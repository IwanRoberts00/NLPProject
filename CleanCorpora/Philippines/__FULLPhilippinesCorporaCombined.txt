Philippines	oh so how are you how 's life uh it 's fine randy nothing much uhm so how about your studies how how are you going with your x s m what 's the title again language evaluation it 's okay it 's okay actually i got put up by watching too much n b a on mondays and on thursdays uh talking about the n b a what 's your favorite team my team nowadays well i go with uh the blazers yeah the portland trailblazers portland trailblazers yeah  because of who   word you know pippen from the bulls who went to houston now he 's in portland trailblazers uh since he 's gonna join with the rookie of the year of nineteen ninety-six who 's that stoudamire uh-huh yeah and it 's an all-star cast rashered wallace uhm sabonis do you think sabonis is good that is one uhm seven footer he 's good i think he 's so slow for a basketball player  ay he does well he 's okay does he make a lot of shots no but he does a lot of you know blocking and he can run faster oh for a center for his size   yeah for a big guy  for a guy like him yeah and he can even dunk word and maneuvering within the paint oh how old how old is he sabonis how old is he i think he 's about he was a rookie with he was already in his thirties and what year was that uh that was way back in nineteen ninety-five ninety-six nineteen ninety-five yeah ninety-five ninety-six so i guess he 's still young as a center   yeah he 's still young  uh and and you know a lot of rookies nowadays just popped out from high school kobe bryant uh like kevin garnett okay they just popped out of high school no more college do you think that portland that portland has a chance of winning the championship uh definitely why this season yeah why what makes you think so there 's no more jordan and the spurs are not that that powerful but the lakers have the best record so what do you say about that uh well there 's phil jackson and but i don't think it 's a it 's phil jackson with a new team so he it 's still like a dry-run for him okay uh uh ay you know i heard the news about rodman coming back to the n b a have you heard of that yeah i 've heard that he 's not gonna have any more fancy hairstyle no more tattoos no more earrings and all that he wants to be a good boy now not a bad boy do you mean to say that she he had his tattoos removed   cough his tattoos removed well he had it erased i heard it from one one of my friends that he 's going to be taking all those bad boy stuffs off why what 's what because he wants to be a good boy now what triggered the change in his heart or change in mind perhaps his being in jail and all that oh who 's this does he have a wife now yeah is that a right choice i think they 're already divorced i don't know uh i don't know i 'm not so sure uh i heard something i heard the news michael jordan was is planning to buy a a portion of the wizards' franchise  have you heard of that  no you see it 's not the wizards' franchise it 's uh charlotte hornets' franchise that 's where he grew up charlotte  no honestly just a few days ago i saw it i saw it in a newspaper he 's planning to buy a slot or a portion of the washington wizards yes early this year that was mentioned charlotte charlotte hornets yeah i don't know if this is another one you know he 's a businessman right now after his retirement but but portland is your favorite team yeah portland then i guess after portland that would be uhm that would be sacramento sacramento kings why why the sacramento uh weber is there chris weber chris weber you know there 's one guy there that i really love jason williams   jason williams oo the point guard position yeah with all those assists those passes incredible positions after earvin johnson yeah something like i i 'm also playing basketball and i 'm trying to figure out how he does those things and he 's so great he 's just so good to become actually last year he was a candidate for rookie of the year uh-huh he was one of the top three fol uh that was with vince carter of toronto raptors uh-huh then one of the other candidates were uhm what 's that guy 's name celtics the celtics guy  uhm   pierce pierce uh paul pierce oh i don't know him paul pierce of the celtics of the boston celtics and vince carter of the toronto raptors along with jason williams of the sacramento kings uh-huh who did they unfortunately for your jason williams why uhw he was next to the it was a very very close fight you know but vince vince carter was the one chosen rookie of the year vince carter of the toronto raptors but i guess vince carter was not selected for the dream team you know that yeah he wasn't selected i think he was too young he was too young no no not really young but he didn't have too much you know p b a e speaker a laughs  n b a n b a exposure n b a exposure oh yeah who was the one who was picked instead of vince yeah it was ray allen of the milwaukee bucks i don't know him ray allen well he was a rookie way back in nineteen ninety-six along with kobe bryant words actually he was the fourth fifth pick you know you know a lot of a lot about the n b a   yeah i collect cards laughs  you collect cards yeah oh what are the most expensive cards that you 've got well uh cards that i got well i had a michael jordan which words you know it 'll be like about two hundred dollars wow two hundred dollars you have you have one like that yeah i still have it i don't know how to dispose of it   can you give it  no just just give it to me why am i gonna give it to you because you 're going to dispose it no i 'm not gonna dispose of it   oh come on just okay just give me one 1 word card uh i 'll give you a rookie card of vitaly pota penko ows i don't know him you don't know vitaly pota penko yeah he 's the he 's the romanian trainee for the i don't know he he 's a do you have a card to have a card of jason williams do you have well when this rookie season came in that 's when i started to uh lose interest in card-collecting so  his card   how many cards do you have i can't count them can you give can you give me five cards  a lot  you know like vitaly pota penko no not the discards   there 's sabonis and there is not the weak and not the weak ones alright uhm well there 's jason kidd the mailman malone uh-huh stockton uh-huh uh haleem olajuwon uh-huh who else uh well david robinson how about uhm tim duncan can you give me a card tim duncan i think i couldn't find one oh you 're not yet sure yeah i guess it was word  well uh you know in in card collecting you you know it 's gone down with the popularity it 's gone down i don't think because of magic or because i think it 's because of you know the resignation of jordan that 's the reason why i think that 's primarily the reason probably probably it 's because of pokemon   uh urhhh  uh  what do you think of pokemon pokemon yeah i think it was the best you know animation for this year because it does not you know show it 's it 's unli you know it 's well all of them live no one dies in pokemon in pokemon no one dies i mean no no one you know cuts off his arm no bloodshed uh yeah yeah it 's it 's like uh a very very mild portrayal of violence yeah some something good about pokemon is that it doesn't portray portray too much of violence and gore if you ask me it 's for for girls you know oh no it 's not for girls yeah i 'm fond i 'm fond of watching pokemon i even collect pokemons  pika oh sorry no offense laughter  it 's alright that 's it that will be fine pikachu even got two you know those red thingamajigs you know on his cheeks you know what are those speaker a laughs what are those uhm that that is his weapon actually  really   yeah uhm it shoots electricity and who is this raichu laughter  who is this raichu raichu yeah oh he he raichu is the uhm he looks like pikachu but   yeah he looks like pikachu he is the evolved yeah raichu is the evolved version of the of pikachu but being evolved there are two distinct uh pokemons right yeah like i saw pikachu and raichu fighting yeah but then like because there are many pikachus actually uh  ha  yeah there are many pikachus if you have if you saw the cartoon last night uhm there were many pikachus okay so one tends to evolve to a raichu or one can just choose to remain as a pikachu that 's it how about uh primetime man i speak of voltes five and daimos voltes five now who 's the better robot voltes five or daimos wait uh i can't you know tell something like i like i like daimos because of his what 's that blizzard uh or his death blow and his blizzard yeah he had this snow blizzard snow blizzard yeah at the end he had all these sorts of you know weapons snow blizzard and then the what 's this uh fire blizzard uh-huh yeah  what do you think okay something like what if daimos and voltes five are going to fight uh they can't fight because they 're both good robots no something like uhm they used the ones you usually read in marvel comics you see the incredible hulk fighting the spiderman  that 's no problem because that 's marvel so about though i think what you were trying to say is d c against marvel they 're two separate companies uh-huh with two different heroes fighting each other uh-huh yeah so with daimos and voltes five who do you think is going to win  oh boy well voltes five is a five-man team laughter five-man ro robot and daimos is only one but i think it 's evenly matched evenly matched with the weapons who do you think has has more weapons yeah i think it 's daimos daimos has a lot more weapons than voltes five yeah the problem with voltes five is you know there is five heads working altogether uh-huh daimos has only one head why so i guess he 's more focused what made it a problem for voltes five having these five going around uh one head chews the other laughter  now let 's go back to basketball uh about the p b a p b a what 's your favorite team  a long time ago it used to be san miguel beer that 's the time when i really liked watching p b a uh-huh with brown uhm who was that samboy lim with teng with caidic uh-huh yeah they were the dream team for the philippines how about the present san miguel team how do you assess them i think they won the the last conference yeah  or no   actually the last two conferences they won it yeah yeah two yeah uhm uh by the way do you know who the players are already in san miguel line-up yeah line-up well uhm i guess uh hey somebody is writing something on the board yeah i don't know what he 's writing anyway oh the guy already left anyway laughter  oh let 's uhm how about chicago bulls what do you think do you feel sorry about the chicago bulls for word   yeah i mean it started out with a dream you know when when chicago their dream was to get three-peat the three-peat uh-huh yeah so once that dream was you know was came came to when they achieved that dream and then the uh i think the manager decided on having a new team uh no uh a team with new players to have a new target or goal  i guess  i guess the team had already reached the point when uh something like we 're already at the top of the world   yeah there is nothing more to to gain words   after  something like we are we are the best in the world there 's no other way but to go down we 've already reached the top probably they came to that point already and now they 're languishing at the bottom yeah well they 're already going down they 're already at the bottom really laughter  in terms of statisti statistical you know outcome in the they 're really at the bottom chicago bulls   chicago bulls  and they just have two wins four wins out of how many games i guess i guess they already have five wins just imagine five wins out of thirty forty forty games something like that  you know i think some of the core some of the line-up of last year was were still retained like kukoch uh-huh like brown ray brown randy b  i guess it 's randy brown

of readings in philippine sociolinguistics because i teach that subject here uhm uhm   to undergrads uhm and i 'm in the process of it 's really just uh mimeographed very limited circulation  uhm  uhm print run of i think two hundred or three hundred  of your essays which would you consider which are your favorites that should go into a readings in philippine sociolinguistics  do you include language planning yes yes that 's a section  because what i have now uhm i had to think of the needs of the students also 'no  oh yeah yeah so since they don't know too much about the philippine language situation i had to include uh the introduction to the atlas of curt mcfarland as an introduction to linguistics  uh-huh   uh  and then i included your article on linguistic minorities uh yeah yeah yes that one because i wanted them to know about linguistic minorities and the eight major languages etcetera etcetera  i see that one i included  linguistic minorities   and then for  is this the one in uh the fiftieth anniversary of uh it 's ano e   of uh   you gave me an offprint e   ha   i don't  it was an offprint my my copy that it was an offprint from i think a foreign magazine no or a journal maybe uh it it is where you mentioned s i l a lot  it is  oh yeah yeah this is in the fiftieth in the golden anniversary of s i l uh maybe yes uhm yes uh   and then the other one i included by you yes for the section on bilingual education yes and language language planning bilingual education was bilingual education in the philippines structure eh strategy and structure  i think that was in georgetown   uh georgetown university  yes yeah maybe it 's the most comprehensive yes yeah those those are the ones i included but i 'd say my favorite is the one reprinted by fishman in uh uh advances in language planning formerly published in uhm current trends in linguistics   uhm  i see i think   have you not read that i think i 've read that sir   uhm   my   that is the one on everything   on language pla  yeah the language planning in the philippines  everything goes on   yes   yeah yeah an over and up to nineteen uh seven seventy something like that   yes yes yes i i read that   yeah  as your student i read that  yeah  yes but my favorite one of the best in my opinion in fact i have it here those i 'd like to give a copy i didn't think of you i thought you were not interested huh i 'd like to give brother andrew a copy to me this is my favorite one of my favorites uh i think that uhm i thought this is i was especially uhm when i wrote this i was especially brilliant laughter insights from language planning based on the philippine experience  uhm this is in the the original manuscript brother andrew says i wish that i would be as productive as you when i reach my senior years  wow i see i read that in hong kong uhm uhm so this this is the latest no the tha that 's not the latest that was nineteen eighty-nine i see  that 's the one read in nineteen eighty-nine but it is it has a nineteen ninety publication date  ay sir  uhm so you 're giving brother andrew a copy yeah i will have it xeroxed yes have it xeroxed have one copy xeroxed for me okay i 'll have it xeroxed by emy  please uh okay  yes that 's one that 's my favorite one of my favorites uh how nice yes i i eighty-nine you wrote it in eighty-nine in eighty-nine  wow   it is as of eighty-nine it is very good uh we have uh insights from the use of spanish and so on yes uh eh philippine english philippine english it 's on english as equalizer and stratifier uh and so on in what language do people learn language rights  i have written insights from planned language change and language shift and so on uh this is one of my better works but uh the my favorite essay i haven't given you a copy ano so i must give copies to my friends sometimes i do not uh uhm  words  my the favorite essay that of uh is the one i wrote in honor of uh fishman 's sixty-fifth birthday uh uhm i haven't seen that uhm becoming bilingual it 's a it 's a retrospective essay on how i learned english in a non-english environment where there were only three speakers of uh english  uh uhm  english yeah really uh uhm wow interesting case study   with me the teacher in fact andrew says that in his remarks because i made him read the manuscript he said this is a this is a first-rate essay this and your uhm article on repetition will outlive you   that 's what he says   uh uhm how nice it 's very good maybe it 's my favorite uh uhm because it is it is an intimate uh documentary retrospective documentary of how i learned english  uhm  uh uhm  so your your best articles are coming during this period of your life   uh uhm  fantastic sir ha  and uh well maybe it 's because i have the leisure of time now uh-huh uhm i accept invitations that i like those that i don't like i just say i have invita i have already previous engagement   sino 'yan someone comes in  what happened to brother andrew  oo nga e laughter   ano'ng nangyari kay brother andrew  wala pang balita e saan kaya siya  i have to go to the next room for my meeting don't worry  hay 'naku sir laughter  you don't know people in la salle no what is this   they are very punctual what is this uh kwan uhm  council of deans   no when when will we when we will meet you said that twenty seven to thirty-one is bad sir because that 's c l a week uh uhm is it very late already the third to the seventh anytime except tuesdays uh in the afternoons  oo yes except tuesdays which is a good which is also the bad day for you yeah no i don't think so i told fe that i 'm meeting you and brother andrew  and uh after talking it over with her i said nobody will advise this in the philippine normal college and she said well i accepted because uhm she is a good student and you know fe seldom accepts to advise because uh uhm unless this student is very good  but i thought you were resigning   oh no i will be like you even if i 'm i 'm not there anymore i 'd like to advise  how nice that 's what she said uh uhm and then when i told her that you are uhm you are uh up-to-date on the literature she said we 'd better give it to tish  uhm so what we will do is to give it to both of you you 'll be co co co-advisers uh uhm what i 'm interested in is the data yes yes i 'm you know this girl teresita fortunato yes the one teaching here yes she 's very good uhm so i recommended her after uh she was in my class  oo yes yes yes   she was in my class twice  i recommended her to brother andrew uh uhm  so why don't you send her first send me some of her her uh term papers  so i sent term papers to to him then he said okay i 'd like to interview her  so she interviewed he interviewed her and uh got him hired got her hired yes yes yes she 's valuable she 's very good very good you know i don't know why the why people are so selfish they don't want to discover people and help those you know who have promise and so on like that  that was the defect of william  really he had a certain selfishness uhm instead of helping people because brother andrew and you are the primary examples of people who help people who seek out excellence who are not threatened by excellence  yeah   because   uhm  no but william is william somehow how did that happen why i don't know yet he 's very bright uh uhm very bright  william is very bright yes yes yes in fact i was the one who discovered william  how i discovered him is by accident we both went to the philippine without my knowing we joined the philippine normal college at the same time nineteen sixty-two is that right july nineteen sixty-two  o  before i went there i had a conversation with ramirez the president  o  and uh orata the dean because when they requested my services i was no i in fact the u p and kwan the request for my services after i came from abroad uh both came from the u p and from the p n c uh uhm  the requ request from uhm the late fred morales  oo naku  and then p n c from kwan so i went to p n c and uh because nobody said that the reason that they were not uh their people were uh not getting their degrees is that nobody were advised and so i had the brilliant idea which i thought was brilliant of seeing to it that i would be assigned uhm and that all these people who were uh wanted to get their m a after assigning their topics we assigned we assigned somebody as the chairman and then some more some juniors some some relatively junior members of the faculty so there we assigned five five advisers to every student three to five wow members of the faculty all members of the faculty  my goodness  uh-huh all members uh uhm son of a gun i found out that many could teach but didn't know how to advise

really that 's why you know yesterday i 'll tell you a story another tension came into my life  alma my friend from alabang hills i gave her bags also yeah when earlier part of this year lang  so now she has like a balance of five thousand since uh january february  laughs  yeah because i gave her lots of bags to help me you know dispose of yeah so she took it i mean took the responsibility to sell it okay  ano na ngayon november na  every month she tells me she promises me on ganito  i will on november like this on wednesday i 'm gonna pay on like this i 'm gonna pay you and then she was supposed to have paid me yesterday uh-huh so she texted me on that day to tell me i 'm sorry that i cannot deliver today can be my friend ganoon pa siya december five  na lang  december five promise real na  i got for december five daw  me i was calling her na kasi i didn't wanna go texting galore she didn't wanna answer my call kept on ringing her cell phone so so beware i guess anyway there 're a lot of those people around i know i know so i didn't naman force my bags on her e she was the one who who uh what do you call this uh volunteered she was the one who who uh what do you call this uh volunteered sige  i 'll i 'll help you sell yeah  kasi in the process she 's gonna earn  rin naman di ba  yeah so anyway so tagal na yan every month i needed it i mean my point is actually it 's not the money  e it 's five thousand so i told her can you just give me a post-dated check because i also need it  kasi you know what her reason was  i had so many payables i had so many bills to pay so  na- short ako so i have to pay you next month   grabe yan ha   di ba so eto eto nga with me naman when i was i texted her back kept texting her  na i 'm sorry about your problems but i have problems too yeah  i have payables too so i hope you make it a priority   yeah   yeah  can i have a post-dated check tonight i was that blunt what 'd she answer and then then she asked me she was answering me  talagang i 'm so gipit i 'm so gipit gipit gipit or something so me naman i didn't wanna stop there i told her why don't you ask your boy friend to lend you the five thousand and then all of a sudden she tells me don't involve my boy friend because it doesn't involve him  aba siya pa ang mataray   so you know what i said then don't involve me because i don't kasi sabi niya in fact i got lugi  in your bags because my friend didn't pay me and then i said i 'm sorry but i don't know your friend so please don't involve me with your problem with your friend and then she said and then you know she changed the topic what 's five thousand compared to your caprices that 's what she told me and then i you know what i told her everything that i spend for my caprices have been was was uh came from hard work yeah words  i mean if if i only had that cash i wouldn't go spending  grabe itong ano uh san mig nakakatakot  noticing a vehicle swerving into their lane  yeah yeah san miguel  huwag ka na lang lumapit diyan talking to the driver   huwag ka na lang lumapit sa malaking ganyan  i mean if only 'no if only  grabe siya ha   di ba the reasoning was really bad because  words  yeah the reasoning was really bad kasi  imagine he 'd she 'd tell me like that na nalugi na nga ako para bang pasalamat ka tinulungan kita  so she will make pasa to me the problems of the tuition of her kids and all that  kasi she she she uh expected me that i 've so much dough but still if i had so even di ba  yeah even it 's the principle behind it it 's the principle behind it e   sabi ko so how about those i need to pay off where will i get it yeah please help me solve my problem gumanoon ako e  because pinasa ko sa kanya the bola e yeah and then uh kasi i didn't like the tone  e yung yung your caprices kasi  it has nothing to do with it yeah that was not the point yeah the point if you 've been yeah and had i gotten the payment a long time ago i would have made it ikot and made it even probably mo double or triple right exactly right yeah so bottom line was i told her five on december five then five thousand five hundred interest na e i put na interest oh yeah tama tama  ten percent yeah is that okay with you give me a post-dated check tonight i don't have checks that 's what she told me but i promise that december five and then i didn't anymore answer her actually it doesn't  that 's right yeah how 'd you meet her how 'd you meet her naman  family friend yan e  she used to board in our house her sister don't do wholesale i got loko na rin words  no it 's not that e  she 's not the type she 's very naive in fact how many times has that happened once first time a thousand the other one was nineteen i mean but that 's that 's part of the game e  pinks the risk that was the risk i took when i gave her the bags it was the risk i took when i gave techie the bags we have to take risks e  on her end on her end when she gave her friend that that was her risk not mine so don't make me pasa na she has not paid me yet so i can't pay you yeah you have to take responsibility for that e  i gave her how many months already  ano ba naman yung every month she 'll save up a hundred instead of texting all her she she spends around four thousand pesos for cell phone usage and i don't like her reasoning na she doesn't wanna pay me because it 's not her priority because i have money because she doesn't know what i 'm going through you get me it 's like techie it 's not the money yeah that 's why you know what i don't even care if i get that five thousand five hundred e  actually because the ball is on her ano na hand  e  now i can say something about her now she cannot say anything about me na  she can always deny it but my conscience is clear i 've given her so much leeway already i mean i 'm so ano 1 1
Philippines	so we 'd like to have a brief account of your family educational background what do you what exactly about the past things uh okay hold on you are we are we are ten brothers and sisters four boys six girls i 'm number three from one where one is the eldest ten is the youngest i 'm number three   uh uhm  i finished my high school in assumption actually pre-school well i started out in holy spirit and then we moved to saint theresa 's i finished my high school in assumption   assumption  and i went to u p for college took up business administration uh-huh and then i took my masters m b a in louvaine a catholic university in belgium uh in belgium yeah and i finished it in eighty-one and now you 're working with union bank   i work with  no uh well actually it 's an affiliate of union bank it 's called u b c capital corporation it 's an investment house and you 've been with them for how many years well i started out working at the union bank since nineteen eighty-eight up to your word   up to now  the the we left the investment house for we were the investment bank division in the bank and we formed the investment house we left the investment bank to join the investment house so practically speaking we built that on the purpose of word  okay so i 'll be starting on your life before you became a public figure are you saying when i was much younger yeah if you could say if you can recall laughter anything that you can remember  so those things   how how that was or how you spent your days what you did all i remember when we were kids when we were 'cause we started out actually in in nineteen sixty-three was his political caree career started out when he was appointed i think it was in nineteen sixty-two when he was appointed as secretary of justice by whom by president macapagal but before that he was just a lawyer 'no an ordinary lawyer and what i remember of about him was just that he was at work and he would always be home at night and weekends is what i remember is that we 'll always be together every sunday we would have to go to mass and then after mass we would go sometimes we would eat lunch or out sometimes we 'd be at home and after lunch or on he would take pictures that was his hobby  taking pictures   uh we we used to live there in the boulevard so we would walk across along the bay and then we would take a pose for him laughter  he 'd take pictures that that was the normal routine that much i remember but i no i guess you 'll have to ask me more more questions na lang or when we get to the generally it was the fact that he was around when we wanted him he was more like uh he was i would say he was really a family man 'cause he was always with us uh-huh but i don't know uhm how politically involved he was then i was much too young because actually he was appointed secretary of justice i was only about ten years old  uhm  so i wouldn't really know   you wouldn't be able to remember  no i wouldn't remember much except 'no the usual kid stuff yeah but i do remember the sundays that we would spend uh taking pictures walking in the boulevard and there used to be bancas along the boulevard  and now not anymore   back then laughter  back then and sometimes we would ask the fisherman who owned the boat if we could use the banca to take pictures of us inside the banca or whatever we would not be on the water just along the along the bay because it was quite okay to walk through there walking around there like that that much i remember about those sundays  uh  so he was really more a homebody stay at home yeah we didn't have   and his office was here ano here no no at that time when we were growing uh his office only moved to the house after martial law uh because before martial law his office was in m h del pilar the building of lola long  there was a building there that i think daddy used  uh i see  i don't know what how how it came about that daddy had his office there that office has about three or four floors with the lawyers and when martial law came and dad was picked up uhm well of course the office had to be closed because daddy really didn't know how long he was gonna be inside   yes  so then we moved all the books all his books uh to the house then the office was moved to the house 3 words of the building na rin   uh uhm  uh uhm from that time on that was the time when the office   you used to  before that his office i remember going to regina building that much i remember near the church his office is along escolta regina building that much i remember and we would go there and pick him up that time from the office   oh really yeah  we 'd go there pick him up then he 'd take us out sometimes we 'd go to the movies at night along escolta you know that 's really weird that much i remember about him uh-huh but what particular hobbies did he have you know things photography for one you mentioned photography for one definitely because sometimes he would he would call us to help him in the dark room he had a dark room in the house   uh how nice and he would make us go in just to mix the chemicals for him or help him he never really made us do all the hard stuff just to be just to be there he 'd ask you okay you mix this for me you watch this you know things like that but that 's what he would do photography is really the thing that i remember he loved to fiddle with his cameras he was so excited every time he 'd go find a new lens or a new what he 's excited also when he 's printing his own pictures you know the ones that he would take that i remember  uhm  what about reading writing  reading  do you have any literary things he did or was it mostly essays  that  well no they don't 1 word it also when he was inside uh i heard he wrote he wrote you poems 'no   yeah  i remember because i told you he would write us letters 'cause when he was under detention that was the time when we well we we had to 1 word  first we were allowed to visit him every day then the military said no it had to be mga once a week lang or twice a week in othe they would use it as psych psycho war you know like just to break you or to make you feel as a like it was some kind of mental torture because suddenly you go there for a visit and then they would say no visits allowed today you 're there already all set to fix his meal uh uhm and then you 'd bring food because that was what we would always do bring food and whatever and then they would say no and and no reason they wouldn't give you any reason why you couldn't visit come back tomorrow or come back and when you come back the next day and there would still be no visits things like that so what dad would do was he would write us letters uhm especially on dates like your birthday christmas uh or if if there was some kind of problems we were having that time that mom would tell him about then he 'd write a letter  uh uhm  i remember graduation from college he wrote me a letter but this this would be censored because the military would pass would pass through them  really  the only time i remember that that they really cut up i think we still have it somewhere the military cut up some words you know lit literally censoring it 'no the letter was during that time i think it was before or after he was in solitary now how long how long was that well that was the time they went to they moved them to nueva ecija for one month   so they did change they did change location   they moved them for about one month and then we couldn't visit for about that during that time and they wouldn't tell us where daddy was did they did they change him in any way did they do you you recall any specific change in his personality after his detention or even during his detention when you would go visit him   how was he   uhm  was he the same same i think uh if anything i think it made him a more human person uh uhm because uhm i think that was when his his thoughts on human rights began to crystallize uh uhm  word when that 's when he that 's why when he got out when he was he when he was released that was the time that he started uh all of his human rights work and going around the country and talking and defending these people that was when it really started but he was always the type who was looking for the family for support and since we knew that he had done nothing illegal to deserve being put in jail except he was just a very vocal critic of marcos at that time then we were not afraid well of no i don't think we were afraid and we were supportive of him and there were people who would come to us and say oh just tell him to do what marcos wants and you know everything but why he has not done anything wrong so dad has always been a very principled person so this is he was the one who taught us all he word  if there 's anything wrong since you haven't done anything wrong and you believe that what you 're doing is correct why should you you know just do what you want just to do just to do what somebody else wants so that was what he lived by actually the last i think the last uh let 's say the last uh twenty years i think because he died in eighty-seven 'no and he was imprisoned in seventy-two so he was released in seventy-four so mga the last thirteen to fifteen years of his life was really devoted to human rights ever since prison because in fact what happened was in prison he could do everything what he couldn't do before that because he was a senator you know he had to do a lot of things like the senate work  uh uhm  yeah and then he had his law office and then you know speaking engagements and all that stuff so then then he could read he read a lot then he could write he could think it was like you know when you 're a very busy person and suddenly you 're given a time to do what you always say oh yeah if i had the time i could do it so i think that 's the time that he had okay words  i think although of course what was often a strain on him was being away physically uh uhm  3 words  we never needed him so much it 's only i guess when we we on our part maybe we also we also suffered from the separation although we didn't we don't really think about it actually after martial law not af after martial law after dad was released when people would ask me about it i would always say like it 's just a part of my life really
Philippines	what what 's the breakdown uh we usually share depends on how many are we we divide it okay even cleaning of the room we even have to pay because normally i was in an office even it it 's government even if it was government we would have a utility worker or somebody among the staff members to clean the room but here even if i think there 's a person really supposed to be a utility worker position i entered that office already with a with the system wherein somebody will clean the room and each of us will pay a certain amount per month uh uh so it 's like you 're paying this guy he 's he 's your employee well our employee in terms of cleaning but we just give a minimal amount and she cleans the room after we leave the office is this an everyday thing so you pay her monthly yeah we do pay her monthly it 's up uh we have this certain amount and uh the thing with my room there 's there are windows but it 's not like you can open and it 's small just like when there 's brown-out it 's so hard uh for us to see because we 'll just depend on that glass window or the sunlight to come in if there 's a sun shining so what happens if like there 's a black-out a brown-out uh they have to open the door downstairs and the room must be very dark it is except for the one the mezzanine wherein the light through the outside would penetrate just a small portion and what else do you have to pay for aside from the janitress well if we don't have enough supplies for materials   words   you mean for the supplies also sometimes sometimes like ballpens you know you end up buying 'cause if they don't have enough supply how many are we there in the office or they run out of supply rather than wait we have to be on our own so the money we bring home aside from the taxes would be spent for those other expenses but you know it 's not like it 's all the time minimal sometimes but you 're not reimbursed for it no maybe because we 'd i don't think they really made an attempt bec if you look at it will you want to reimburse ballpens or  words   o but all these things add up that 's true but when i got there that was already the system that 's how they deal with it they pay a certain amount for this or that so i just follow whatever oo  so doesn't does this this situation doesn't it make you consider uh working in an off a private firm where  you don't have to pay for all these things  uh   yeah  yeah uh actually right now i 'm not really thinking of that maybe because i have so much to learn wherein in this office i 'm learning uh so maybe it 's not like i 'm planning on going or or leaving that office uh you just have to make some sacrifices and at the same time right now i 'm just having a positive attitude to enjoy working there because at least what makes it more bearable is i have good officemates why did you transfer anyway from the your old office which is also a government office right that 's true uh because at that time i wasn't a lawyer yet and uh my work involved more uh administrative not so much with the legal work but because uh it was time already to go and practice and uh it was a suggestion from my mom and okay we 'll try it and i did of course in the beginning it was not that easy because so many things you have to learn you mean you couldn't you couldn't work as a lawyer in that old office words   nah as a lawyer no because it was limit  it was more administrative position so now since if i wanted to practice uh i had to find another job  and this pays be   this was the one  this pays better than the old one not really because it 's the same salary grade a as a matter of fact i think i 'm getting lesser compensation but it 's more of what is important to learn or to earn and i guess i wanted to both laughs  both ideally but you know you can't have everything so maybe the first thing is to learn something first you know and have the right to do so yon  so ano more or less it 's manageable so you 're happy you 're happy i 'm happy because i mean i 'm meeting other people although that 's the time it could be a test because you don't know the personalities and they just show you you know you 're being treated in different ways or you treat them also depending on their level or what they would uhm you know how they carry themselves or how you carry themselves to help them what sort of people ba do you have to deal with uh well all kinds but of course you can't say the top echelon because since we 're government it 's more of free legal service for them so it 's not those who really are moneyed more or less i guess from the middle class or lower class but most of them their fights involve neighborhood misunderstandings e  criminal cases  they criminal criminal only so uhm neighborhood fights but did you have really serious ones like rape uh not handling that yet 'cause since i 'm relatively new i have only this particular court wherein these are the cases handled for this court so rape no not yet but we have this uh thing wherein for investigation we if we 're assigned with let 's say that kind of case we can rev we can look at it if there is a basis for filing the complaint or not but you know as i said my posi i 'm i 'm still learning and my position is not high enough in comparison to the other people there so we also have uh particular cases assigned wherein slowly they 're adding or making it a little more uh serious or complicated cases but not like the other uh people who have more serious charges  y you find this fulfilling ba  well in terms of public service yes because you feel like you 're giving so much of your time and effort and you don't expect anything from them sometimes you 're not even appreciated but you have to get used to the job that it 's really like that that 's how life is it 's more of how were you when you wanted to help them or do what is expected from you  uh huh  what what 's the most serious case that you 've ever handled outside of the neighborhood squabbles to date but you know most of them are some like b p twenty-two it 's like collection of money wherein they didn't their check bounced and they didn't pay so sometimes you know they just need more time for them to settle the problem or their financial situation some of them involve uh you know like one said this slanderous remarks or there 's a threat by this or that person or acts of lasciviousness  uh huh  yes do you uh yeah there 's also but not that many  wha have you no what case have you handled which is do you have anything handled anything that 's been like a funny one oh yeah yeah   humorous case there 's one when it started i think with the feces of a dog uh huh and then what happened  what   and then they started saying something and that 's when the complication began and so that 's when the fight  and the the complaints you know words   so  who sued whom  uh whoever was the one who said something bad first or someone who uh would fight or have some physical injuries but sometimes it ends they end up also charging the other so it 's like a charge and counter charge   but like about this one about the dog  uh what about the the owner charge was charged  no the one when they were mentioning about the dog uh and somebody and the neighbor who owns the dog said something bad so the one who recei who was the recipient would be the one to complain so this is what a slander case  and uh sometimes threats  uh huh   including slan uh oral defamation and then i was some that 's why i would kinda i would find it funny because imagine it started just with the feces of a dog and then funny is i had another court i had to appear in another court as a trouble-shooter 'cause the regular lawyer wasn't around and it was also about the feces of a dog so i s i i felt what 's this is this a common thing for this kind of people always about dogs uh hum so i said ano ba   so how was this case uh finally settled  well i dunno  the other one did you win it no the other one i i was just there for the i think for the cross-examination which i did not even know about because i was just trouble-shooting but i was forced by the judge to continue i dunno what happened but the one i 'm handling i entered into the picture i think it started already but since i 'm now assigned with that court i have to continue with uh i still have to present another witness which is the husband break in recording   teka muna what do you think of kris aquino and her new problem speaker b laughs with this new married man in her life  ay naku she has her own way of thinking  ay we i can't say you know it 's hard to judge especially when it comes to the heart but what was your reaction me i had an initial reaction which was this kris talaga  she always gets in trouble with the same kind of trouble falls in love with a man she really couldn't have  e but wh wh what can you do about it i mean you know they 're just what if she really fell in love yeah but i think i think there are a lot of other eligible men but uh i think i think she really is specifically drawn to these men who are married and and are hard just just hard to it 's a relationship that 's really full of problems to begin with   troublesome relationship  uh huh   uh huh  uh huh i think because remember with uh philip i th they had the same problem  yeah right yes   with philip salvador and even if this thing gets settled if they do get annulled the situation is just so complicated because joey has children of his own and children with other women pa  aside from alma well that 's true but at this point for me maybe because of how we see other people what would make them happy sad or what they want i guess when it comes to the heart it 's hard to judge that 's the safest answer yes but it 's hard to judge i mean you can't say when someone falls in love di ba  uh huh  that 's true yeah well that 's true that 's true laughs   laughs okay no but at least in my case in my case uh the reason why i 'm sticking with it and i 'm actually fighting for it is because he 's my husband and i know that everything is right and it would work out eventually in the end yes it will   but in kris 's case i think she 's i don't know uh she 's very intelligent it 's such a waste di ba  it 's just such a waste when people expect much from her uh huh especially with her family background or her position now in showbiz and she 's very influential and then in comparison to maybe the guy who is a womanizer probably or what but still i have that same opinion when you cannot say and judge when it comes to the heart  especially with love  there 's this   there 's this   you can't say we don't know also joey that well maybe who knows there must be something in him that kris might have seen which we didn't know or have seen that made her feel like loving him i dunno i don't know him but but i you know i tend to think that it 's more of like a rebound thing for for joey for joey for joey because he has just had a he was just uh had this marital problem with alma and uh he was just working on his that 's uh that 's the very reason why they they got to meet in the first place because for the interview i think yeah for the interview  oo  so if you think about it i don't think it has already been a year and suddenly he finds himself agai falling in love again uh huh and he hasn't even resolved his problem with alma moreno that 's right that 's right so i think there 's also this element of uh being on the rebound on joey 's side on joey not on kris 's side no because she hasn't been in a relationship i think for how many years yeah well it 's very strange because the the profile of these two gentlemen more or less the same speaker b laughs still married and working on the annulment uh huh that 's true that 's true but uh and it 's such a shame because she 's the daughter of ninoy aquino maybe that 's it e  they expected so much more from her and to think with her position i 'm sure there 'll be other eligible wonderful men who would want to be there for her but we dunno she 's the one who 's gonna decide on her on who she wants to love so we 'll see we don't know it 's just too bad that 's she 's in the limelight yeah that 's why it 's more pronounced and talked about uh huh okay yeah 'cause i was just trying to imagine like what she said she told joey okay just between the two of us we have we have a dozen kids already  ha   becau she has she has her joshua oh okay that 's one   and then joey has his own kids with alma and the other kids that he has with these other women okay so between the two of them probably joey has eleven altogether plus kris 's joshua so they will have twelve kids and so and if they have kids of their own pa  then that would be really really complicated well there are other men before joey who also had that kind of situation with many children hmmm but uh well it 's up to them   really  oo  what would make people happy anyway yeah you know there 's this uh there 's this uh quotation that sometimes i used to think a about it a lot which is uh which is it goes something like the heart has its reasons that the mind cannot understand  and i used to think about that a lot especially when i think about my own relationship and i think that explains that that explains uh kris 's situation right now can you elaborate like you know you get into you you get into uh all if you 're very much in love with this person you 'll defy everything and uh even if it 's just a even if it 's a you-and-me-against-the-world situation uh huh you still go on with it and try to fight for it because is it possible because the heart says so because you love the person so much  oo nga and you don't think rationally anymore so could it be it doesn't mean it 's right something like that no no no it 's actually it 's it 's uh trying what it 's trying to say i think is that uh a person in love can do the craziest things foolish things in fact so for the person uh huh for that person for the love for the love uh huh so it 's the heart working but if the person doesn't stop to think about the consequences and the bad uh the bad things that she that uh might happen because you 're entering into this complicated relationship i used to think about that a lot but that was before  uh huh  and now what do you think about that quotation i don't think too much about it anymore because uh i don't know i 've found some uh i think i think what i am fighting for now is not just because i 'm crazy about this person but because i 'm married and everything is legal anyway  uh huh   you know so unlike in cases like this in cases like this everything 's just wrong wrong wrong in my case morally there 's no problem  uh huh  you 're supposed to be together to start with uh huh  yeah so i don't think about that but when i was younger and i was involved in questionable relationships speaker b laughs  then i used to hang on to that quotation uh huh because you loved that person even if the legal  conse  yeah or whatever consequence yeah yeah yeah well but you know it 's sometimes we just have to let go and feel our emotions to know what life is also didn't they say was that in the moulin rouge  that uh the best or is it the best achievement or what is in life is to love and be loved in return although i know we shouldn't be hurting other people but uh i still cannot say much about that because it 's so hard when you 're really in love you 'll never even whatever consequence or true you-and-me-against-the-world you 'll love that person truly with all your heart uh huh 1 1 1
Philippines	and then were you here yeah i was in school na  i was in class and then uhm our teacher was lecturing and all of a sudden she started kinda swaying she felt dizzy   word before or she thought that she felt dizzy and then she asked us did did you feel that more or like we we kinda realized it after she asked us e  and it was like it lasted for about a minute a minute  a minute  it was really long but it it it wasn't really that strong e  it was kinda you know when you 're kinda drunk and and you can't get your footing right  yeah  uh uhm uh uhm so you kinda sway that 's how it felt but we were sitting down then and also it felt like somebody was shaking your chair your desk what time was this because i didn't go to school so i didn't feel it i didn't feel it in para&ntilde;aque uhm i think it was around nine thirty to ten something like early in the morning early yeah and then what happened did anybody panic or whatever   no nothing she was she our teacher just said na uhm it 's about time 'cause it hit like i don't know japan or korea twice already so it was a matter of time   i think it was japan japan right so she was like why be surprised it 's a you know it 's  it 's a natural phenomenon  it 's inevitable because it 's hitting everything around us why won't it hit us  so there but it was nothing like the one in uhm uh when was that gatecrasher yeah during the gatecrasher a few months last summer last summer ba 'yon  what month was that i forgot i totally forgot no   not last summer early this year yeah i think it was january jan or feb or march   late late january late jan uh uhm yeah yeah late jan something like that no that was really strong i know it was so strong because i was in bed it was like two in the morning yeah it was at two and then i woke up because i thought i thought i was dreaming i thought i was dreaming and then i was getting dizzy and then when i woke up my fan was shaking my whole bed was shaking as in the whole fan was swaying left to right and then you think it was gonna fall like that it wasn't it didn't look like it was gonna fall but it was really shaking and my my fan had wheels so so   oh my god it was really shaking and my bed was made of narra  can you imagine it 's shaking like hell and i woke up and i was so scared you didn't hear like things fall down like you know no but i heard my the the light the chandelier downstairs yeah it was really loud it was swaying uh uhm and then there  yeah  there kasi in ano we were in uhm makati makati in that in that club fun thing glorietta glorietta uh uhm where that party was 'cause of that gatecrasher came here right so there was a big party a d j party so ang daming tao and then all i thought we were staying by like a few steps by the d j 's booth and what separated the d j 's booth from the dance floor was like a ledge right and it was like maybe a foot wide and i saw kasi people uhm would put their glasses and their bottles on top of the ledge so what i did was i was going down the steps it was like mga around two three feet away and right when i reached my hand up 'cause i wanna push back the bottles and the glasses 'cause people kept on bumping into the ledge i was gonna push them back and all of a sudden before you know nobody hit the ledge but the bottles kinda tipped over right into it fell into my hand so and that 's when i felt swaying like really lakas really strong i swayed back and forth even the d j was like what the hell is going on everybody was swaying  some of my friends thought it was the effects of the place of the club yeah be because everybody was high everybody was on whatever  and there were like laser shows and all of that  uh uhm  and people it was it was it was as strong as it was like the tide that you could get knocked off your feet if you were like uh unsteady or something it 's really strong i had to i had to hold on to my friend we were hugging each other 'cause it it was like ang lakas grabe  so there and the thing is you know after that right after it happened uhm my boy friend and i was let 's go let 's get out of here because aftershocks daw are strong   uh uhm   are worse  are worse so you we had to get out of the building we couldn't take the elevator because we know it 's stupid so we went to the parking lot and uh took the stairs and took the stairs and a lot of people were going out but the thing is like maybe half of the people were still stayed in there they were still partying and the d j just kept on going he 's like what am i gonna to continue or and everybody was cheering and okay we 'll continue they started playing and then everybody was there shouting you know it was kinda stupid stupid because you know di ba  people don't realize that things like that happen for a reason it 's not just yeah exactly and they didn't kinda piece it together that you know earthquakes have been happening in first in turkey and i don't know where else but it was sunod-sunod right it was right one after signs in signs of the coming of the end of the world i know it said in the bible and these people aren't even scared i mean di ba i was telling you before it was like the perfect setting for it to happen i wasn't even surprised that it happened because you 're here amidst all these people who are high on something or drunk or whatever and it 's kinda like that image when uhm uh when when people are  parang they turned in salt from the bible what was that no the one where they were uhm they were like worshipping that golden cow or something that they have made uh yeah yeah yeah and when you look back the the person who looks back will turn into salt uh that 's the one uh uhm that 's it okay so it was kinda like that i i kinda re parang i pictured in my head na this is the scene from the bible only we 're not by a mountain we 're in a party and these people are worshipping the wrong thing  i know   they 're enjoying the wrong thing worshipping their drugs their fun their hedonistic whatever and it was like that earthquake was kinda like the lord 's voice from above remember when di ba in the bible it says uhm there 's a loud voice from above or something like that uh uhm that was so that was so scary i was so scared and what did you do uhm when i woke up i wasn't even sure because i was i was sitting on the bed and i was i was just sitting there for the longest time waiting for it to stop because it because i couldn't move and i was i felt so dizzy and then after it like after like i looked outside and looked if everything was fine if yeah there is if there 's a fire or whatever and then i called my friend dianne and she 's this religious type she 's really yeah right she 's i i i called her i talked to her and we were praying over the phone and we were saying stuff like uhm people are out partying while uhm god is getting mad na and stuff and then there we were so scared there was crying over the phone dianne was crying also yeah we were crying we were and we called i don't know we texted we called christine we found out she went to that party and she 's also scared  yeah  i saw her i was there and there and the thing is another friend christine montalvo they didn't even leave right away they saw that i was leaving with jim and i 'm on i 'm going i 'm leaving this place let 's get out of here and they 're like you know they didn't make me pansin   uh uhm uh uhm  they were just you know there dancing and i was like what the hell is going on with these people christine was scared she told me after she she went home right away with her sister but then when they when they were on their way home people from condos were outside  yeah  some of them were some of them were even wearing robes yeah because they were so scared in the hotel in hotel uhm i think   nikko  nikko ba yon  i don't know somewhere there in glorietta or new world or something like that basta the one that 's malapit  uh uhm uhm the security made everybody get out of the room intercon i think intercon something i don't i forgot what what uhm hotel it was and then everybody was going out but we had to pee so we had to go in and go to the bathroom and then right away they they told us to leave to get out and there were security all over i guess there were some important persons there  grabe 'no  the signs are everywhere but then i know everybody just goes on with their lives and not thinking of what may happen in the future it 's more of like they 're brushing it aside they don't they don't di ba they don't wanna deal with it  uh uhm that 's it  they don't wanna think about it they don't wanna feel scared sometimes when i tell my friend when i tell them like i feel like it 's going to be the end of the world soon they 're like can you not talk like that exactly they don't wanna it 's true it 's gonna happen soon so why not face it while and be ready when it comes exactly but they don't wanna face it they wanna go on and do whatever they 've been doing they don't want the reality of god 's power to to kinda rain on their parade kinda thing they wanna enjoy they wanna do what they want they don't wanna have to uhm you know speaker a says something but unclear  they don't wanna deal with their conscience uh uhm  di ba  'cause they know things are really going bad and and they 're not doing anything about it and sometimes they 're just not really interested anymore exactly it it 's like they don't wanna feel anything di ba  it 's sad e  people are so uhm apathetic yeah especially here in the philippines i 've noticed that and and it 's ironic kasi here everybody is supposed to be so catholic and so christian and blah blah blah blah blah but look what they 're doing they 're not doing anything but sometimes it 's extremes some are really religious and and you know god-fearing and whatever and some are they just don't care as long as they have the pleasures of life they they they have they have uhm they have money they have whatever they can get everything is fine as long as they 're living a a normal and and what well that 's what i 'm saying kanina like they 're worshipping the wrong things like what you said perhaps people are happy that they have uh a good home they have money to buy food they have money to buy clothes ganyan and they 're worshipping money they 're worshipping you know these material things that you won't even be be able to bring with you when you die
Philippines	  uh so the term is over   yeah   what are your plans for this summer   yeah this coming april nineteen i 'll teach because uh i 'm given loads by by c s b i 'm given world literature at the same time creative writing i shall be teaching one subject in the morning and then one in the afternoon actually actually the subjects uh should start at eight o'clock in the morning until twelve ten but then i think there 's one english teacher who would like to teach in the morning because she 's pregnant and then she would like to go home in the afternoon to bulacan    uh uhm   uh uhm  uh uhm   uh so she asked me if we can swap and then i gave the subjects one subject to her the the one in the morning so my schedule is really tough in the sense that i don't like actually the schedule because   one is in the morning and one is in the afternoon     uh uhm yes   in the afternoon uh uhm   so that 's it i 'll be teaching from april nineteen up to may may twelve   that is oh less than a month     laughter three weeks    yeah three weeks     three weeks    well anyway uh that 's uh how how generous you are  really 'no     that 's right that 's the policy of the school because if you are a full-load teacher uh i think that 's only in c s b because in the main i think we have only part-time and full-time   uh-huh   part-time and full-time but in c s b i think we have something in the middle like full-load uh the full-load enjoys also what a full-time teacher enjoys but then what 's the difference the difference lies in uh in one thing when summer comes a full-time teacher doesn't teach but then he gets a salary a full-load doesn't get a salary he has to teach   yeah yeah yeah   and then another advantage of a full-load uhm  compared with ano compared with full with a part-time   with a part-time   is that uh a full-load is given i think an eighteen unit eighteen units eighteen unit load plus three units a part-time can only have up to fifteen units something like that   uh uhm   so of course the salary is higher in terms of salary the salary of a full-time and then a full-load uh teacher between a full-load and uh full-load and a  full-time the salary is the same    full-time  oh the same   the salary is the same uh the difference lies in the number of years of teaching at the same time the qualification academic qualification say if you have a p h d of course you get a higher salary and then if you have stayed in c s b for a number of years then you get also a higher salary   when when does one become a full uh full-time  cough    a full-time it depends on you know the coordinator the what do you call it the chairperson and then there 's another one the director   uh-huh   so the three of them decide and then everything depends on one important thing and that is attitude even though you are a good teacher  and then your academic credentials are really very good if uh you know you don't    uh-huh   uh uhm  your attitude is   you don't you don't follow the c s b mission we 're talking about attitude   uh uhm uh uhm     you know so you can never be a full-time teacher a full-load teacher    so you 're now     so they look into that   so you 're now a full-load teacher   a full-load after two terms because in the first term this is my first year actually in c s b in the first term i was a full i was a part-time teacher   uh-huh   and then in the second term i was a part-time teacher because at the same time i was teaching at university of the east   because i was invited to teach there    uhm  uhm   so the director told me why don't you give it up  and then the second term we 'll give you a full-load status    uhm  uhm   i i told them to give it up but then i think the classes ended uh last last october for the first semester  and then our second trimester started in september    uh uhm   september    so they cannot they were they were not able to grant me the full-load    uh uhm     so they told me you really have to wait for the third term because uh we would like to be sure that you you would give up university of the east so that we can grant you a full-load because that i think that 's the agreement so i was given the full-load in the third trimester    uh uhm   uh uhm  uh uhm   third trimester and then they are planning to give uh teachers who are full-load uh a full-time status this coming  june    yes this coming june   yeah because according to yeah because according to the president brother dizon there 's no such thing as as full-  load    full-load chuckle    as far as status is concerned we have  only part-time and full-time where did you get this full- load something like that    yeah   full-time   uh uhm  oh yeah oo nga    so he was questioning that when he he went to c s b because he goes there every wednesday and he was questioning dean reyes and the e v p where did you get that full-load i mean did andrew gonzalez know about this    uh uhm  uh uhm   why is it that it 's like this if you follow the la salle system when you talk about the university    uh uhm  yeah   so as part of paascu accreditation which will be this coming july then they have to convert these full-loaders into full-time   uh uhm   uh   uh one hundred percent   no they re still looking into  possibilities because there are some teachers who are not you know in terms of attitude    the attitude   yes  yeah   they re not worthy to be given the status   something like that    uh uhm  uh uhm   because the school is very careful in granting the full-time status to teachers because now in school of multidisciplinary studies uh out of one hundred thirty teachers we 're talking about basic subjects english math uh filipino social studies all these teachers uhm belong to school of multidisciplinary studies uh we call it now as general education program and then we have also another department like management something like that so the biggest department in c s b is the school of multidisciplinary studies so out of one one hundred thirty teachers we have only full-time is four full-time teachers and all of these have problems with attitude   uhm   so the school has really difficult time  how thinking how to get rid of these four people but we cannot because they cannot because they 're full-time something like that    yeah   uh uhm    so when the school grants a full-time status to these teachers who have full-load status they are they 're very careful with that   uh-huh those schools there you have a full- time uh faculty uh that uh who are not yet permanent   uh those full-time faculty those four full- time faculty members are permanent already   permanent already    oo they re permanent already   what attitudes for instance    one is the faculty association president but then it seems that he doesn't he doesn't uh he doesn't protect the interest of the faculty like take for example during the promotion the promotion uh the meeting of the board for the promotion of teachers   uh uhm   he always goes against these teachers who are promoted like for example   uhm   i was nominated before to be promoted to be given the full-load status together with other four english teachers he questioned that i mean you are a faculty president    uh uhm  yeah   faculty association president you should you should protect the interest of the faculty you should defend your  support the the faculty members for promotion why is it that you are like that    support   uh uhm    so people a i mean teachers were actually questioning him why is it that it 's like that telephone rings  at the same time other four full-time uh faculty teachers who are hold who are also officers of the faculty association   uh uhm   and every time every time the school decides oh the plan is like this the plan is like that they always go against with the plan    uh uhm  uhm   so   and why like that   the school cannot remove them the the school can't get rid of them because they 're permanent   yeah   so   very difficult 'no     so i think last month uh there was a news that that they would like to go to united states as tourists something like that   that s the president   the four of them the four of them   wait a minute are they all officers wait are they word   they are all officers of the faculty association   oh    oo something like that one is president the other is secretary   uh uhm   because uh i think the policy the policy in the the faculty association is that you cannot become a president you should be a full-time faculty in order to become a president if you want to hold a major position like secretary auditor so you should be a full-time teacher so the positions they they get all the positions  so i think they feel that the school doesn't like them   uh uhm   and then many last month many were applying for abroad   uh uhm   so uh they asked for what do you call this they asked for certification what do you call that certification of employment that they are permanent teachers at c s b so that when you present this paper to the embassy you will be granted the visa tourist visa    uh uhm    because if you are permanent in a certain school like for example c s b or any private schools     uh uhm    then you will come back because you are   permanent     uh uhm    because you may you really have to serve the school something like that  so they asked for that and then dr reyes said why not give them the letters they like i mean they want whatever letters they they want so that they can go out of school because we know that they will not come back anymore because that 's united states of america   and that the purpose of going there is not only to to see america but to stay there and work that 's one way t n t acronym for tagalog slang to stay on as an illegal alien so when the dean heard that from the human resource management uh in-charge and then she told she told him give them the letter    uh uhm   and then  uh uhm and then let them go   let them go if they will not come back then that 's okay   when are they planning to go   but we heard that uh the visa was not approved they were not granted visa because it s difficult to go to the united states right now because of the v f a because of the v f a  so that 's that 's life in c s b so i 'll be teaching     usually how long does it does it take for a full-loader 'no a full-load faculty to become a full-time   full-time uh usually one year uh the reason why they were questioning us the four of us uh the four of us from the english department because this is our first year i mean if you are a new teacher you have to wait for one year you have to finish your one year and then you 'll be granted the full- load status but why is it that after after the first trimester why is it the school was eager to to give us the status because in preparation for the paascu that was the reason and then they see they saw that time that we deserved to be to be given the the status it was not stated in the faculty manual actually but uh but they claimed that why is it that in our case before i mean we waited for two years three years and then we were granted the full-time and full-load status why is it that these new teachers are are are given the the status it 's uh unfair on the part of those who have stayed here for a number of years so they were questioning that but then they cannot do anything at all because uh the school decided for that
Philippines	so we start with uhm family educational background your educational background where you finished   uh bachelor of arts major broadcast communications cum laude nineteen seventy-seven october uh university of the philippines diliman quezon city that 's it  uh uhm  high school you were in assumption assumption nineteen seventy-three makati san lo san lorenzo village  uh uhm elementary up to grade three i think i was in saint theresa 's college in manila uh uhm and then we all skipped a grade right uhm yeah it i think maya no not maya uh all of break in recording pat maris margot and me uh uhm when we transferred to assumption we were accelerated one grade up and so when i was in grade four uh uhm so assumption was grade five up to fourth year high school there all in san lo san lo yes and then now you work with flag free legal assistance group   flag  yes all that while you 've been 1 word  uh okay you see i worked ganito nineteen seventy-four i was still a student and i worked part-time with my dad before this i was part-time with uh no i was doing social work at senden home and then which is an orphanage for uhm street boys uhm and then i worked with my dad part-time from nineteen eighty-four i think it was until i graduated when i graduated actually before i graduated i was supposed to go abroad but the government withheld my passport so since i couldn't travel uhm and i graduated mass com my dad asked me to work with him rather than to work for the government  because if you 're in broadcasting you work with the government you have no choice so i said sure for a while and i ended up working with him for something like fourteen years before he died  uhm  uh uhm uh so but i was also i was doing a lot of crazy things like i was teaching in u s t i was teaching in assumption i was not a very good teacher speaker a chuckles  i have no patience uh and i used to dub you know those japanese cartoons as in voltes five  uhm   oo  okay but i was

which you know kind of wasn't allowed uh but he was the only one he would he he and dad were very close they were talagang unclear utterance by speaker a  now he is eleven so when your dad died he was only he wa dad died in eighty-seven uh uhm february and my son 's birthday is also february okay uh so ano he he took he really took it very badly because he viewed my father i would say uhm not so much as a lolo i mean both as a lolo because he was spoiled rotten really laughter  uh but also he but my dad was his father image that was his concept so when my dad died he he he he his studies were you know he just didn't wanna study anymore he he he was really of al i think 'no  uhm let me put it this way i could not grieve as much because i had to look after him because he was the one who really really really i mean  yeah  he took it badly he he really did he he took it badly word  he couldn't sleep he wouldn't eat you know that type  siya talaga 'yung naapektuhan so i was affected but i couldn't break in the recording because i had to attend to my son  yeah  well anyway so you remember your dad before he was into politics  do you remember that time   as a kid i used to work for him all the time you see my dad was more my boss he and i had a very good relationship but i would say that i knew him very well as a boss uhm because i worked for him  uhm  so what was his personality what what kind of a person   he was a perfectionist okay i yet i heard he always did things last minute yeah but he was a perfectionist in this sense ha   uh yeah  there 's a pleading uh he he does not like touch and go office supply used for erasing  at that time there were no computers so i could not submit anything to him that had an erasure because he didn't like it he was he was that much he was also what he demanded of himself he demanded of us uh so he demanded he had very very high standards in everything he did he felt that if you do something you do it well or you don't do it at all period and that was what he imposed on himself that 's what he imposed on us he also was uh i don't know a very responsible person uh in this sense 'no like for example we the staff i mean i would make him laugh with booboos but in front of the client he would protect us he he would you know but in front of when it was us he would bawl us out why did you do that you were so stupid ta tah ta tah ta tah i mean he had no compunctions about that uh what kind of a person was he he was also ano he loved books and huh he used to say ale mahal instead of ali mall that will that was our joke all the time okay he would go around with us break in the recording  several times i used to accompany him to his hearings he would forget that i was with him speaker a chuckles  he would leave me and it 's up to me to go home i don't even know where i am and it 's up to me to go home because he had so many things in his head  ah yeah ha   uhm  uh he 's always thinking so he yeah i thought yeah he was thinking uhm and sigh and then uhm no okay he loved crossword puzzles he he would do that a lot of times uh what else would we do  ano rin siya he was very uhm cari&ntilde;oso  uhm uh he would always make akbay he would always put his arm around you he was not uh he was not ano i mean at least with us 'no with us kids very cari&ntilde;oso  and then uhm i don't think he had much of a sense of humor but we would laugh all the time and he wouldn't find it funny i mean okay there were things he wouldn't find funny of course 'no  i mean uh but not my sense of humor he was more serious than most uh he what was his wha what else was he like you know basta he was a tough boss he he would he was a difficult person for me 'no  he was very challenging to work with but he was and the thing about okay there are a lot of things i like he accepted a lot of criticism for someone 'no who who writes as well and as intelligent as him for example he had a talk he would prepare his talk he would show it to me announcing you read it you read it tell me what you think he hated an answer like it 's okay it 's okay i he hated that uh he encouraged you to argue he encouraged you to criticize even him and his works and i remember doing that and he i remember telling him papa no i don't think it should be done this way uh i don't think this is correct i don't agree with you you know etcetera etcetera and he said and he argued with me and we really argued and then in the end he says okay and he changed it and then i   he was really open to very open and he also for his for a man of his stature his brains he was very intelligent he was also quite humble about himself in that sense because very few people will take their work their masterpiece being criticized he loved it he would show me all his papers what do you think what do you think about this uh he he always like for example for me i 've i was never a lawyer he trained uh with his father right  uhm   uh uhm   uh uhm   as a lawyer yeah he he took up two years of law that 's all if i remember and uh his father used to teach him this trick and he would do it to everybody all of us at us who worked with him his father would tell him read this he would read it and he would go back to his father and he 'd say i 'm through and his father would say okay read something else and he asked won't you ask me questions about what i read no you said you read it i trust you i imagine you understand it if you don't understand it you ask if you don't if you understand it then fine read something else it stuck with him uhm and the other thing that his father taught him was how to research so if i asked him any question he would say you have eyes you have a brain god gave them to you go to the library look for whatever it is you 're looking for read it look for it when we were really stuck then i 'd go to him like sorry can't find it etcetera etcetera  hay then he 'd sit down and explain it and i i never studied law i worked with him but towards i would say uh the eighties already we would sit down and discuss his cases and i would ask him papa can't you do it this way and he 'd say no you see because if you do it if you handle a case in this way this is what 's gonna happen but if we do it another way it 's fine so he didn't mind he never made me or any other person feel stupid uhm you could ask a lot of questions and he would take be patient enough to answer it at the same time he encourages you uh not always to think the way he wants he does not and he already he told us me anyway so many times you can't uhm don't believe what i believe because i believe it believe what you believe because you believe it i don't expect any of you to follow me or do exactly what i 'm doing or what or what or what you do it because it 's you because it 's what you want  uhm  uhm he really made us pushed us to be very independent thinkers uh uhm and uhm responsible thinkers i don't know how else before before that so i was i 'm one of the younger ones
Philippines	so can you give me a brief account of your family and educational background okay uhm educational background i just finished law school in the states and i passed the minnesota bar and i trained in the u s  uh uh  you 're gonna be working here or  uh  yeah i 've come back for good na  and i 'm hoping to take the bar again next year for the philippine bar after petitioning the supreme court 'cause they might not let me take it after a few years there uh uh  word  yeah in the family i 'm the ninth words i was the baby before my nephew came laughter   yeah   and you are so you 've been away for how many years three years three years out in illinois 'no  yeah two years in illinois then i spent my last year in minnesota uh so i 'm here to ask you about your dad i 'm doing it for my thesis so you 're not working yet 'no you just finished uhm i 'm i 'm a researcher at free legal assistance group the flag office uh huh uhm since i can't take the bar until next year what word until i can so i 'm doing legal research for flag uh so now you 're you 're a lawyer and your dad was a lawyer did he influence you in any way yes laughter   words  i think i 've i 've i 'm not sure i wouldn't have been a lawyer if it weren't for dad i always started out saying no i 'm going to be an artist no i 'll be an archaeologist i don't want to become a lawyer i always said no i don't wanna be a lawyer and uh it seemed that everywhere i turned it would always end up with me going back in the direction of law school oh and he was a big influence it was something i knew would make him really happy if i did go to law school did he ask you did he ask you no  but you could sense it  no yeah yeah 'cause when i told him that one time that i had decided to okay for sure i 'm going to law school he was really really uh that 's good   that kind of tone of voice  uh  and i knew he was really really happy so that that was the big influence part words it was nice to make him feel laughter  i felt he he really wanted me to go 'cause i 'm the only girl who 's gone through law school although cookie probably knows more about the law than i do 'cause she worked again with him practically but uh i 'm the only one who really went through formal training  uh   uh-huh yeah  uh so how old were you before you he formally went into politics that was around nineteen no i was born in nineteen sixty-four i think around four years when he was already starting so you have no memory of him aside outside you know his political life before that i mean before he was really into the limelight so what do you remember most about him you know his being a family man  uh what do you  uh he was always around to talk to he liked to read uhm uhm we liked to read the same books so we read the same books   yeah  we 'd always go to bookstores  he was fond of reading   i think that was i think our main activity he 'd come up he was tired of work and i would be home from school he 'd say c 'mon let 's go to the bookstore so we 'd all go together and you uh and then we 'd be reading the same books so it would be fun it could be a family outing and when i was a kid he liked to take a lot of photographs yeah that was one of his major hobbies so i have lots of since i was the baby at that time i was one of the favorite subjects laughter  so if you look at the family albums there 're lots of pictures of me  lots of pictures of you interesting so he liked photography 'no  what about his uhm his his what do you call this his writings i know that he he also liked to write especially during his detention  he liked to write a lot  yeah  for each us like there was a time when he was in solitary confinement and there wasn't anything he could do he would pray the rosary and he would make a poem and that was all i mean he couldn't they weren't allowing him any access to books or the radio or what so he would just think and he would make a poem and then when we finally got to see him about a month after he 'd told us all the poems he 'd memorized them completely and he had one for each of us and we 've kept all his letters from prison every birthday 'cause he couldn't really buy anything or make any uh buy anything for us he would either like i have a kit he had this model of a cinderella coach  uh   it it 's more a pump with uh with water and at the background there 's the cinderella coach and those would be his gifts he 'd make crafts ahh and then always the letters and if he couldn't make anything it 'd be one of the roses he grew in his tiny garden and always a letter how does it affect you personally 'cause you were very close to him 'no  i think you 're yeah i was laughter  yeah i was the baby for awhile until my nephew came laughter  by that time i was happy not to be the baby because i was in high school already uh huh but okay good somebody else now uhm you know the way i thought was really influenced by what he did i only realized it when i got to high school 'cause i would talk about things with my classmates that they never saw and we all when i went to assumption and it 's true the convent walls are really high uh uhm laughter  you there 's nothing you don't see anything of the outside when you get out of san lorenzo village so you end up thinking yeah this is probably the world so when i would talk with my friends about what was going on they would say uh yeah uh yeah that 's interesting but they never really saw so he really he really influenced you in thinking 'no about the world and everything  yeah  yeah about what was going on that there was something more than just within the four walls of the house or within the thick walls of the school there were other people and and that 's why i al i became a lawyer i think it was there is always the desire to serve and i saw how much work he did and it 's nice to be able to you know help continue what he did what about you know when he went into detention after that how would was he changed in any way i mean emotionally aside from physically ha  it it was a big change 'cause when he went in nineteen seventy-two i was eight years old and mom was very worried about the situation so she pulled us all out of school except for the ones in college we all studied at home for two or three years three years yeah two years then i only went back to school in grade four so i think i took part of grade two and part of grade three it was maya who was teaching me 'cause at that time she was getting her education degree so she would tutor me and uhm so it was a big change in our quality of friends and there was that thing you know your father is under detention so it really didn't affect my friends i don't think their parents ever told them don't play with her or what there was no change in that but i just felt that knowing you were you had a different family life kind of it sets you apart and the nuns would kind of look out for us  uhm   uh uhm  uh yeah yeah i always felt that you know we were always watched wherever laughter  uh huh they made sure we were doing okay uhm and 'cause we would also have i think we started having masses in the house and words  but what about his attitude you know was he did he feel that he was weaker you know his spirit i mean it made him go did it change him in any way he wanted to to serve for yeah i think it it really strengthened his resolve to do something but before that he was really more of a politician  i think i mean this is thinking back 'cause when i was growing up i really didn't think about it that much uh uhm uhm before i think he was a traditional politician you know he went to the senate although he would talk to people and help them as much as he could when he got out of prison it was a deeper commitment to really really serve because he went through a lot he wasn't a politician anymore and he didn't have to go to the senate or what he really went into lawyering seriously he would travel all over and for him it was i think this is what he always said that he was treated very well while he was under detention and he knew that other people weren't uh uhm and but for him he i think he really hated the experience of being confined yeah and he said if it was that bad for me i was treated pretty well i had my own room they 'd never tortured me what about the people who were tortured they couldn't afford legal help and that 's what really pushed him to start the free legal assistance group flag and really get into it but ahmm what about his family life he was very busy 'no after after this he always had time for everybody  yeah  not as much uhm uh we used to laugh i used to say that i saw more of him when he was in prison than after laughter  but all of us i don't know we took it in stride because we all understood i think he he al he made us understand which is what i appreciate it that you know he explained what he was doing uh-huh so we never really resented the fact that he wasn't around and when he was around it would always be fun uhm meal times were great you know you would all sit down yeah and we would talk politics we would talk about what was going on you know it was a more than just the how was your day like that did you hear about this what did you think of that that was your special time right during meal time probably you were all together yeah we all liked to eat too laughter  and okay so what about family gatherings you know did you have any reunions or anything always birthdays dad 's birthday mom 's birthday   and the whole family would be there yeah and christmas 'cause by that time some were married or some had lived separate words for a time they 'd live with us mench lived in bacolod for a while and she had a separate house but always for birthdays we 'd be together so what what happened there and what would you do you know uh oh i don't think we ever really had any gathering that was just really family he had a really public life he liked people and people really liked him so every time it would be his birthday friends would always drop by and it was always like the extended family i mean the only times would really be i don't think we had any really family gatherings just the family except when he was in prison always after that it would be a gathering of lots of friends and he 'd just circulate and go on everybody would just be talking uhm the kids by that time we had escaped chuckle  they used to make all the girls sing all the children sing and dance  uh uhm   okay  so by that time the nieces were growing up and the nieces and the nephews were there so it was their turn already there would always be a short program for whose ever birthday it was and yes a lot of eating drinking and laughing so he was very i can say that he was very viva person he enjoyed a lot uhm   yeah  so now we go to his uh he got sick right again sick how did this affect you your relationship with him when he it was really it was really hard to believe the first few years because he had always really just been going on and i thought nothing could really faze him i think the only time he had gotten really sick was he had a bypass in his early seventies and then in prison he got really really thin but it was hard to think of him getting sick  uhm the usual case it only really started showing i think in eighty-six before although he would go for treatment he still had hair laughter  uh uhm  and he would still go around in eighty-six he was appointed to the committee on human rights and i was his confidential secretary at that time and like there were fact-finding missions he wa he was scheduled to go and we couldn't go because he was too ill and that was the only time we really saw it how did that affect him as a person did he say i 'm sick and you know i 'm i 'm just gonna give up now no i think he he tried to fight it as much as he could uhm like he would uh he would promise like he would you know get up on certain days and in fact uh i have a notebook of his i got it after he died 'cause he said he had his penmanship really suffered he had great penmanship and when he got sick he couldn't write it wasn't as clear and he told himself he was going to learn how to write again so he asked me to buy him one of the you know those writing notebooks with the blue line the red line the blue line and i got it after he died 'cause i said mom you know can i have this so i thought it hadn't been used until i noticed at the bottom corner of each page he had written a big a a small a a big d and he was he had full real intentions of practicing unfortunately i don't think he ever really got to the fourth page he was sick he got really tired when he was really really sick he got tired a lot  uh uhm  what about you how did you take this it was it was very hard it was hard to see him that way 'cause knowing how he had been the years before and how quick his mind was it was painful for me to see him like that so i knew it was probably painful for him though he never really said he never told us
Philippines	yeah did you get my point now cough  i don't think convenient purposive sampling is a delimitation i think it 's part of the scope  why would we delimit the study  you think so  okay so put it in the scope no problem okay okay so what else well for the others just think it over and try to find out what are the other possible uhm scope or delimitations which you might encounter or we might encounter during the study itself anyway uhm just to be sure bobby told us na not to not to stress on this part yet because we 're not yet sure on what we 're going to focus it on so just add the note there that this uh this scope and limitation is not yet permanent it 's not it 's only temporary because we 're not yet sure if we 're really going to encounter these limitations yeah okay so is that clear yes it is okay so the significance is clear and the scope is clear now let 's go to the things that bobby told me or was discussed okay  do i need to take down notes  so  it 's up to you if you 'd like to okay so uhm the first thing we talked about was about the review of lit = literature since it was that one that we really referred to or you were supposed to talk about during the meeting okay now in the discussion of the review of lit he told us the review of lit was okay in fact the the the funny part nga however was uhm when he gave the when he gave these little pieces of review of lit not the actually the review of lit he was so happy because he found out that he was not going to have a hard time with us it seems our mind was loose and indirect and was flow was flowingly good when we gave out or we handed out the real review of lit his mind began to get boggled up yeah there was so many uhm it became complicated it became complicated from the easy thing it became so complicated so that 's why he told us to uh limit down or cut down on some of the things that we have in our study or in our review of lit  so uh first and foremost the so it 's okay the parts uh we have to talk about something about uh poverty something about uh about uh aspirations and uh but we have to include another factor and the uhm and that is supposed to be uhm more on the coping patterns and the uh what are the usual resources uh usually encountered during the process and at the same time he also made mention since we have this is the thing that we have to submit for monday e which tess forgot that we should do anyway i 'll just call him just call her up and i 'll tell her maybe we 'll just make it up na lang on monday afternoon before we we attend bobby 's ano tapos to formulate so that when we submit it it 's okay na  now that part kasi we have to figure out what are the questions or the questions that were kasi bobby told us to formulate fifteen questions and these fifteen questions are supposed to be geared in finding out the things we want to learn so for uh one question in finding out uh what are their goals tapos how did they reach their goals the problems reaching their goals and how do they cope in reaching their goals  tapos another problem which is uhm uh uhm assigned or which was uh related to this was also in knowing uhm what will be the uh bracket of the people that we will be studying will it be by family or or by age uh tess and i told bobby that we 'll be studying by age groups so age groups yeah so adults you know adolescents uh elderly now uh when it comes to that we have to figure out or we 'll have to add into our review of related literature the developmental stages  uhm   yes so we don't know who 's going to do that yet that 's why it 's imperative that next week we start revising our review of lit because we 're going to be starting to work on our chapter two and at the same time revising our review of lit because if we don't start already which is supposed to be today nga if we weren't able to meet as a whole today we start it next week and midterms next week so many tests we have to find a date and really start it and work it out 'cause if we don't do it we 're not going to finish on time we 're not going to make the best out of our thesis okay so those are the things he told about the review of lit now when it goes naman to the review of lit again he said na uh it was it 's proper daw kasi we gave data okay uh the proper format will be to give the data then after giving the data is to to try to relate that data with our study  tapos uh if and that could be related by either uhm formulating a question or formulating previous studies which are associated with uh what we are studying which could be related to that so what i mean is when when we have like for example for the poverty or the poor you 've gathered the data so now that we know how many people are poor in the country how would we associate that to uh our study what 's the importance of that to our study so we could uh stress daw in question form like uh uhm if there are so many people who are poor in a country uhm what impact would this have on their ano on their aspirations in life so something to associate it with because our output was okay in the sense that it had content the problem was it lacked a little bit in direction so we have to direct it so we have to really we have really to smooth some of the edges which are a little bit rough and i think it there are lots of rough edges for the indigenous method uh tess will be the one to handle that anyway uh it 's quite easy naman what bobby wants to do for that then uh i think that 's all so i already discussed to you about the scope and delimitation and together with the significance of the study the frame of his mind so if i were you i 'd look for a book related to uh adler or jung or jung or why is it important uh maybe you would like to talk some more and especially in english i 'm the one who 's talking and talking and this tape is running hi poch i 've nothing to say  ha  i 've nothing much to say to you why so short my goodness b laughs  i 've been talking so long in english and you 're not saying anything so that 's it na   are we through well i think so unless you have some more questions i have a question yes but it 's not related to our thesis okay it 's about psycho two the translation  what about it   how do you go about it   di ba you were talking to mrs abrenica kanina  why would i tell you please naman because i 'm asking i don't like to i 'm asking you i don't like to please i want you to have a hard time please naman o   well   i 've been so definitely uh next week ha we have to meet please  no no  no for psycho two  pero wait ha we really have to meet   oo yeah it 's okay  no problem with me  and next time  when we meet next week i wo please let 's have it serious because because we 're not going anywhere even right now my mind isn't fixed yet on our real target for this thesis okay so i 'm just telling you that in advance okay now where were we psycho two yeah what about psycho two uh yeah the process of the translations and stuff   yeah  well you see translation cough break in the recording starts enunciating very clearly, exaggeratedly, mimicking a teacher  well you see uh in the translation there are so many methods that we might use yeah ha  paper no oh there are so many methods of translations that we might use now uhm in those methods of translations for example in our case we would be using the bilingual form of translation in essence what would happen here would be we have uh the tran we will get the uh copy of uh of the words that we were supposed to translate and we 're going to get the copy of that which is in uh in tagalog or filipino and we 're going to ask a bilingual to translate that into english okay so for example there 's other words in uh in filipino and then i ask you ma'am may you please translate this in english you 're going to translate this in english now once you have translated it in english we would i would then try to compare how are you able to translate it but  uh uhm  compared to the original yeah with the original then after doing so i would ask a monolingual not any more a bilingual a monolingual is someone who is really an expert in the in the in vocabulary or in words you got me yes okay now this monolingual will countercheck monolingual in what in in expert in english or in tagalog   yeah yeah yeah in english  yes yes yes you got it very good now this monolingual will then check the translation that you made okay together with the translation uh uh together with the english form and try to find out if they are matching okay now whatever the monolingual finds out and whatever you found out from the bilingual will then be uh written down in a form of synthesis ahh to inform how were you able to check it out and at the same time it is also essential to know uh if uh if the way it was translated was in the proper way or not you got my point yes  okay   i see your point it 's very big help the point the point the point that you made is so big okay good okay because ano  you give me the mike okay so get the mike get the mike oh it 's ok  mike okay  ha no i 'm finished no no no no don't say i 'm pinished pronounced with a p say don't say i 'm pinished that 's wrong e that 's wrong grammar   i 'm finished  no no no you say i 'm fi   i 'm through  that 's slang make it more eloquent i 'm finished yeah now you try it i 'm finished  you try it you try it come on now don't be ashamed it 's okay it 's okay uhm you know some people commit i 'm not ashamed for myself i 'm ashamed for you  wai wait wait not don't you can't that 's wrong grammar again it 's wrong yeah i 'm not ashamed fro i 'm not ashamed for myself ashamed i said ashamed with sh  hey your bohol accent is getting uh getting ahead of you again okay i 'm not ashamed for myself not my i 'm not ashamed i myself  say i 'm not ashamed for myself  but you said i 'm ashamed for you  you get me you get my point  aw if you don't stop laughing nothing will happen in our conversation poch will get disappointed right poch okay so poch wait aw is trying to concentrate aw you 're turning red again so don't laugh my goodness aw come on say something when are we supposed to submit psycho two psycho two well it was supposed to be due due ha remember due laughter three weeks from the from the time she gave away i didn't commit the error of saying he gave away  it 's she gave away which is usually committed by some some filipinos in in talking alright she gave away was supposed to be due uh three weeks from that date when she gave the paper
Philippines	you know i 'm afraid to watch the sixth sense  isn't that the film of bruce willis you know actually she just vomitted just like that i watched it but i didn't see that part because i was

scariest part she wasn't able to sleep for like three nights alone isn't it that words at the box office yeah me and my for me the scariest part would when the when the guy was walking down the corridor and then he said uh sooner or later i 'll put you to death and when he turned he had a hole in his head so that 's sick  so sick  anyway another question are you taking your practicum denise uhm yes i am oh where are you taking it i 'm taking it at hong kong bank it 's at ayala avenue they just moved in they have a new building it 's quite good i mean it 's interesting 'cause it 's like a

can access like different offices just through that bar code in their i ds what do you do there uhm i was assigned to work at the administration department uhm i i 'm like i 'm like the secretary of

's none it 's it could really get frustrating 'cause like you have no one to talk to i mean someone you could talk to the same i mean i mean someone you could converse with 'cause like basically most of them have their own family and they 're like daddies already so there 's really not much there 's really not much to talk about with them  so what do you plan to do after you graduate uhm i haven't

yeah my lessons tried to pre prepare during the night or in in between but sometimes you know i just i   lessons   just before laughs  yeah just before laughs and i feel so bad laughs  because the

had consigned with them that was paintings that 's a paint what uh painting paintings yeah small paintings uhmm smaller than bond paper size anyway you know i 'm wondering if if chuch has already called the peo   guests  yeah the guests but she has to she has to instruct them that not to invite others laughs   laughs well yeah yeah one thing not to to invite others that the invitations are very limited and then she has to tell them not to park in front of our house so ma so mama won't be suspicious  laughs  she 's gonna ask them to to park in front of the neighbor 's house so that when mama i think i think i think mark arranged uhm for the association remi to invite to to have a meeting that day laughs  well not really a meeting so a small mock meeting   mock meeting  yeah a mo a small group meeting just this person that she needs to meet with mama ahh and that person is invited to the party okay so there so that mama will be out for the day laughs  when mama comes home then

general uh ahh okay most of the time they 're not there i see good idea for every time when when she calls a guest she has to instruct them  snickers  well better than the first plan what was the first plan   the first plan is because we were planning to have it on a sunday e mama doesn't usually go out on a sunday she 's lazy when she gets home she doesn't want to go out anymore so tong was  well she usually on a sunday mama just stays in her room and watches t v and she hardly goes down uh hum yeah you noticed uh hum she only goes down for merienda  and dinner and dinner laughs  and chit-chat there so so we were planning we were planning to have them to have the guests go to the basement directly to the basement huh  laughs imagine they 'll be staying there for a long time uh might be a long time depends on the rate laughs they come then anyway after they gather enough they 're going to go up and surprise mama uh huh then but mark was saying that 's why he suggested to have it on a saturday what if syempre mama will just be wearing her duster 'di ba laughs so she might feel and she won't be fixed up so she might look  laughs funny   yeah   1 word   saturday 's

i don't care anymore i don't care who knows in fact i want the whole world to know of course that meant a lot to trish word  are you serious so that everyone started dancing right and that both that singer guy goes over to trish and gets her hand right and she goes on playing but then that guy calls her up later on and says hey i saw you and james uh you were pretty sweet trish is like uh so so we are right and then yeah he was i i guess well james keeps saying that that guy likes trish but trish doesn't care because trish is in love with james  words  and for the first time you know trish found someone who when when she looks at him everyone else falls into words  it 's just him i mean not that she disregards everyone they 're there but it 's just him he 's all that is important and she doesn't care if her ex-boyfriend passes by or his ex-girlfriend passes by all that matters is that they 're together in the same area trish is a lot prettier than his ex-girlfriend  laughs well i 'm sure trish would like that would like to hear that yeah but for a while trish felt it she was like you know  words  was she the reason why they broke up i don't think so i hope not i hope not i 'd hate for trish to be a home-wrecker i mean you know it 's bad enough what trish went through in the first relationship with you know all that yeah i remember that  laughs and yeah and oh yeah uhm james was saying something like oh there 's something about what you said that i was uhm trish 's uhm uhm ex-relationships right james james was just telling her it 's all in the family you know family and it was fun because they were trying to be they would see her that they 're together and trish even said you know james i 'm sorry about the break-up but i 'm even sorrier because i 'm not really sorry get it trish is like i feel bad that you guys broke up but i don't feel that bad oh but i feel worse that i 'm not sincere i mean in fact i 'm happy   it only shows she doesn't love him that much yeah but i was happy that you know said trish yeah trish was saying that i was happy that you broke up i guess not that she wanted james to be hurt it 's because i don't know i guess she felt that she wanted to give james something more words  words and trish calls her trish never calls his ex-girlfriend by her full name by her full name trish always calls her would-be ex-girlfriend  like trish word she said that you know you and your ex-girlfriend because if if trish calls her by her real name it would sound like they knew each other right but that 's words  we they were introduced uh we were all in here and then they were introduced in fact james goes oh yeah you know this is my sweetie and then you know sweetie this is trish so it was kind of weird you know because the next i think a couple of weeks after that they broke up uh-uhm and then a week later on or a couple of weeks later on she 's walking down the street sees his car knocks on a window she he puts he rolls the window down and she looks in and trish and james were in the car right so she looked she gave trish this mean like bad trish didn't know what to do she was sitting there oh my god  james she shouldn't have seen me i shouldn't have been here and james is like i don't care you know screw that she you know she left me she 's got her own reasons why can't i go out on my own but i guess for a while james was struggling to make trish feel like she 's the most important person in his life he kept calling her up i guess sometimes words because like yesterday trish and james were somewhere there right after uhm james word  and then james 's ex-girlfriend happened to be there oh the other one the older one yeah the older yeah yeah that girl that bitch  that girl yeah that b s right so i was sitting by the lobby you know where the photocopying machine is and she was there and i said hey what 's up you know that 's true words   laughs i think so i mean not to words  about but you know when i see that girl she 's like a like a like a prostitute or a dead person yeah she 's so white i mean she used to stare at me in a mean way every time i 'm near her she did it to trish too all of her words  when she comes in  laughs holy cow so you know uhm trish walked over sat down and then the girl shelly goes hey hi you know trish was like hey hi and then shelly 's like oh that 's a nice jacket and trish was like thanks but it 's not mine whose jacket is that james oh and she has a look like oh okay shelly 's like so uhm are you tired why don't you go home yeah i will in a while i 'm just waiting and then she asks like what are you waiting for right and she was like when james is finished oh okay and then for a minute there i think shelly gets it then she looks then she goes so what 's up with you i mean trish and shelly would never boast correct yeah yeah right in fact when they came to the station you know shelly was like hi hi hi d hi but then in the hallway they wouldn't look at each other not yeah so you know it 's not fishy and then uhm she goes so what 's up with you i mean do you have a boyfriend then trish is like what no i broke up with him a long time ago it is a long time ago i mean you know if you think about it pretty much yeah i mean emotionally it 's not like a long time ago and then shelly goes oh so are you going out with anyone but then james told her already before a couple of weeks after i don't care if she finds out that we 're dating in fact james told his best friend that you know that they were dating and i you know like trish is just oh my gosh she was telling me right she 's like i 'm the happiest girl alive because i mean how would you feel when your guy tells his best friend that he 's finally dating that 's a sweet thing when it comes from a guy right so when i heard about it i was happy for her too but oh my god that 's that 's exciting and and he he he 's got the same birthday as trish  same day yeah really yeah it 's so weird i know it 's so weird right and then yeah so there and i was thrilled when i heard about it i was words and james sounded so excited he sounded like a little boy who 's just got a star in class like you know what i told my best friend we were dating and trish was like oh my god that is really sweet and then uhm to think that they 're going out on a week-end i think uhm trish uhm james their friends the other couple marlon  corrects herself marlo and junior marlon and junior yeah there we go marlo and junior it 's gonna be marlo junior trish james and then uhm bert  laughs  and his uh his wife rubber ducky a dj name  yeah his rubber ducky it 's gonna be fun well i don't know i heard that james invited bert but bert is not sure yeah words james trish marlo i know because it will give us you know it will give them the chance yeah it 's like a double date for them i know well james asked trish if it was okay trish is like he 's your best friend again i 'm not gonna say no to that she says but then i guess yeah it would be sweeter to words other you know i mean i i marlo already asked her dad or told her dad to leave her when was that her dad said words so i guess it 's all right yes yeah it is and then i heard and then marlo just said words trish 's sister is there right now oh you know what 's so cool what 'cause trish trish said that it was it was uh marlo 's birthday right yeah but it 's not and the funny thing did you say that marlo 's sis is gonna be there yeah because trish told her parents that trish it 's a coincidence trish goes yeah you know her sister is gonna be there and her sister is you know like this you know known person t v personality or something   yeah  she 's uhm her sister is covering the military camps see oh my god that 's such a coincidence see that 's a good thing it 's a sign it 's a sign it 's got to happen and you know james is like i 'm so excited to go shopping with you baby and then you know trish is like okay but what are we

Philippines	hello my name is wendy and i 'm here with pammy say hi pammy hi i 'm pammy okay so today we 're going to talk about our childhood moments so i 'm going to start i remember once one time when i was in grade three i was in ms mrs barstow 's class and i was around oh nine years old so one day mrs barstow asked us asked us to draw a picture with the theme stop look and listen it was a safety theme like in the traffic when uhm when you 're crossing the street what you what should you do first you should stop look both ways right and listen for cars  look   listen  yeah that way you 're sure to be safe so i drew a picture with three scenes uhm in the first scene a girl just stops she 's just standing there the second scene she was looking in one direction and the next scene she had her hand up to her ear so as to say she 's listening for something and the funny thing about my picture was the look of the girl giggles  she she had so much make-up on laughter the her eyes are eye shadow was blue and she has real really really red lipstick  red blush  and a blush-on and a blush blush-on like you 'd think she 'd look like the nanny reference to a television character with big hair and and thin body and make-up i think it was because i was influenced so much by my mother because growing up i always saw her every morning applying her make-up yeah just like the flintstones that flintstones' advertisement wherein the kid one time uhm her mom went out oh i think went to work and then she she went inside her mom 's room and then she got all those make-up stuff of her mom oh yeah yeah remember she 's trying to put make-up on and the lipstick 's going everywhere and yeah so my picture really looked strange especially since she had so much make-up on  yeah   yeah  well anyway so we submitted all our pictures in to the teacher and unknowingly what the teacher did was she submitted all our drawings into a contest a traffic contest that was sponsored by oh some traffic organization for safety and  so in a few days she gave us back our pictures but then i noticed that i didn't get mine back so i thought where 's mine 'cause everybody else have theirs you know i didn't wanna feel left out so i asked mrs barstow where is my picture and then she goes and then she says that she entered my picture into a into that contest and it hadn't come back so i thought a contest okay that 's fine so   how old were you then i was around nine or ten grade three and uhm  so after a few days my drawing came back and my teacher said that i had won that my entry was one of the selected drawings from uh in a in that contest that which is open to so many others from different schools oh that 's great wen so what did you get what prize did you get well it wasn't really a prize thing but i did get the poster that on which they printed all the different uhm drawings that they selected as winners so that was nice i actually have that poster up till now wow that 's great oh so well what about you pam break in the recording  well for me uhm when i was in grade three i also remember we used to have art classes every wednesdays and fridays i guess so but that was a long time ago but what i enjoyed most about my childhood years was that i i always bring my barbie stuff my barbie dolls remember oh barbie i had one uhm yeah i have i guess i have three and i always bring the three barbies to school and of course show them off to my friends and we play all day one time uhm it was our yeah i remember it was ms garcia 's class i think that was our filipino class yeah and then i i i don't wanna listen i i don't know i guess i was just so excited with my with my new barbie and then so i didn't listen and and then while in the class i was playing with my barbie and then my sis the worst thing is my sister saw me playing me with the barbie and then so of course the teacher approach approached me and she talked to me uhm ms villanueva why are you not listening to me do stop and then i go like no miss i am listening then my teacher told me okay well give me your barbie after that of course the the the the usual reaction of a kid is to cry so i cried as in i really cried so when i went home my mom asked me oh why are yo why are your eyes so red so i told him what happened and then the next day my mom my mom went to my teacher whoa yeah mom against teacher my mom actually my mom didn't parang uhm didn't shout at my teacher or what she just asked of course why is my uhm barbie with her 'cause i didn't tell her uhm i didn't tell her i didn't told her that i was i wasn't listening so otherwise my mom was thinking that my teacher just got just got just took your barbie away yeah just took my barbie away so what happened is instead of my mom scol uhm uhm scolding my teacher at the end my mom scolded me so  until now i don't know if my barbie is still in the house but i remember i didn't get it back anymore  pammy i think you 're the original barbie girl laughter  well barbies actually i didn't really get a barbie until i was pretty old really uh i mean some girls get it when they 're six or seven i got mine when i was eight or nine and i think it was given to me by my godfather and godmother  six  oh that 's nice in our family as in all of us should have barbie at least one yikes actually i don't really like dolls those that kind of dolls even dolls with long hair yeah sexy bodies what i really liked were the dresses i loved dressing them up i had a barbie and she had this long dress and sometimes since she had such a long dress i 'd make it shorter or up to the knees 'cause it really went down up to her ankles  yeah  unfortunately of course i had a brother and being a brother he broke the head off  yeah  oh so there you go no more barbie beheaded barbie my my brothers can't touch my stuff ca they can't touch my barbie those are my favorite things when like when i was still small and i used to have those big houses of barbie ow yeah with the car yeah with the cars we have ken of course of course yeah i remember  no i didn't have any accessories as grand as that   as that  but you know i 'm pretty much a simple person i don't go for those dolls especially those dolls that when you sit them up they open their eyes and then when you lie them back down they close their eyes remember those   yeah you 're right   i remember  they 're so freaky they 're actually they 're so scary they are really i hated them i hate them also i hate them and they used to have those what do you call the 'yung stroller thing stroller thing you 're playing mummy or something yeah i hate that i don't enjoy that maybe that 's why i never watched chuckie the main villain in the film child 's play you know that chuck  i watched that yeah stutter the that horror movie yeah stutter with the doll that tried to kill there 's a part two of that yeah there 's even a part three oh part three uh uhm wherein the bride of chuckie you know with the he and his girlfriend also turns into a doll or something else so weird but it 's always showing in h in h b o uh uhm that 's true   yeah  actually you know i 'm a stuffed

jeans  yes but i don't wanna go to quad and enroll 'cause there was a flood there  but you wouldn't be going  you wouldn't be going to megamall if your mom didn't ask you to no 'cause i i should be in in in in shangri-la anyway so we 're gonna go to megamall because i wanna buy jeans and louis wants to look for some shirts and and some summery outfits i don't swimming trunks i 'm not sure i don't have decent swimming trunks for this summer   no actually he has except that it 's bikini   bikini trunks  and he has this big tummy so he can't wear that anymore and he 's going to dumaguete this summer so he can't so he can't he can't he can't he can't wear it so now he has to look for shorts right okay okay okay you know yung salita ko here goes the background of the story uh uhm sugar-coating the whole thing no i wasn't i was bluntly telling everything laughs   siyempre you you 're very ecstatic and we 're talking to a tape recorder  o yun nga yun na nga ang it 's so weird it 's like going around and i was talking everything now the big question is the confidentiality of the tape uhm sir don't don't go like playing it to everyone that 's not it 's not nice uh okay break in the recording  okay now we 've decided to talk about the academy awards i don't know why but he wants to talk about it so we 'll talk about it okay what then the academy awards yes okay what about the academy awards i wanted uhm uhm i had i only had two candidates of mine who won  yeah   out of like the hundred uhm categories to choose from i only got two who won  exaj complete word is 'exaggerated' but speaker intentionally uttered 'exaj'  there weren't one hundred categories yeah there were pre-award categories   there were only fifty two fif there were only like fifty statues to to be given away they had a pre-academy awards night ceremony really yeah they did  did they   it was hosted by so they knew na who 's gonna win or not no  e wha what 's wha what 's the those were for the least popular uh oh   for the less popular categories actually  hindi i wanted it was hosted by salma hayek uh uhm what was she wearing i don't know you 're sure you don't know i don't know okay that 's that 's good  kaya nga it 's that 's why it 's a pre-awards night yes   pre- it doesn't they don't show it to everyone else yeah  you know i i didn't want tarzan to win for for the best song but then that 's the only song i knew   what did you want to win tarzan best song  what  what did you want to win uh i don't know it 's not that maybe the one tha the one by sarah mclaughlin   i think i think he deserves it really he has been nominated three times before   hey and and what 's his name i i wanted the kid from from sixth sense to win haley joel osment yes that kid he he 's yeah i think the reason why the the older guy got the award was that he was old   he was the oldest guy  he better win something it 's like it 's like a it 's like si mad and si ella and pacos okay that 's o okay lang 'yon sir it it 's uh mad and ella and pacos you know what ella said the wh why they will you know they were they gonna graduate na this term why what 's the reason because pacos is so old he he better graduate na  that 's mean   kasi stutters  that is so mean no stutters he was just kidding kasi parang 'yun pacos is what ninety-four ninety-five referring to i d number tied to first year of enrolment like really old now but he 's still here   he 's i d number ninety-five i think  you see he 's still here why i 'm gonna graduate a year from now and i 'm i d ninety-six i 'm gonna be fishi finishing my college degree in five years that 's so pathetic   uh no it 's okay 'cause you you you you were from computer science so your case is understandable why pacos pacos is from computer science exactly so we 've got to get our thesis good you know pass the first time we get it okay no problem we won't fail the thesis and uhm mr largoza told us that we should avoid having our better halves okay so wo we won't  i 'll get toks i 'll get toks akin si toks okay i 'll get joy and and you can't it 's gonna be kristel joy and dods uh i 'll look for someone else  o sig go ahead  who 's stopping you i 'm just kidding i 'm just kidding no you 're like that naman e   laughs what 's that english for ganyan ka naman e  you 're leaving for canada na that 's why okay okay let 's talk about let 's talk about something else okay break in the recording  okay now we 're gonna talk about something sensible go on louis what do you think about the clean air act what 's the clean air act okay the clean air act is i think it 's principally authored by loren legarda actually i saw the deli the deliberations on t v and it was i think five four months ago the clean air act is all about uhm removing leaded gasoline from the metropolis it 's filling out leaded gasoline and favoring unleaded gasoline instead is it isn't like unleaded is not really too good for the car uhm let 's put it this way it 's not that 's not good for the for old cars but it makes the acceleration slower but it 's cleaner than leaded fuel okay so so what do i think  well if if that 's gonna make the environment better or cleaner or or liv livable well i think yeah i 'm gonna go for it but then oh no you know what we 're gonna talk about death penalty i love that topic uh as as hard-core catholic that i am i 'm so for death penalty i am so for death penalty you know i mean i 'm not i don't even know why why these uhm like priests and and nuns are lobbying for for for uhm uhm no death penalty  hindi uhm actually   okay so okay okay what sir has been telling us it it makes a whole lot of sense which is the the bureau of prisons is called correctional corrections so they 're supposed to be correctional facilities  yeah bureau of corrections but come on  look at it this way if that was your daughter who was raped would you want the guy to be corr corrected nor rehabilitated would you want that no i wouldn't want that you want them dead a s a p i 'm sorry you 're excited no i mean think about it i mean i 'm a girl and if i was raped do i want him to be corrected i want him killed ahhh i would want to to inject that injection to him and you know watch him die i think they have to adjust the conditions wherein they will apply the death penalty i was thinking 'cause heinous crimes is is a very broad topic and they should narrow it down to specific topics further i think what they should do is that you know if if they know that this guy is a repeater repeating offender well i mean you know okay kill him but if if it 's like a first time thing and i don't know i i i no you know what i think that i take it back uh first time whatever minor or not you get killed because you you know it 's like this you you expect the the person he she has the right to live too and by doing that you took away that that privilege i think to solve this problem about the death penalty well first they have to efficiently fund the bureau of corrections yes yeah they have to hire decent psychologists psychiatrists uh uhm people who could rehabilitate these people because uhm you could can't go on without saying that these people need help they need assistance and most of the crimes committed were we were primar were primarily because of uhm uhm tsk what poor parental supervision when they were kids violence within the home or within the household no but then they there are like those kids uh like let 's say freddie webb freddie webb no the kid you know that he didn't grow up with an abusive father

Philippines	hi issa how are you i 'm fine how about you i 'm fine where did you come from well i just had lunch with lala how about you i just had my finama one course code for financial management class  wha yeah you had lunch with lala how is she she 's fine well she just got sick the other day but right now she 's feeling okay we just had lunch in aristocrat that 's good hey guys you never told me about your love story you tell me about it well our love story is kinda long if it 's is it your break right now yes it is well if you have time maybe you can listen to it yeah i have all the time in the world well so when where do you want me to start from the beginning of course well okay it all started when i was second year college it was the first week since classes start i was trying to enjoy school i thought things didn't go my way because i had to take a leave of absence since i didn't want to accumulate failed units and i couldn't coordinate my studies and my football practices friends kept me company and all i did was to have fun with them and play football i liked some girls but i always found something wrong in each of them that made me stop liking them usually because they don't meet up to my standards since i already wanted to have an inspiration and get my life fixed there 's this girl in her first year a new fresh face in school her name was lala i liked her right away but i didn't have the guts to show her we had common friends and i eventually got to be with her quite often i realized that she was easy to get along she was funny easy to talk to and of course attractive i never thought i 'd get close to her i still didn't have the guts to show her that i liked her one day during the second term it was the first day of class i saw lala in the classroom where i was enrolled i realized that i didn't need that to take that subject only to find out that i took it already there was a mistake somewhere i don't know the teacher spoke to me and asked me to drop the class but i didn't want to because i felt so lucky and happy to be with to be her classmate i decided to stay and sat behi sit behind her the class was so boring and she was all i looked at she was just smiling at me the whole time chuckles  and it lit up my day somehow she was really bored and she didn't know anyone in class so she turned to me and taught me funny songs of april boys rico rico j puno and other songs april boys yup and those days that was like the hit song yuck laughter  she made me sing with her and laugh so hard the teacher always caught our attention and we enjoyed philhis course code for philippine history from then on weeks later she asked for my seatmate 's telephone number and i said how come me you never ask my phone number she said oh yeah what 's your number then i gave it to her she called me over the weekend and i said hello she sang she sang our favorite song we used to sing in philhis which was the song by fug the fugees called fugeela then i started laughing  i didn't have to ask who it was after that i found that her friends didn't have the same break as her so i called so from then on i kept her company for lunch and that 's how it started yeah that 's how it kind of started we got closer and closer until i felt that i wanted to be with her more often she even invited me to her birthday party and i was really excited and nervous about it weren't you there yeah i think i was and i saw you yeah that that was our first uhm acquaintance if you might want to call it that way yeah but when did you start really falling for her uhm let me see  i fell i really fell for her when we started to get close to each other and we started sharing our secrets we started to know more about each other and that 's when i realized that she 's the kind of girl who i 'd love to be with and spend most of the time with and the rest of your life with probably speaker b chuckles  i don't know how about you why don't you tell me something about your boyfriend if you do you have one yes i do yeah what 's his name uh his name is thomas but you still haven't told me how you asked her how i asked lala yeah you have to tell me that well it was a saturday night before that i invited her to my friend 's birthday party which was in dasma and so we spent the whole night together and when the day end uh when the night ended excuse me before i dropped her to her car i gave her uh a goodnight kiss  where   in the in the lips of course yeah and and she she made you kiss her   yeah it was more of a friendly smack in that that night then after uh  so i felt that night wasn't complete without saying what i felt for her oh my god  chuckles and then after i called when she got home i called her up and eventually i told her that i loved her and she 's   and what did she say she said yeah me too but then that love was more like i love you as a friend something like that so now that i got to say how i felt it made me feel better then the next day we talked about it and then after we kinda exchanged thoughts about each other  and i don't know  love took its course from then on wow what a very inspiring story thank you issa how about you can you tell me something about your boyfriend about tommy yeah what 's his real name uhm thomas skiden   oh   well he 's swedish that 's why he has that family name i see uhm how did you meet tommy well tommy and i we met at a friend 's party at the hard rock cafe laughter last august of nineteen ninety-six yeah i 'm always there oh yeah how come i didn't see you that night probably because i was out with my lala wow laughter  anyway i didn't really expect to meet someone like him  yeah   'cause that time my my mind was pretty oc preoccupied it was i was thinking about someone else and that time uhm we weren't really in good terms really and so when i met him i just decided what the heck just talk to him and entertain him the whole night since it was my friend 's party anyway yeah  and we started talking and then we found that we had so much things in common and then he asked me to dance and so i danced with him yeah you danced  and   what song  i remember we danced to let 's groove by earth wind and fire  oh  i like that song yeah it it 's a cool song yeah and after that night it became one of our songs for each other 'cause it 's so memorable  cool so that night  so that that was a night to remember oh yeah you bet it if it weren't for that night we wouldn't have met oh so after that night uhm he asked he started calling me up 'cause he asked for my number from my friend yeah and so of course i gave it 'cause i kinda liked him in a way in a friendly way or in a friendly way because he was such a sweet person and then before i knew it he started court not not courting but showing signs of liking me already but at that time i liked someone else  yeah  really yes i think he 's your i think he 's your friend laughter  uh what 's his name  tonio chuckle   tonio yeah he 's my friend he plays football with me yeah uh i know that chuckles  anyway so what happened between you and tonio before you and tommy uhm tonio and i were have been friends for two years two years that 's too long   and during that time we knew that we liked each other but nothing happened oh really and that frustrated me because i thought he liked me and if he had liked me then he would have but i think he   started calling me up already but i think he really liked you then yeah but then he didn't show signs  he was just he was just too shy probably yeah anyway anyway back to your story yeah uhm when i started getting to know tommy better i started thinking to myself why not give him a chance and drop tonio  exactly yeah that was what i did last was that a difficult decision it was one of the most difficult decisions in my life but it was the best that i 've made so far so it was a blessing yes it was a blessing in disguise i met uh we started talking we started really talking to each other last october of nineteen ninety-six and then uhm which means we 'd start going out he 'd asked me out on dates he 'd call me up every day then if wow he 's so sweet yeah he 's very sweet and if i couldn't go out on a weekend he would insist that he 'd see me so he 'd tell me he 'd ask me if i if he could visit me at home he really showed his emotions for you yes like he was very open about it he wasn't shy there is no pride in him like he he fully expressed his likeness for me yeah and i and i and i ful and i accepted it 'cause i like the feeling that it was giving me i 'd have butterflies in my stomach it made you feel like a girl well i am a girl chuckles  well yeah it made he made me feel like a lady like a woman there and then uhm he asked me december twenty of he asked me last december twenty-one nineteen ninety-six yeah i remember that day i 'll never forget that day that he asked me  and it was such a shock because it was fast  so that was your like  he would he was just calling me up for barely two months yeah and he asked me already that night no way yeah and that so were you shocked i was shocked i surprised yes i was so surprised speechless very speechless because i didn't i didn't love him yet that time i just liked him a lot yeah but he told me already that he loved me so what i did was that i just took the chance risked it i risked i risked it yeah i mean i won't it 's not as if i 'm gonna end up marrying him anyway and i was young then so might as well yeah and then so i answered him yes wow and ever since that night i i i 've become the happiest girl here you know like in the world yeah 'cause he 'd always be so nice to me   so it all paid off eventually oh yeah it it all paid off but there 's one big problem pete what 's that issa uhm right now we 're hav it 's a long distance relationship that we 're having don't tell me he 's in sweden no he 's in san francisco no way so how does that work well he calls me up thrice a week and he comes here every break time
Philippines	"you too what have you been doing uh i 've been busy reviewing for dr isagani 's oral exam and i 'm glad it 's over yes i 'm glad it 's over too  so and what were your feelings earlier before uh there our names were called before the exam i was really nervous and i couldn't breathe and i had my notes in at hand and i i i don't think i was really prepared for that my mind was just in scramble so   did you wake up early for for this for today  yeah  what time did you wake up six a m six a m i woke up at five thirty six a m and then i was here eight sharp i was looking for the cla i was lost this morning so was i i was lost i was lost i was looking for the classroom and then i saw lisa and then we saw another classmate and then she said oh it 's at william hall uh uhm second floor yeah i had the misconception that it was gonna be held in our classroom that 's why i went there i was running after marianne  that 's what i thought  and then when i went up there where is marianne she 's gone and so i figured this must be the wrong room so i went downstairs again and proceeded to the office of dr cruz and i saw him uh drinking water fountain asked him where the exam is gonna be held so what was your question uh the question was what number did you get i think it 's number two number two asking me about the best module how about you number three the best teacher oh it 's sort of related so who did you choose as best teacher actually uhm marianne marianne word  and how long did it take you to you know uhm i tried to talk so that i could consume my five minutes so tha i i didn't want them to ask me any follow-up question but then uhm the examiner had the chance to ask me a question which wasn't related to the original question that i got so i was really nervous but after that it was a relief yeah it 's a relief i also thought that i was able to consume the five minutes but i was wrong i guess they don't know how to count counting it backwards i suppose i think i only finished uh i i finished my explanation in uh two and a half minutes  hindi kasi you speak very fast very very fast and so when i when i was done and i was looking at the what do you call this what the dr isagani cruz was looking at and i figured that well i still have about three minutes two minutes four minutes and so they were able to ask me several questions two to three questions and he was even thinking what to ask me i was lucky because the examiner only had two questions was it difficult what was the exact question it it 's difficult because i don't think it 's related to the question that i got the the follow-up question was how was i gonna teach the same subject to a second year biology class so uh uhm it 's really difficult because i haven't really thought about that and we were talking earlier that uh marianne i and purita were talking that it 's better to have the examination really really early in the morning so that he 's still out of sync which he does  uh uhm  yeah he doesn't know what to ask yeah since she 's feeling her way so we figured we would have a very very uh good advantage   because i when i when it was my turn she was already getting the hang of it so that 's why definitely first she was just observing you know   uhm  trying to ask careful questions and all that and i made the explanation very very long that same question that she asked me i made it very very long but still unfortunately it wasn't long enough because dr cruz still asked me another question uh uhm out of this world i don't remember now what he asked me anyway don't you remember just to change the topic i don't wanna talk about it anymore chuckle  it was really it really gives me a funny feeling when i think about it the oral exam what are you gonna do this summer this summer i 'm still gonna teach teach yeah i have a teaching load this summer how about you uh uh uhm what am i gonna do divulge uhm i 'm going to hong kong with my boyfriend we 're going to visit my father and my sisters so i leave uhm before the fifteenth  my sister who 's twelve years old na she 's going to be baptized on the twenty-second so and it 's my father 's birthday on the twenty-seventh too good for you at least you 're gonna have a vacation i have had such a long vacation because i haven't worked since i graduated really how long has it been march ninety-nine since march ninety-nine march ninety-nine so it 's been a year 'cause after graduation i went to hong kong my my father didn't really think that i should get an m a it was already june when he decided uh maybe you should get an m a uh uhm so i went back for the second term and when i got back i didn't really think of working first because i was you know i tend to study again   i see   you 've been bumming around for a year huh  enjoying yourself   not exactly because when i came here it was really uhm a time for coping because back in college it was really spoon-feeding  uh uhm  yes very different here i have to agree so and then last month i started applying and i i passed the examinations at the bank of commerce for corporate communications i 'm still set for a final interview but i don't think i 'm gonna go for it  i don't  i just wanted to experience because i 'm studying because i wanna teach  so why should i i was thinking if i 'd get a summer job but then i didn't know that i was going to leave for hong kong okay  why not   uh uhm  how long would you be staying in hong kong just for a month because i 'm going to enroll for the first term oh yeah first term would be uh what about you how 's teaching how 's teaching oh boy what are your students like my students uh most of them come from public schools uh uhm but i prefer that i teach at s t i people keep on asking me why why why why not you know teach in a better school  uh uhm   yeah  yeah the question is you know uh why is it that the good teachers always end up in good universities i mean we have already so many good teachers in for example in this university uh uhm i don't think i 'm needed here anymore unlike in the schools there   why not  unlike for example at the s t i the students really need good teachers there because they don't have a good background uh especially pag public schools chances are all of the subject matters not even spoon-feeding nothing they know nothing when they come in grammar is zero zero not only zero  and i pity them  uh uhm   uh uhm  i agree and their confidence level is really low   very very low but they 're nicer  they 're nicer because because of the confidence level when i uh when when we 're with our uhm what do you call this uh the students there in mr cruz 's class dr cruz 's class the the undergrads there compared to the undergrads at s t i word   yeah they are   uh uhm i can't even uh what do you call this iv short for a 's name i can't even fathom how these particular students from s t i were able to graduate from high school in the first place but they 're very very eager to learn compared to the students here who are a little bit you know smart-ass   uh uhm  yeah which is a good sign  that 's a good sign that they are going to to learn more because they 're eager to learn uh uhm they 're eager to learn how about you where do you plan to teach if ever uhm i have an application in a college in lucena city and in a university i plan to teach part-time because i 'm studying right so i haven't gone back there yet but they said that i can start in june  uh uhm  are you gonna teach what subjects english mostly and literature literature both uh uhm so how many units do you think you 'll be taking on i don't know i haven't really thought about that i haven't talked to them again  i have to go there   but you 're really uh what do you call this eager to teach na this june uh i don't know what do you think do you think i 'd make a good teacher of course i mean words enroll   i haven 'cause i haven't taught before you know even the presentation last saturday i haven't really done that before so i was really nervous now you can say that you 've already done it there 's a first time for everything yeah but that still doesn't uhm make a qualification for me to become a teacher i guess uh what do you call this with the way you or okay let me put it this way uhm do you think i have the potential to teach uh-huh of course because i am when i was in college i didn't really think that i was going to be a teacher someday but i think my father wanted me to to become one because my grandmother was a teacher now i wanna throw back the question right back at you what do you think do you have what it takes to become a good teacher to to become a good teacher i uh i think it 's too early to tell for me 'cause i 'm still in the uh what do you call this i 'm still trying to get a feel  i 'm not there yet you 're not there yet yeah how did it feel 'no the first time last week when you presented i was really nervous and i think uh 'cause lisa told me you know you should smile because you were too serious when you presented your demo i guess so that was caused by my my my my nervousness uh uhm you see i 'm still fumbling now when i talk talk about it ano uhm that 's it i think i get really nervous that 's it  well my experience uhm first semester of teaching i was like this uh very uh strict hitler type of a teacher i shouted at everybody i was uh i was always uh demanding them to do more than they should uh uhm i guess first timers for me ha first timers are stricter so to speak but you know as you go along the way you discover things we have to learn along the way it 's just like when you have your first class in the morning and you still don't know what to do but then eventually as the day progresses nine ten o'clock you can become better and better and better eventually at the one o'clock class perfect the lesson plan is perfect  uh uhm   uh uhm  i guess it 's something like that you just have to develop a stronger  it depends on the students that you 're gonna be having if like the students that i have right now it 's very very easy but if the students are like the students here it 's gonna be a little bit more difficult  uh uhm  yeah of course their expectations are difficult uh uh different from rather from uh uh those higher yeah definitely   in our classmates are very very   i remember remember when they criticized the the one the uhm who demoed word ""demo"" was used as a verb uh who had a demo with us   manny especially manny yeah manny i guess they just didn't like him i suppose i don't know i think that 's unfair"
Philippines	what do you think can we discuss about our presidentiables what do you think someone speaks in tagalog  can you suggest   wala akong alam do'n e  don't you know about those people glitch in recording one of those presidentiables i know some of them uh you know some of them how about you pam i know some of them uh you know some of them but in my case uh i only know some but among them are pimentel estrada enrile defensor and maybe cory herself and recording interruption  uh then these people maybe they have their own they have their own intentions to run for candidacy for this this this coming nineteen ninety-two elections   what do you think  but  but i don't think uh they will be a good president okay how about you how about you pam do you think that all of or each one of them will become a good leader something like that there is a possibility but uh we are used to it that traditional politicians are doing the same things uh uhm uh these are these are the trapos traditional politicians  well anyway in my ca in my own in my opinion i would say that uh i might be the same with what you think that there is no one of them who is capable of running for presidency because almost everyone of them has been proven to be corrupt to be something like that to be they 're just using people to be their instruments that when they uhm when the election has already lapsed they don't think they don't even mind they don't even mind us anymore we voters they just think they just think about themselves and then once   for their own benefit yes that 's true and then once they are already in their position they don't even mind us what is our what are our needs and they don't even ask us right it 's the same scenario  so it 's better to change the ano  yes but in my case you know what is important there is i think this election of year nineteen ninety-two is still premature in the first place we do not know yet these people who they who really they are and then what is my point there is the first ones to change first their attitudes are those who are there in the official uh there i mean in the government positions because uhm like for instance no matter if we keep on electing officials we keep on choosing from them but if they don't know what is basic what are the basic functions which are inherent to them i think it 's it 's useless right it will be useless  how about estrada what do you think about estrada  estrada is he good laughter  can you consider estrada as a good pre president he was proven to be a good mayor but i don't think if he can be a good president  uh uhm wel  uh-huh well that 's also my opinion as a matter of fact even his educational attainment yes he has not he has not finished yet his college as a matter of fact he is a drop-out from uhm m i t mapua institute of technology and i don't believe i don't have the nerve to think that he can be a good president  he can be he can be the same also but i mean he can be the same with the other pres uh past presidents but maybe in some other aspects in some other walks of life he can be different from those past past presidents how about defensor miriam defensor oh yeah defensor you know i like this miriam defensor-santiago because aside from uh aside from being good in his uh position because when he was when she became the c i d commission on immigration and deportation commissioner he did uh he did his uh he did his her uh he did her best when she was in the when she was c i d commissioner and then when she became   and not only that when she was a judge yeah she when she became the judge judge she was the one giving uh death penalty oh yeah and then how about  salonga salonga yes salonga pimentel ay  they are traditional politicians yes they are traditional politicians and i think they can they will just do the same with what they have done in the past as a matter of fact when they do it they don't these are the people who do not uh give any importance just imagine this treaty uh the treaty which has just been concluded last oo  the treaty of friendship  oo the treaty of friendship security and cooperation  you know the point is this this is it is it was very untimely for the senate to kill that treaty in the senate  why because we don't have yet uh enough capital we don't have yet enough money to build or or to build and to stand on our own feet yes own feet yes as a matter of fact uh it was there that according to the senators who have rejected this uh treaty that uh we can stand we can now stand and we can be very independent yes anyway we are independent you know the point is uhm we are not independent from our own fi from our own uh from our own race   from our own country  yes from our own country but we are already independent from the other countries we we are no longer administered we are no longer we are no longer manipulated or whatever it is it is us because they themselves are uhm uh i mean they themselves are doing it that they are being manipulated by those people they are the ones that they are making that filipinos are being manipulated but they are the ones being instrumented isn't it in fairness to uh the senators the twelve senators uh uhm uh what they are fighting for here is that uh the the content of the treaty is not clear  uh uhm  uh uhm and the the figure the figure over the payment you know it is not clearly stated in the treaty that is one of the thing that they are fighting for of not uh of not do of not uh what what do you call this uh of not signing this treaty yes have not signed have not approved it   yeah  uhm but somehow it uh it would help us if they approve the treaty yes i do believe also if they if they have approved this treaty just for a while but there 's if they have given it at least ten years or at least less than ten years or ten years  at least ten years   uh  ten years yes it would be a good it would be a great help to the filipino people   filipino yes  because   especially the ano the mount pinatubo victims  yeah  because when this mount pinatubo erupted there were a lot of people who were affected isn't it the buildings and even the sub uh the clark airbase and this clark airbase is severely affected by mount pinatubo uh uhm and that is why because this has been uh the that base was destroyed so we don't have the money to uh to to renovate that that building because well why oh oh i mean where are we going to get the amount where are we going to get the money to pay for the renovation of these buildings or of these buildings so if these if these buildings will be converted for us to be our uh i mean part of our philippine uh philippine what is that philippine properties something like that so i think it is something that we can uh but i want to ask you yes how about if if we sign a treaty the twelve senators if they signed a treaty for another ten years do you think after ten years uh we can we can uh we can what do you call that we can cut the treaty or we no longer have the treaty from the americans do you think we we can stand already after the ten years oh after giving them the chance the ten years it would be of the same case because if we cannot stand if we cannot stand after ten years if we are not sure if we are not certain with ourselves that after ten years we do not know if we can stand on our own feet how much more now yes 'no  the fact that if we would be given uh the americans would be given another ten years  they are less   1 word by the filipinos if ever they if ever the senate approves it and the ano and another problem is ano 'yong underemployment  but  yeah there would be a lot of unemployment yes there would be a lot of things that might be affected the economic stability not only the political stability but at the same time our social uh yes our employment our and many other things okay let 's let 's point uh let 's focus on employment there are more than almost two hundred thousand to two hundred thousand to five hundred thousands who are already unemployed because of that because of that uhm because of that rejection and because of the mount pinatubo eruption and then don't you don't you know that don't you hear that that some of the electronic companies nowadays are now are now i mean are now slowly declining it declines now because some of the electronics companies now are now starting retre uh i mean terminate or not exactly terminating but they they have now the retrenchment they retrench these people who are employed because according to them they are at great loss  yes  they they lose they lose uhm lots of uhm products and these products are coming from u s and i believe that these products are be are are are being supported to us by the u s economy and it will also affect the ano foreign investors but for me 'no uh but for me the thing is the i think uh the thing is when when we will be when we will be going to stand on our own feet and try to uh try to build our own you know our own economy like that perhaps if we if we if we depend too much to them well that is also true that how can we build our own ano our own independence well anyway the sense is the point is we already we are already independent we already have it but it is it is the manner of administration  actually i do not i do not con yes i do not condemn those twelve senators  yes the administration   the leaders  i do not condemn with i do not condemn them in fact i am very proud of them because at least they have the pride they have their pride of nationalism patriotism and loyalty to the philippine or loyalty to the country to the nation   do you believe that it is a nationalism or patriotism or it is just a self-interest maybe i uh because as we all know that they are politicians and politicians are good in that they really they can really make everything what they want both of them might have their personal interest  yeah  as a matter of fact when the edsa revolution happened everyone every politician there had his own like enrile yes enrile had that personal interest when he uh went to edsa revolution and i don't believe that they could uhm make it possible everything what we hear now what do you think uh what should we do after the rejection of the treaty so i think uh everything depends on our government and then well it will depend to them you know it that the government is just making us uhm we are being enchained we are being en we are being enslaved by them because everything what they want they implement it without even consulting us especially these senators especially these people who are who are voted who are elected in their respective positions
Philippines	hi patneb by the way what are your plans for this summer i don't know yet but i 'm really planning to go to a beach and go swimming or go to tagaytay or baguio anywhere cold as long as i can go out on a picnic and i 'm also thinking of going and getting a summer job well that 's a great idea yeah because i need extra cash because my mom won't give me any allowance this summer so i need to earn money to be able to go out how about you what are your plans well as of now i have plenty of plans laughs  i want to go to baguio i want to go to boracay i want to go to palawan and i want to go to bacolod but definitely i 'm going to bacolod maybe in the second week of april of course i miss my hometown hometown already yeah and who will you go with well my brother can't go home because he has practices i don't know but he has to practice for his football you know football games this summer  varsity  well maybe i 'm goin going home alone wow that 's exciting are you gonna ride an airplane alone i experienced that for many times already well if you 're from bacolod you have to face the reality that you 're going to ride a plane just by yourself really i 've never i 've never ridden a plane alone ooohhh promise i haven't really   you must try you must try it i 'm scared yeah it 's really scary at first but after you 'll get used to it well you got a point but if you 're going to boracay can i come with you sure any time but i 'm not yet sure but my cousins want to go to boracay so i wanna go also because it 's been how many years that i 've i 've been there so i just want to go back there again and well enjoy the beach the white sand and the clear water at least you 've been there i 've never been there before i 've just heard stories about it and then and then i wanna see it for myself and see if it 's really a good beach but i think it is  oo  i pity you well you have to go yeah so if if ever you 're planning to go there this summer   yeah i 'll call you i 'll call you tell me please yeah i 'll call you how about palawan yeah but yeah i want to go to palawan too because they say the view there is spectacular but i 'm scared of the malaria  stutter are there is i don't know outbreak there 's a malaria outbreak i think somewhere there an and i don't wanna have a malaria i i just came out from a german measles and then i 'm gonna have malaria isn't that too much sickness in one year   but i believe the beaches in palawan are better than boracay yeah but they 're cleaner they 're cleaner the water cleaner clearer and everything but but at least in boracay it 's really a resort   civilized  yeah the service sort type of island unlike in palawan it 's more of a forest and jungle type actually boracay it 's it 's like a city in a beach that 's the setting it 's like a city in a beach and then there 's night life also yeah there is yeah oh god  stutter better in boracay   night life in boracay is very fun yeah and even more foreigners   and there is even golf courses imagine there 's even golf courses in the beach   and we could meet foreigners laughs   ay no laughs  how about uh what was your most memorable vacation me well i guess my most memorable vacation was when the first time i went to the states with my family i think i was around ten years old yeah i really enjoyed disneyland magic mountain knottsberry farm and all those amusement parks uh yeah i remember uh i went to i went to lake tahoe and that was the first time i touched the snow wow it was so fantastic i envy you i 've never seen snow and i 've never been to the states well i guess your time will come just wait for it yeah well at least my sister went there and my mom and my dad except me and my brother why don't you go with them no it was in different occasions i mean my mom went there alone for the wedding of her sister my dad went there on business trip my sister went there alone for her birthday gift in her eighteenth birthday gift  uh   that 's why  why don't you convince your parents to give you the money and uh we don't have the money laughs  as of now yeah as of now maybe if i 'm wor if i after i graduate when i 'm working already and i 'm earning my own money i 'll probably visit the states  ye  yeah break in recording  how about you what 's your most memorable vacation well i guess my most memorable vacation was when i was in third year high school and we went home to our province in romblon  i was with my titas and titos but they 're almost the same age in their in their early twenties during that time so they 're more of the teenager touch but not really they 're like the yuppies and then we went to our house in front in the house in front of the beach wow it was beautiful   and it 's like our sort of private beach because there 's nobody there just us and our house is isolated it 's it it 's in it 's it 's surrounded by forests and was it the first time that you went there no i went there when i was still little e but   but  it was the most memorable because we had fun we were we were swimming we were joking around we sleep in a hut be instead of the house we 'd sleep in the hut because we 'd tell scary stories at night before we go to sleep and then in the morning we eat pandesal and milo  hay those were the days yeah so sad to hear but but i guess you can do it again you can experience it again yeah it 's been a long time since i went back to the province  but if  but you know what if you 're going to think of it philippines is a lot of great places uh better than the oth better than going out yeah the better than abroad we 've got better beaches i think and better uh vacation spots  beach   yeah  but you know the problem is they 're so expensive yeah it 's it 's as expensive as going to the states almost as expensive as going to the states   yeah the rates are really expensive uhm it 's better if you 'll go to hong kong instead of going to palawan it 's more cheaper and that 's chea that 's a reality i 'm not joking yeah i know but well no not all of us get the chance to to visit every island in the philippines every tourist spot in the philippines so i guess it 's just someone 's luck to go everywhere around the philippines how about you pam i believe the you know what i believe they must give special rates for filipinos yeah don't you think   like discount yeah discounted rates yeah because this is our country we should have been enjoyi i mean like what they 're saying we should first visit or get around our country than plan on going out abroad because the philippines has better places to visit this week this summer time and i guess it ju the problem with the philippines is that most of the filipinos still loves to go out yeah they prefer to go abroad than stay in this country not knowing that we have better places like in batangas there are many beaches which are better than those in the states like my uncle who 's an american himself didn't like a beach in north carolina i guess and he doesn't want he 's not sure of visiting the philippines because he 's not su he doesn't want to see i mean he wants to see a beach that is very nice not like the one he saw in the states and to think he 's already an american and he 's doubting the philippines i told my tita that she shou she should bring her husband to boracay or to bat at least either in e even in batangas 'cause our beaches are far better than in the states and look at it hollywood stars are going to amanpulo  imagine going to our own beach hollywood stars  yeah  yeah they 're not contented with their own and we filipino are not contented of what we have yeah  we prefer to go to the states to europe  of what we have yeah  i guess it 's part of our mental mentality yeah so   so we want to be like others like the foreigners we we think that it 's more prestigious or something i guess it 's uh it 's the effect of our colonial mentality yeah you can say it words  it 's really sad hey how will we by the way will we how will we do our solicitations for esa european studies association this summer well i guess we have to meet first with the esa with the other esa officials and after that we should arrange the sponsorsh sponsorships packages and i guess after that we can go around manila to get sponsors well that 's a good idea you know i really want the euro-tour to push through next summer i really want to go to europe it 's really educational my mom even told me that if i let 's say if i 'll go to to europe i should go with my friends not with my family yeah you 'll enjoy it more yeah and it 's more exciting if you 'll go with your friends and and besides we 're studying it so it means we 'll get a a glimpse of what we 're studying of what we 're talking about in the classroom not just imagining in our minds what what does this place look like at least we can get first-hand info or first-hand picture of what we can really feel the ambiance of europe   yeah and when we when we go back to school in june it would be really exciting 'cause we could share stuffs that we we learned from our tour yeah i hope we can go i really hope that 's why we have to work hard yeah to get sponsors yeah we have to we have to get a lot of sponsors from rich companies yeah so they could support us when we go on tour what which countries do you want to go to when we go on the euro-tour well i guess i want to go to paris the usual things in france i want to go to paris france uhm greece also i like to go to greece spain yeah spain yeah you 're studying spanish you should want to go to spain and wanna practice our language   and i think we can apply our spanish language  yeah  even though we 're not that fluent but at least we 'll get  yeah  we know something i mean we know the basics yeah that 's good how about germany you wanna go to germany oh my dad said germany is also a great place yeah i wanna i wanna see those old castles but you know and look at them kasi it was really my dream while when i was a little kid to see a castle and act like a princess and everything but you know in europe everywhere there 's castles   there 's castles yeah i know how about belgium you wanna go to belgium uhm i not that much but i prefer going to paris and the places i mentioned yeah me i want to go to belgium because my aunt is there she 's a nun she 's a missionary nun so why don't you tell her we 'll visit yeah actually she 's been waiting for it i i told her about it even be way before when we were still freshmen

 not clean it 's ammonia and something else  yeah  yeah salt
Philippines	hi uhm you still remember the topic we discussed last time  on   about why bad things happen to good people   good people  i read about this article concerning the quo the oft-quoted statement nice guys finish last  do you agree to this nice guys finish last yes which means that that if you 're good you finish last you die last  chuckles not necessarily what what i 'm trying to say is you don't get the goods you don't deliver the bacon so to speak because you 're good  i think so  which in the opposite what hap what happens to bad people of course we can say that uhm because of okay we cannot say that we can attribute the luck or the fortunes of a person to his being good  would you agree with that i don't know meaning uh because you 're good then fate would be good to you good to you be kind to you  so that 's why uh just like the jews uh during the time of moses perhaps they often asked the question why didn't god honor us by giving us the wind  uh uhm why were why why did god allow them to go through several trials several trials persecutions uh sufferings why  hindi i think according to that article article to strengthen their faith so you mea meaning god has to test them i think so god has to put you to test to just to test whe uh okay just to know to determine whether you are for him or not  determine  i think so tha that 's love you call that love yes  would you not want to be put to a test would you not want the other person your loved one to be put into test before you could call it that feeling love perhaps that would be alright if the relationship is between two human beings a man or a woman or a man and a woman between a man and a woman but not between god and man but definitely there is a big disparity between the creator and his creation and and i i could also assume that there is also a disparity between the love that they both feel then i could also say that that 's a different love in the first place yes which cannot be compared to or equated to the love that a woman feels for a man   what i 'm trying to drive at is that uh a hit would not be fair to require a man uh yes a man uh having an infinite love for god when god is capable of feeling an infinite love for his creation but because because of what man experiences what man suffers or the sufferings that man uhm uhm experiences the sufferings he goes through the supper sufferings persecutions   same with any relationship it 's the same with any relationship right  it can be equated with a relationship between a man and a woman and a relationship with god in a sense that both relationships experience trials sufferings both relationships but you okay but would you agree with me that god knows everything yes of course okay because of this capacity of god knowing everything of of course corollary to that is the power of god to of the power of god of of uh doing anything because it carries along with it the power to do anything right the power of knowing carries along with it the power of doing because of his being god  so  so okay would you agree with me with that premise  he 's capable of doing anything yes okay  because of that power then why still allow why would god still allow what happens to free will   to the creation to the to his creation because he loves ve very much his creation like man why would he still allow man to suffer to suffer why test when you know for a fact that man is weak because of the inherent weakness of man okay the argument would be then you tell god god why why does okay your argument would be because of free will god granted us free will to choose between right or wrong   and wrong  yes but why still allow that to happen when you can very well direct man your creation because of your infinite love for your creation to do everything good it 's a test it 's a trial why test why allow that because of your goodness right god why not god loves us and god  okay  are you claiming that anyone who is good should not be put into test i think so why not why like for example in your case if say you have a friend you very well know or you have all the capacity ability to uh guide him guide him and uh make him do things which are good uh uhm would you still test him to do things  yes  yes to determine whether he has learned or not learned what he knows very well the difference between good and bad   no but you said i am directing him so this person is a human being he has the cap the the tendencies to commit mistakes  okay  what 's the purpose  what is the purpose of testing him  to  just to determine his loyalty the extent of his loyalty   no whether he has learned or not you know mistakes make us strong mistakes bring us closer to god yeah that 's why my my question here my question here is the relationship between man and god correct why would still god allow man to be tested or why would he test man my question is why not why not put him to test that 's that 's god 's love for a man no because if if the love i feel if the love that i think god feels for man is so what how would i describe it so infinite so infinite okay infinite so pure there is no condition whatsoever because of his love for man right  because that is man is his creation okay he would not want definitely he would not want man to perish to commit to commit any sin right okay but why still allow man to do bad things to transgress to to sin why not just  yes   that 's his choice   why not just remove sin why not just remove sin and let man do good things okay to answer that quest question if you cannot commit a mistake how will you know right from wrong okay if you cannot make a sin how will you know that you haven't committed one so you mean to tell me uh what presupposes goodness is badness yes i think so   what presupposes uhm good or being kind being good being beautiful is or are other other people 's or your   be the opposite  yes other people 's or your   uh so you mean to tell me that goodness cannot possibly exist without sin without badness yes because you won't be able to determine one is that so how will you know that this is correct  uh-huh   uh because you have a basis for such because the other one is wrong then this must be right uh uhm right how will you know that you have committed a sin uh because i have done a good deed okay that 's why i knew so what do you think is the opposite of god the opposite of god is the devil i think so okay so uhm what presupposes god is a devil there would be no god if there is no devil you mean to tell me we would not we cannot appreciate god because there is no devil or we appreciate god because there is a devil i think so oh really i think so uh uhm  so so the   you know that god existed because he kept you away from sin  but my question is uh did god already or is al is god already in existence even prior to sin yes or did they exist simultaneously no god existed prior to sin prior to sin and sin was a product of what man 's transgression i think so because of god 's uh granting man free will yes because of that grant of free will what was born was sin yes okay look uh when adam and eve were left at the garden of eden they knew that what they 're doing are all correct uh uhm until such time that that evil entered into their minds it was introduced to them right okay and then that 's why they were able to determine that what they did was wrong oh but god could have prevented uh could have prevented them from committing wrong   yes yes   in fact he prevented them no he tried he tried to prevent but he still allowed he allowed sin to creep into and attract or test   he didn't try  he prevented them remember he said uh you can you are free to eat precisely because of that free will that was free will in itself yes but then the evil was so   he could have destroyed beforehand that the the tree but he didn't allow it why because he wanted man to realize that okay you want to do what you want then bear with it then suffer   uh uhm  uh uhm i have given you enough for you to be able to determine what is right and what is wrong you mean to tell me that uh god was trying to teach adam and eve they he was trying to teach them adam and eve uh his ex his existence by allowing them to choose between him between between god and this what you call this the the devil  wait   no it 's a choice  it 's a choice uhm being able to determine because in their case they know that everything is happy everything is given free un but they realized that after they have eaten or committed the sin and then they were able to determine what is right from wrong the same with us we 're given free will we 're given two choices all the time there is no neutral just positive or negative but what i 'm trying to drive at is why did he still allow evil to exist i cannot answer   he could have just destroyed evil  i cannot answer his existence  he could have destroyed  no why he could have destroyed he could have removed the idea of sin then what will happen to you  what will happen to you  that 's it  how will you know that you haven't sinned then what will happen because there is no sin   what will you long for what will you ask for nothing nothing yes because there is no sin then you will never everything is good then you will never improve uh okay so the you will never prosper the improvement or development or growth comes with an error uh i see okay right okay you try this this is the first test okay it doesn't fit with what you want with the hypothesis   okay  then you commit ano then you try another then you commit another mistake okay okay that 's it then you become a better person with the mistakes that you have committed  you become better because of because of sins because of transgressions because of your mistakes i think so which is better uh a person who has never committed any mistake that 's a lie there is no person who has never sinned okay then you can't give me that example you know that it 's not better okay there is no comparison   let us assume this person has committed how many sins let us just assume during his entire lifetime he committed what say let 's quantify that in specific terms he committed one thousand sins uh uhm okay you mean to tell me okay that this okay another person perhaps   committed  has committed in his entire lifetime he committed one hundred two thousand sins the first person is one thousand so the first person one thousand so comparing that to the other person who has committed who committed two thousand sins okay question so has he committed the same mistake or mistakes uh i would not know

did you see carlos agassi crying  what about it  yeah i saw carlos crying what did you think about his acting he 's so like a boy chuckles   chuckles like a boy you know the problem with him is that he really can't act that 's why the tabloid says uhm that he 's like a rapper when he acts and that 's one big criticism against him i think that 's his field you know to sing to rap but not to   not to act yeah and then they found out that onemig is a best friend of his  and then the reports are saying that he 's going to be replaced by onemig he 's going to be killed in the episode and that 's why i think he 's so pissed about that because he didn't  wha what episode uhm the episode he 's got uh sa dulo ng walang hanggang you know this uh with with uh with claudine barretto   barretto oo with barretto and i think it will be uh it would make a great impact on his finances if he stops in that show you know how much naman they earn yeah sure but why did he cry in the first place well i don't know the problem is there was a question of onemig replacing him but then when boy abunda started questioning him the conversation centered on his past uh yeah i remember about his father the iranian father yeah who used to beat him up daw quote unquote and then he even showed his scar laughs and then the conversation   scar where on his face uh yeah  o di ba on his cheek  oo  and then he he was saying like uh he grew up with the maid and it was an accident but then he wants his father to recognize his abilities and and and the sad the funny thing about it is because the show uh the the interview started with boy abunda asking him so how are you now how are you now chuckles   words he 's ready to cry my god you can see the tears at the corner of his eyes but the one thing that i like in the buzz you know the last time i saw the buzz  what what was that when boy abunda was interviewing pops fernandez uh yeah yeah that was that was nice two two sat two sundays ago yeah when whe when pops fernandez cried yeah i with that interview that was the first time that i empathized sympathized with uh pops yeah because before when he when she ans when she is interviewed i hate her why i uh i cannot see sincerity in her   uh is that right okay   but during that interview with boy abunda the last time just recently i saw that he she was sincere i can understand her now
Philippines	my name is grandmasta sleek a disc jockey name and uhm my real name is adrian i am this is o d b and my real name is jem and who is this guy la salle school okay so anyways uh g m s uh what what do you have in mind for uh tomorrow evening well it depends o d b it 's like uhm well you got you already you got already the music the rap the free rap for the jingle i had the lyrics i think that uh spoon will take care of uh the background i think he has an idea already what background music will fit the lyrics i wrote for the song so probably you know it 's for the big things that we have to do right but i suggest we should just really 1 word tonight if you have any thesi drag on papers and uh more organized when we when we wake up tomorrow something like that  what i think you know uhm laughs there 's this uh radio ad radio ad though it 's in word  yeah and what they did was uhm there 's this song for for for that you know for that commercial and then what they do is uh sample not really a sample but uh they sang the full song but they included a rap thing words  what do you think  you know i 'm open to anything you know me i 'm a team player i i i just think i i think that we all agree that we 'll have to expand and have more jingles played uh word is calling me about single jingle they ask me about the different styles of jingles and due to circumstances right now because there 's a trend we can't get it done but i 'm looking forward to tomorrow evening hopefully we 'll get our work done and uh you know well i just just get it done tomorrow oh but you know i it just so happened that i know this person in texas  he said that uh the jingle sucks but the d js encourage it  well you know good observation i just wonder who this person is  i mean if he is like a media mogul i might respect what he has to say but if he is a regular person is you know whatever you know you can't please everybody we have you know maybe there 's one person saying this i can't see it negative i mean they accur we 're amateurs uh you know and stuff like that but uh for the one we for the one we uh get negative feedback we have but ten maybe more positive feedback you know so that 's all but you can't please everybody you know i mean hey that 's the way it is right uh you know  hey what can you do you know exactly you can't please them all can you it 's true but then uhm what what we need to do probably is uh is like this probably we could choose to jingle in such a way that this uh studio studio type of the jingle and uh wha i well actually my friend 's gonna do is like uh he 'll make up the jingle again and he 'll uh transcribe really transcribe and then he 'll put it you know in a in a winzip rap with zip rap and then track by track i think he 'll be recording them he 'll be transferring them and uh into the studio on wednesday like midnight and do it he 'll do the rap words and it 's free yeah you know uh it 's a sign to uh really get going i mean there are there are listeners out there who like the station and it 's true we have to sort of become more you know presentable right not just blah you know what i mean i think that 's enough that 's an excuse already you know we don't have the time and maybe lack maybe lack of uh financial resources but uhm we have if we 've had time to really uhm to start uhm creating uhm let 's say a word jingle or or whatever to make it seem more like a viable or a real uhm radio station you know i understand you know that you know that we could use comments or criticisms i oh you know what that 'll only make us stronger you know no matter if it 's negative or positive criticism it should only make us stronger it should make us try to improve ourselves and uh do better at the station and uh you know i 'm i 'm satisfied with so far what 's going on uhm of course of course i wanna do much more you know before uhm before i 'm done with my thing here i really want a nice set-up really and uhm and uh basically whoever comes in after us you know has an easier time than us you know pioneering this stuff you 've got to remember uhm this is pioneering stuff you know this is uh we 're the first college to ever have our own f m radio station not just it 's not easy you know you can't just you can't mimic exactly what they do in uh other stations because they have the resources they have the technology you know we we we 've worked hard to uh set certain criteria or certain uh uh protocol to to be a to be you know to to maximize uhm to be effective but uh you know i 'm i 'm satisfied with what 's going on you know but of course there 's so much so much more room for improvement i mean we we 're we 're just only beginning you know that 's true and probably and the thing is uhm we 're doing we 're doing good now and the the booboos that we that we uh commi commit uh before is is part of it first time thing you know first time we lose now i think i could probably i could probably say that uhm we 've gone far away from what we had before and you know i i 've talked to mr marasigan a while ago and uhm and he told me that uhm well the station should like uh the station is quite good compared to before so it 's you know booboos and the mistakes you know we made we got those uh bad air times sort of things like that right well uhm more of that well the thing that i got a feedback that we 're not amateurs  well what i think about that is that we 're really amateurs we don't we don't get paid with this right that 's why we 're we 're still amateurs professionals do get paid and we 're lucky to be the first uhm college or university to be to get an l m an f m band it 's the first time in the philippines i think oh abso absolutely you know i i think that uh the difference between professionals and amateurs has been simply cash flow we don't have the money and uh with that in mind we 've had to you know be basic but you know we were able to uhm minimize uh minimize losses maximize gains and uh you know with that i i i i 've been really uhm you know happy even proud you know that uh that uh stuff has turned out the way it has you know where we 're trying we 're trying to be professional in the in the office you know and that 's the place where we should be professional and uhm and outside you know we can be friends or whatever that 's fine i think people have been able to start really now to divide uh personal and professionalism that 's very important i think amongst the group so you know things have gotten better of course i can't say it 's been perfect we 've had some rock rocky times you know and uhm some things going on here but uh i 'm glad to say that we were able to work things out and uh in the end you know we all have to remember that we 're a team it 's not about just one of us one part of the of the of the body we 're a complete body and we work best when we all function function well you know so uhm you 've got never mind you know it 's it 's it 's just uhm it 's just getting better i mean i can't i can't see us going down anyway i mean i mean we 're just gonna flung one uhm upper and up uh i i 'm really confident that uh we 're gonna get more listeners and get more attention that 's uh they probably out of the word entry you know we 've been known already and uh no matter no matter if it 's positive or negative we 're making noise you know that 's the point that 's how we want to do you know we have to capture them like before but if it were if it we 're causing a stir that makes people talk hey why not you know any publicity is good publicity even if it 's bad so stutter that 's what i can say about that what i think is that uh laughs  why are you laughing uhm  ha  you 're all good  i guess that uhm we should we should like uhm  oh here 's this thing uhm we should like probably uhm get some more uhm advertisement not really advertisements but then some more promotions for our radio station 'cause sometimes you know and then know there was this one time laughs at band camp a line from the movie american pie you know that movie laughs no no no i know exactly the movie you 're talking about but we won't mention it right now you know exactly the movie but i know what it is what is it come on i know the flute laughs yes laughs and i didn't know anyway basically thanks for bringing that up i 'm curious about american pie  i was i was doing a line actually uh okay oh yeah there was this like a while ago there was this uhm classmate of mine she was in the what 's this inteorg course code for international organizations classmate of mine she she goes like and said uhm i go like about did you hear the radio station and she said oh you have a radio station  she goes like oh i didn't know that i said yeah we have it it 's it 's like eighty-nine point five oh by the way o d b why did you transfer from eighty-seven to eighty-nine point five uhm as far as as i know i remember sir explaining that uhm the frequency anything below eighty-eight is considered emerging frequencies and uh uh this does not exist like on the radio dial for some strange reasons so like uh when sir went to the n t c national telecommunications company to discuss it they explained to him that and uh then we had to make our change you know from eighty-eight point seven but strangely enough someone else 's already there i mean i believe right so uhm like adjust eighty-nine point five you know i i mean we 're we 're the new boys now eighty-nine point one eighty-nine point nine but uh it 's it 's been okay so far so good uh you know i might have considered so about other stations maybe are trying to turn out our signal or or what i don't know i 'm sure but uh since it 's been okay it 's been what it 's been a while now it 's been some time now uhm but concerning about uh the uh the ads and the promotion uhm i think the main the main pr the main problem is that uh when when they when they decided to develop this project and uh whatever uhm they did not think about the bigger picture like months it 's finished where where it will be in outlets for the students and teachers to actually you know enjoy and listen to it and strangely enough we 've had to go on to canvass and discuss with certain uh avenues like uh uh the canteen and uh that 's why i really uh uhm not that uh it angers me but it it irks me kind of thing you know
Philippines	uhm i think he should be a responsible man responsible enough to know uhm the needs of his family and he should prioritize his family first before his work uhm he should be concerned concerned with you with the with the relationship or  concer  uhm i think yes he should be concerned with with uhm the environment he should be environmental-friendly i mean  laughter environment laughter   because  yeah yeah yeah because i 'm not that environmental-friendly okay so i think i need someone who should teach me how you 're you 're saying like you want someone who 's not like who 's not you uh is that what you mean not really but i think i want a person who would teach me the things that i don't know and i still have to learn   know  okay and what else uhm of course i want laughter i want i want him to be physically attractive okay but if i can't get i expect i can't have it all then i 'll settle for someone who 's not that that good-looking looking yeah but his uhm his values are quite okay and uhm he 'll love me for who and what i am the way i should love him for who or what he is how about you with what you 've said earlier when you said someone who 's not that good-looking you know what for me yeah i don't   i think i want someone who 's presentable speaker a laughs you know like laughter when i go to parties or to any family gathering i can be proud of him he 's properly dressed yeah he talks really well yeah and he communicates well with other people i want someone smart smart yeah i can i can i can  talk to him no uh yeah i can talk to him any topic at all yeah and he can relate to other people uh yeah he knows what he 's saying and also i want someone who can love me more than i love him well that 's what most women speaker b giggles say okay uhm but how about education as much as possible i want him to be a college graduate or even he has a masteral degree oh my god sir our teacher is quite you know chuckle   well  well laughter uh-huh no comment anyway any yeah i want someone who 's extra cute i mean not not only that he graduated from from a particular university but i want him you know educated as in the real sense of the word yeah i think i can understand you because there are some educated people who really have the values and the character of a pig yeah yeah laughter  right yeah i also want someone who 's understanding uhm but i 'm a career woman and in the in the future i want to work i want to and not to stay at home yeah i think i think what you 're saying is that your husband or your ideal man will allow you to be yourself and to achieve what you want in life  yeah  yeah because that 's what i also think that 's what i think i want to be so what else what oh no it 's raining i know i know i know so anyway we have to continue with the conversation  anyway  uh uh again i want a guy who my family will love  there are some guys that your family they cannot they cannot they cannot   relate  yeah they cannot love him because they feel something bad or i said this to you before uhm i think one of my uh one of one of my teachers said or one of our teachers said thunder that you shouldn't thunder huh uhm laughter  marry you shouldn't marry at a at a young age at a young age yeah  kasi them a guy uhm at the age of like early twenties and mid-twenties they 're like quote unquote playful speaker a laughs   you know   uh yeah yeah i think yeah i think i remember that uhm what i have i have a friend who told me that you know i i i was shocked when i hear this because uhm he 's a guy and he told us girls that we should like you know  play around   collect and collect then select laughter   ah talaga  my god yeah i mean maybe not really play around but you know like if if you 're not rea if you 're not satisfied with this kind of relationship and with this kind of guy then get out of it of that relationship   yeah just get out of the relationship and then find another or if you 're still ready yeah right but not like two girls at the same i won't take it anymore  my god no  no of course not   i don't like those kind of guys do you think a guy can like you met this guy and you have no idea that you know he has this kind of attitude that he 's playful laughter and i want to use that word i like it  laughter i can see that laughter  you you met this guy and for for you he 's okay here 's this situation he 's he 's handsome you know at first glance he looks so ideal yeah but the attitu you there are hearsay na he 's he 's like he has this that attitude yeah are you still gonna go out with him or well or you 'll prove na people are wrong or you want to see it for yourself uhm i think i think i have to get to know the person first before i really really should judge him or in the first place i have no i have no uh i have not the right i don't have the right to judge that person because he i did i don't know him and he doesn't know me right but if ever i 'll get to know him and then maybe i can tell what kind of person he is   he is  but i don't have the right to judge him based on on what other people say i don't know if you can relate with what i 'm going to say but i like a guy who 's like my dad laughter  i think i think you know i think uhm   you can relate  yeah laughter yeah yeah yeah yeah do you agree with what i said yeah 'cause i want a guy who 's like my dad   your dad   i know   yeah  especially if you 're like attached to your dad yeah or or maybe uhm other girls or other women would like uh  words if you 're daddy 's girl what  like if you 're a daddy 's girl yeah you you like someone as your dad yeah because uhm you can see what your dad is doing what he 's doing for the family how hard he 's working and i like someone like that who can provide you with everything or like women who are who did not grow up with their fathers around laughter   okay  yeah and what else uhm my ideal man tall dark and handsome but of course really yeah but but you can't have it all so you know if someone   you go for tall dark and handsome guys yeah yeah i do okay laughter  my god i have this i have this okay let 's talk about that let 's talk about that ideal guy uhm based on his physical features yeah speaker a laughs  okay i 'll go first   you you you i like a guy who has nice eyes nice eyes yeah expressive eyes expressive eyes yeah you know  tantalizing eyes i want i want guys who who have these sleepy eyes you know tantalizing eyes you know like what what what does the what is the term for that mapungay  yeah  mapungay  i like those kinds of guy yeah and uhm charming i like uhm ano tsinito guy  tsinito  not all tsinito guys but i like  ano   tsini you know there are certain guys speaker a laughs who are who has these tsinito eyes but it 's not bagay  yeah and uh one one one more i don't like guys who smoke oh speaker a laughs i don't like guys who smoke yeah 'cause it irritates me when oh wel the smell of of cigarettes i don't like it uhm i 'm going to teach you one term what from the p m a what  scub  what 's that cigarette  scub  yeah and then does that refer to cigarette yeah from there yeah okay scub  so if you 're a smoker they 're gonna call you scubbard   yuck   and it 's really bad for the ears yeah smoker scubbard my gosh  and i don't want guys who are who have many vices yeah i mean i mean it 's okay to have occasional occasional drinks like that  occasional  but i don't want them to be a drunkard laughter  what 's that drunkard drunk drunk i guess laughter  guess okay what else  uhm i want a guy who is god god-fearing god-fearing yeah god-fearing or a person who has a godly devotion something like that both both i think both goes together yeah and also lastly i want a guy who has a sense of humor uh yeah   i don't want any dull moment when we 're together yeah laughter  there are just guys who who don't know what what to say and i want a guy who 's funny who 's funny yeah but not humorous okay  not  yeah laughter  i know the difference you know i think i know the difference  yeah  i like pero  uh okay uhm for me i think my ideal guy should be passionate  ay   you know yeah because because if he 's not passionate about something then how can he be passionate about me right passionate in the se  yeah right and and what 's the most important thing is that he should have love lots of love to give  yeah  because i mean love encompasses everything and yeah and if he 's like and he 's like not educated or if he 's not if he 's not uhm good or if he 's not any any bad any bad attitude uhm i think love is the catalyst that would make everybody change for the better right okay you 're right but for me even if such a even if a guy is educated he 's really good-looking and he he seems to be everything uh yeah a guy who doesn't love me for what and who i am is nothing  and don't you think uhm both our concepts of an ideal man is is in this one song which goes something like uhm starts singing you 've got to love me  yeah  the way i am for simply being me  let 's finish this speaker b chuckles   don't love me for what you intend the hope that i might be if you 're only using me to feed your fantasy you 're really not in love so let me go i must be free  it 's just so sad thinking that there 're only a few men left in this world who has all the qualities of an ideal man our ideal man uhm actually i don't think that all that qualities you 're looking for okay some laughter  okay okay okay yeah you know that 's true because times change people change and it 's clich&eacute; but it 's true you know like change is constant part of our lives but you know since change is a co change is a constant thing i think our concept of idealism or our concept of ideal man changes with the time or it just depends on the people you meet yeah yeah yeah yeah right and uh but sometimes since we can't have our ideal man we have to like not i 'm not going to say settle for what you have because because i think that 's really crap that 's crap that 's crap that 's uh it 's really crappy thing to say but don't you think if you 're if you 're like with this special someone uh uhm if it even if he has he does not have uh uhm the ideal qualities you you want in a guy uh uhm you just have i think you just have to recognize the qualities the best qualities that he has and you just thank thank god for it  god  yeah 'cause the mere fact that he loves you it 's something  of course of course i mean just uh just like what you said before i mean there 's good side and a bad side in everyone of us right and that i mean ideal ideal man or the the cause of ideal man really really depends on the person himself right

uh okay your friend 's house and what do you usually guys do anyway if you 're in manila i mean i thought it 's very different considering the  fact that you 're like you 're words away   yeah  like what do you what do you guys do in angeles what 's the usual hanging out yeah and arcade   there are just two malls there uh-huh of course we just stay home at aren't you close to the uhm free port zone i think yeah our house is about fifteen minutes away fifteen minutes away  so how it how is angeles now without the base was it better than when it had the bases or i think it 's better 'cause they 're like uhm converting the  former former base into uh an eco ecozone uh-huh there are more there are more there are more people coming in yeah but was it better when the americans were there i mean did you get any advantages from them i mean like uhm their uhm what do you call this their discipline something like keep angeles clean like in subic olongapo there 's not much difference because they just stay in the base yeah they don't do they go out i mean out of the base aside from the red light district sometimes yeah do you have american neighbors or are they all in the base it doesn't just in the base   not in our house not in your house are you in your village really i don't know do you know anybody from angeles named vanessa santos yeah i i know she she was she graduated from

so what do you think about her  is she okay i mean yeah you know i mean she 's okay i hear she 's intelligent yes very i don't know i can't i can't really tell no point of comparison yes oh okay if we compare her to you laughter  no no being a dean being a dean 's lister that you are cough so tell me marc uhm why don't you tell me about you okay you ask me something anything ask me i mean like what do we guys do in manila for fun okay  cough okay first thing i mean like let 's see  during high school there wasn't that much there wasn't that much to do because you know high school and you have all the curfews we had we had to ask our parents if we had to go out but now in college uhm the current fun is like it has a  broader scope   broader sense  yeah broader sense so in a way like lately in college or uhm fun would consist of hanging out at malls uh aside from hanging out with friends' place calling on the phone talking on the phone like computer ar you know ar at arcades cough computer arcades stuffs that 's where we usually hang out uh do you have arcade stalls i think yeah at angeles have you played the game area fifty-one  1 word  no area fifty-one area fifty-one yeah it 's about these aliens that you have to shoot uh-huh yeah uh-huh uh-huh okay that looks like an affirmative to me laughter  okay ask what else i thought you wanted to ask me something  listen up marc c 'mon laughter  you graduated from zolu zobel right yeah la salle zobel la salle also zobel and your line of questioning goes laughter  do you have do you have uniforms there like uh yeah but it it it 's different like in grade school we have a different uniform from high school and for fourth year high school fourth year high school yeah for fourth year we had to wear barongs  and socks any dark colored socks how about you we had our uniform i mean  maikli laughter  was it the khaki yeah with the duncans and yeah even up to high school yeah so from grade school to high school you 've been wearing the same duncans  in grade from prep to grade three e grade one you had to wear shorts yeah yeah we also had the same thing but it was only up to grade five ours is up to grade five  grade five  yeah we we had to wear shorts grade five i can still remember that back in grade three i used to tuck my polo in in the shorts okay anyway that 's cough that 's uh that 's your my style laughter  your style yeah that was me but uhm when we got to grade six and up to fourth year high school we had we could wear pants already and when we got to fourth year we get to stay in an air-conditioned room with the barong  with a barong  and with all with the seniority stuff that being a fourth year has how about in hangeles angeles laughter sorry i caught that earlier from your hangeles chuckle  anyway angeles uhm do you also have that seniority seniority thing i guess it depends on the person you know like if you 're a fourth year can you just like walk through a crowd of third years and everybody would like step aside  no what c 'mon answer me  uhm no no just what just like what i 've said it just depends on the person who that person is you know uh if he 's in the the part that he wants to walk through a crowd of third year yeah i see uhm okay what else i mean let 's compare angeles to manila no it 's it 's different right totally different if you were to stay in somewhere else i mean if you were given a chance to live somewhere else where where would that place be would you want to stay here in the philippines not in the philippines  in zimbabwe laughter  zimbabwe i heard it 's a good place where did you hear it from who did you hear it from from a friend oh what 's your friend 's name rose rose yeah is that rose ms rose sevilla   ms rose anne v sevilla who lives in

well they 're okay i like meg ryan she 's a good actress uh yeah well tom hanks is a good actor too but he 's not really my favorite oh how come i don't know i think he 's too old really  i don't know for meg ryan oh yeah for meg ryan but you know but  he can play any role right   he   yeah  and they make a good couple i don't know they i don't know they just   but i really don't like the way meg ryan walks yeah she she walks like a guy yeah i know   she doesn't have any   the grace yeah she should go to an etiquette school oh yes laughter  and learn how to walk properly   you wanna teach her how but i like her clothes i mean the way she she dresses up and  uh yeah   up  uh-huh you know i mean she 's slim anyway   or is it like  yeah so she could wear anything she wants comfy clothes yeah actually we 've watched a lot of movie together right yeah  i like her hair uh uhm i mean even if she doesn't brush her hair   yeah i know  it 's the i don't know   it looks good on her yeah she 's the only actress i know who doesn't really comb her hair  yeah laughter   not really  i don't know i just like the way she dresses up and you know her hairstyle but uh compared to what 's the first movie they 've done together uhm sleepless in seattle   yeah  which one do you like i don't know uh i think i forgot the story of sleepless   story  no it 's like uh love affair right is that no but i think that uhm yeah i think that tom hanks already had a kid uh uhm and his wife passed away and i think his son wrote uhm wrote a letter to meg ryan was it wrote a letter or called called the station or whatever oh yeah yeah right that 's right and then and then   and then it was like that old movie right love affair  you watched that   uhm yeah yeah uhm warren beatty or whatever and annette

actress yeah but the story of erin brockovich was for me uh you know boring as in boring because they featured so bland was it no it was too detailed uh okay so it was like they showed every detail and   as it happened yeah uh-huh i don't know i found it dragging and boring compared to her other movies yeah i guess because it 's not a love story or something   story yeah i know  it wasn't really amusing or whatever so but that was okay i just can't believe that it 's one of the it it was number one in the states for a couple of weeks yeah   in the states uh in u s   uh-huh  i couldn't imagine it to be that i mean i guess she played a good she portrayed a good role or whatever uh uhm was it was she sexy there yeah more of slutty oh okay chuckle slutty type yeah 'cause she was like wearing really skimpy clothes why her i don't know maybe that that 's how the real erin brockovich dresses up  how erin   dres yeah  but then i don't know and i guess it was in the eighties so   uh-huh  the colors were like she wore pink   striking flashing yeah she wo i remember she wore a pink-top i think uh-huh and i don't know it 's just too colorful to yeah i don't know colorful to look at uh yeah

Philippines	hi rowena how are you this morning well i 'm fine but haven't you noticed that i just woke up what time did you wake up exactly uhm around seven i think it 's because i went home late last night i mean this morning really where did you go  i 've been to a party at my friend 's house in valenzuela how was the party what did you do there break in the recording  it was fun there were lots of people who went there most especially our most yeah our org members organization from our organization well we had our drinking time out there and we had so much fun  yeah  uhm really i also went to graduation party last night it was in xavierville i too was feeling a bit sleepy because yesterday morning i had to wake up at five a m because we had production day  yeah our production uhm we 're already starting with our production that 's why we don't anymore have our saturdays how was the production was it successful efficient somehow we were able to produce eight films for that day same thing we 're able to mit uh to meet the minimum requirement on the word  we 're able to produce eight word  oh uhm but in our case we haven't met our minimum requirement which is nine but it 's good to see that we have made eight uhm for that first day alone i know it was uh very difficult at first but as we go along we 're able to improve ourselves yeah break in the recording  well i guess practice makes perfect huh oh by the way uhm did you stay in school last friday for the celebration of our being the champion unfortunately no i had to go home right away how about you did you stay no i was so tired then that i want to sleep and have a rest but i heard they had a lot of fun what what did they do at first uhm most of the people went there just to eat little did they know that there were bands playing out there the basketball players even danced really  i 'm sorry i missed that it would have been fun yeah uh i can't imagine seeing those basketball players dancing i don't know what they danced but it seems like they 've been enjoying themselves i bet they were i heard that there were also the signing of aut autographs can you imagine that oh they 're suddenly celebrities now yeah uh ren ren ritualo and allado became instant celebrities they 've been signing auto autographs uh at the chess plaza i heard yeah i 'm sure they were really good did you watch the game yeah haven't you seen me there not exactly oh it was a nice game i would love to watch the replay replay yeah last night but then i went out yeah me too i missed it chuckle also but don't you just find the game ex really exciting at first i couldn't i couldn't shout i mean when at during the first half uh uhm uhm we 're way ahead of the f e u far eastern university  but then on the second half i can't control myself chuckle  i 'm so nervous that i 'm afraid that we 'll sounds uncertain going to lose yeah and but you know it was a bit unexpected because i 'm not really a basketball fan but i actually had fun watching it it was really exciting and i was actually screaming and shouting and everything did you know that i almost lost my voice because of the shouting and my hands were kind of getting red because of clapping uhm yeah my hands also they were itchy chuckle red from clapping but i 'm so glad that we became the champions because at last even before i graduate or we graduate we were able to i mean uhm enjoy the victory the long awaited victory   yeah chuckle   victory  oh by the way did you hear the new policy that we 're asked to wear our i d 's in sch inside the school premises yeah i heard about that uh atty cruz yeah was it yeah she went to our class and she announced about that policy so what do you think about it i don't know uhm personally i don't want to wear i d 's inside the school it 's just like i 'm in uh high school just like wearing id 's letting to know everybody who you are i mean just like that and everything i don't know but if it 's for our safety then i 'm for it yeah i agree with you but then uhm i i 'm a bit embarrassed by my i d because it 's already in uh well bad condition chuckle  it 's covered with tape and everything chuckle  well mine is still in good shape but then i 'm ashamed to show my picture during my first year in college why what 's wrong with your picture well i just don't feel like showing it to the people i i 'm planning to have ah i mean to secure a new i d i don't know if i can secure one this time maybe you could well as for me i think i have to because it 's in such a bad condition break in the recording  maybe we could even go together and secure both our i ds oh you haven't changed your i d yet not yet laughter  and now i 'm sure there 's a long line out there for all the people who want to secure a new i d just because they too are ashamed of their faces laughter during their freshman year i know laughter  so have you heard of that incident i mean of the brawls yeah i don't know when when atty cruz mentioned about the numerous brawls that occurred in la salle i was a bit surprised because i 've never witnessed one i 've never even heard of one how about you me too uhm i just only learned through atty cruz i don't know when that happened i haven't seen one i haven't heard one too just from her when was that what do you think  i think  i mean i 'm not really sure i 've i 've no idea but then rumors has it that it 's between fraternities yeah so i assume that if there will be frat fraternities which is very much i mean they violate they are violating our school policy yeah school policy they should be expelled from the school is it break in the recording  but that 's part of the problem they were not able to identify who the participants were so that 's why they insisted on the i d policy didn't you know that the students of velasco i mean the engineering students were already obliged to wear their i d inside their building why only in velasco i think in gokongwei too i mean maybe that 's one of their reasons for safety and security so maybe our department i mean c b e college of business and economics is trying to follow them i think i just don't know why does the brawl occur in velasco and gokongwei most of the time not necessarily but i heard that one incident hap happened when uhm there 's a brawl which happened in front of a d o = discipline officer imagine that oh they 're really brave ha  yeah so what did the d o = discipline officer do i don't know i haven't heard much of that news maybe i can just ask one of my friends to tell me more about that when you find out you tell me all the details oh sure speaking of problems uhm i think i may need your advice why what happened well word well i 've been having problems with my best friend lately remember him yeah well i don't know how i can call it but i think uhm we 've got uhm we don't no longer communicate nowadays what exactly happened well for one thing i decided to cut the communication   yeah  why why did you do that well i don't know i 've been thinking it for ages now and i think it was just parang now is just the time that i woke up or i 'm really in my senses that i don't know did he do something wrong to you yeah he would i just cut our communication if he didn't did something wrong what exactly did he do well for me what he did was unforgivable as in unforgivable i 've heard that he was a bit intimidated by me i don't know why intimidated by you yeah why would he feel that i don't know i haven't realized that 'till then 'till now i mean uhm haven't i told you before that he was about last sum just this vacation summer he was about to give me something but then he was thinking twice of giving it to me because he thinks that i won't i won't be using it  uh uhm  but you 've been best friends for such a long time and so why is he feel intimidated by you now  yes  i mean you know it just doesn't make sense me too me and my friends are wondering why uhm i don't know about him i asked him about that but he seems quiet that that topic will be talked about he just doesn't want to talk about it yeah uh but maybe he has developed some feelings for you i don't know hope not 'cause i don't know how to deal with it but do you like him yeah but just for a friend just for a friend and now you miss him obviously i 'm the incident last summer was just i mean was just nothing i i decided not to think more about it anymore but then uhm it happened again just during this sem break well it was one sunday night when he asked me to go to his place it 's because it was his younger brother 's birthday i was kind of hesitant then because i was too shy to go to their place especially meeting his parents haven't you realized that why well i don't know but the real it wasn't any problem with his invitation in fact i was too eager to go to his place uhm but then during our conversation i mean on the phone when we 're talking on the phone uhm he was kind of i think he decided not to to invite you yeah to invite me anymore did you say something to him that made him change his mind none at all in fact uhm i was kind of he he knew that i was so excited but then he reasoned out that he was just too shy of himself to let to let you yeah to let me show their place it 's because he feels that i 'm i mean too rich i mean for him just like that matters like that but the fact that you and he are best friends for such along time i mean doesn't that mean anything to him  doesn't he realize that you 've when you 've decided to be friends with him that you have already accepted him that 's what i don't ah that 's what i didn't expect from him that 's what i don't understand from him imagine we 've been friends for five years now and it was only this time that he brought this the topic up so i was thinking that he was he already had 2 words in his mind before but why is it only now that he act that way i don't know when i told my friends about that they too are wondering why the sudden change in his attitude are you sure you didn't say or do anything  no i didn't do anything wrong i never remember doing anything that might hurt him  so with that conclusion i think uhm i mean he did that to me once during summer vacation so i think if he won't be able to accept me for who i am then it 's just useless to continue our friendship but it 's such a waste to you know to let your friendship go like that yeah and i agree with you with that uhm but then i can't do anything i don't see any point in continuing our friendsh or keeping our friendship if he behaves like that
Philippines	 ano uh chinese school di ba is it different from a philippine setting kasi ang  it 's different in such a way that when you uhm in our school actually   oo  in our school it 's not the same in another in other chinese schools   chinese school in greenhills in manila no it 's it 's in quezon city uh quezon city so in the school where i teach uh uhm it 's only on a half-day basis because all the english uh uhm filipino subjects are in the morning and then in the afternoon they take chinese chinese lessons  uh uhm  uhm half-day basis regarding the subjects being taught yes but not on your no not on the loads actually not on the oo not on the hours of service yeah because it 's still regular load i i handle a regular load but you receive a good pay good pay good pay could you consider that a good pay be paid yeah i can't  baka naman i am receiving a lesser amount even if sa akin  i am not sure because i am getting eight thousand for a half-day work four to five hours of work but but you stay until no i can leave   five four  you can leave as long as you have finished the five hour service  my  i 'm from seven thirty to to twelve thirty that 's it that 's it and i can go home   and then you 're receiving eight thousand yes that 's good enough kasi   but you 're not required to go back  yes i think so  to stay to come back in the afternoon no to stay until no until you consume eight hours no not really that 's good enough that 's that 's that 's the reason why i took the job  oo  otherwise i wouldn't have taken it  oo oo and then in the afternoon you 're free to do what you want to do  yes  i 've i have other rackets   you can have your tutorial  yes that 's it i have business i do tutorials and act before i used to teach at speechpower it 's only this summer but i 'm interested in speechpower  is it good to teach at speechpo speechpower good to teach good exposure that is experience-wise yes   why good exposure kasi i have been uh wishing ever since i was young uh uh ever since i was twenties early twenties uh uhm  na i 'll be connected to speechpower oh really but af uh up to now i haven't really tried it  never  why don't you try  well now they 've already  kasi  they have already started their their classes uh-uhm last week of march no i want to teach not to enroll as a student  yeah  yeah that 's it oh they 've started  actually what you could do is to apply they have their applica they open their applications on january uh january december december as early as december   uh december  do do they ano do they encourage part-timers that 's actually what they do uh so you don't have any benefits   actually all the other teachers there  no we don't have any and we are we are being paid by the hour also  oo oo  so the number of subjects that you handle or course we call it course the number of course the the the compensation depends upon the  oo  the number of of loads that you ha handle do you receive ano uhm trainings yes yes that 's it one of the benefits   oh that 's what i want  for one uhm before you could even handle before you start handling classes  oo  you have to go through a training because you have to imbibe   for free  yeah you have to imbibe their metho methodology   wow   oo oo  they will it 's like brainstorming you  talaga   oo to use their method have you acquired something from them i mean yes that you could use for your own personal business like tutorial   actually   actually the methodology   you are doing it now  yeah  talaga  the methodology is really manageable   how i wish i could be connected at speechpower   that 's that 's what i 've been telling you about when it comes to exposure experience because once you once you mentioned the name of speechpower it 's it has a pre it 's prestigious in a way   oo oo oo   oo oo oo  'cause once you say speechpower i came from speechpower actually   compare to other speechpo uh uh speech speech cour i don't know speech schools offering speech oo courses  schools   centers  they i think they are the one of the most famous i think   uh uh the most uh reliable chuckle  well yes because that 's because we have to go through a certain training  school   talaga  yeah how much do they pay their training instructress   uh on that part it 's not too much at least i was only getting   per load per unit it 's a per per hour basis uh uhm i was getting eighty then eighty per hour   in other schools in other in other colleges uh uhm they also pay well as low as as lower than eighty no i think as low as or at least near to eighty near eighty but i don't know of any speechpower schools na near sa rizal tanay rizal i think the nearest that you could go to  there 's one in cainta  no no no   none  the nearest the nearest speechpower what someone approaches the speakers  yeah the one who approached asked a question  nothing we 're just doing this break in the recording  speechpower school the nearest speechpower in our to our province tanay rizal  nyek the nearest is in cubao  ay that 's too far that far but my goodness that 's one ride one one ride di ba one ride from tanay is it no there is you go to antipolo first and then you ride another jeepney  niye it 's too far   right  i thought there 's one in antipolo i don't know maybe it 's a different school it 's uh i probably i don't know if they have they have   oo nga e  or maybe  kasi that 's what i 'm after uh  one of the branches  because they go from place to place  oo nga e   i mean uh from last year they have given up or i think it was two years ago they 've they have given up their their branch in caloocan uh uhm and then in lieu for in lieu of the ano ba 'to branch na 'to  where was that in bi&ntilde;an uhm there 's another one in bi&ntilde;an actually what they do is that they go to a certain school   uh uhm uh uhm and then they try to they they rent the place uh uhm and well they hav i think they have an ex-deal wherein they 're also going to train the teachers in that certain school uhm so in the south the there 's the golden valley school of bi&ntilde;an uh uhm and then next to that the nearest spot is that of taft uh uhm the one in taft uh uhm and then the one in in espa&ntilde;a uh uhm the more regular ones the ones that do not close are the ones in espa&ntilde;a and then cubao those two uhm they don't they don they they 're they are it 's always there uh uhm because that 's where their the two links how do you say that links i suppose are and then what year what year were you connected i started at uhm summer of   did you work on nineteen ninety-three oo summer of ninety-three so that 's seven years ago yeah but uh this year i didn't teach what about uh if you enroll as a student do you pay uhm that much  now  at four thousand four thousand of what at it 's at four thousand for how many units no that 's that is twenty-four hours spread out  uhm  parang two two hours per meeting per session uh uhm normally it 's two to three hours two to three days a week uh two to three days a week a week  so you finish the twenty-four hour session in four weeks or if it 's a two hour session in two uh two days for two days in a week   uh uhm   uh uhm  that is that 's that would stretch out for six weeks yeah oo six weeks ay   uh uhm  oh so it 's it 's different from any regular school i mean th the way they handle the subjects uh yeah the way they offer the subjects   yeah different quite different quite different and they have   and this is not the same with the other regular sch regular schools uh which offer very different very different except that it 's   uh   twenty-one units and then you attend regularly daily or m w f t t h no no it is you have a regular schedule though uh uhm you go on regular schedule   but shorter  yeah because it 's just word in our profession   kaya lang i would be wasting four thousand oh why don't why don't you just apply just apply and be a teacher  yes  yes and then acquire undergo training for free   the methodology  and then you also take you 're also you have the privilege to take one course uh uhm for free for free uh uhm during the time that you 're teaching so you just find time to attend and they would even encourage you to attend uh uhm some of their courses  in something like if you have if you if you have free time ask the consultant we call ourselves consultants  uh uhm  uh uhm you just ask the consultant if you could si uh sit in for one or two sessions just to just to observe actually they they encourage newcomers to observe the the old comer the old comers the old ones the old timers  uh uhm   the old ones  where is the ano where is the the main office or the main the main is that main office cubao uh cubao the one that you mentioned a while ago  the main office yeah that 's the main because that 's their building probably they know if there are other branches aside i mean  oo really in what areas the other branches are located yeah yes you may do so so i could probably ask if there 's one in antipolo i 'll be  and they would even tell you  they would even tell you to go to this place it 's nearer your place  oo  it 's basically the same it 's our branch uh uhm they 'll tell you that but uhm ano t commonly how many units do they give a a consultant as you call yourself it depends it depends  oo  as long as you can handle the number of units because i used to handle before i was given a an eight to five uh uhm eight to five job like it 's from eight to ten then ten to twelve then we have a break from twelve to one and then one to three three to five that 's how it is uh uhm and then when i was already in i think on my third year they gave me an eight to eight job huh my god   because that depends upon the vai availability of the consultant and yet you don't have any benefits even if you have been teaching for that long already none because teachers just come and go consultants come and go  so you 're not qualif i mean you 're you 're your status is not on a permanent basis but just a part-timer   it should be on a permanent basis ahhh that is if you are one of the one of the what do you call them operations manager what do you mean   if you 're one of the operations managers then you share a you are a capital laughter  no not really you 're the you are the what do you what do they call them little j ms j m the owner the owner the founder   junior manager  no no no the founder uh the founder owner of speechpower the j m jun  i don't know there he 's joe mordano the little j m because they do the they call the shots how i wish there were there 's one in antipolo so i could probably work as a part-timer  if there 's if there is another one if there would be a new one uh uhm you know what is rewarding is the experience  oo that 's what i 'm asking for   you 'd be exposed to the experience to the modules and besides this is about what is good at speechpower that 's why i stayed that long how many years did you work there well six six uh six years six not uh continuously ha   oo  because during the regular school year i go to my to regular school during summer   ay no wait wait wait may i interrupt you uhm not speechpower in antipolo it 's it 's it 's s t i pala  my goodness   oo kasi i know of one my my former or rather oo my former school uh no no no she was   colleague  yes colleague uh uhm she was not a teacher but then uh an employee at the office
Philippines	these are so diverse yeah may is so quiet and then aileen is she 's such an actress yeah remember yesterday laughter she was acting like weird funny stupid stupid stupid  yeah that 's the

college is better ours is four so it 's not much of a difference chuckle  but college is okay since we learn to be more independent of ourselves in high school you 're still like in the four walls of the school  you don't go   everyone spoon- feeds you yeah you don't go out much like in college you go out you see the world you see how it looks like speaker a chuckles  make projects tons of

Philippines	really you do of course me too we haven't seen him for almost two weeks already yeah it 's and it seems like you know forever but it 's been quite a while since we last saw him you know i miss his long black hair and his shiny hair  red lips  super red lips kissable lips  yeah   you know   and his  you know sometimes i just want to stop thinking about super silky smooth face yeah me too you know what i think we shouldn't have absent ourselves last yeah  i miss   last wednesday  'cause i guess if we were there it 's cool then we could have seen him for so many times  sneeze i hate my nose it 's just a waste anyway what are you putting on crimson red crimson red it 's not like that how here let me show you you just have to dab a small amount i see is there any difference yes can you see the difference like your eyes are uhm enveloped in this white spot and it just emphasizes your eyes here put some more you know what i i applied some last night and i think it looked great but you know no one can see it i think you should have applied some last saturday actually actually i ap i applied some last saturday you didn't tol tell me  i would have put some too   the  wait yeah i think that 's why i think that 's why when i used the it last night there was this black spot around the tip so   and i thought it was like dirt   which attached itself into the stick so i thought i maybe i used it i must have put it on top of your eye shadow so that 's why the colors stick up it looks great yeah how much was this  something like uh one hundred plus  it 's   it 's not expensive  yes it 's kind of cheap uh uhm compared to uhm consider in polish up which costs three hundred pesos yeah i think that 's a good bargain of course and it smells nice also uhm look o uh  my gosh  faye what do you think we 're supposed to repeat it again laughter  no i don't think it 's that obvious faye what uh how come i don't see an effect uhm how is life different when you have a boyfriend uhm a boyfriend yes well you know that feeling you get when you 're i don't know if it 's love or what but i don't think that 's that deep or what but you know this uhm some kind of strong intense feeling or excitement what do you mean intense feeling  wait let me just read this uhm  marlon just paged me and is asking me to call him back do you think i should page him now he asked me to page him now uh i think your sister is using the phone so if you use the phone she will surely she will surely yeah i know but he said he 's waiting for it   catch it i don't know what it 's all about now are you sure i guess you can try using the phone   yeah   what were what were you saying a while ago before i just read my my message uh look can you p elaborate on that intense feeling  i think you know what i 'm saying already 'cause i didn't you just told me that you already had a boyfriend i guess twice uhm i guess i know but i th i think i forgot so what did you felt were you happy then or   of course i am because having a boyfriend is like finding your soulmate  you see  yeah and you know your other half they say that when you have a boyfriend you 're always you always look good 'cause there 's this uhm what do you call that knock   1 word  yeah uhm they say you 're b always blooming that 's it 'cause you 're always happy you 're inspired you have inspiration yeah i guess that 's just it  inspiration   so i guess that 's what i need to know an inspiration   an inspiration  why are you bored kinda and   what about m g is he not an inspiration to you uhm m g of course he is an inspiration but but it 's like he 's not real you know the hopeless feeling because you don't know him and and you see him every day and you you want to to introduce yourself to him but you you you just don't have the guts   i don't have the guts to do it you know i was planning a while ago that maybe i could the way uhm the i think the only way for me is talk to him is by you know asking him to buy some ticket from the y f c yes well maybe maybe you we can do that or or approach his friends first and then no   i think his friends already knew us i think they knew that we have this sort of crush on m g yes what uh and i i think you i think it 's obvious yeah i think   that they already noticed it we have a crush on   because whenever we follow them they always you know uh look back or take a a peek or a glance at us  smirk  yuck smirk as in uhm they smirk at us you know i think i don't know what to think but i don't think i you know uh i 'm not that affected look at the effect  it 's so nice   yeah it 's nice  it 's like your eyes are uhm are nice no it  you know the models on t v yes they have i think i 'm better with consider  a lighter shade yes a lighter no i think it 's

have my hair cut i want it much shorter  again   i mean a shorter hair  shorter shorter i don't want long hair anymore it uh you know a shorter hair suits you more suits you more than a longer hair  i i uh well  i think so because you look uhm i look cuter yeah speaker a chuckles cuter as you put it  well and you know what i find shorter hair much more you know attractive   elegant  yeah elegant 'cause they look you know innocent and all that innocent so you mean i look innocent you look like more of a a kid no   a kid  yeah of course i was just kidding no i think you look great in your hair

Philippines	 b has just shown a a picture of b taken at a wedding o my god that is so beautiful b laughs  cely that is so beautiful i know because it i had my make-up done by by my old suki uh  by in piandre  no no no piandre dino dino 's parlor ahh dino fajardo  oo  i was the ninang at the wedding of   my god it 's beautiful  so you have to do you have the original i don't have the original the negative  oo i 'm asking my niece to give me the original because i wanted this copied but they said the copy of a copy is no good so  uh okay  i like it i like it  ay it 's beautiful really beautiful cely this was may uh after lito her husband died in april  really oh my gosh   uh hum uh hum and then  beautiful  so did you go to the cemetery on your birthday yes of course so how how was it it was very quiet quiet i said my rosary i talked to him  oo b laughs  and then we had a very nice dinner at katre yeah was it good was it good it was good it was very very well presented  the presentation was so good but then i noticed whatever you order it looks the same it 's everything practically looks the same so that 's the one     oo uh oh   the styling the styling of the food oo oo  but the food was good  oo the styling  yes but the servings you know the servings were small were small uh so the prices are not reasonable the price is reasonable maybe that 's the reason the the   oh i almost forgot we have to pick up telly no what yeah she told me because she arrived early   directed at the driver naku carlito punta muna tayo kay telly   okay where is she now   sa bahay niya  uh alright i didn't know you know i went to my parlor to have my blow-dry and i said okay let me see what they can do to my hair the lady went to the bathroom and took a bath and so i was waiting there chatting with one of my friends  and then i said oh my gosh i 'll be late so i said give give me a little sh sh sh spraying sound; a laughs and then i ran out because i said i don't want to be late  oo oo oo oo  yeah she called she called and said that uh she 's done so she 's going  did you know she went to china december twenty-six to january two   uh huh i know that   yes a week  was that with friends or was that official  with with no no no uh with friends the guy is a chinese filipino and he teaches the nuns   the nuns  ahh yes oo  it must have been very cold 'no  very cold you sh yeah i hope did you tell her to bring the pictures no no no she should bring the pictures 'cause you can hardly i said who 's this and it 's she laughs  'cause she 's all loaded   she 's all bundled up  and then the funny thing is she has that scarf across her face like that because it was so cold  oh my god because of the wind chill and i said wow all of you all of you   where did they go in china  ay it was a beautiful trip according to her she said there were ice sculptures and the ice sculptures were huge oh i see i hope she brings the pictures because she brought the pictures and showed them to me   and i said okay oh why i would have wanted to go with her but it was very very sudden and bubut was in town  oo oo okay okay the guy remember i refused to continue with the  nuns' group the guy agreed i think to continue with the group  he he meets them three times a week  yeah   uh okay  that 's a lot of work laughs  it 's a lot of work three times a week three hours but you know the thing is it 's easier for him than for me 'cause he does the written phase so when they write he can sit down and rest i you ask telly how she felt when she was listening to me laughs she said  uhm   rest oo oo   oo nga  she was more tired than you she was definitely more tired than i because i was you know my adrenaline was pumping because here is this group of seven nice nuns and i wanted to find out how much i can do really   but it 's too much  yeah   uh hum  i thought annabelle lee would have handled the class she has  no patience   telly didn't i don't know telly said if she handles it then i will have to worry about it  and so she wanted me to handle it first  i said telly you know i tried ha i 've been a very good girl  i tried and she she almost faints siguro almost fainted laughs   ay telly let her tell you  uh huh okay   oo   oo oo   ay gosh but the thing is when when the guy showed me the written work it was so good yes it 's almost poetic the language is almost poetic   uh really ha   so it 's really just practice they need practice it 's the mouth and the ears  oo  so that means they are reading a lot i guess in china  it 's the oral phase  i think so yes yes yes and they are reading but when you talk to them they can hardly understand you you have to speak very slowly and even then they cannot understand you so you have to write go to the board i have to write

chi minh  hmmph   oo nga oo   benjie says benjie rebullida says i want to marry vietnam what vietnam laughs figurative language marry i want to marry vietnam figurative language  talaga ha   uy where is benjie now i don't know i hope i don't see him   is he the one with a problem you know i hope i don't meet him anymore  why   why  because i called him when the rumors were circulating i called him benjie what is this rumor i 'm hearing about you and then he says hindi ko nga ho alam ba't ginaganito nila ako e  i don't know why they 're doing this to me  you mean there 's no truth to that rumor  wala sabi niya  so i 'll go there on november and follow up my papers personally and find out why they 're giving me a problem with my papers so  oh my god  oh my god when did you call him about a month words   before november  when did you start hearing the rumor probably august   did somebody check bother to check yeah lita wrote stanford university but you know the the funny thing is wyona yon hindi ba  before the dean uh works on the papers before the appointment is done and 2 words committee the v p a clears the papers  di ba tapos noon go on and hire so we assumed that wyona did all the background checking otherwise she would not have told us okay go on and hire benjie rebullida  so we hired him and i we we gave him associate four which is only for p h d holders  tapos ni- recommend ko pa na  professorial chair holder  it was cleared  yes he was so promising so bright very bright  oo oo  and then so i was told that somebody from abroad came and mentioned that to the international studies people but i didn't believe because i called benjie and he denied not having a p h d and did he show anything no so we went over his papers and uh they you know the people from stanford didn't say he does not have a p h d  ha   oo that 's why wyona gave him they cleared his name but they didn't mention that he has no p h d so we i i wyona must have assumed that okay and then lita wrote  strange 'no  didn't stanford say he 's a graduate or  something like that   no no no basta they cleared name niya but not the degree what do you mean by cleared  that he has no problems but what you are interested in is his degree   it was a character reference it was a character reference yeah a character reference i don't know what wyona asked but that was the paper that i saw  and so lita finally wrote and was told he has no p h d  oh my  that he does not have categorically he does not have a p h d  wala  a p h d break in recording  was he working on his dissertation did he have an academic i think he had a problem with his adviser that was what all of these usually it comes out it was speculation already  oo all of these were rumors rumors  oo   o where is he now he 's still with la salle paying back everything so hindi ba we paid him uh the rate of the associate four  ha  what 's he paying back  e di sobra yung ano he was his rank was changed now so he was made associate siya 'no  now he was made assistant prof and so he 's paying now the difference between assistant and   the chair also four thousand five hundred  associate   and the chair  oh my gosh it 's a wonder that he still sticks around  sabi ko i hope i don't meet him all laugh ba't naman pati yung i called him 'no  and said this is very confidential will you please tell me he said he has a p h d oh my gosh you know i it was manolo who recommended him  hindi ba manolo went abroad so then he brings this benjie rebullida and he says o he has a p h d tatata tatata make sure we don't lose him tatata tatata so ako naman i worked fast and we hired him at lyceum i always told do not take any word of any man or woman who claims to have a p h d if there is no paper attached  kasi i 've learned that early enough in my career as a dean i think you know wyona i have a feeling that wyona considers  manolo 's word parang the guarantee uh no no no  ayan ayan  this is not the first time that it happened in de la salle  di ba  in liberal arts i don't know several cases i guess but i cannot cannot remember a case i usually would tell uh uh paulino i already told you be very very careful as it has strung me once and i will never forget that  and you 'll recall that was only one person that said she graduated as an honor student at u p  oo oo   oo oo  but you know benjie i think didn't apply it was manolo who encouraged him to join la salle all you need is  hindi ba when i applied at de la salle  kumpleto ang papers pati transcript ko  plus the diploma  hay naku i really don't like to see  benjie anymore because i called him i called him  hindi ba si santos also remember that santos guy the one who sang with the chorale french computer ba computer ahh carlo   carlo oo nga  he didn't have a p h d also he did not defend his dissertation or something and yet when people called him doctor he didn't correct them and he was dean so the latest is brother andrew uh is giving him i don't know how true this is 'no up to the end of uh this school year to finish to finish his p h d  to pay   aba where i don't kn stanford  go back ganoon  but has he defended his dissertation and all he needs is to revise you know that 's what i don't know i i don't know we don't know kasi ba't ganoon walang klaro  funny naman stanford  i didn't see the letter of stanford to lita but that was what lita told me wala siyang p h d that 's why he 's paying back

Philippines	so when are you gonna graduate well hopefully i 'll be graduating this term really so what are your plans after college  yes  well nothing definite yet uhm i guess just like other the other graduates i 'd like to get to work in a multinational company or even an airline company my mom wants me to work abroad but i 'm really not sure yet i also want to take up my m a but i think it 's gonna it 's gonna have to take two to three years before i can get one so how about you me i 'm gonna graduate after this term one more term but then i don't know if i 'm gonna work after that don't you just hate it how hard it is to find a job yeah it 's very difficult  uhm i even tried looking for a job already but as i 've seen in the classified ads most of the jobs were looking for either computer graduates business and engineering students yeah i know i 've searched also but then i 'm not sure if i 'm gonna work so  so let 's talk about another thing yeah uh what about uhm what do you love most about your friends well i 've been with i 've known my friends for quite along time already and uhm i 'm just happy being with them because i can just be myself i can talk to them about anything under the sun exactly that 's it  uh  i can i don't know if i can trust them mobile phone rings  hey is that your phone yeah so continue well what else uhm how about you what do you like about your friends well they 're always there for me definitely but now that i have a husband and a kid i can't go out with them always so it 's rare that i get to see them but still the closeness is still there don't you just hate friends who deceive and lie to you yeah huh indeed you know that yeah i know a lot of those kind of people what do you think of them what do you plan to do about your friends who 're like that well frankly frankly my dear what i plan to ditch them that ditch them and bring them to hell no that 's too mild okay so what do you suggest i don't know basically in order for you to stay words stay the hell away from them you know gosh don't you hate it when it rains yeah definitely besides getting wet yeah the traffic and everything and all   yeah break in the recording  yeah i totally agree with you so what are the things that you you wanna do when it 's raining i just want to sleep eat yeah sleep eat uh and smoke yeah definitely smoke it 's so cold now you know not like before but then when it 's summer it 's so hot i can't stand the heat and the weather here in our country is very extreme yeah i know you get sick all the time because of that  so let 's talk about gimmick what about it don't you miss it now that you have a kid sometimes but not really i don't really get to go out that much before and besides as you said i have a kid now i have a responsibility yeah  me i don't have a kid but i haven't i haven't been out in one for quite a long time already  really  yeah come on don't lie to me you 've been out almost every day of the week  every day but i don't go out on a gimmick like you know gimmick like go to a bar yeah   gimmick until two in the morning  yeah gimmick as in malls only is that what you 're saying   yeah just go to malls just go to starbucks or you know just have coffee and chat with friends but yeah that 's not the kind of gimmick e   not the kind of gimmick that you go to bars you get to meet people you get to dance boys especially  are you trying to tell me that  yeah  that 's what i 'm pointing out boys  i love boys i miss boys me i don't laughter  of course of course i don't have to miss boys or else my husband is gonna kill me break in the recording  hey you 've been out of a relationship in almost a year so don't you miss it you know what do you miss most about it well somebody being there for you yeah what else it kind of bites me once in a while the loneliness yeah but it 's a good thing that i have my friends we 're back again to friends yeah chuckle  yeah 'cause uh they 've done a lot of things for me since i split up with my ex uh uhm  3 words i 'm just taking care of someone worrying for someone can't you do can't you just do that to your friends yeah but you know it 's different nah i understand i understand   the way you care for your friends is different from the way you care for a boyfriend  uh uhm  uh uhm like the way you care for your mom or your dad and my baby definitely   yeah  so i guess hopefully i 'll someone would come along sooner or later speaker a laughs hopefully sooner well good luck   like this saturday  laughter what are you doing about it nothing i mean do you go to bars and go look for guys  i mean   yeah  no i don't look for it 'cause i don't believe that you should look for it it just yeah it just comes along i i do believe in destiny you know love is not forced yeah it just grows  can't force someone to love you i 'm just waiting for the this magical thing that i feel like the way i felt with my past relationships what is it to that magic thing people always tell me that you have to feel the magic well definitely i 've felt it with my husband but why speaker b laughs why why do people place too much importance on that can't they see that when you get married and the routine gets to you it 's not gonna be that magical anymore yeah but   don't you realize that it 's gonna be a routinary thing i wouldn't know that 'cause i 'm not yet married well i 'm telling you you know that 's why i 'm still into the magical thing you know well it 's so good to be like that well i mean experience is the best teacher so i haven't experienced getting married i mean i 'm not yet married so i wouldn't know   yeah i know break in the recording  well enough of that magical thingy so what do you fear most in life fear well what i fear most is death why i don't know   everybody will die someday   yeah i know but just the thought of losing someone you love   yeah yeah someone i love and i mean not seeing that person every day not being able to talk to that person anymore yeah   not being able to talk to that person or touch that person it it really gets into me and also   well  what also one of my fears is also fears is also being lonely being lonely yeah i just don't want to be alone  it 's hard being alone definitely like they said no man is an island  yeah that 's right as for me i i fear snakes i hate them i despise them for besides that i would i fear what i fear the most is not being able to be a good mother or wife  it 's not like there are books you could follow or you know uhm   yeah unlike in cookbooks you just follow the instructions   yeah follow the instructions get the ingredients and yeah voila it 's there  life is really like that you just have to do what you have to do yeah do what you think is right do things that you think will make you happy make do with what you have yeah hey i have a question for you what uh what do you think about teenagers nowadays were you that wild back then no i know i wasn't yeah no i mean teenagers nowadays are very extreme like  at thirteen at twelve years old they get to have a boyfriend smoke drink do drugs have sex yeah although i did those things but not that early yeah not that early at the age around seventeen after high school uh-huh but definitely not grade school break in the recording  what about getting married so when do you plan to get married well uhm around twenty-four to twenty-six i mean   why so late well nowadays it 's really hard to make a living and yeah i know   i think you have to be financially stable emotionally stable at the same time to get into such things so   definitely   yes  you have to be mature in order to be married to somebody not mature  yeah  yeah 'cause that 's hard it takes a lot of responsibility to get into one it 's a very serious thing it 's a lifetime thing so it 's a lifetime commitment actually   yeah so you really have to think about it uhm what else is holding you back  finding uh the right kind of guy laughter  yeah same thing same thing as before it 's finding the right person i mean it 's easy to look no it 's easy to look for the the person but looking for the right person the person who   you believe in such things the right person the right man the right one   yeah as i mentioned earlier i still believe in those things i still believe that there is such thing as as i i mentioned before the magic thing uh uhm and uh you know you just feel it once it 's there it 's there i don't know i 'm not sure  how about soul mates well i do believe in soul mates but for me soul mates comes in different aspects   forms  yeah yeah different kinds of relationships also like uh uhm friendships yeah your soul mate can be your mom it can be your brother or even a friend yeah it 's just someone who you feel close to somebody you can connect with yeah  so how 's your married life it 's okay it 's not that it 's not what i expected it would be but it 's definitely great having someone beside you and everything and having a kid to light up your life ang corny laughter  anyway but it 's true you know yeah it 's true even if you 're tired and everything when you get home you see that smile in your kid well it erases all the tiredness away ye and i can see that i can see how how hard it is to take care of a kid and a husband at the same time but at the same time i also see the brighter side of it you know   yeah  it makes you glow it gives you more uhm sort of inspiration to do things yeah definitely that 's one of the things that you should remember when getting married  that 's why  don't just focus on the bad side but you know try try to focus on the good side not dwell on the bad yeah in order for you to have a good marriage uh that i 'd know in time i think i have to look for the person first before i begin to think about those other things but sometimes it 's better to be ready for those things like me it wasn't planned right so i was it was uhm on the spur of the moment chuckle  yeah but i think it 's more it 's more of a case to case basis like uh uhm for you it came earlier oh right yeah yeah uh uhm like when i was younger i was expecting that i 'd get married at the age of twenty-two but then your dad says laughter   but then now i 'm twenty-two years old  and not yet married  it 's like  yeah and you don't have a boyfriend yet  it 's now i realize that i 'm not ready uh uhm that i have so many things   you still have a lot to experience   yeah so i guess it 's really it 's what you call uhm right time and right place uh uhm you have to uhm assess all of the possibilities first before you get married 'cause it 's one of uh it 's one hell of a job to be married and to take care of a kid
Philippines	what do you want to talk about  1 word speaker a laughs  actually you start it off 'cause you are just bothering me ha ha go for the first question i 'm ready to answer let 's talk about our trips abroad trips abroad actually i 'm going to philadelphia oh don't brag about it hopefully on sometime this week if ever i get my visa then  laughter  'cause my friend is going there on sunday and i 'm not and he 's really he really wants me to go with him because he doesn't know his way around disneyland how about you   so it 's it 's his first time yup it 's dan 's first time in the states and dan and i planned ourselves our trip to the states our fly backs speaker a laughs the states we 're going to the bus trips we 're going to the hotel fares   who 's gonna pay for this the office the office will pay everything   but the but during the course of the training  dur during the course of the training but after that which is around april fourteen we will be going on our own using our own money which frankly is not that much that hurts your mom why would that hurt my mom because she 's gonna spend for you my mom 's not gonna spend for me that 's all my savings in my bank how about our  forget it our what forget it forget what  ha  nothing nothing what how about our future i thought you were saving for our you know for what for i don't know laughter  say it come on say it for our wedding so-called wedding and then look she 's bragging about our wedding which is so funny i can save for my wedding i hopefully get assigned to some project in the u k but aren't you thankful that you are in the per diem basis not allowance yeah that 's cool actually because being on an allowance is really a hassle you have to take note of all your expenses you have to jot it down and after the training you have to return to the office and report each and every single cent that you 've spent so what 's the minimum uh allowance you get speak louder sorry what 's the minimum allowance from the off the office so the for the standard allowance for people going to the states it is forty-four dollars a day that would include everything from breakfast lunch dinner laundry everything  so  okay so meaning that per diem basis means that if you are if you 're if you are going to spend only ten bucks a day so   i get to keep all thirty-four dollars   yeah  wow yup wow but that 's small compared to the per diem we get when we are assigned to hong kong  you were   it 's close to sixty-six dollars that was when dan was assigned to hong kong that was the standard per diem   you were there  i wasn't there why 'cause i wasn't there 'cause i 'm here the time when we were in hong kong it was training   oh   you said uh okay and it was on actual expenses unfortunately when you were picked up  yeah they didn't give me they just gave me one hundred dollars for allowance which is kinda very very very small okay okay what 's your next question how about you have you gone to

Philippines	explain it for me peer pressure is uhm getting influenced by your friends it 's like when your friends try to tell you to do this or that and you think that it really isn't right it 's like you since they are your friends you go along with the flow and you just you just do what they say so uhm they they won't be able to tell you that you are chicken or something i think i think i also feel the same way about it uhm i think that peer pressure is very very common common now i mean e each every every any person goes through this you know and it 's just like yeah your friends telling you to do something that you 're not sure of doing but you end up doing it and then later you regret doing it it 's usually that 's usually the case for a any person any student  yeah  so uh do you do you have any experiences that can be related to to this topic 'cause i do but you first   yeah  i asked you first okay i have i have some actually many but i 'll just state one like there was this time when it was our lunch break i wait at wendy 's and speaker clears throat one of my friends just spurted out that what if we cut class and we watch this movie i thi i heard it 's nice then speaker clears throat all of sudden uhm each one of us gave in and except except one of my friend i think uhm the pressure really was on my friend because uhm she really didn't want to cut class because she besides that she liked that class she never cut class in her life so uhm there the pressure was there and at the end uhm she was able to control herself so she really didn't give in but we did and after watching that movie we really felt so guilty all of us felt so guilty because after that when we went to our next class they told us that we had a test in that class that 's why we really regretted what we did how about you i have this friend who always cuts i mean me i don't really like the feeling of cutting classes   cutting class  yeah uhm one time uhm we i ha we we were gonna have this test this long test but you know i wasn't able to study for it so i was thinking if if i should just not go to class since you did not study for it  yes  yeah since i didn't study for it then my my cl all along my class my classmate was also thinking of the same thing yeah so i wasn't really considering that that o considering cutting class but then my friend forced me into it she she she forced me to do it  so we en yeah laughter   did you  we ended up cutting class then the next the next meet the next meeting uhm i found out that that the test was really easy  meeting   oh shit   it was open notes so i really regretted doing it but then uhm our our teacher gave me another chance and you know he gave me the same test  the same kind of test  yeah  so it was really easy  it was okay   yeah it 's good that it 's good that your teacher gave you the same kind of test laughter   yeah  i mean uh i wonder what why do you think these things happen to us i mean why   how friends pressure us too much yeah it 's maybe because uhm it really depends on us if if we are that uh weak not that really weak but if we really give in at once to our friends 'cause sometimes uhm even though we know that this thing is not right we still do it for the sake of our friends since uhm we stay together then and if we don't go with them they might say things about us but that 's not the nice part of it we really should have our own principles  how about you i think yeah it depends on the person and you know sometimes i think if if if peer if there wasn't peer pressure life would be boring boring so boring   i yeah laughter  i mean i i i believe that it 's so easy to do the the wrong thing rather than doing the right thing 'cause it 's more exciting  yes   yeah laughter  there and uhm oh why why do you why do you think your your friends pressure you why why i mean why do they yeah i don't know maybe chuckle maybe  they just want to some   they just want to do it yeah they just want to be with you yeah uh yeah   that 's it  they wanna do something different or if they wanna do something bad they want someone to be with them yeah because   so that it sh it 's so that the blame yeah the the blame would be on all of you yeah and not only on that person yeah i think that 's it how do you feel after being pressured after if i if i really liked what i did uhm laughter of course i enjoyed doing it but after when i think about it i really feel guilty but what can i do i did it already so there 's nothing i can do me it really depends on on what i did of course i i feel bad but then i think of the the excitement i felt when i experienced that certain thing  yeah laughter  'cause sometimes you do something that you know it really isn't right but you really enjoyed doing it  yeah   especially if you 're with your friends yeah and i have this one but then i had this one experience i cut class and then   for what  uhm to watch a movie speaker b laughs the same with you then we had fun but when i got home i really felt bad and i yeah i told myself that i 'd never cut but still i i  you do it  i sometimes sometimes laughter  still cut there uhm these things like peer peer pressure usually leads to bad things really major majorly bad things like uhm preg pre-marital sex  yeah   yeah  yeah you know also also drugs and a lot a lot more things yeah and can you imagine i mean if you were if you got pregnant at an early age  yeah i really can't   what will happen to your future yeah i really i really don't get how how some teenagers uhm especially in the states uhm have sex like under eighteen like yeah and they even they even think it 's normal for them and if you if you don't if if you 're not a virgin anymore you 're you 're not in   you 're not in  you 're not a part of the the the the really popular people in in school  yeah  i i really don't get the point yeah it 's yeah you 're right there and you know sex is something that you really should do uhm at the right age at the right time when you 're married when you 're stable in life when you really have when you planned everything else out you know it just it just shouldn't be like oh let 's do it tonight so our friends would laughter our friends would think we 're cool like like that laughter  yeah i also think so i mean sex is nothing it 's not like something you just   it 's not like everything  yeah it 's not like something that you just have and you can just give it away yeah laughter  i mean virginity is not like that it 's really something sacred   sacred yeah yeah i i i also believe in that i mean it would be better for a person to to have sex when she 's already with someone and she is already married not i i mean not not even not even extra marital yeah affairs but you know with someone who she really loves it 's nothing that it 's it 's not it 's not something that you just give it away it 's it 's   yeah it 's nothing to brag about yeah it 's it 's just it 's something 's yeah that 's what they say it 's something sacred it 's really some   well i i hate guys who who think of sex as everything they think of sex as their life you know yeah like yeah yeah laughter you know some some people when when they think they love a person they think that uhm when they have sex with each other  it will make the relationship more strong i i really don't think that that 's true 'cause if you love a person uhm you can wait for each other you know if your love is really uhm pure and honest how sex is not sex is nothing yeah it is it is yeah i i believe in that also i mean some guys ay most of the guys they even look for sex first  yeah   they don't even think of even if they don't love the person they just wanna do it with that person i mean i believe it 's really lust it 's not love love anymore it 's not love yeah it really isn't love yeah break in the recording  what do you think about you know people who just get into drugs they just you know they get they get influenced to do drugs they get pressured by their friends with to do drugs that 's really yeah a really blame   yeah yeah yeah   thing i don't know for me i mean how can you not control yourself and what 's with the drugs what can it what what good can it do for you yeah what good can it do to you i mean you get what you get insane you get high your your nerve cells break down   yeah  get destroyed yeah decrease in number yeah and you get your your your it 's like you kill yourself uhm faster if you do drugs i don i also don't get it why people do drugs maybe yeah i know it 's certainly because of peer pressure but why do they still do it if they know that uhm a lot a lot of people really die because of drugs  yeah  and their life gets so ruined   miserable  yeah get really terrib it 's terrible i mean people just end up you know in the streets  yeah  uhm doing nothing instead of them working they just do drugs like the rugby boys under the bridges  yeah and   yeah you know i really every time most of the time we pass by that bridge i don't know what bridge that is anyway under the bridge i can see a lot of young boys uhm  i think those doing doing that that those stuff you know i think those boys do drugs i mean specifically rugby 'cause they have so many problems and you know they don't have money to to buy food and they 're really hungry so they just you know they just do drugs to forget forget their hunger forget their problems   problems  but still i mean they can   they 're not excused  yeah it 's no excuse i mean they can they can look for a job they 're not they 're not disabled  yeah  i mean imagine disabled people they 're disabled they 're they they like one one person one disabled person lacks a hand but still that person you know wor would work if if he or she had a chance yeah i you know uhm but maybe because those young young boys uhm do do those drugs because they don't have money but still it 's no excuse on why why why they should do it they could look they could look for jobs even though they 're uneducated like uhm there are a lot of programs in the government that give jobs to those uhm not only poor boys all people all poor people yeah but what about those rich kids kids i mean they they all they have all the money to buy drugs i mean but still they don't even uhm you know they don't   yeah   engage in those stuff they shouldn't they shouldn't engage in those stuff  i mean they have their future ahead of them
Philippines	i 've heard of this restaurant where they serve uhm california pizza what exactly are california pizzas i suppose they are pizzas that are made from ingredients taken from california or they 're pizzas based on california recipes it 's not because of the size i don't kno  maybe it 's larger is there a california size  what about in california pizza kitchen you ate there the other day right  how were their pizzas well i think it it it 's mostly about the california lifestyle or so it 's the flavor of the pizza i think it 's the flavor of the pizza  what do they have   or the character of of a californian which is i suppose ambiguous because it 's a mix of western and asian 1 word  rowdy bunch chuckle  a rowdy bunch it 's a rowdy bunch of ingredients so uh i think that 's that 's why they call it california pizza it 's uh it 's a hodgepodge of of of of of influences and where do pizzas really come from anyway i think they originated from italy   from italy chuckle  yes but pizza what 's what 's the what 's the root word of pizza  is pizza like a piazza no i don't think so uh okay   pizza  what does pizza mean is it a piece does pizza mean  piz it 's a piece of a pie  a round  it 's a piece of a pie i i don't know i 'm just guessing uh okay well ma maybe it 's because i think it 's it 's uh well it 's probably the the uh the way italians would do the uh like to have their round bread i suppose but i 've eaten italian pizzas and they 're not round  they 're actually square  oh really  okay so i guess  or sort of rectangular   but the popular  well does it also depend on the the location or the the place where it originated i mean there are i 'm not too sure because of the many regions in italy yeah there are many uh there should be many types of pizzas according to the different regions i know there are different types of pizzas in terms of what you put inside the pizza or what you put on a pizza on top of a pizza  on top  but in terms of shape i think pizza means simply means the type of bread it 's like a pita flour-based bread   actually it 's flat nga e   it 's your thin crust not the thick one  yeah  yeah so uh it 's more of the bread   maybe the americans made uh did the uh popularized some form of yes piz another yeast another bread to make pizza another kind of dough that 's why we have our pizzas right now and i guess it 's also the the kind of of of treating the dough don't they throw the dough in the air and clip it in and punch it in   yeah   but they usually roll it out thinly  and twirl it  but  uh uhm don't they do that with pizzas i mean do you do you remember the the the that restaurant the italian village  pizza dough   uhm   in quezon avenue quezon avenue and also one in i think in in edsa  uh uhm  they they originated italian pizza here uh uhm they popularized italian pizzas before shakey 's came out here   but they they serve thick crust pizzas they serve all kinds of pizzas but the point is they popularized pizza in the philippines uh i didn't know even before shakey 's yeah even before shakey 's even before shakey shook what 's shakey shook shakey shook the pizza uh-huh  1 word shakey 's speaker a chuckles  okay so what else uhm about pizzas pizzas and uh  what else well the italians also have aside from don't pasta come from flour as well yeah they do okay so but did you know that pasta originated from china it didn't really   yes  i think marco polo   as noodles  yeah marco polo   as noodles and then marco polo brought the same concept but instead of using  to  is marco polo italian  no he was portuguese was he por   he was   portuguese di ba  he was portuguese okay i think he was portugese so what were we what were we talking about i think we were talking about pastas pastas uhm it originally came from italy ay china as noodles right  china  yeah and then marco polo brought it to italy yeah and they used flour instead of using rice rice yeah yeah uh uhm well and then the italians popularized it but i think i suppose well there are the chinese also have been   popularized noodles yeah and i think they also have uh different recipes for different kinds of noodles yes they have it in soup  there there there are rice noodles glass noodles uh uhm uhm egg noodles uh uhm okay i thought it was how you use them yeah but but they have different kinds of recipes for that don't they   uh uhm  yes they do uhm i think the chinese are more adventurous and more innovative in terms of their recipes in the world i think they are the chinese i think so i mean they have different recipes for different kinds of of of of uh food or ingredient they almost they use almost everything in uh can't you say the same for filipinos  for example in   not really  if you look at the recipe yeah you   if you have your pig you can eat everything yes but if you look at the chinese recipe or the chinese if you go to a chinese restaurant for example they have more choices rather than filipinos in terms of of their uhm food like uh and i think they i think but they only they are equally as as uh as uh uhm they 're equally as as uh adventurous in terms of their recipes compared to the thais well the thais have chinese influences as well but they usually use the same cooking method   they use  no no not really   where they stir-fry steam not really but the ingredients they use are the chinese are more have more ingredients  adventurous  they they uh they uh they they 're tastier they have var varieties of of of uh of ways of cooking things like uh i i can also say the same thing for italians i think it depends on   not really i don't think italians are the sa the same as uh the chinese i think  why   yes  chinese have more ingredients rather than the italians the italians are well they 're typically they have their olive oil there 's tomatoes the garlic  western meals  exactly they have that the anchovies the capers but that 's basically it  yeah   yes but chinese have wansoy   i can see your point  they have uh they use ginger a lot they use garlic they use onions a lot they use cornstarch a lot they use uh soy sauce sesame seed oil uhm but don't they usually taste the same  1 word oil  no i don't know i don't think so i don't think so there 's this szechwan style of cooking there 's a mandarin style of cooking   what 's the szechwan style of cooking   szechwan i think is more uh spicy uh uhm and more darker in color presentation as compared to the cantonese which is more based on cornstarch and i think it is more uh you mean the sauce is like the one that is very   sauce-based  yes uh uhm very sauce-based the mandarin i think is is is uh is with i think the mandarin is because steamed the dumplings  the mandarin cooking i think is primarily served for kings and therefore they 're more uh   really  i think so i 've never really read anything about chinese cooking   it 's very interesting if you if you look into uh uhm chinese cooking the way they prepare uh their their food uh it 's sort of a ritual uhm because there 's a certain uh cultural value attached to on their their food  well  aren't the french supposedly the the the parang the father of all cuisines i don't think so uh well that 's because you know westerners they they tend to they 're very ethnocentric they think that they are the the superior race or superior culture  yeah  uh uhm i don't think so but when it comes i think to food i think it 's the chinese that are more more uh adroit what do you mean they 're more adaptive they 're more uh innovative they 're uh they they they tend to use ingredients in so many ways they they easily modify their their recipes plus the fact also that the chinese enjoy their food a lot i think rather than the than the french uh they have the classic recipes but that 's about it i think uh any deviations they usually do and i think it 's because also of a certain form of an elite culture or class attributed the french to be the uh the world class cuisine which i i really don't uh agree or subscribe to i think it 's the chinese and i think what we know here in the philippines is is uh is nothing compared to to what the chinese really can do in terms of their food or in terms of real chinese cooking i suppose that when one goes to beijing or or peking or hunan or or any other chinese province they discover a whole different world of cooking  uh uhm  i can't say that for filipinos because you tend to see the same thing wherever you go uh uhm although it 's the kapampangans that are known to be more of the cuisine type uh uhm but that 's about it for example can you think of any   how about the bicolanos for the bicolanos it 's like this you go to the north you the ilocos region   the ilocanos  you have the you have you have   pinak- pakbet  you have signature recipes uh uhm  pinakbet uhm dinengdeng uh pinikpikan   that pork one that pork  bagnet   bagnet  you have those when you go to pampanga oh you have a lot of recipes what do you call those crickets that they eat   cucaracha no kutkut ku i don't know uh you go to bicol you talk about bicol express what exactly is bicol express i think it 's chili peppers so it 's any kind of it 's chili peppers cooked in in ground pork and uh  ingredient  it 's always ground pork   coconut milk  i think ground pork because uh pork is the more popular   it 's like your sisig but it 's with gata   no yeah but no this is ground pork is just the the secondary ingredient it 's really the chopped chilies that 's the main ingredient so you 're eating chilies you 're actually eating chilies i thought it was just like   and the oil that 's coming ou the oil used for saut&eacute;ing comes from the pork that 's simply it oh and then you put that   i always thought bicol express was you put that away you mix it with uh   like pinakbet  with uh coconut milk which is the signature bicol uh ingredient  uhm   okay  so if you don't want pork you can put shrimps if that 's what you want you could put shrimps yes you could put beef uh uhm you can put uh vegetables if that 's what i want other vegetables or you can put uh chopped fish squid but uh the basic ingredient is chopped chili and and coconut milk  uh uhm   uh uhm  uhm getting back to what we were talking about back to the chinese and pasta no we were talking about uhm california pizza because you told me that in the philippines you have in each region you have this signature dish yes apparently if you go to mindanao there isn't really any signature dish in mindanao in mindanao you stop in and you actually stop in in the visayas   bacolod  the visayas where you get the uh grilled uh food  uh uhm  and the dried fish the dried fish what 's the what 's the one you usually buy from cebu  danggit   danggit  but that 's about it i mean there isn't much uh uhm innovative recipes or uh different recipes or a variety of recipes  and why is that  one thing i think is because we have very little ingredients to well we have a lot of ingredients but they 're mostly used in in in uh the same manner if you compare to chin china is such a big country and uh

Philippines	yo yo bles yeah you know i talked with honey last night so what time did honey call you up i called her at around maybe eleven at night uh okay why what 's about that nothing it 's just that she called me up to ask me about our plans for today well honey told me that she was offended by sharina 's comment kasi you know about the ginger spice issue yes about the ginger issue what 's so offensive about that well clears throat honey said that she doesn't like ginger is that it no i mean she told me that she wished she said that scary is kinda sexy and sharina is not but that would be cruel i don't know so honey just shut her mouth why did she get offended by sharina 's comment that she could be ginger spice uh uh i don't know what 's wrong with geri i like geri i hate geri you hate geri i like geri she 's nice no she 's not she 's not nice how can you prove that i hate what she wears always she wears almost nothing yeah and you hate that of course i hate that well i like sporty better sporty uh uhm well she 's too sporty for me i like posh more i also don't like posh she is too too too too too posh for me that 's why they call her posh hey i have a story to tell you uhm what 's that clears throat  i got it from a magazine well it 's a distorted version of one of the most famous fairy tales uhm but i won't tell you what the fairy tale is you 've got to guess what 's that okay so here it is  there is this kingdom see of course when you say kingdom there is a king and there 's a queen right uh-huh and it so happens that this king and queen they have this little cutie cutie pie baby it boy or girl it 's a baby girl okay and so during birth the queen died so natural tendency for a male the king remarried so he married this beautiful peasant woman so the king and queen and the new queen that is they took care of the baby uhm the queen kinda raised the princess as her own so for a while the king   wait wait wait is that cinderella nah not cinderella bad guess  okay  okay so the king and queen hey i said king and queen there 's no king there 's no queen in cinderella laughter  but there 's a mother a stepmother yeah but i never mentioned that they had two stepsisters with them uh okay continue with your story okay so for a while the king and queen were happy with their lives so the kingdom was peaceful as in there was no war no fighting etcetera so the child grew up the little princess she grew up to become very pretty wait wait where 's the prince what prince  do you think clears throat if there 's a princess so there should be a prince okay so the prince comes in later in her life oh okay okay okay so the king grew weak as the child grew up do you get what i mean okay so the king started to age so as time went on as in years passed by the king became bedridden what bedridden as in he couldn't do things for himself he had to be in bed all the time have servants take care of him paralyzed sort of paralyzed so he had no she noticed scars all over the king 's body and stuff break in the recording and blah blah blah blah blah blah blah he knows stuff like that break in recording actually healed but then there were lots of them all over his body after a few months the king died so uh the whole kingdom was sorrowful because their king was already gone so  what 's that noise i don't know this building is too much okay so after the king 's death of course the child the princess the tendency of the child is to become sad because her father is already dead right  uh-huh  uh-huh okay so the the child the little princess she came to the queen 's bedroom uh uhm so the queen understanding the situation that the child is in she openly comforted the child uhm she hugged the princess you know comforted her but then you know what happened uhm what well the princess bit her why don't know it 's just said in the story that the princess bit her  and then you know what the princess did what well she just sucked blood from the wound the queen sucked blood from the wound no the child why is she a dracula or something i don't know but then the child kept on sucking blood from the queen 's wound so the queen fainted at the sight that the ch the little child was sucking blood from her arm so next morning when the queen woke up uhm she was at the foot of her bed  the queen yeah because she fainted right so when she woke up she saw that there was a faint scar where at her arm where the little child the princess was sucking last night  how old is that princess the princess is about fourteen fifteen or sixteen uh okay so when the queen saw that scar at her arm she was scared because she remembered that the the king remember the king uh uhm he had scars all over his body before he became bedridden oh so what she concluded was that the little child was responsible for the king 's death so uhm she steered clear of the princess  she   wait wait wait is the queen also bedridden by then no remember she was only bitten once oh so what she did was she stayed away from the princess she tried avoiding avoiding the princess because she didn't want to end up like the king as in dead okay so she barricaded her doors at night so that the princess couldn't get in and suck more blood from her where did the princess go well the princess stayed at her quarters at her bedroom of course but then they always found these animals as in deers uhm little birds dead without a trace of blood in their body left okay so one day the queen as scared as frightened as she was because she has power like in poligov course code for politics and government   wait wait wait that 's a fairy tale right yeah i told you it was a twisted version okay so one day she ord   oh oh it 's raining uh uh i hate the rain because my cupcake gets wet 'no  okay back to the fairy tale okay so one day she ordered a huntsman to take the princess to the forest uh uhm because she has power right uh okay so so she ordered the huntsman to take the heart of the princess you know take it back to her after he kills her you know i think i heard about that you know the taking of the heart and then   okay so what fairy tale is it i don't know speaker b laughs  uh you don't know uh how can you be like that okay let 's continue with the story so the huntsman of course he will do the job for a price as in lots of gold jewelry  uh uhm  wait wait i know the hunts the huntsman right the huntsman didn't get the heart of the princess  yeah  uh that was in the other story this is the twisted version remember so the huntsman took the princess to the forest and then he did take the heart and then he brought it back to the queen and then the queen well she hung the heart over her dresser  she 's so cruel  so she 's  uhm you might say that so she hung the heart at her dresser and then the funny thing the horrifying thing is the heart continued beating even without the body without a blood without blood it just continued beating and beating and beating for years okay let 's go back to okay so the huntsman killed the princess right so there were dwarfs who found the body of the princess uh it 's like snow white yeah you finally got it okay so it is a twisted version of snow white so there were dwarfs who found the body of the princess and you know what they did what they built a coffin huh then   okay so they built a coffin for the dead princess and   i know what happened next okay and then after that uh maybe a year later or something something and then the prince will come okay so uhm it goes like that but you missed a lot of details okay so here it is so they built this coffin for the princess it was made of glass as in all glass so they carried her coffin up to a hill so they left their coffin there so that uhm people could see her so after a few years as you said after a few re a few years a prince came wait wait wait this is i think the dwarfs don't know snow white yeah they don't know snow white in this story in my story okay well why did they build a coffin for her because they pitied her because she was dead uh okay okay so a prince came to the kingdom so what happened was that this prince he was a weird prince  you know why why because he didn't wait wait wait is he like your cupcake no he 's not like my cupcake  oh okay   he 's weird okay weird okay laughter  okay so what what happened was hey stop it okay i 'm losing my concentration here i 'm trying to tell a beautiful story   wait wait wait you know i think prince prince a prince look like ano tall and then white and then have uh long hair and then you know everything kind of like so what so he smiles   but but but he 's not cute okay oh my okay continue with your story   okay let 's continue i 'll get back at you later okay so the prince he was weird because he was like what you mentioned a dracula uhm no not really a dracula but he was extremely pale and is he the dracula no he 's not the dracula he is extremely pale and he 's eerily silent he 's always silent and then   yeah yeah like my prince who 's always silent so what happened was like this uhm the prince and the queen had an affair  but the weird thing is the prince didn't want any motion uhm what motion  sigh motion he didn't want the queen to move as they were uh okay  dali as they were whispers having intercourse uh okay laughter  okay so that 's the weird part okay the prince the prince didn't want the queen to move so the prince and the queen did something yeah they had an affair oh okay so the queen wait wait how old how old is that prince the prince is about twenty and then the queen the queen is about twenty-eight oh because she 's a stepmother remember oh stepmother yeah   okay so the queen kept on squirming she kept on moving so the prince he was angry he became angry because the queen didn't follow his orders you know to keep still so what he did was he left the castle so he left the castle  uhm  wait wait wait a while ago it is raining but now it 's not good for us okay okay so he left the castle and he he traveled the kingdom as in he went through the forest and then that 's where he found the princess princess snow white oh snow white so he was shall we say enchanted by the beauty of snow white so what he did was he he made love with her and because snow white 's dead she kept still uh oh okay so she kept still because she was already dead

Philippines	good morning lulu good morning li uh lito how are you today well i 'm fine thank you but the rains are quite bad uh did you experience any traffic problems on the way to the office apparently there are less people traveling now because of the weather uh i heard in the news that uh this morning the elementary and high school uh students uh are are excused to go to the school right now but in certain areas i think only not not in the entire uh n c r = national capital region but in certain areas like manila malabon navotas marikina but i think in para&ntilde;aque there is still school quezon city also has school well last night the weather the the rain was so hard and uh it caused a lot of flood our street was flooded again i think this is basically because of the typhoon that got stuck in uh the balintang channel it hasn't moved and it has been uh triggering the monsoon in manila even though we are not covered by typhoon signal number one but this weather disturbance uh uh is quite quite uh much better compared to last year 'no  i think last year we experienced much much worse uh uh rainfall 'no when we had a lot of big floods but i think this one is also a major disaster because so many towns in bulacan are under water up to now and many believe that the water will stay there for some time it has not receded well in uh pampanga also i think there is again uh a report about a problem on road road uh uh prob uh you know the the water is uh the bridges are you know are almost being overflowed overflowed uh  all the roads are flooded  washed away yeah  lahar has been washed away again  any problems on your uh what about your farm lits it 's under water  laughter well uh in zambales i think it 's a high high area do you do we experience uh flooding in that area well my area is in the mountains so there 's no flooding but uh if the rains continue the la you know the land becomes very soaked in water and we could say it 's water-logged and some of the it 's not stable anymore some of the loose soil uh slide down in the slope too much water will destroy your crops you mean to say that there are a lot of cut trees also in your area no actually we are planting trees we are allocating one hectare just for the forest we are reforesting the place and uh it will be a very it will be high density uh we are putting hardwood trees in that uh particular hectare but uh is it difficult to reach your area when it 's uh rainy season or well there 's a road you can reach the area but it 's difficult to walk in the farm because of the it 's a slope so you could slide but the problem is uh you have to pass pampanga in order to reach zambales  uh  we go via pangasinan pangasinan but it 's a long way e  uh you add one and a half hours to the trip just to reach your place yes but uh during this time i don't think the fruits uh prices are down because of uh of this weather many crops will be damaged so i assume uh you have to pay a high price for your vegetables i think even fishponds uh have problems right now overflowing  overf yeah so many many of the neighbors will be very happy because they can get fish for free ha  uhm did you see uh mr the the president uh looking at the uh manila bay area  there is so much garbage ha   yeah yeah  yeah that 's right well uh a year ago they had this advertisement saying that if you throw your garbage it 's gonna come back to you   come back  it will come back to you so today uh that has become a reality and the garbage has come back to us  it 's gonna come back to you  i didn't know that uh some of the uh garbage guys are disposing their garbage in the sea ha  people along the squatter area they just dispose their garbage basically the main problem is the attitude this they want to keep themselves clean but they don't take the responsibility of cleaning their environment the i think it 's very typical of filipinos they are very clean with themselves but outside around them they don't maintain it clean you mean they clean themselves without cleaning their surroundings lits it follows sometimes that they don't care whether it reflects your personality once you keep yourself clean you also keep your surroundings clean not really uh they will throw their garbage at their neighbor 's place it is because they live in a surrounding which is not really that clean so naturally it comes you know laughter in the way they live but filipinos normally are clean with themselves they know how to take a bath every day even though they are in the squatter area uh-huh but where they dispose their garbage god knows because the garbage problem is not really a problem that you keep to yourself it 's an it 's an economic and social problem it 's a problem of the the city di ba  how how you dispose of your garbage that 's one reason  talking of  speaking of uh disposing of garbage i think they have opened again the uh this garbage dump in tondo  landfill  smokey smokey mountain smokey mountain yeah  they 're dumping again   because i think uh the the current uh dumping ground in payatas i think is scheduled to be closed so  yes   the one that 's in uh the one that is located in uh near antipolo uhm it 's going to be closed by the end of the year and i think uh the metro manila authority has not found a suitable replacement up to this point in time they were thinking of cavite but uh the i think the local government people there does not allow this to happen because it will cause a lot of environmental problems i think no one nobody likes garbage likes garbage how could they do it in other countries do you do you know of any of the systems that is being done in the other countries well most uh countries they do they have a recycling program where bottles or plastics are stored in or thrown in a special uh disposal area let 's say all bottles are consolidated uh all papers are also consolidated in one area and then these are all recycled and then let 's say organic garbage such as uh kitchen refuse normally it goes to their sewage system because they have what we call uhm digester in their sinks well in the philippines our sewage system exists only in manila and especially in the old part of manila and the rest they don't have the sewage system and the system in manila is an old system way way back pre-war years i think yes it 's pre-war years and that 's why in certain uh houses in malate ermita they don't have uhm septic tanks because it 's all disposed in the sewage system separate the rest of us the rest of the areas make use of the septic tank another thing that uh the problem of manila is the transportation ano  they could not organize themselves in such a way that uh it will be advantageous to the people you know like for example in in other countries they have this uh well organized uh mass transport system mass transport of course we have already started the m t r should be m r t which stands for metro rail transit the l r t light railway transit but uh we need to have more hopefully i think we need to have more i think we have to have good links with this uh rail system when after the people are going down in their station they have connections yeah you know jun how i wish they they had you know built a train along along the south super highway rather than built that skyway because it will be more advantageous if they ever did the train thing yeah but they then i won't be able to bring my car to makati anymore   no need to bring yeah but the other thing i heard that uh ayala is uh thinking of that  yeah  supposed to be that uh that that that pro project yeah supposed to be but i 'd i hope ayala will not change its mind especially now that uh the the oil prices are uncontrollable ha   its mind  yes you know it 's so expensive it 's not easy to bring your i think the the more they raise it the more our economy will be affected uh negatively because it might cause some recession  your car every day  and uh you you can also notice our economy our economic situation right now is not in at its best you can see that the philippine peso has gone down to yes forty-four to one again one u s dollar is in fact uh some of them are projecting that this will go up up to forty-six pesos and this will affect the cost of fuel 'no  yeah because first the cost of money and then the cost also of the oil it 's quite the oil has increased in cost although saudi arabia is trying to produce more to bring down the cost of the oil this will be a domino effect again now when we increase the oil prices prices of goods will go up and then uh the workers will demand then people will demand for more wages right and then what will be the result we will not be competitive in the world market anymore i think we no longer are competitive we 're only good for expensive items or specialty items that can be only produced here but if they cannot be produced here normally the other countries like thailand china indonesia and especially maybe the former communist countries like burma and maybe in the near future north korea will be uh benefiting from the the world market because of the they have lower prices because in the year two zero zero four it 's going to be a global uh world market uh there will be no more import restrictions  whoever can produce th the cheapest and high quality uh will will be able to be the successful one  no more quotas  but i think that 's a very myopic view from the point of view of the of the rich countries what do you mean myopic why because they only look from their own point of view actually the ones who benefit are the rich countries do you mean do you mean   poor countries will become poorer do you mean to say that we should still impose uh import restrictions i believe so  in a way   to protect the local industries in a way that will help us that 's a commitment  what do you mean commitment  commitment if there are quotas i am committed to share this much  uh yes of course because there are still restrictions restraints quantitative limits but if there are no res it 's a global market so everybody is fighting for for his own product who buys the best who buys the cheapest that 's true and uh you can see the development in the uh in the i t ha in the information technology a lot of people are using now the what is called the e commerce the electronic commerce and it 's very popular that uh a lot of companies are putting up their own web websites or web browsers or something like that  uh what do you think do you think even our company i think is uh going to come up with this kind of uh operations wherein the we will put up a web website and then interlink it with our uh business partners like uh like our suppliers like our suppliers and then accessory suppliers you know they can put these goods suppliers they can put input there the latest uh prices   products that they have prices and then the suppliers can uh immediately come up with their own uh selling prices based on those things so you can actually do your shopping using the internet yeah shopping i think is now now more feasible in by using the internet is that what they call on-line shopping  yeah that 's on-line shopping   and it 's cheaper 
Philippines	i suppose so i suppose so  we have no choice laughter  hamburg is not being represented yes it is in north of germany very near denmark isn't it very near uh yes denmark uh the uh how do you call that uh scandi scandinavian countries yes i 've been there twice so when i was there  i suppose you 've been to heidelberg i was there a year ago it 's a beautiful city well it 's a it 's a university town huh yes it 's a universi  how about the the university of leeds is that is leeds supposed to be a town or well leeds used to be an industrial town they produced wool textiles and the university was built because of the woolen industry  uh uhm  oh yes then philosophy evolved and philosophy and literature i heard from uh vic brias that uh the the author of a of our book alistair macintyre yes he 's supposed to have taught in the university of leeds i 've no idea they told me once yes probably probably before i was there how 'd you find that book of uh macintyre it 's good although i had to get used to the language uh it 's not anglo-american so it takes getting used to  it 's very  i uh my comment is that uh i think macintyre is uh getting into a problematic into that problematic of uh what we call postmodernism like that of 1 word  i don't know anything about 1 word  uh-huh postmodernism postmodernism uh although i have heard people mentioning the word but i 've never really word  let me see let me see let me recall how macintyre gets into this problem uh based on this book after virtue that very title after virtue i think it 's postmodernist because virtue you know after virtue what uh it it it gets you into thinking about the the the phase  i think the cultural phase in which something of the past is uh going through a threshold being questioned being transformed and uh precisely at the point where you don't yet know exactly what the what it is that it 's going to be transformed into  now it doesn't uh  well so far somebody told me i 'm not really sure about this you have to correct me then some people say that postmodernism is sort of a critique of all forms of meta-narrative something it 's anti-foundationalist uh i 'm not really sure uh i may be talking my head off yes uh  maybe if we we could say it is anti uhm anti-modernism uhm of course that begs the question of what is modernism it 's a critique of a of the modern spirit and so again the question of uh what is the modern spirit isn't it is it also a going back to the classical 1 word it 's not it 's not it 's not a going back  it 's not  it 's a moving on it 's a it 's going forward without having to i hope without having to lose the heritage of the past because for example this uh book of macintyre while it is it is speaking of something after virtue is contextualizing itself within history isn't it  there 's a great deal of of his history in uh macintyre  well i have to you know think about that you think about it there is however a kind of post-modernism which is uh also anti-history an example will be uhm will be somebody who is nietzschean who is radically negativist  uh so whose postmoder postmodernism could be a sort of umbrella term for a lot of things but they could share certain assumptions is it like that including that but generally it is uhm it is it has a historical dimension because uh we are supposed to be going through through a stage a stage in history in which we are no longer we no longer belong to the modern age in other words the modern age is past in the same way that there was a time when the medieval age was uh was past  and uh we are moving into a new epoch we don't have a name for it yet so we call it post-modern  so what characterizes this as you as you say it new epoch at this point of the game uh the general charac character of this epoch is one of critique the critique of the immediate past noise   i see so there 's something new in i i think post-modernism is uh is optimistic about about the future that there 's something new in the offing  and you can see that even politically because uh everywhere in the world something 's going on right  changes right and left  these are no longer the same as before so new time is a new epoch don't you feel that way  no no not really not really break in recording  are you enjoying your classes  yes oh i enjoy the the the graduate class the graduate class i see i see  hey i hear you have plans to introduce computerized logic teaching in la salle   uh uhm  uh uhm and so that will relieve the teachers to to discuss to discourse more on the philosophical issues involved in logic uh uhm yeah when you come back i think uh we should uh think along those lines design courses and uh 'cause i have done this tradition also with word  'cause when i was in leeds they they they had the they had this logic interaction with with computers and it 's it 's the computer really teaches you how to because if you make some for example if you devise something wrong the computer will give you a feedback it 'll say it 's wrong like that uhm uhm it 's very good uhm we don't have that yet here i know you know it 's raymond 's birthday also yes i heard  so when is the  when is the when is the lunch going to start or are we just waiting we 're just waiting we 're just waiting but the food is here right actually i have had my lunch  you haven't received word from uh where 's that finland finland no i haven't yet i think they 're supposed to deliberate on it after the end of march oh and then you 'll hear from them april may april may and then ju just in case you uh get accepted when you when do you are you supposed to go it 's my choice actually it 's your choice my choice uh-huh you don't want to teach uh for the first term well it depends yeah because uh i 'm not really sure what i want to do yet with my life actually before i was so sure but then after i came back i uh uhm i 'd like to work in government  how 's your work with the c c p it 's tiring it 's always very tiring  laughter what is it that you 're doing actually because i 'm researching in the office of the tribal groups in the philippines the art yeah yes and it 's difficult to research and type it out it 's very tiring uh uhm uh uhm but uh what 's your contract with them is there a stipulation time or well it 's until the end of may oh until the end of may  yeah  yeah it 's until the end of may words  how would you like teaching for the first term graduate school logic oh i 'll i 'll i 'll see about that yeah may june july about may june july  yeah  have you met dr quito  have you talked to her not yet  she isn't dean she 's at l s building if i decided to talk   yes yes on ground floor ground floor  you can actually drop by any time for as long as he doesn't have she does not have a meeting yeah she 'll be very open to you  i enjoyed it very much when she went to england to see words   oo nga daw ano   yeah that was very nice uhm she visited you at the university no she she was in london uh i went down from leeds to london oh is it a distance two hundred fifty miles two hundred fifty miles that 's uh four hundred kilometers uh-huh that 's quite a distance huh yeah but the train is fast two and a half hours two and a half hours yeah fast train  i 'm going to see dr reyes and you left each other there no no i wrote to him oh uh and i so i did you know that both of you were coming this year no i had no idea no idea uh yeah i only knew it when i came in i think that was the friday before the start of term uh-huh and the secretary said that uh words  uh-huh i was supposed to meet uh prof quito in paris oh yeah uh after she visited me she would be going to spain then france and i would see her in paris uh-huh she gave me her address in paris uh-huh but then something came up uh i went to liechtenstein which is a small country between yes yes i went there instead and uhm germany switzerland i sent her a postcard  luxembourg uh luxembourg luxembourg is nice  how long have you been in been there five years or so four and a half four and a half and keith was about the same time i think a bit a bit longer five or seven years   six  there is a in england there is a time limit for the p h d oh it 's four years i see if you 're doing full time four years is the maximum time limit i did it in four and a half because they calculated because i stopped for for a few months and if you don't make it for four years you 're considered words  i see you fail yeah and then uh you don't have an m a there right there is but i think it is because of their educational system because their undergraduate is already very geared towards research so after you finish your undergraduate you can proceed if you have excellent grades you can go straight away to p h d because in p h d in p h d in england we don't have we don't attend any classes we just do research we don't have class  uh uhm uh uhm how nice so   only it was quite disorienting in the first because i am not very much because i i was not part of that system so at first i was a bit disoriented yeah but in the second year i slowly yes  how was the language  the language yorkshire well if they speak with a yorkshire accent you wouldn't know what they 're talking about what is it yorkshire accent what 's that is that a native well it 's not native it 's eng it 's sort of english with a very thick very very strong let me give you an example uh i thought that was me spoken with a yorkshire accent  hoo hoo hoo hoo  i thought that was me  what time do you have twelve thirty twelve thirty i 'm going to the library yes
Philippines	okay good afternoon i 'm here with my friend jun and we 're going to talk about a lot of things especially about jun whom i will interview a little bit so hi jun hello mimi okay so uh today i really want to know more things about you and i would appreciate it if you can be honest enough to tell me your ideas about some of the things that i 'd like for us to talk about is that okay sure okay first i 'd like for you to give me a brief background about your teaching experience uh your experience as a teacher in la salle and then a little bit on your teaching experience before you came to la salle uh can i cite my non-teaching experiences as well yes you may if that 's uh what will make uh an idea or give us an idea of how you came to be who you are right now   alright  okay okay uhm first of all i i 'm a graduate of a b mass communication from f e u in nineteen eighty-seven chuckle okay and then i started my i started my career in advertising as a copywriter and account manager uh uhm oh and by before i move on uhm what does an account manager do in a com advertising   an account manager deals with the client clientele of the advertising agency you know we we the creative department collaborates with the management team of the company and through the account manager  uh uhm  okay and then after working uh in an advertising company what did you do next  i moved on  i moved on as an assist administrative assistant at i- temps  it 's a recruitment agency uh uhm i i got uh ha i have experienced had experienced uh dealing with overseas filipino workers go bound for saudi arabia and i conduct training workshop for them which is i guess   uh uhm   on what topic about about procedures policies dos and don'ts in uh on when migrating to saudi arabia  uhm   uh uhm  and after that i had my first teaching experience at uhm east asia computer college uh uhm that 's in f e u for about uh more than three years uh uhm uh three to four years uh uhm and then i worked there as a part-timer i was in-charge of the language laboratory and while uh while i was pursuing well i was doing my m a at that time i and then i i finished well i finished my m a here in la salle  uh uhm  uh uhm in m a english language education e two years ago two or three and then i while i was working at east asia i was also teaching here part-time so i i i taught uh i taught for about four terms here as a part-timer and then o o other institutions educational institutions i have uh worked with uh include ama ama computer college in caloocan and university of the east caloocan uh for about two years  uh uhm  uh uhm for about two years and then i finally settled here in la salle as a full-timer this is already my second probationary year uh uhm uh so far i 'm enjoying my stay here in la salle  your stay  okay my stay in la salle that 's good but uh let me ask you a question you mentioned about starting uhm in an advertising firm uh uhm and then you moved on to becoming a a a trainor a trainor yeah   for a recruitment agency how come there 's a distinct shift in profession meaning uhm i can't really see you from an advertising firm to become a trainor in a recruitment agency oh how how did the transition happen well it is it is by accident i guess a and also because the the the oppor travel opportunities are there the pay is good so and that 's why i i got attracted with the job uh uhm and i i dealt with foreign principals and i guess it 's somehow related because it the training involves communication  uh uhm  uh uhm communicating dealing with people did you ever get a chance to uh travel by being a trainor yes i i was sent to cagayan cagayan de oro that 's in in uh down south down south yes uh cagayan de oro chuckle  yeah down south  yes   oo in mindanao  and in   o yes and also during my stay in advertising agency i was also sent uh abroad no he uh northern mindanao northern mindanao so the there are travel op there were travel opportunities a and besides i i i have no regrets having an industry experience because i can somehow uh relate what my experience to the experiences in the in the academe uh uhm but let me ask you which is more enjoyable for you the experiences you had outside of the academe or the experiences that you have now that you 're sort of full-time in school  uhm  well my experience as a teacher is fulfilling is very although very demanding uh uhm uh the job entails tedious paperwork but uh so far i 'm not complaining i 'm enjoying every minute of my teaching profession yes you said enjoying but uhm which part of teaching do you enjoy the most oh i enjoy dealing with chuckle uh students like uh molding their minds or helping them become a better person what about the power of being able to control the class don't you enjoy that   yes that 's also another challenge that 's part of the challenge challenge which i enjoy most the ability to persuade the ability to manipulate chuckle or to let other people do what i want them to because i want them to because i care for them  uh uhm   uh uhm  uh uhm okay another question would be now that you 're uh la salle is a research institution uh uhm and uh they 've been uh encouraging us to do research work  in what particular field are you most interested in and uh why  briefly only ha chuckle   i am  i am interested in psycholinguistics okay that 's uh presently i 'm doing uh my dissertation uh uhm on on the cognitive how how mind works uh in terms of the analyzing the ability of the students to detect grammatical error and then to explain  that 's uh or or this is the so-called metalinguistics or  uh uhm  okay so are you saying that this is some sort of an experimental research wherein you will use your classes to be the subjects of your thesis and where your own students will be the ones to determine if they recognize their errors and if they are able to correct their errors yes uh my target subjects or respondents would be my students and of course i 'm also planning to uh to try to have other students other than lasallian students uh okay so when are you planning to start this are you already doing it i 'm at the proposal stage i i hope i 'll be able to present it at the end of the term if not then maybe second term just uh as a matter of curiosity uh isn't pilot testing part of the proposal making or proposal uh you know uh when you 're conceptualizing the proposal isn't piloting it uh going to help you refine your proposal before you actually implement it  yes  no uh because of time constraints i i don't think i can pilot test my questionnaire anymore but what is more important is the refinement or refinement of the paper uh uh relating the concepts together to to make it coherent uh uhm and i can probably do the testing proper after i have presented my proposal okay so as a teacher you don't only teach 'no but you also have some form of social life uh uhm what do you do in your spare time when you 're not in la salle what are your preoccupations well i i am still active with our parish-based choir and i i used to be active with the church with our parish commentators and lectors guild uh uhm and i am a trainor at our parish-based cooperative okay uh other than that are there other leisure activities that you do like do you read a lot do you play sports do you what else do you do aside from being involved in organization work or social work well my my leisure time is spent mostly on reading but if i have extra time i i i get the chance to watch a movie on weekends and then   uh uhm  what sorts of movies do you like speaker b laughs   why are you laughing laughter   well  you don't watch too many movies yes i don't watch too many what was the latest movie that you have watched  mummy   the mummy returns or the first mummy   yes   the mummy returns  uh the mummy returns   the mummy the la the recent movie in the 1 word  so more or less you 're updated din naman pala  uh yes oo during my spare time but uh you know do you have dogs at home pets none you take care of pets we have cats uh neighbors ' cats but we don't actually own them uh uhm uhm what other things uhm recently you traveled to singapore uh uhm what were your impressions about singapore singapore is a very progressive nation compar the philippines is very much left behind in in terms of economy and i i hope the filipino people can really ch will change their attitudes so we can be at par with singapore what is it that struck you as something that is too negative on the filipinos that uh singaporeans are good at well when you compare that when you say that we 're lagging behind that we should improve specifically on which aspect in terms of attitude uh i guess attitude of what  la lack of discipline let 's say work attitude attitude towards traffic dealing with the traffic situation uh attitude uh in terms of punctuality productivity you know filipinos hi have not really set their minds on that that target e  uh uhm break in the recording as a teaching professional what are your plans for yourself here in la salle what do you still want to obtain  my  well my immediate concern is to be able to finish my p h d in applied linguistics degree uh well my target would be abou about 1 word one school year i hope to be able to complete my studies so then after that i can i can pursue other research interests mat like materials development and uh uhm in terms of materials development what sort of mate materials are you interested to develop  so  like uh software i i want to have a compilation of grammatical errors uh philippine english in relation to the standard american usage do you have a lot of experience working with computers yes i i 'm exposed to a computer-working environment like east asia computer college ama computer college and now here   but in terms of programming since you want to do software  programmi  so if that 's software development it means you should have programming language uh experience i 'm i 'm not so good in programming but i have attended several training workshops in the past uh uhm and do you like computers yes i like computers very much although som i find some programming not so user-friendly chuckle  so probably in the future you would want to uh create a program that would satisfy the needs of all types of users from beginners to more advanced users  yes  yes specifically for college students   uh uhm  are you interested to write a book yes in the future chuckle  what kind of a book are you interested to write anything related to language
Philippines	hi rez what are you doing chatting on line why well i need to find a lot of friends right now i need something to do you need something to do why don't you have anything to do right now well i just wanted to do it right now because i planned other things tonight like what like doing a lot of lessons lesson plans for next week for next week oh my goodness you 're so industrious just this week because i will be observed next week uh who will observe you  but  uhm well our coordinator your coordinator what 's a coordinator you should know my friend laughter  i don't know that means the one in charge with a a with a couple of teachers like you do like me are you also being observed with your coordina  uh do you have a coordinator anyway uhm yes sort of we have a year a year level coordinator is that what you call that a grade level i think year level and what 's the other one subject coordinator subject coordinator just one so how was it are they observing you once in a while she 's observing us every once in a while i 've been observed about two times one is informal and the other is formal in the first quarter that 's yeah that 's about it first quarter and then second quarter she 'll be observing us again i don't know when maybe next week people from colegio san agustin will come august twenty-five where  here   here  here they 'll visit s uhm students in grades six and seven uh okay good thing they will not be coming here they will  they will   they will be visiting our classrooms yes just the campus maybe i think just the corridors not really inside the classroom thank god so they 'll be observing you yes classrooms  classes in grade six and grade seven  for  for a period i 'm not sure  there are teachers who are assigned assigned to be observed i do not know they were mentioning about that a while ago in the faculty room okay clears throat that 's on august twenty- five  twenty-five  friday that 's friday this friday already twenty five that 's on friday already uh yeah that 's on friday   you should prepare then i 'll be absent speaker a laughs  that 's a good idea i 'm not feeling well i 'll be absent on friday  laughter i think so too your voice is not that good yes so that would be your excuse so who will handle your class   so tomorrow i 'm not uh on friday yes who 'll handle your class i guess jet will which one jet jet the filipino teacher uh jet he doesn't have any advisory class none good for him good thing they are not uhm asking us to to substitute for them anymore because last time   imagine you would travel from here to not to the main building that 's so far really yeah that was the what do you call that the procedure before  to the new kingdom  uh uhm but now it changed yeah good thing by the subject by the subject and by the level i think no uh if there will be nobody who 's going to substitute from the subject areas that 's the time they get from the level other levels it 's a form it 's a different procedure here right we get substitute teachers by the level not by the subject area  uh by the level  like if there 's an absentee from the senior prep you cannot right prep actually junior prep because they don't have classes in the morning in the afternoon when we have absentees or absent teachers the senior prep substitutes for them uh so only the prep substituting for the prep yeah prep for prep and then grade one two and three i think so you have the same subjects anyway yeah because it 's self-contained same thing with grade one uh uhm grade one is also self- contained but grade two and grade three they are semi-departmental right  grade one  yeah so they substitute by the level by the subject i think by the lev  by the level just the same thing there so how about your let oh chuckle don't remind me  it 's coming by   it 's coming by this august  this uhm this august twenty-seven sunday yes whole day because i got secondary could you believe that i 'm in prep and they gave me secondary but your training is in high school yeah i graduated b s biology uh uhm so that 's why good thing it 's only for it will only last for the whole day because last time when we took the test  yeah  two days right yeah we took it for about two days two days uh uhm uh uhm one whole day for all the general education thing and then the second day which is half day for specialization yeah for our specialization   specialization  so you mean that 's two years ago you mean for the general you have one day and then another half-day for the major yeah your major subjects   major subjects  oh my goodness but it 's different in the elementary why we only have one day uhm even today uh no half-day uh for the elementary   yeah  for the elementary they have half-day secondary we have a whole day to do the test  i think it 's draining is it draining  so it 's the same thing  training for draining for us uh okay 'cause we have to do the test for the whole day what do you think  maybe a bit   you can manage  uh uhm that 's what you 're here for laughter   with grace  no laughter  with grace i doubt oh my goodness it 's quite scary   but don't worry you 're going to pass i hope so we 're praying for that  that 's what   i saw you reviewing with uh with whom   with chloe with chloe and anne uh anne yes because we 're all secondary sc natural science majors   uh uhm  so that 's why you 'll be taking the same things yeah the same school we 'll be taking in p u p uh p u p yes p u p santa mesa santa mesa our rooms are adjacent so we can see each other did you check the place already  after  no but they did find time so you can uhm look for your classroom and if you really belong to that school i actually went to the p r c because my notice didn't what do you call it didn't arrive i wasn't given notice  about what   given the notice about the room assignment uh the room assignment so i had to go to p r c to get my room assignment yeah i did that too when i had to take the test uh really yeah i wasn't able to uh to receive the mail that they yeah the notice uh uhm uh uhm okay so in my case i did not receive any because uh mine was during the p-bet uh-huh so just the notice but i did not get anything from the p r c p r c is nothing yet before it 's uh what was it what institution the commission something civil service commission uh not p not uh p r c yet that time i went to batasan batasan in in quezon city   quezon city so far laughter  that 's where i got my uh results that 's where you got your results too yes they didn't mail you they did but they only gave me the a notice of passing not the real thing   without the percentage  so you want to see the percentage of course  laughter so how did you fare   the yellow the yellow card how did you fare don't ask laughter  why i bet you got high uh nah just average   maybe you 're even the topnotcher laughter  how i wish yee  you even made a courtesy call in metro bank laughter   it 's not possible  i bet you received fifty thousand pesos laughter  if only those things are true i would probably uh buy you what hamburger laughter   ay so cheap plus coke uh hamburger plus coke plus uh add french fries and i 'll be happy fries what fries the curly no the regular ones the regular ones  what else what else well right now are you going there by carpool uh okay we 'll be going there by carpool with the others yes with anne and chloe   how many of you are taking the tests  at p u p we 'll be three anne chloe and i  chloe  okay and then in lyceum there 'll be i think four no three ruby uhm b j and olive   uh lyceum   ruby will still take the test  i thought she had   yes secondary english no i thought she had already taken one last year no she didn't uh because she already uh no she didn't have the education units then so that 's why uh that 's uh okay so she has to complete first the eighteen units   eighteen units of education which we finished last summer actually for the t c p yeah t c p and you 're done with your t c p almost because we specialized what do you mean we took uhm six units for the major because it 's teacher 's certificate program right and then you can get six more units so that you 'll have specialization like we got six units of early childhood uh that 's why you 're taking early childhood with ruby also yes we 'll finish this term so how many units have you earned already eighteen plus six actually we got nineteen because of profe one unit profe 's just one unit what 's that uh professional ethics in education yes and then nineteen plus six so that 's twenty-five uh okay twenty-five units for the t c p yeah t c p with special training in early childhood   that 's before you take the uh board exams before uhm before we take the board exam you have to get eighteen units right but that 's more than eighteen units already yeah that 's more than eighteen units already but we opted to take specialization so that it will jive with our present job but if you have only eighteen units it 's okay it 's okay it 's fine as long as you get the requirements uh uhm we have these requirements in the p r c so for secondary education no no for licensure uh okay for the exams yeah for the exams  that 's it i hope you 're going to uh to bring the bacon laughter  no that 's pressure already you know what did you have packed lunch during that time uh what i didn't have why but we were asked to buy because there was a canteen anyway in the school uh is it open  so  it 's sunday  there was one in our school uh in the in that was i forgot the name of the school but it 's in quezon city also so we were allowed to take the lunch outside uh-huh then uh we were asked to come back one o'clock i guess or one thirty for the test for the remaining tests uh uhm i think we 'll not be allowed to go outside just bring your own baon so it will not be a big problem you know i don't think i 'll be able to eat anyway anyway you 'll have what uh eight o'clock you 'll be starting at eight o'clock no we have to be there before six thirty uh it 's too early maybe it 's seven o'clock seven i think it will start at seven o'clock and the test itself it will end about four maybe or three uh okay i don't know yet because i didn't have the notice so you will have uhm seven to maybe eleven thirty i think so and then twelve to i think one to three or one to four it depends i think it depends on the proctor   just bring your packed lunch and merienda maybe uh-huh candies i can't remember we were given time to have merienda that time what i remember is we only had lunch i think you can take i think yeah you can take merienda during the test but since you 're so nervous engrossed or engrossed with the test you won't have the appetite to eat in my case i didn't remember any merienda i just remember the lunch okay that was nineteen kopong-kopong laughter  in my case i can't take drinks during the exam because by that time i will go outside to go to the comfort room no don't take it so seriously anyway you know yourself if uh you 'll be able to make it or what and with the kind of review you 're doing my goodness because we 're panicking that 's it that 's the very point don't panic
Philippines	since we are all practitioners of meditation in our community maybe it will be of interest to to discuss how we started or why we started the practice of meditation  kuya art uh okay uh well i think uh basically uh i wanted i was uh in the charismatic uh renewal and i uh wanted to search for something deeper as far as my prayer life is concerned so uh one day i was in mass in magallanes and i saw an ad on a christian meditation retreat which uh uh made caught my interest and i decided to sign up for that retreat and uh in that retreat uh fr lawrence freeman was the one who start who started to teach uh uh and share meditation and it intrigued me and as far as ah i was concerned i wanted to see what it would do to me in my life 'no  so i decided to practice that way of praying meditation when was this nineteen   this is in nineteen ninety nineteen ninety eighty-nine or ninety and then uh i decided to tell myself uh i 'll do it for two months religiously as taught to me and see what it will do to me if it changes if i see a lot of changes in me then i 'd con i would continue to practice it so after two months i realized that it was really giving me a lot of insights and a lot of uh depth as far as life was concerned i started to see the other side of the coin so to say so to s  so uh i decided to continue the practice until today uh i 'm still practicing it for the last ten ten years 'no and uh i still try to do it uh religiously twice a day so i and i don't think i intend to stop because i see that it has really given me uh a lot of peace a lot of tranquility a lot of security uh uh and it has brought me closer i think to god and uh i 've come to know god uh the many aspects of god uh in this life so uh i think it 's something that i will not give up and i consider it as my prayer time every time i meditate i took aside this time and say this is god 's time so i devote twenty to thirty minutes in the morning and twenty to thirty minutes in the evening for this so   that is daily practice that is my daily practice but uh on the first time that you did the meditation did you have a guide or did you read books how were you able to sustain two months of uh meditating on your own uh uhm uh did you go to fr lawrence or you mean just by this one talk you were inspired to do this all alone you did not have community you did not have books no uh nothing uh uhm it uh there was no organization yet at that time there was no structure that was the first time fr lawrence gave a retreat here it was a one day actually it was a one day not retreat but a one day recollection on christian meditation and uh i just told myself i 'll really do it for two months and then uh later on i his books came along and i decided to buy some of his books and that 's what uh kept me in the journey and after two months or three months i decided that uh i think there should be a group really that should start to share this and i realized that uh uh maybe about four months later someone called me and told me that they already have a group that had started in don bosco so i decided to go there to don bosco and then as i started to sit and meditate in this group i also started to go out and try to share it with others so then other groups started to come along the way and that 's when christian meditation really started uh ho how about our group what did you when wa when was the group formed well of course this is where we live 'no and uh so with uh it was one of the earliest groups also formed i decided to take along all my friends around me uh and share it with them so this i think this group also started the same time in nineteen ninety in my recollection clears throat it first started with uhm art 's trying uhm making an appointment in uh the parish in merville parish uhm he asked the the parish priest then to if he could give a talk and after the mass after the six p m mass and so after the six p m mass he gave a talk and then we started putting out poster one or two at the church door and uh we or he was able to find the venue that was the knights of columbus   knights of columbus  yeah knights of columbus and there were people and he we started uh just being there and then there were people who read the the poster or who would uhm or who heard his speech his his talk and they would uh go to this session and uh because it was happening weekly uhm shortly after we we started to experience a bonding uh among us so we extended it a little bit more to cover uh bible sharing so originally it started as a pure uh talk on meditation and experience of meditation and then later on as as the participants uh grew uh stayed on longer they they had a hunger for the word and uhm so there was a suggestion that uh we read the the gospel and bi and share but then you were already kuya manny you were you were already complete you were there  well uh in my case uh actually uh excuse me actually even before it started in knights of columbus we already started here in south admiral   south admiral yeah in the chapel and uh of course uh manny being one of my best friends i asked him to join us in the south admiral chapel okay and then it grew after maybe a month in south admiral chapel we moved to knights of columbus the group uh grew bigger as dinggay was saying some people saw it through the posters and uh some people were invited uh as the group became bigger and then you know that was the time that we incorporated through a suggestion of a couple that we incorporated the bible sharing so that uh there 's also more bonding and more activity in that sense you were all charismatics then i was not only kuya art me and dinggay oo  well i 've always been you know i was not charismatic but i 've always been uh uh how do you say that a searcher you know uh i think ever since i was born i have been searching you know uh even before the formal practice of christian meditation which i am doing now uh i started reading books on uh self knowledge uh self-realization i went into the hindu scriptures i read uh bhagavad gita and uh uhm another one i forgot 'no  and i worked i dabbled into uh buddhist scriptures also and some theosophical books and i sort of toyed around with uh different forms of meditation it was just that you know i could not sustain it because i was all alone and i was doing different forms until you know uh i got to join this group also and then there was a sort of formal way or technique of doing it and uh there was this uh group that met once a week so it that 's helped sustain me you know until now i still sit quite regularly uh that 's about it twice a day also uh twice a day sometimes well sometimes it 's once a day but i do do a lot of quiet you know uhm for me meditation is not just simply just sitting 'no  uh meditation is i think a way of life in that sense 'no uh it 's being aware of what i am doing if i am eating i am just eating 'no  totally there 'no  if i am playing billiards i 'm just playing billiards 'no  uh nothing outside that so that for me is also a part of of the whole process of integration that 's about it as far as i 'm concerned break in the recording  how about you uh clears throat on how i discovered meditation uhm i was a regular uh blessed sacrament worshipper and uh i was a charismatic and also uh in the beginning uh centering prayer was uhm taught to the community of buklod ng pag-ibig where i be the community where i belonged and i tried to do centering uh but it was a one day seminar one day teaching and then it was not followed up by the community uhm so i could not sustain it so i stayed in the blessed sacrament that that was my quieting when i saw art there whom i did not know at that time uh 'no  finally i got to know him uhm and i i wondered how this man could uh keep so still and clears throat i asked him about it and he and he taught me the the technique clears throat  and from there on uhm i started meditating uhm then he started he put up this group which uh which sustained me and others because of the regular teaching and then there were there were fr lawrence would come often so there was constant nourishment uhm   in the beginning i i was so hungry for silence in my life uhm although i had hours and hours of it in the blessed sacrament but for some reason this this type of quieting was was deeper i i cou i can't explain it but then it 's a hunger of the soul e and and uh i i do i do meditation five six times a day and and uhm i 've stayed on i i do it twice a day and i 've seen a lot of uhm changes in myself like i used to be a very nervous person i 'm very anxious and uhm trying to please everybody all the time when the group knew me they knew they they knew me on that level  but because i believe i 've been faithful to the to the sittings i 've been able to detach from the opinions of others and i 've been able to discover myself uh love myself understand myself i i was able to uhm unmask many of my masks unravel uh and and then i started to understand how truly god must have loved me and because of that i because of that i love myself more and when i love myself more i i uhm when i love myself more i just became a better person basically i think the reason why people who really practice it stay on to it is because uh you see that uh it really expands us uh uhm it widens our level of understanding  yeah  it uh makes us uh the opposite of being narrow-minded you know oh uh we can be so focused and be one track mind but not closed to others in other words it has led us to understand the journey better especially the spiritual journey and understanding the spiritual journey i i feel that uh following the context of the bible where jesus said uh where the spirit is there 's freedom and liberty it frees uh it has freed me from a lot of perceptions and concepts which i feel has restricted my growth in life and through the practice of meditation uh this way of praying it has led me to understand that there there we can widen our horizon we can widen our understanding call it maybe wisdom uh and this widening happens without studying it 's an internal knowledge that comes about through the practice of meditation uh you don't need to read a lot of theories uh and study in order to understand the insights the depth uh the call it maybe the revelations or uh what term do we use uh when intuitions

i have with food   more rice more  pam this is your fifth serving laughter   ay but that reminds me of the poem what poem that you 'll laughter 'no yung kanina  eating in   eating in   eating in uhm  yes i was thinking of that   pornographic or not   ha eating in delicious   pornographic   no honestly pornographic   di ba luscious  because i 'm going to discuss that i don't know what 's pornography we 've been discussing that oh i was telling pam it 's hard to give a standard   you keep on mentioning my name i think there 's a point here somewhere laughter  rhythmic kasi e  pam pam pam pam pam pam pam laughter  christmas pam pam pa ram pam laughter  my classmates pamela gumamela oh yes what 's pornography or not basis yeah what is pornography what would be pornography uh uhm for you what 's pornography next question no honestly is that something you can give a definitive answer to or personal choice personal perspective wouldn't yeah it 's subjective subjective oh what would you consider as pornographic this what we 're doing right now  eating   stop it pam stop it laughter  that is so pornographic laughter  stuff it stuff it laughter  you 're stuffing yourself what do you think of me stupid laughter  is she really gonna listen to that chuch  kasi we we were discussing ekis what 's ekis   ekis the movie movie sunshine cruz sunshine yeah sunshine cruz ba 'yon  did you ever watch her in that you know scorpio it 's not pornographic did you understand the story first question scorpio nights two or one  two   story what story laughter  i understood the scenes and the theater or cable   wasn't scorpio nights one supposed to be  wasn't it supposed to be good   it 's two also  i don't know about two did you watch two or the one two two comment uh good shots i missed my old school why it was shot at normal uh okay so i was so busy identifying the places laughter i didn't get to catch whatever story it has if it had a story yes in the first place i don't think so hypothetically if you find the laughter the cr&eacute;me laughter stuff what speak up pam laughter  so what 's pornographic i 'm eating if it 's graphically described yeah oh and it 's baboy laughter   wouldn't be   i 'm so ano e i 'm prude when it comes to those things  pero   is it easier to identify pornography in movies in something movies in movies or visuals  visuals   visuals  yes naked woman not really  it would depend   but what about something printed  uh e xerex column in a tabloid  uh pornographic i think in a sense yes because its intention is to make an impact i have to abstain i have not seen a single xerex material yeah sure but you know xerex personally  laughter  pam stop eating naman  you 're stuffing your face with food   no  if ano uhm it has something to do with intention the purpose if there 's a purpose is that pornographic so it should intentionally uh  if you portray   perform  this is what you were talking about earlier yeah  eating in  can we recite the poem for them laughter   genitalia con pulot   no because this is the first time that i i asked them the question is it pornographic uhm what did they say uhm actually i have the answers here the girls would probably say it is  no   no in fact  no ironically it would be the guys telling me  talaga  is this pornographic they go miss no it 's not pornographic okay answer uhm is it pornographic it is not pornographic it is metaphoric the comparison of women and food is the art itself okay simile metaphor  speaker turns pages of paper next uh the woman no wait the woman is portrayed as a commodity not necessarily with a value but an item which any man can treat at his own disposal be it for lust or love the group thus agrees of its pornographic nature due to the inhuman treatment of the woman inhuman inhuman inhuman  parang iba naman yata 'yan   cough no it 's not pornographic  emphatic   see there is only one guy here out of what five girls one guy it was the guy who told me the author is trying to present a woman as a man 's answer to his sexual fantasies by using food as an object of comparison and description for the girls they they trivialize sex he trivialized sex but he feels it 's not pornographic  who  uhm and last no it 's just it is just suggestive and it is not graphic so the basis would be if it is very graphic it 's pornographic it was not written in an offensive way  uhm  uh uhm because one of them claimed that he suddenly thought of food  uh uhm   uh uhm  which are biological needs yeah  di ba  actually one of them just realized later on that it is all about a woman speaker a coughs  so which is which because i was thinking since he portrayed the woman as an object which is something like sex object object of his desire uh uhm would that count as pornographic when you trivialize women was he example only uh uh treating her as an object comparing her to food would that already be in the context of object of desire but if it were but if he intended it to mean that he needs uh the woman as much as he needs food in that sense basic need uhm would that make it pornographic do you find that in the in the poem no it 's uh it 's not comparing the woman to special recipes it 's just comparison from different regions right but let me see the crispy pata of her  oo  and eating in and and devour where 's the book and uh how did he describe the breasts of a woman uhm  nata  yeah or something charette you read speaker a chuckles   laughter you 're stuffing yourself again charette you found it where did you find it at home laughter  at home  alam mo chuchi 's books might be there no i found this thing speaker c laughs  chuchi she stole it we 'll help her find the book so that she could treat us or else she 's going to pay yeah imagine that 's a thousand bucks essentially clear wouldn't that be such a waste of money yeah  when you could   i promise  feed us every day when it turns up we will splurge the one thousand bucks at least we 're happy read please speaker clears her throat while i stuff myself uhm she lies before me

what it is  words i 'm still searching  but in your condition of course you know what you want as of now i 'm not so sure i 'm not so sure of the future i 'm not so sure of my plans especially especially of all those things that happened with me these past few months you know i envy those people especially my classmates who already have plans after they graduate from college what are their plans what are their plans as usual go into mass media but isn't it such a bore to to plan your life ahead anyway it is good to have definite plans but that will be so dull if you simply if you simply fo follow the pattern of your life of your life that you want it to be then you won't have to   it is much more thrilling but then you went you won't have to get to be worried for the   worried about what  about the future yes if you plan ahead for me it is quite a bore i don't know it 's just that i take life as as it is you know although i have plans for the future it 's just that i don't want those plans to run my my present life because it will ruin me
Philippines	why should i start okay what was the last movie you 've seen oh come on laughter  are we going to talk about that laughter  no i don't think so i think it 's worth talking about it the last movie i 've seen  oo yeah uhm no i guess it 's uh sort of the question would be the last movie that i think was the best that i 've seen okay you were with me when we watched the green mile right  ye i i don't think so the green mile tom hanks we were with sir bruce and lavoxa okay i was with you and the guys   you were with us   yeah   uh uhm  it was well for me a very touching movie uh gotesco one so i liked very much how about you green mile was kinda cheesy cheesy since uh it was wrote by stephen king a horror a horror writer but i never not that i don't like it it 's just that it never appealed to me maybe the  uh uhm  and what appealed to you  maybe the   boys don't cry  yeah di ba i liked that movie i never liked that one about pretending to be a boy uh-huh and no one realizing that you 're really a girl uh uhm and then being murdered later on and raped it was gross uh i never liked that you were the one who asked me to watch that it was a nice movie hillary swank won an oscar for that but he was i mean she was raped   she she was raped it was a real life story it was a kind of a real laughter  are you 1 word at me whatever anyway she was raped from behind so what  laughter so what  how about m i m i two mission impossible two  m i two was great uh technically wise we were not together when we watched that one yeah but we were in the same cinema uh-huh i think you were with fr glen fr glen i was with rey and mike because you asked me not to watch it with you because you will you will be late uh-huh and and you told us that you would be late so we we moved on we watched the movie by ourselves not waiting for you because you would belate  e but but the thing is you never waited for me i always do i made tampo that like that uh at that moment uh  yeah   then   ang baduy mo  thank you because the thing is uhm the reason why you watched that movie earlier than i did was uhm perhaps because everyone would be late also so it would be perhaps   the reason why we met was because of the bingo by the jaycees which was not continued that day  yeah  yeah it was postponed for two weeks then   and you were not there during the bingo i was sick could you blame me you were not sick then i was sick since uh thursday you were not talking to me you were not talking to me uh uhm you were not talking to me because we were waiting for you that thursday night when at the north lounge we always do we waited for your last exam uh during that time but then you never showed up we left then we saw you well my mind was not actually clear at that part we saw you with who 's that christopher and bhang we were settling a case i guess oh that time uh oh and i was sick waiting for you   'cause we were 'cause we were not talking then why can you imagine we 're talking about this on tape now laughter  we 're talking about not talking anyway because monday uh we worked at j v in the morning then tuesday i was out you said j v right g v you said j v laughter  g v you said j v   j v f m chuckle   uy one day sonia went to the station and brought you bibingka   she was  no no it was not sonia uh the one who brought the bibingka was a couple and they sort of just brought the bibingka because they said they were listening to our show and sonia came there because she 's organizing this uhm club which you know we 'd like to call friendship club kiko and friends if if ever we would have to be to to uhm name that organization what do you think would be the best i can't think of anything right now it 's a public service program i was i was thinking that it should not be only focused on our show but on others as well because   as g v per se uh uhm the great goers  the best  uy one time i uhm after our class in la salle when a classmate approached me and told me that there 's this d j who said on air that i was not texting him anymore it 's like as if he 's asking to text him again and he said his his duty is during the night time so i guess it 's if i 'm not mistaken it 's dean dean dennis dennis you never went to maverick 's birthday because i was sick saturday you never returned the tape i haven't returned the tape i ha i still have the tape at home you 've got to return it to your friend of course i 'm gonna return the tape it 's not mine  laughter after revie  it 's even recorded for him not by him i see  ha dead air dead air laughter  i know  i haven't had lunch likewise chuckle   are you saying laughter   hungry   saying what uhm saying what what time would you be coming again to class two o'c two o'clock uh uhm for my theology class so you have built your name in theology yes everybody knows that i don't believe in god  wh why is that you know when we had rizal it was like sir pieto told us that there 's nothing wrong with believing it 's like when you believe now and you die later and then you realize there is no god then there 's nothing to regret about because you are already dead but if you die and you realize there 's really a god how could you regret you 're dead yeah that 's why so i so the point is there 's nothing wrong with believing i think uh believing is just having uh a hope that okay i 'm gonna die i 'll meet this person who who guided me all my life and doesn't it give you anything like a spark in your life  a hope   you could be a spark in my life speaker a chuckles  you could be my hope oh i see   see i don't have to fai to have faith on this someone i do not know 'cause i have faith on myself i have faith on my friends but the thing is don't you think it 's uhm sort of natural for somebody to hold something above him uhm like someone who would not put him down it 's like i know you can believe on me and count on me but then i also have these times when i go up and then i go down and well i it 's not that i want to put you down but there might be a time that i may be putting you down just like the time that we were not talking to each other so so the thing is isn't he sort of somebody who you 'd place above you and like he 'd not put you down uh that is making a false hope of yourself i mean if you put me down it 's just a a mere fact because you 're a human so not that you 're supposed to make mistakes it 's just that you can't avoid mistakes uh uhm granting that putting me down is a mistake uh no okay  does it give you some sort of hopeless attitude why nothing it 's just you 're hopeless not me  laughter this conversation really words  and what else uh you know back in u p i had this uh classmate uh uhm uh his uh point of view or argument is that god is only an excuse that if i ask you why does it rain  precisely   because you can't answer you would say god  uh-huh so that 's an excuse not that god created the rain  it 's just that you don't know the answer so you say it 's god  uh uhm  i guess that 's the precise point laughter  that i don't know i guess it 's for me it fits me that whenever i do not understand a thing especially i it 's not with regards to things that you could study about but it 's with things that you have to believe in without looking  i always say it 's because of him because my mind is that limited  uhm  how could you always say that uh it maybe it 's just meant to be that way but not really make an excuse i mean if there 's a god how would you feel that he 's just an excuse  yes  uh uhm i just hope that everybody else can understand you as much as the people close to you can understand you the thing is they have this tendency to put religion down one 's throat and uhm can you blame them we 're in la salle yeah that 's that 's the sad thing   a catholic school  that 's the sad thing about la salle they uhm entertain students from different uhm religion and then they enforce you to take up eight theology classes and make you believe in the god they in the first place you never believed in i think my teacher 's ano scared of me scared of you ha  he 's a new teacher  scared or challenged  scared scared scared like a virus something   he talks to me like are you fine speaker a laughs   uh-huh  yes i 'm fine everything is fine are you  laughter hello anybody here  hay naku  anyway let 's talk about our favorite author jessica zafra   zafra the bitch from hell there was this episode and i and i don't know if if you were able to watch it but points of view uh uhm their show is now on every mondays mondays same time i guess ten thirty there was this segment when she said that uhm uh i don't know what our guest said but i think he 's he 's been very much disoriented and he she said uhm it so sarcastical so sarcastic that uh the rest of the cast were just like freezing there waiting for her to say something nice which she didn't and i don't think we should expect jessica zafra to say something nice yeah word laughter  i don't know i remember one time when she said if you elect me as president the whole philippines will be in chaos why chuckle  and uh all the teachers in u p are practically dying of starvation  chuckle how come oh because in u p you have the i think a very low salary uh you teach because of teaching per se not because of the money uhm i guess it 's similar with most of the teachers nowadays they teach for passion not for the money uh uhm what do we do for passion eeecch  i have something in mind but i don't think i can say it chuckle  no no no what i mean is sometimes we tend to do things that are way beyond what other people expect of us and yet we do not wish to have something in return oh yeah that that job in g v if you could call it a job uh uhm a non-paying job how many months have we been working there since march and we have received but five hundred pesos five hundred not counting expenses   plus some expenses  yeah my mom is telling me 'wag ka nang pumunta diyan ano ba'ng napapala mo diyan  it 's it 's the other way around i keep telling my mother i do not want to go anymore and she 's the one who 's always asking me to go there i don't know why because she 's friend with ronel uh that figures the sped thing what 's that what sped stands for s p e d special education yeah and that 's where my sister goes too  uhm at any rate i guess i guess weng 's job is similarly  weng 's job  of going around the seventy-two barangays every saturday and wednesdays

then you know kerstin kerstin chaz and fritz  nadia uh uhm  uh i see i just met them now college college days  uh uhm  uh uhm but my high school friends uhm only one of them is from la salle  uh uhm  uhm all the other all the other five they 're at different schools  yeah  where did you graduate in high school   elizabeth seton school where 's that it 's it 's in our community it 's in b f las pi&ntilde;as i see b f it 's just a fifteen-minute drive from our house uh uhm
Philippines	kids now engaging in pre-marital sex yuck i think kids are getting into it really early these days as in as in like how early you know of someone who did it at age ten eleven well i know uh well these are second-hand stories like people getting into it you know when they 're in high school like in their teenage thirteen fourteen so what makes them wanna go into it wanna go into it is it really just human nature or it 's pre-meditated nah i think it 's well there 's that human factor human nature thing but it 's more of the environment they 're in  ikaw uhm is it peer pressure or family  whi which background are you talking about or environment are you talking about everything you have the media you have the family   media as in like the movies sex movies yeah pornographic materials like abante o o tiktik names of tabloids  yeah the subliminal pornographic materials subliminal because they 're not so up front like uh that teeny-bopper movies you see now when they have this first kiss and all they start really young i mean during our time it was like maricel soriano dina bonnevie but they were past thirteen fourteen  uh uhm   you know  you know how i 'll compare this i 'll compare this to cellular phones kids now at a young age they get cellular phones who who give them their phone  and now  their parents their parents so who like initiate it or encourage them i can't blame their parents who encourage them to go into uh pre-marital sex well majority would still be their friends but it 's all the influence of the media i can't say parents condone it of course parents will condone it will not condone it will not will not why will they condone pre-marital sex  chuckle yeah you 're right i misunderstood you what do you mean nothing anyway so cough uh so what why do kids go into it just for the fun of it uh they wanna explore they wanna experiment driven by curiosity   or is it really the libido that 's acting up or i don't know i never had it when i was their age yeah but let 's try to look into i really think it 's the media uh i think it 's the environment 'cause when we were when we were in our teenage years we didn't have this kind yeah that 's true how old are you anyway twenty-nine that 's kinda old i 'm only twenty-five yeah right nah i 'm twenty-seven so basically we come from the same generation   same generation  yeah i agree with you but if we become parents hopefully we 'll we will be yeah and i think we will be 'cause i 'm gonna marry you in two years right can't we make that earlier uh that 's a different topic okay okay so cough if i become uh a parent i know what is right and i know what is wrong so i would really instill in my children 's in my kids' mind that sex is really not a bad thing what do you mean sex is not a bad thing sex is not a bad thing within the context of something yeah to have sex is good really good after marriage after marriage yes   yeah that 's how you should explain to your children yeah but you see it 's not naman the parents' fault yeah  i mean i can't say that  but if if the background if if the persuasive uh ability tama ba  persuasive ability of what of the parents okay if it 's good then the kids will not be will not buckle under pressure 'cause they 'll not give in they 'll not give in from peer pressure so it really comes it boils down to or it comes down to still the basic unit of the community okay you mean the family   which is the family does it mean that if a teenager engages in sex then i will directly assume that the parents are terrible then there there must be a lack of uh uh you know exp explaining guidance guidance or you know there should be uh like a one-on-one talk or a man or do you think you 're gonna have a father-to-son talk or a mother-to-daughters talk mother-to-daughter talk or mother-to-son talk and vice versa so i think   do you think you 're gonna actually talk to your own kid about sex uh i would did your dad i will did your dad talk to you about sex uh yeah he did when he saw me uh what  ano ba 'yon 'cause i can't i was like twelve years old when he looked at my uh drawer and he saw some pornographic materials inside then he said hey this is this is really not what it 's uh uh meant to be or meant for it 's not what it 's meant for what do you mean 'cause the acts shown in that material are disgusting in a way it 's not supposed to be that what made you buy them uh friends gave it to me you 're not gonna admit you bought them i don't have that kind of money uh back then back then  i don't have that kind of money to buy maybe my friends got it from their brothers or cousins or i don't know so we had that little talk and it kinda you know it kinda stuck in my mind that what that it 's sex is really with responsibility  you know i 'm so confused about pre-marital sex actually why my views are changing well before my best friends and i it it was like a no no thing until people close to us started confiding about actually doing it and it 's like how can we hate her we know her too well and she 's not that kind of person or how can we judge her when we know who she is i mean her character doesn't change just because she engaged in it  so all of a sudden when when people near you close to you start really doing it you 're forced to change your outlook and also forces you to look deep down and make you question your own values  okay  you have to question your your uh your strength also 'cause if you 're really strong inside you  will resist the temptation from your friends well yeah pre-marital sex is still a sticky issue as far as i 'm concerned sticky and sensitive  sticky that 's it e  so if the foundation is good about sex my the families of my friends are like well-respected families but you don't know what 's what goes inside the fam the the house the home maybe   uh i 've been with these people since grade school maybe inside the house they 're not   dysfunctional  yeah they 're not they 're not the ideal family  we went to the same school well anyways basta it 's just a sensitive issue and it makes me really look down deep inside what is really my stand regarding pre-marital sex so what 's your stand my stand is it 's still wrong it 's still a sin against god okay nothing can make it right okay i have this question wait nothing can make it right but having love in it will probably make it a little less wrong not right uh it 'll just lessen the guilt okay what if you 're uh in this situation uh you had a few drinks few laughs listen to music and then then you stumble into doing it how would you feel as in i 'm drunk if if at that point i 'm tipsy i 'm drunk uhm you like the guy not love you just you like him you you love him okay let 's put it that way you love him but you stumbled into doing it how would you how would you react i mean right after doing it i 'd probably cry why i didn't imagine it to be that way but the two of you i mean you love each other you know that you 're gonna end up with him who knows that for sure okay let 's let 's change the the the what 's this the scene or the situation what if you 're gonna get married tomorrow okay and suddenly the guy knocks at your door and says hey chinks it 's just like you know just a formality why don't we get down and dirty let 's do it tonight instead of tomorrow the wedding day will you do it probably not why because you 're tired i 'm tired after preparing for for the wedding wedding i 'd wanna look good  i wanna get a beauty sleep beauty rest  but you know  but you know even if you 're tired it only takes a minute to do it laughter  i wouldn't imagine my first time to take a minute speaker a laughs  i 'd wanna go through all the motions and all the preparations but if you did it the day before your wedding is it wrong  hard to answer i don't know so what 's wrong with doing it the week before a week before a year before uh two years before  i don't know but you see my point i see your point so i 've never been asked that question yeah but it makes sense 'no  it makes sense but i still think it 's not right i don't know if can we say there 's a degree in wrong-ness level of wrong-ness or probably not wrong-ness degree of guilt degree of guilt i don't know i 'm not sure   i like that degree of guilt what 's the nicest thing you imagine you 'd do to a girl i mean i 'm not talking about physical context do to a girl in terms of uh what you can do for her make her happy instead of having sex oh no not within the context of sex oh what nothing what makes a girl happy you know sex is not the only thing that can make a girl happy buy her shoes oh yeah buy her shoes that would make me very happy buy her shoes buy her jewelry when are you gonna give me my engagement ring uh it 's a surprise i wanna be surprised now that 's not anymore a surprise honestly when it 's a surprise nga e if i tell you when then it 's not a surprise anymore when will your parents know that we 're engaged as soon as i give you so they don't know that we 're engaged now no but you know the formality so what do they know now that we 're gonna get married soon uhm that i 've decided already that you 're the one i want you 're my love i feel like having mongolian barbecue tonight buffet i don't like why not i 'm in a budget that 's why no it 's my treat  it 's my turn  no  actually mongolian barbecue is not for me why not can't finish it oh you make your own bowl nah it 's okay i i i 'm really hungry i 'm hungry  di let 's eat downstairs we just missed dinner i like home-cooked food we just missed dinner  talaga  i thought we were going out tonight but we have to do this we have to talk remember after we 're done talking uh all i can think of right now is food all i can think of now is you or sex no it 's you yeah right no yeah well i had a bad day today a real bad day yeah why well for one uhm i looked at the bulletin board of the m b a program uh uhm and i did not recognize a single name in the dean 's list and i realized most of my batchmates have graduated while i am still half-way through and i shifted to a different masteral program i 'm not even sure if i 'll finish it so you feel like you were left behind yeah by your batchmates yeah but you changed uh programs right which i 'm having difficulty finishing because of all the travel schedules because of my work which brings me to any point in the philippines at any given time but your problem is a fun problem right because you 're enjoying your course your program yeah but i 'm having difficulty i 'm getting insecure whether i 'll finish it or not so you mean you you 're not enjoying your course i am enjoying my course i 'm worried i might not be able to finish it like so if if you 're i dropped my m b a didn't i if you 're enjoying it there 's no you shouldn't think that you will not finish it no my problem is not whether i enjoy it or not my problem is the time  my problem is whether term after term i 'll be able to enroll  oh  it 's just a matter of uh proper scheduling and proper planning i feel like i 'm driving my body crazy and you know the sad part is i 'm enjoying my course so much as in well i never thought english could be so difficult i 'm really enjoying it because i 'm really learning but my problem is i might not be maximizing the opportunities for learning because i don't have enough time to devote
Philippines	 missing words they 're playing our song i don't have enough money to buy tickets no uhm if you want to buy more tickets uhm i think you can get them at all uhm ticketrons at the same time they give you discounts if you buy them in groups uhm also if you 're interested in watching other plays if you 're interested in watching other plays we have one right we have uhm i think in repertory philippines a new season we have kiss of the spider woman which is a straight musical and then the river in through the woods straight play then we have aimee 's view and murder for rent what i think happens to be which happens to be i think a comedy and then for children 's theater they 're having jack and the beanstalk which runs i think it started already in july and it 's going to run through 'til december so how could i get one you can go to repertory philippines at shangri-la plaza at the fifth level you 'll find the box office there you were able to watch they 're playing our song right yes i watched it twice twice 'cause lea salonga was so amazing she and adrian pang had this chemical reaction on stage they just complement each other without the other having to hog the limelight you should have seen it it was amazing sounds great but ho how was it it was it was different especially the acoustics of the theater it was held in the aguinaldo theater and the theater is very very preserved it 's very nice all the acoustics are very uhm even with their sounds that 's really great what yes have you have you already purchased your tickets for miss saigon i 'm planning to have one but i 'm still thinking what 's the most specific date that i 'll be watching that you should be watching if you want to watch all the lea salonga shows you should watch all the evening shows because lea will only be doing the evening shows for three months all evening shows only the rest will have an alternate for the afternoon during matinees and then for the rest of the succeeding months because it 's gonna uhm run from october until march uhm there will be another person playing the role of kim so that 's really that sounds too bad so i really have to purchase the tickets right now   and not to mention how much it costs for the orchestra i think it costs like four thousand plus for the evening and then for the orchestra side right three thousand plus and all the good and cheap seats are already sold out oh my god so how am i going to purchase the tickets  i don't have   oh my god oh my god you could have a credit card that 's too bad teacher donna why are you so busy won't you join us teacher donna teacher donna teacher donna has a sore throat how about you would you like to watch miss saigon too uhm i 'm not interested what are you barbaric or something laughter  sort of get cultured get out of that cage and get moving don't disturb me i 'm busy what what are you doing anyway i 'll be observed later okay no wonder you look so pretty of course i have to really and blooming like a wild sampaguita flower laughter  were you ob observed already last week thank god no laughter  you weren't but i thought you were you would be observed also i thought so too apparently somebody forgot their watch so  that 's good news anyway right   so yes i will still be waiting for another couple of sleepless nights until somebody observes me in my class and i hope it 's not in your loony class because you have anton silva well among the students  i hope so  talking about antonio silva you know what he did this morning he was howling all over the place howling yes did you put on his leash because i reprimanded him the last time for kicking somebody 's table really i didn't know that yes it happened to be the teacher 's table  laughter oh my god yes so no wonder you didn't know about it rez you know what movie i saw last night what my god you 'll never believe it i saw the sixth sense again on h b o  so so uhm was it uhm the same thing as you 've watched it before uhm probably i 've watched it around six times already so it 's not as scary as it was the first time i saw it because i remember the second time i saw it i saw it with you guys and you guys saw it for the first time and i could just i could just i could just see clearly now as i close my eyes the look on your faces how freaked out you were then you were just teasing us always for example there was a scene there already and then you 're you always tell us that uhm okay look at the scene look closely to it and then we were very excited di ba waiting for that scene to come exactly and then by the time i watched blair witch i was already emotionally disturbed after seeing the sixth sense okay so i thought that you wouldn't watch that anymore because it really scares you that much it took me uhm it was shown october november december january february around until january just to get over the movie just to get over the fear of the movie and then by the time i was able to watch it again it now marks as one of my favorite movies of all time that 's really interesting right though have you watched other movies aside from the sixth sense after watching that movie uhm i 've seen the blair witch the blair th what 's that blair witch blair witch blair witch one was it that one and then i saw the haunting with you guys three scary movies in a row is enough to give you a nervous breakdown so speaker b laughs  but i recovered don't worry i recovered but lately for the past few months i haven't seen anything because of the bombings my parents refused to let me in the you know to let me inside malls just so i could watch movies i was not allowed you may never know what will happen to your safety so they refused  uh uhm  uh that 's too bad because a lot of movies shown lately are really good like the patriot  wha what 's it about about patriot it 's like uh the continentals like they they 're fighting with each other with this country and then and then the most interesting part was that this a family are really bound together they they really are so close together was this the one with mel gibson yeah with mel gibson uhm and also you know what we 're really so interested while watching the movie because it 's really uh talks about the bonding of a certain family like the family of mel gibson and then especially this kid when she was really crying because mel gibson was going to uhm to a war again this revolves around what century what year i 'm not really sure eighteenth i think nineteenth century eighteenth century yeah i i don't know i 'm not really sure about it what country  i forgot laughter  were you really watching laughter were you really watching i 'm just so amused with all the things that are happening in the movie especially those uh people who are right beside us because they 're really words   the movie that i have uhm let 's uhm be wholesome and not worldly here  yeah  yeah okay okay now the movie i have failed to watch and i have regretted missing is uhm erin brockovich uh yeah have you seen it it 's about what i have i have no idea erin brockovich is it uhm what was that julia roberts words  uh-huh i forgot was it 'cause it was shown a long long time ago laughter  did your parents ever tell you you had uhm short attention span laughter  that 's my problem anyway laughter  so don't talk about those uhm movies that were shown a few month ago already 'cause i can't even talk about the ones that i 've seen yesterday and a few days ago  i 'm afraid   i 'm afraid that  later on at three you might even forget that we had this conversation di ba  then uh what time is your next class it 's about nine o'clock so we have fifteen minutes more to kill laughter  to talk about ay  are you done with your conduct grades already uhm conduct grades  yes and it 's uhm i 've already encoded it i 've already computed it a week before it 's supposed to be due although i i was so pissed off when they had to uh i mean after finished deliberating it we had we had to grade it in another numerical manner like one two three four five  uh uhm   uh uhm  yeah and then all of a sudden after you 've finished all the work after encoding it to your record book to the computer to your diskette to the network all of a sudden they say that they have to change it uh uhm i think it 's most annoying yeah and careless so you know what   they apologized but at our expense and then now they have to rush us they say it for example they say they say that they have to be they have to be changed on wednesday and the due date is already on thursday i mean what were they thinking uh uhm and one more thing because the other teachers are are done with their grading already so they need another extra work to do right exactly it is just like it 's just a waste of time not just a waste of time but they think that the teachers don't have anything to do at all and ask them to do this to do that they always have to rush things out so especially now how would they know that they 'll be grading the the same persons again so exactly especially for the first grading period you are not that familiar with your students uh uhm and what i did was in class i would get my record book and then i would call them according to their numbers and i saw their you know i 'd see who they are you would have an idea on how they behave in class it 's easier for it 's it 's easier for it 's easier for uhm uhm arvin and company yes arvin it 's easier for uh it 's easier for what do you call this for for regular subject teachers to see their students because they get to meet their students every day unlike the special subject teachers only get to meet their students once a week break in the recording  arvin have you gotten your tickets for miss saigon  uh uhm  yes what show uhm what date are you watching what theater what date what date uh december twenty-three at eight p m uh balcony one side right laughter   december twenty-three eight p m would that still be lea yes that will still be lea  because what uh  what i 've heard was there is no guarantee even for the evening shows that it 's gonna be lea again i don't know if they 're trying to pull down uhm ticketron or it 's really a part of they 're not yet sure if lea 's gonna be playing all the evening shows i read in one newspaper recently that uh it 's ces campos who will only perform uhm two times a week for from october to december two thousand   forgive me forgive me for saying this but i don't know who 's ces campos ces campos ces campos yeah ces campos who is she the other kim i i i i know that but what she played the role of kim when she went to australia oh the australian version   yeah the australian version would you know who else aside from leo valdez will be our engineer engineer uhm i hope it 's cocoy laurel no i don't think cocoy laurel will perform the engineer i think uhm robert se&ntilde;a
Philippines	good afternoon mike yo  uh how about you mel what can you say about this afternoon i 'm tired uh but i 'm fine except i 'm tired same here tired fine how about you mercy are you tired and fine laughter  me i 'm okay it 's just that i 'm having this kind of interest right now something about my hobbies that i would like to share but i would like to think about other else to hear other sides or other people 's comments about their hobbies or something like what they do for during how many days already for these past days so what can you say about your hobbies or what interests you right now uh i 'm currently indulged in reading lots of books mostly analytical books so uh more on the line of psychology philosophy religion people relations that sort of stuff and oh can you tell something about that well the latest book that i 'm reading is by a bishop named uh john shelby spong okay the title of the book is why christianity must change or die it 's a quite controversial book uhm here uh fr fr spong uh believes that uh most of the dictums or most of the practices of the of the church whether catholic or protestant are already outdated and already uhm uh not very useful anymore in modern society so he suggests ways in which we can uh revive or uh revive our faith or make the faith more significant and more attuned to the times i think it 's a very deep or enriching kind of book isn't it yes i i i should say so the language that is used by the author is quite deep but i like books like that they kind of challenge me how about you mel what kind of books do you like to read although i do have interests in analytical and psychological aspects of life i i believe that adventure and espionage interest me too and right now i am reading clive cussler 's wow i forgot the title of the book but geez i 'm just wind up but that 's okay anyway and i 'm already nearing it 's just like this shanghai express and i think this person just never dies the main character dirk pitt that is okay aside from books let 's talk about other kinds of interests that you have right now can you tell something about any interest you like to talk about mike  cough well i do have many interests but uhm they 're seasonal laughter  so it really depends upon uh my mood for a certain uh number of months like i said my indulgence right now probably for four years now is really books i 'm really into books right now those kinds of books but uhm if you just ask me what are my other interests well uh well you you know mercy i i love music so i love listening to music uh i like to sing e dance and all of that stuff yeah so that would be one of my main interests what do you do during weekends uh you mel i bake oh really i bake actually before i really came uh before i taught here i trained in a hotel because i was supposed to be shipping to new york oh yeah i was supposed to go there because i wanted to become a chef but well i was lured here so here at school but anyway that won't stop me from my dream so but actually because there 's two aspects like being a chef but what i wanted in particular is to become a pastry chef so i 'd like to train more with the cakes and all those frilly stuff and presentations uhm you know what mike mike also i think you have that family business about pastries yeah you have the same characteristics or same interests that 's good okay aside from that what else well since you mentioned it i also cook uhm i cook more than bake uh but i like baking too it 's it 's sort of uh a hand-me-down kind of a talent or or hobby uhm it started off with my grandmother on my mom 's side she she she loved to cook and she turned it to a business and up to now we still have that business from my grandmom to my mom and then down to me so we 're all we 're more or less a cooking family yeah uh one time at the mall i saw you and is it with are you with your sister and grandmother or was that your mother that you were going down the escalator from glorietta four  well i would like to think i would like to believe that was my mom because if that was my grandmom you would have seen a paranormal uh phenomenon laughter  okay so what else  what do you like to cook yeah that 's good my specialty 's pastas i love cooking pasta and uhm uhm like i said my mom cooks the things that she 's good at cooking i can't make like i can't make the usual adobo i 'm not good at that nilaga but my mom makes fabulous there 's nilaga waiting for me at home right now it 's really really fabulous she cooks empanada  her bestsellers like pastillas i can't do that but the thing is when it comes to pasta when anyone orders pasta from us i do the cooking because my mom cannot make pastas as well as i can thank you wow uhm actually i 've been practicing making pasta but it 's just like the simple pesto and uh pomodoro from scratch although it 's not yet uh i have not really road-tested it too much so it 's not appreciated yet just yet because i 'm i 'm more i 'm i 'm really more of like a vegetarian so i try to get into that cooking since i also love pasta myself so i tried to experiment with the basic i think i agree that italian cooking and french cooking are very basic so i 'm trying that i 've i 'm kinda i 'm i 'm kind of like the traditional cooking first so there me i 'm not very good in cooking because i 'm an only child and my mother is always there for me so that 's why it 's it 's really my frustration right now but i think it there 's still hope i think and then one thing i would like to bring up with you is something about your vocation or our vocation our teaching career so i don't think it 's a boring kind of thing to be brought up today i think me for myself i like to talk about my kids my students my grade one students because they 're very very very active very alert and every day is such kind of a new experience for me and like what i have shared this afternoon du during our colloquium we talked i talked and i shared about this kind of boy his name is juan and this boy is very very active very very alert and something like sometimes just squeezing twitching or anything that you would like to think about him he does it for example standing without asking permission but at the other side i talked and i shared with the group something about him that touched my heart this morning heart ha  it 's like he approached me this morning at my table and he said teacher i will be going to states it 's much longer but then i just have to say this to you in advance that i 'll be going there and i will not forget you imagine coming from a grade one student and then he said i will send a package for you and you know what what 's inside the package the very first thing that he thought about is he will replace my old chalk holder imagine that a boy saying that kind of stuff for me what do you think about him well i guess he 's very thoughtful yeah i 'm i 'm not really i have to admit i 'm not very well-oriented with the uh uh psychological profile of grade two students i 'm more oriented with the upper grades uhm but the most i would say oh i guess he 's a very thoughtful kid uhm he knows he knows what you want see and he he thinks about you and he 's very sociable too which that that 's very characteristic of many students in san agustin yeah actually juan happens to be my student and i would share the same thoughts about him he 's very thoughtful he 's actually very sweet and many times actually he would ask the most if i guess for a grade one student he would ask most high-faluting questions or sometimes if i would say if i talk to them to the whole class i would say somethi a word that 's not familiar he would ask all the time what 's the meaning of this word for example then i don't know it wasn't just one occasion but it was like several occasions he would ask so i i think he 's like curious he wants to learn but sometimes we 'd deviate from my subject which is which is music but i 'd be glad really like to talk to them all the time and i remember seeing him in the mall really yeah i think that was my first i think that was my first experience in the mall actually somebody calling out my name really loud in front of my mom and my brother but it wasn't anything really embarrassing i mean although i i guess in the be beginning i wasn't really used to it so it just felt so weird it just felt so weird there in the mall but uh he was with his actually with his sister and parents so fir first it 's like i felt i don't know if it 's like embarrassing or something but i guess i just have to get used to it and it didn't end there wherever i go there 's somebody you know somebody will see you yeah get used to it yeah you see i don't know some of them they saw i think they were like they saw me like in the restaurant and then i think at mass so the next the week after miss you know what you were at magallanes this uh last sunday i saw you you were wearing sneakers you were wearing jeans laughter you were wearing a striped shirt and you were wearing a parka and you were with your sister  but no i don't have sisters it was my mom so i don't know probably i will get used to that so like okay so wherever i go even though just in the grocery uh i am likely to see somebody that 's a very nice kind of experience we have been getting with these kind of pupils but then how about paper works what can you say about it well thank god i 'm not teaching language anymore last year i had agh enormous load of paperwork 'cause i was uh i used to be a language teacher grade seven language teacher so that means uhm every week you have spelling lists to the sum of three hundred fifty spelling lists to check and then every week you have a quiz to check almost every day you have seatworks you have the homeworks you have the notebooks and you have the the mastery test twice and it 's in a quarter and it 's not a joke to to check language tests 'cause they 're they 're whole sentences and grade seven kids don't really write very good sentences and they don't write well okay so uhm it was horrible and the activity sheets i had uh it 's a good thing i had an empty desk beside me last year  the whole desk was filled with with activity sheets for the next quarter you could hardly see me behind the pile of behind a stack of papers well fortunately now uh they transferred me to speech and reading i 'm only teaching two three sections in reading and there 's a lot less paperwork now speech no paperwork at all so uh i thank my coordinator for that
Philippines	you start the questioning whatever you know uh  do you think it 's gonna rain i feel it 's gonna rain why do you think so it 's humid  yeah yeah i know you know we have to be spontaneous about this you know so no you didn't give me no you didn't give me an answer that was laughter that that could explain it a while ago  explain  uhm you just said that it 's gonna rain when i asked you because humidity e when it 's humid it 's going to rain right i just know because uh i i always feel this way when i think it 's gonna rain but when we were walking it wasn't i was hot i was sweating so break in the recording  the usual conversation laughter  i hope the guys who are hearing this uhm doesn't get offended on what we are going to say no they 're not going to be offended it 's normal thinking about sex is normal yeah when you think about it it 's normal but when you when you hear other people talk about it because people in the philippines are you know <, they 're pretentious  people in the philippines are pretentious   yeah yeah   no not really   even even in other countries you don't like in the states you can't even give a compliment you have to think of what to say just to give a compliment about somebody about about her looks uhm like like this girl here this one yeah like this girl the girl outside you know she 's got uhm she 's got a nice butt and you know nice butt butts butt nice butt  aside from that what   yummy  uh she 's yummy laughter  yeah she looks she looks nice in the eyes what if i quit the band if you quit the band quit the band  it depends what if the band becomes successful then i will not know that yeah i have no idea if we are going to be successful you know you see other bands they don't you know they don't expect to be that big but they just do what they do and they they get records and they and then they make lots of sales and they become big and they just die out you know but think about wolfgang they didn't expect to be that big but you know but they they they got into the international market and now they 're known at least here do they sell records outside the philippines yeah they they sell records outside but uhm they they have a they have a contract with ah sony epic epic is a big name in the international scene you know  they 're they 're hitting big outside i think   so what do you think is the problem with the band for me in some ways you don't really make that good music us we make good music well not all of you no no our band makes good music but uhm i don't know i 'm not sure if we 're gonna make it big like uh like the like wolfgang or like the beat the beatles or you know like led zep  i just wanna play music and then be rich that 's uh that 's an after effect of uh of working of trying to perfect or trying to trying to perfect our craft yeah we 're just trying to gel with the other members of the band  if i if i leave the band one of one of our band members might also leave so  i 'm not sure if if i leave uh that they 'll be you know they 'll continue playing music you know  i have a feeling that they they won't continue after you leave no they 're gonna get someone else that 's good for me because i could leave the band they could get someone else that 's going to be their problem not mine man before i i thought that if i could teach someone else to play for me like you know substitute for me playing the guitar i could stay and just make music and i could leave and concentrate on my work but now that i don't have any work what are you going to concentrate in i don't know i 'm just you know thinking about making more money than before you know my dad said that i could look for another job but but i have to but that that job has to have the same benefits which he used to have you know so i 'm not sure i don't know what to do with my life right now you know but i really hope that that the resum&eacute; you gave to caltex you know they would they would see it they won't get me they won't get me you know because i asked for a much words  no way they they give they give that kind of salary that that high  word they do they do they do give that kind of salary but not for me you know i 've been working for three years in that kind of job but i 'm not sure if i i 'd fit the qualifications what what i remember they were looking for a person who has more than two years of experience and you you 've got three so right now i 've got three before i used to have two and a half years i think that 's not worth it you know i wanna look for a job in uh you know mcdonald 's mcdonald 's remember i i i answered a question in h r she asked me why do you want to work in mcdonald 's and i said because i love big mac that 's kind of silly but you know it was honest it was honest because you know that 's what i really feel i really want to work there but because i i i don't want to work there because i think i think the manager thinks you were giving a sarcastic answer she 's stupid she didn't know where she she didn't know what i was trying to say to her i told her that because i was honest with myself i was sincere she asked me if what she asked me if the reason why i wanted to work there i told her i love big mac what more should you ask for from a person who has worked in a company who loves their product you know you got a point there yeah i know i have a point there do you want to work but they don't understand that yeah do you wanna work do you wanna work under allan what 's he at what 's his work no he he wants to he wants to make a company uh a holding company then from there then they would think about what kind of venture that they would really go into you know what i think uhm i think that allan could be much more you know successful than he is right now because he has talent he has skills  he is intelligent  skills in what  he knows how i think he 's well he 's successful in in being a stock purcha stock trader so stock trader i don't know what he 's thinking right now but what i 've heard is that he wants to leave he wants to leave his company and start start his own yeah what about glenn you you you told me a while ago that glenn would like to work for him uh i don't know 'cause glenn is out of job right now right yeah so i think he he wants to concentrate also on having you know having our dream come true having a company but it really depends on him we did that before yeah right you know what happened right so what do you expect right now what do you expect me to believe what do you expect me to think man i don't know i 'm sure there 's i don't know if they could i would rather work with you brian and lemuel in a company instead of having to work with those guys because it will start all over again will start all over again and it 's better to work if there 's just two the two of you or the three of you could work better less manpower less overhead  i don't know i just believe that uhm if you 'd have a hand on uh something you should work on it yourself not with others or someone else you don't trust and if you work with someone you trust that 'll be better you 're talking pretty straight right now laughter  i 'm not yet drunk we 're not drinking anyway so  well not yet but we 're gonna drink tonight we 're gonna drink yup we 're gonna drink lots of beer it 's a very filipino trait  but the weird thing is you know in other countries they it 's very common it 's very ordinary for them to drink beer in the morning in the afternoon in the evening yeah like like brian said when he was in the states he said uhm you could you know just go inside a house and go to the ref and open and see bottles of beer six packs it 's quite common because they give beer to their guests break in the recording  you know i really like to drink beer but i don't really like drinking hard liquor make me make me dizzy and all and sleepy and the next day i get a hang-over but with beer and and we don't we don't try to find alcohol because we have problems or we have some big things that we want to forget but we just drink beer because we want to drink beer it 's part it 's part and parcel of what what males should be in some in some ways we could drink we could drink and eat at the same time but eat and drink the same yeah you don't really have to over-drink or over-abuse i mean abuse the the alcohol that you 're you 're drinking remember when we when we when we used to think that we could start a company or a restaurant or a bar and inside the bar we could put our pictures there and you know the people coming over are gonna ask who 's these guys in the picture and then we 're gonna say to them that 's us because you know it 's our friends who got the bar and it 's us who who put up the bar  and they 're gonna be curious about it and they 're gonna ask stories about us and then someday you know we might we might get their picture and put it there on the wall so they 'd say they got their word the bar they drank at the bar and they could remember they drank the bar and for i don't know i mean after a few years and they 're going to go back to the bar with their kids or their friends and they 'll say that we had good things there and we had picture taking there that was me that was me hey  that 's me   in the picture that was me hey look at your dad laughter  uh i went to a bar once with ivan and ian where uh some bosconian owned it batch ninety-three where uh along bautista street just uh porch no uh i forgot the name the porch yeah i think so because because i think angel knows the owner owner yeah i mean you know if it 's in makati it it 's most probably the people there you know people there the owner of the bar used to work used to study at don bosco because word  you just work there yeah   they consider this home  they just work around the area yeah they just and we studied in don bosco almost almost half of our lives right now in makati we 've we 've worked and lived in makati for ten twenty years no i mean fifteen years we 're not even thirty so half of our lives is in makati
Philippines	as in oh i 've read na the articles of the best of youngblood youngblood is a column that appears in a popular daily newspaper featuring contributions written by young people and they 're quite what uh what 's the best article so far the best article uh what ba  name game by  it 's about what   name i it 's entitled name game because dying young dying young i haven't read that yet dying young the the movie dying young so good di ba  yeah have you seen i yeah yeah yeah by julia roberts i don't know if that 's the dying young the movie anyway single fathering is also very nice single fathering it uh di ba we usually say single mothering but it 's single fathering during that time for this time have you read the latest one the fa  which one my father 's daughter my father 's daughter my father 's daughter what is that youngblood youngblood really uh issue last july twenty-nine i think july twenty-nine it was really nice   my father 's daughter   what 's the story   the story is really nice what 's the story about uhm what 's the story the story 's about uh the relationship between between a father and a daughter and   a father and a daughter then afterwards as they as the kid grow older   as the yeah yeah what happened is that their relationship becomes different their relationship became different why break in the recording  anyway what happened to that young girl when she got older what happened when she got older uhm their relationship was strained why i no the here 's something because the girl grew up in manila studied in manila and and then and she 's from bohol i think uh i see and then uh there was a gap yeah between uh as she grew older   yeah  you know there was a you know there was a gap uh between them and then finally before the girl left yeah uh  what happened to the girl she grew up  you know   why was the relationship strained i really i i i think you really need to read so that you can really understand because if i 'm going to tell you all these things it 's   to read it   explain things to me  okay what about youngblood two what about youngblood two   you 've read it already yeah some are nice some are not really that nice  but it 's okay   you were talking about gender sensivity sensitivity laughter  a while ago a while ago no uh yeah yeah yeah yeah i read an article about uh about gender that 's not really re related to what you 're sa you were saying a while ago  yeah okay it 's about uh  do you believe that guys are really good in math i i i i i think generally guys are good in math i mean they 're better off than girls when it comes to math but for say for the for the arts and the languages i think girls are far better than guys   you really believe or i guess i mean that 's an observation that 's an observation   yeah why because we were discussing a while ago in our class uh last time in our class we were discussing about cough uh guys are really better in mathematics than girls   are they  there are researches made and we were discussing why  yeah  why why uhm the thing uh the reason that we have was that uhm guys are really better in mathematics perhaps because of our culture because before remember before uh time of plato and socrates   why   i mean   so you 're you 're speaking about uh so it 's not not not just the philippine culture break in the recording  international research   ano okay yeah it was really known and there are so many researches that shows you know  and then  and why is that regarding plato and   researches that show uh if you can remember uh those uh philosophers before they were allowed to you know only guys were allowed to study mathematics remember   uh uh yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah so girls are not allowed and then we were saying they were not allowed to study mathematics nor were they allowed to neither were they allowed to study yeah   yeah because   because they 're they were second class creatures   yeah  denizens laughter okay critters laughter  okay no uh and then and then we were saying that what we have now although we are always saying that there 's equality between you know men and women what we have is the residual effect of that chauvinistic culture handed now to our culture   uh really   handed down  and then but there are no researches that prove that the factors but they are just assumptions that we are saying because all all the researches are saying perhaps guys are really good in mathematics but the question of why was not cough explored  uh   yeah  i was thinking of a more biological reason for that  what do you think  biological reason like perhaps what what part of the brain functions uh for math wha uh left yeah left okay perhaps uh the left part of the brain of the guys work better but if you can  or  to think that there are also girls who are really excelling in mathematics  than girls   uh yeah yeah  but generally it 's the guys who excel in math right   because that was our culture before uh okay   di ba like engineering are only for guys di ba   so arts are only for girls  yeah   but why do you think girls generally succeed in the languages than guys in languages rather than guys i mean do you owe that to culture also perhaps because language is in a sense a weaker   not really chuckle like like girls weak weak what a weaker a weaker uh a weaker science unlike math it 's a hard science   so it needs analysis and language doesn't even psychology di ba   we don't see guys in psychology  women psychologists  uh really but but the proponents but much most of the proponents in psychology are nowadays but before like sigmund freud   most of them are girls yeah really i never thought of that that 's why in psychology because it 's uh nowadays uh they are already promoting in school  yeah yeah but languages languages why or arts isn't uh girls uh go for arts more than guys do i don't know i don't think so or or the number 's just equal  because in architecture classes di ba  there are more girls than guys   there are more girls uh there are more guys i think you can see and architecture is an art an art form  uh yeah  uh oh yeah so it doesn't really follow but come to think uh there are only few girls in architecture classes right why  because of our culture  because we are saying that architecture is only for guys di ba  yeah yeah   because our culture dictates  oh yeah i took that up with uh my class last summer when i taught so-an sociology and anthropology and that 's it we were discussing about what professions uh uh in what professions do guys usually dominate and what professions do girls usually dominate and that 's it like what professions do girls usually dominate these are teaching the teaching profession nursing  yeah  nursing like most of our nurses are girls most of our teachers are girls what else and i i i i i even pointed out to them that i had a classmate in college before who took up education and like his friends were trying to tease him about it why why are you taking up education are you gay or something something like things like that  if you also take up nursing and you 're a guy like hey are you gay or something because our culture dictates that this profession is only for girls and this profession only for guys yeah  yeah that 's true that 's true engineering you know there 's this anecdote about what was that uh a boy and his father meeting an accident and the fa uh the father 's boy what was that and the boy and his father meeting an accident and the father uh a vehicular accident at that and then the father died on the spot so uh the people who witnessed the accident uh brought the kid or the boy to the hospital and when the boy rea and when they reached the hospital they called for a surgeon and when the surgeon arrived she exclaimed oh i couldn't i couldn't operate on this boy and then they were asked why and then the surgeon said 'cause he 's my son  chuckle  so who 's the surgeon the what the mother the mother and what most of my students said oh perhaps the the father who died in the accident was just the foster father and things like that because usually we have this notion that surgeons are male or males or guys yeah  chuckle like in the story of one of our teachers last time uhm in a mathematics class cough he gave uh examples of maria painted the room cough twice as much as yeah yeah yeah yeah you know the usual problem in mathematics and then all of the students are you know reacting like there 's something wrong we cannot solve the problem because there 's something wrong in the problem because maria doesn't really paint i mean the usual thing  what  reacted  why uh maria don't paint maria cooks laughter   okay  so if the problem was stated that maria cooked more recipes than whatever or went to market she doesn't paint she doesn't paint she doesn't you know do carpentries like some old culture laughter   she doesn't paint   okay  yeah or like plato what plato doing the laundry laughter  i don't know if it was plato or socrates who who had eight female teachers i think  who  eight female teachers and then what was the implication but it was not even mentioned in the articles yeah why because men are not really that significant before women uh i 'm yeah i mean women women are really not not that significant before yeah how would you attribute that to what would you attribute that like women weren't really that significant because weren't really that significant because how did that originate do you know uhm like we we were born we grew up in a patriarchal society wherein boys rule over girls why perhaps perhaps it can be traced back uh to activities of the society before ancient society yeah uh where guys are the rulers yeah but you see cleopatra oh yeah cleopatra but was she a ruler was she a ruler was she a ruler because usually uhm girls are you know on their emotional side yeah is that uh scientifically proven like girls are more emotional and guys more logical  i read an article about that uh i 'm not convinced yeah it 's because you know uh  you know  it depends upon the culture where you 're growing it depends upon the environment you know yeah the environment shapes you di ba so   yeah because in our r s class before we had this hand-out no not hand it was really a book it was compiled the the the articles there were uh compiled by fr yatco and then yeah he whe when we went into the topic of marriage of marriage uh that 's it he mentioned that uh why should men and women be what understand each other then we he he enumerated the things that men should understand in woman women and women should understand in men like men are basically what silent that they don't talk much oh yeah that 's true yeah is that   women talk much women talk much do they oh yeah i guess so my mom and dad are like that my mom talks more than my dad does they nag more often laughter  mothers nag more often obviously okay what else what 's the difference between men and women the thing that we you were saying a while ago the thing that you were asking i mean about gender what was that  what  gender yeah socializa uh there are words that you know uh yeah that uh like there 's this study that uh showing that gender defines what social language is that is that the term or something that uh men have diffe have a different language quote unquote from women do you believe in that yeah perhaps perhaps like i have   like men speak in different language yeah because like like us we cannot talk about i mean private things like

night before eleven fifty-nine p m where do you go no it 's just a joke okay okay what do you think of our subjects now well our subjects is somewhat nice though it 's tiring because there are words exams and projects  a lot of work ha okay oh boy how about work work what do you mean by work uhm the homework the project are they are they too much or somehow yes it 's time-consuming and it 's hard

be at home and have some rest because i need rest right now okay so are you not preoccupied in your works what kind of work your ministry your school works academics those things well it 's kind of fun to juggle them around aren't you having hard time finding time for you to sleep well uhm i find seven hours of sleep for every day i think it seems somehow sufficient for me oh i see at least you 've got seven hours i think i only usually get six hours of sleep okay well it 's fun to juggle ministry academics everything including house work uh uhm i i really have to help with the company and stuff uh uhm okay so what do you think about this place what do you mean this place this aquarium here in the aquarium uhm they could put in an air-conditioner they could put in a fan there 's a room for improvement lots of room of improvement here how do you find it uh how about people around what do you mean people around people around here what do you think uhm well they are uhm friendly uhm nice to get along with uhm i see how do you find them what how do you find them well they 're nice they 're friendly true though i could somehow feel that uhm the warmness is not the same as the previous term okay why  i don't know maybe  uhm too much work people people are getting busy  people are busy  uh-huh or maybe they 're falling i don't know okay i 'm not sure hopefully by next term it will be restored again okay how about your ministry how do you find that which ministry how do you how are you working it out your ministry which ministry uh you can name them one by one if you like well my ministry here in c c c is leading bible study yes and part of the evangelism and discipleship committee  okay  okay well uhm in the bible study well it 's nice i got to know god more and i 'm able to lead other peoples also to get to know god more and uh in the a d c well basically we 're right now planning on when is our next meeting and still have no mo no updates yet on when that meeting would be held okay uhm you got other stuff other forms of words in terms of ministry that is  well ano another ministry is my the youth summer conference we 're preparing for the youth summer conference for this summer and it 's uh heavy work because i 'm in the part of the secretarial committee and i 'm in-charge of the handbook so many typings have to be done and lay-outing and designs okay i guess that 's all how about you how do you find lay-outing oh how do i find lay-outing uhm well it 's fun because i 'm interested   are you enjoying it enjoying it yeah i enjoy it because that 's what i like to do editing graphics those stuffs okay oh by the way before we proceed uhm do you know lilibeth yes i do know lilibeth okay why uh nothing it just passed my mind ows really ha chuckle  okay well well by the way how do you find the college canteen food no comment laughter  no comment don't worry you 're not going to get uhm a libel or something no no comment no comment laughter  wait how come you 're asking me those questions ha  why not let me ask you questions i find the college canteen food really fine  yeah how often do you eat there   you know uhm uh they are they are scientifically designed what do you mean by scientifically designed uhm they are more or less recycled over and over again recycled you mean those wastes are being recycled again  yeah  for example you have adobo for lunch and next thing you know you have chicken curry the next day and then pork curry i see how sure are you  ha  how sure are you that they are recycling it well it 's just my guess and mine are usually are correct  oh so it 's a hunch  that 's good well almost all almost always correct uhm i see  what can you say about the condominium uhm right beside gokongwei well i can see that its foundation are built almost huh uhm all the ground there are being laid foundation and those pillars being built right now are big you know the size of each room no but i expect its gonna be very expensive it will ju cost millions for one unit  okay  why don't we try to buy one no no money sleep there for instead of uhm sleeping here in school for our overnight for our projects or thesis and everything yeah give me the money and i 'll buy one sure i i can supply you yeah you 're sure yeah uhm i know a certain uhm ms de leon who would be uhm willing to support you and if you should like i can introduce you to her really yeah oh no no problem  okay so by the way how do you find the i d policy i d policy yeah well it 's i don't know you find it fine or you still look for something   but   it 's fine but it 's somewhat unfair for us why  it 's a training for you ha you know  from only   yeah   when you get to work you get to pin your i d yeah though i hope that all college would also be like that as ours  more or less yeah well if for example all of the colleges will uhm would promote that kind of law would we have that kind of law uhm would you feel uhm that we are treated equally yeah okay and therefore uhm you feel you would therefore feel that uhm the i d policy will uhm it 's time for you to graduate yeah is that right actually the i d policy is fine because during our high school days we pin our i ds always   yeah i mean but you 're in college already yeah but still   it 's the major quote unquote highlight of your college life so that you don't have to pin your i d anymore and you don't have to wear your uniform or something  really is that how you view college yeah well i don't why not oh how do you view college well i viewed it more learnings and really okay somehow it 's somewhat part of yung the training that i need for me to go to work okay by the way what kind of work are you planning to go to to work for i hope i could be involved in a company that would really produce softwares so i would be a programmer or an analyst or even a graphics designer it depends but i don't want to do work such as inputting datas only into the database okay so you don't like uhm secretarial type of job okay  i hope   well i when i graduate uhm i don't like to work in in programming stuff why  and why did you find select comsci degree code for computer science   well i don't find  well as long as it 's something i find joy in really during my high school years that is yeah right  look lilibeth lilibeth is conscious laughter  anyway so how do you find the no eat the eating no eating policy uhm here in la salle well it 's somehow a discipline for us though it 's also hard because   are you in favor of it or are you are you against it partially yes and partially no okay why because for instance you want to eat and there are only specific places that you can eat right yeah are you in favor of that   and if those  wait let me finish okay and if those places are already occupied then where are you going to eat right so it 's somewhat it 's not really needed actually it 's just it just 1 word discipline but not littering okay so well uhm so in conclusion you are saying that uhm uhm you are not that uhm in favor with the policy right  oh in some sense yes okay cough well let me tell you how i feel what i feel i hate that no eating policy why  ha  why  e it 's no use you know how come uhm cough are you in favor that they are limiting uhm the places where you could eat are you in favor of that no
Philippines	so how 's life  laughter about life yes fine very fine i 'm doing fine how about your work here how do you find your clerical job in the seminary   here  i 'm enjoying it a lot your relationship with your boss and the seminarians uh i think they 're good i think they 're good good   in what sense  in a sense that they are all of them almost all of them are easy to be with what about the brothers the se the professed brothers staying at the other building  the professed brothers i don't get to be with them all the time i get to be with them only during lunch so i really can't how do you find them {> some of them   i think some of them laughter  i don't know they are they are so they are they are too many for me to and too serious some of them very serious very serious that i think they should be rushed to the hospital laughter  i am more interested to hear about your present uh work here how do you find your job and at the same time how do you relate with your boss how do you find your your work here and everything you 're interested about that yes what was your first question how 's your work here you said fine yeah  it 's fine i like it yeah i like   but i think you have to qualify that word fine  what do you mean by fine  how how should i explain that it 's like when i when i go here in the morning i will i will i will have my coffee here i will let all the professors sign their attendance and all that when when it 's pay day my boss will come here and ask me to give the pay envelope to the professors things like that and when it 's and when it is isn't it boring well i don't know sometimes i get bored because i stay here whole day and my boss doesn't stay here the whole day he just drops by   so you 're just alone   yeah   in this office   so sometimes   well your office is conducive very cozy and at the same time well thank you i arranged this very good good arrangement i arranged this  what about   courtesy of jing-jing  what about if there are phone calls and then suddenly your boyfriend is there and my boss is behind me   yeah speaker b laughs  would you entertain your boyfriend no i drop the call este i will say like you call me some hours hours uh no call me back after an hour  why   like that  because i cannot talk to him the way the wa the way i want to you don't wanna get intimate with your boyfriend while your boss is listening yeah yeah laughter  and besides that 's office hours yeah and understandably i i i 'm not allowed to talk to my boyfriend during office hours  and you don't want to be affected  does he understand he does he 's very understanding well before i forget this coming august twenty-eight we 'll behaving a fiesta celebration the feast of saint augustine and i understand we 'll be inviting our professors some of our professors our   ms cruz is coming i think ms cruz who 's ms cruz  uh the teacher  word  yeah  english teacher   english  okay what about you are you coming of course please watch our presentation in the evening august twenty-eight because i 'll be directing a play with our college seminarians and you better criticize it afterwards  uhm  you know that 's one thing i really uh like doing   uhm  i want to direct plays i want to be in the production uh uhm and uh i think it 's one way of expressing myself yeah that 's why your masteral 's in relation to that well yeah sort of but uh you know i really want to pursue a kind of uh further studies in theater arts theater arts and i think that would be who 'd be your characters what kind of play by the way is that   well it 's uh a typical augustinian presentation uh well you do that every year yeah this is for for three years already for three years same play no different plays of course uh different play because the the play should suit the characters and at the same time it should really touch a kind of issue it should discuss an issue about for example our issue this year is about friendship and community life yeah i 've read it telephone rings   that 's very augustinian  wait oh there 's a telephone call you better answer that hello good morning  who 's on the line break in the recording  she 's looking for whom for my boss fr secio who 's that sister tina sister tina of caloocan uh a teacher here or  no   or just a friend  i don't know okay  it 's the first time   so yeah this coming august twenty-eight we 'll have a presentation i think you have to invite some of your friends also so you 'll not feel bored i won't sharon is here so why would i be bored   yeah sharon also is coming together with her friends i think that becomes a tradition already that uh every time we celebrate the feast of saint augustine we invite our friends from different schools and from dif from other seminaries and we and it 's a kind of socialization you know ve augustinians very friendly yeah like you  am i   you really belong here am i you are laughter  oh thank you do you still notice i have colds yeah actually i 've noticed that two weeks ago laughter  yeah well forget the colds i ju i am very very happy that i am here although i 'm not feeling well i just wanna see you because uh because yesterday i wasn't able to to join you for lunch yeah where have you been where were you yeah i was just very busy doing uh a very important work uh in my room then suddenly i slept i rested for a while then when i woke up it 's already three o'clock you skipped lunch yeah it 's time for prayer when i woke up   you always do that  well sometimes i forget to to take lunch because i 'm too busy but anyway i 'm too fat i 'm big speaker b laughs  and i don't think no that 's not enough reason your size is not enough reason for you to skip lunch you know in an augustinian community we really we really value meal time we should be together we should be eating uh together in the in the refectory and every time i skip dinner lunch or breakfast my brothers would always ask me where have you been why did you not take your uh your dinner why did you not take your lunch i feel so guilty  yeah   yeah   and as i observe ha  when you don't join them for lunch  yeah  but sometimes i can't help it but uh just to sleep just to take a rest kasi  but e every time i do that i ask for an apology especially to my brothers who who kept on asking me about that well that 's part of life  uh-huh  yeah like when you were when you didn't join us for lunch i when i see you in the afternoon i asked you why didn't you join us for lunch well every friday and saturday i 'm out for school and they understand that i have i have to take my lunch outside   yeah   i understand   outside   e la salle is too far from san agustin center of studies so uh i take my lunch outside but mondays through uh wednesday i see to it that uh i   you take your lunch here well laughter i try i always try but you know my work sometimes you fail most of the time and as i observe that as i was saying as i observe when someone is not there for a lunch they look for that 's because you know it 's part of our training that we should go together we should be together that 's very augustinian you know community life we value community life and when somebody is absent of course the fathers always look for the lost sheep   lost sheep uhm yeah you know as the bible says he 's looking for the lost sheep  and so after that father master would always ask the leader oh where is willy oh where is dante where where is uh uh so and so so because break in the recording belong to the community and every time we take our lunch we take our dinner here yeah we talk we discuss anything we discuss issues yeah the things that happened to you the whole day   the whole day yeah fray will i can i ask you a question yeah what did you really want to become when you were a kid when i was you wanted to become a priest well when i was still in the elementary my one of my teachers asked me what my dream as i reme as far as i remember i really wanted to be an economist i don't know why   you love numbers not really numbers i don't know why it sounds so good economist  uhm but later on i realized that i cannot really i couldn't be an economist then later on during my high school days uh i wanted to be a doctor uh yeah laughter  but i 'm but i 'm not good in science uh-huh then uh i also hate numbers so i don't wanna be an engineer but later on i realized that i want to teach i want to be with people then after high school i   what course did you finish by the way bachelor of education i graduated from the philippine normal university  uh that 's good   then i taught for three years after before entering the seminary i taught for three years where in montessori de manila in para&ntilde;aque uh-huh then i really enjoyed teaching then it was the time that i met my co-teachers who were seminarians before then they invited me for a retreat for seminars symposia about religious life then seminarians of saint augustine no uh s v ds they were my former my former co-teachers in montessori oh then they left the seminary and then it was the time that they invited me to to join the same congregation  to join  uh-huh then after that i felt that there was really a calling then the rest is history yeah it seems that you 're interested about my my my vocation  yeah i am i am well i am interested it started there uh i felt that uh god is calling me for a very special purpose then i enjoyed uh attending seminars about religious life i started reading the bible and started uh examining myself i involved myself with contemplation then after that i left my work i asked my superior i wanna enter the seminary then the rest is history as i said yeah so you you entered seminary three years after you graduated from college yes i worked for three years in montessori de manila it was so compensating i really enjoyed my work i was able to meet different kinds of people and up to now they still uh we still have an open communication with my former co-teachers and administrators and words of me but of course god has greater plans for me that 's why yeah that 's why i opted to be a priest well it 's not an option but a kind of calling it 's a kind of vocation that i can't really resist there was one time that you told me you missed kids like that 's why every time my my formators ask me oh willy would you like to teach yeah i always see to it that i accept the offer because i really miss kids one time we were at bi&ntilde;an yeah yeah yeah that was what i was about to say  uh yeah  every time i see these kids running i miss my work i miss my job as a classroom teacher and i wanna go back
Philippines	you know what i remember way back in ninety-four when we first started in the first all-asian tournament in singapore remember that yeah nanyang technological university yeah i wasn't there yeah 'cause you were still in i was still here you were still in main right yeah what 's your i d number again here in main uhm i d ninety-six ninety-six so you weren't here yet in ninety-four oh yeah i wasn't yeah i 'm sorry laughter  you were still in new guinea yeah in papua new guinea yeah i was still in high school yeah you know that was really so much fun 'cause that was the first time i was actually ever out of the country okay yeah i mean you 've been like to several countries already well i think it 's you 'll get to appreciate 'cause you 've left the country when you 're older what do you mean like 'cause i left the first time i got uhm papua new guinea was where i was born right i was still a kid and i didn't really remember the memories i wasn't really excited but i still i i remember the time when i left the country by myself coming to the philippines it 's more exciting oh yeah i understand na parang i i i understand like you grew up you feel liberated there yeah 'cause like 'cause like you know that was really the first time i left the country and that was the first time i was in a plane also so   uh  and you know how it is people say pal philippine airlines the service isn't that great the planes are kinda old the pilots are like you know nyak  uh-huh so i remember when i told the guys in debating team david my teammates david and and iba i was telling them guys you know this is the first time i 'm gonna leave the country this is the first time i 'm gonna be in a plane what this is the first time you 're actually leaving the country yeah yeah yeah so it was we were all there and you know on on the plane we were all seated down and then at that point i was asking okay so what happens now oh we 're gonna out we 're gonna do this and that okay and when the plane started right remember when the plane first started you start hearing these weird sounds rattling and dripping and so i started sweating i was getting really getting nervous and they 're still ribbing me uh the plane 's gonna blow up the plane 's gonna blow up oh i never heard that sound before i say what i said stop it stop it stop it leave me alone gosh i was really scared but once what and then that part i 'm sure you 'd agree with me that the worst part when you 're on a plane is just the exact moment when it leaves the ground  yeah   yeah  yeah you you 're your stomach goes topsy-turvy yeah yeah it 's like as if you know you 're like fifty feet in the air but your stomach is still at ground zero yeah gosh you feel like throwing up also when your ears pound yeah it was weird so how was your first tournament like my first tournament trip to bangkok yeah my first yeah it was really exciting i really wanted to go to bangkok i 've never been to thailand uh uhm so i was really looking forward to it and it while on the plane it was it was pretty uh a fairly short trip and landing in bangkok was was uhm  freaky yeah freaky it was like you 're landing in midnight and you 're really hungry 'cause the plane food wasn't that really good uh-huh and bangkok is pretty similar to the philippines in manila similar to manila and i really enjoyed debating there the debating experience the debating side uh-huh it was very competitive and very worthwhile debating for c s b college of saint benilde and the experience was really unforgettable and then considering you guys were all rookies right yeah not that much training our team was a rookie team also your team was a rookie team right yeah we were we were a rookie team but we still had like several weeks of practice training and you know way back then i was hanging out with the people who are the great ones today nikki bombit yeah caloy yeah r j ledesma yeah the great debaters of course the the problem in that is that you know whenever i meet someone you know you 've seen me when people say oh you 're jack right i remember you from ninety-four in the first all-asians and then all of a sudden there 's this meta-comparison of r j then r j now bombit then bombit now it was like me speaker stressing on the word 'me' laughter  it 's me still the same   yup still me me i really hate that when that happens though yeah of course i never did debate for wer weren't i keep on telling you i never debated for the competition it was always for fun yeah i didn't care if i lost yeah my main reason for debating is to go abroad just to visit countries and discover new cultures check out the chicks check out the girls uh taste the food and probably inspire you to travel later in life when i work and to build up my independence yeah it 's such a nice feeling right when you 're you know you 're there your parents aren't around you gotta take care of yourself of course yeah it 's like you 're working already and you 're traveling all around the world yeah you have to budget your money and buy food yeah it 's like i remember in singapore we had to subs we had to subsist on these two dollar rice meals 'cause we were staying in school okay and naturally the registration fee didn't cover all the meals they just pretty much covered breakfast and a few dinners you know cultural night break-in night or whatever so most of the time during lunch we 'd have to buy our own food and since it 's it 's summer there you know summer the cafeteria really wasn't the school cafeteria wasn't open just the small stalls you know just small place where they sell whatever  and you know while we were there we had to pick our food because there are only so many so many choices and some of the choices were really expensive it 's like you know it costs what it costs like about four or five singapore dollars to one american dollar and food there costs two dollars three dollars so you know in here i wasn't on a low budget i was going around like oh man i am hungry i wanna eat like ten bucks laughter twenty bucks uhm okay i think i 'll wait for the free dinner later laughter just go back for seconds yeah like like my tip trip in bangkok how i saved money so i 'cause like breakfast is really everyday right so i would eat a very heavy breakfast it 'd probably last me until the night so during the night i would probably eat a small snack and uhm keep you know keep me full for the rest of the day save save my money and spend my money on more clothes 'cause clothes are really cheap in bangkok  but the food in bangkok is really delicious it 's different from filipino food  uh uhm  uh uhm more spicy more fresh fresher vegetables and fish it 's pretty cheap compared to filipino food i mean quantity wise uh uhm it 's more cheaper  okay yeah in in singapore i didn't get the chance to do much shopping stuff there 's so expensive but i i thought something really funny 'cause when we were there walking around there was one night a bunch of us were just you know walking around checking the city singapore 's a very small city so you just you can make the what 's the main road orchard yeah yeah orchard road yeah orchard where the shops were yeah i was so surprised when we were walking down now showing lion king  and i remembered lion king had already shown here around one or two years ago yeah i was like hey this is great the philippines is actually first when it comes to movies you know something to feel proud about i don't know it 's a very small thing but you know yeah i watched that ahead of everyone else yeah if i was in the situation i 'd probably feel proud too laughter  you 've got the upper hand with the singaporeans singaporeans are out of date laughter  by one or two years yeah it 's a big thing and it 's because we 're better at getting pirated stuff i know singapore 's really strict in piracy   yeah  in piracy and the people there are so weird 'cause like   why  right in singapore you can't bring chewing gum when you smoke you can't just throw the butts anywhere yeah i remember my teammates when they 'd smoke they have to carry the butts in their pocket until they find a trash can and throw it out but and so i kinda figured that singapore 's really strict and when i got there i was kinda scared 'cause i think the caning incident already happened already in singapore michael fay yeah michael fay it already happened so joel was like uy don't get michael fayed don't get michael fayed so okay fine and so when we were walking around hey how about some gum you know we were ribbing each other there was one time we took their their their their train the m r t whatever it 's called and naturally there were signs there saying no smoking no gum no littering whatever and the people there were so serious not they 're just like sitting there straight-faced workers students they were all so serious you know i was like joking my friends we should we should put a sign there no laughing fine five hundred singaporean dollars  no really so so there i was expecting these people to be really so stuck-up and you know tight-assed and whatever and come the evening so since you know it 's the evening already so okay debaters you know debaters all party people we went to hard rock and i was so surprised the same geeky nerdy people you see debating and talking so intellectually with glasses and ivy league haircuts you see these are the same people jumping up and down on the dance floor doing the macarena doing the lambada  you know drinking you know tequila shots like it 's water something like gosh talk of your first vampires man weird singaporeans yeah i find them pretty weird how about people in thailand what were they like people in thailand were very kind they were also outgoing in parties they 're very hospi hospitable and they they like to laugh and joke around it 's similar to the filipino culture uh-huh the only problem with the thai people were they were not really fluent in english as we are in communicating  i have some fond memories of them they were very accommodating it was like it was like my fellow brothers in the philippines my fellow barkad my fellow friends in the philippines  laughter yeah i have also some fond memories of thai people i told you the story right oh yeah darn laughter  that was really weird one you know and the funny thing is years and years after that i still just sit down some place and think about it yeah what would have happened if laughter if i had gone on ahead and see what would have happened how different would my life be today if if i had let one night that 's destiny or fate how will you how will you classify destiny or fate stupidity stupidity laughter  i don't know i guess destiny yeah it 's destiny it 's destined to happen funny yeah
Philippines	you girls actually read this stuff i mean look at this the boyfriend clinic what 's with it i don't know i mean looking at the 1 word   i 've been going out with this guy for four weeks but he barely acts like my boyfriend  like we say in the parlance of the industry this is so much tsu-tsu  i mean laughter i mean look at this i mean what 's the basis for this stuff yeah actually yeah like this one i love my boyfriend but i can't stop thinking about this other guy laughter  why it 's common occurrence nowadays really laughter  yeah it 's because you 're not i 'm not human no not that it 's because you 're a guy  rea you know that is one reason why there is so much strife in the world when people start thinking of us like oh you 're a guy you won't understand i mean hello that 's true it 's basically true no no no no no there may be differences between people but when people communicate and they try to have this mind set that they can understand each other that will at least solve the problem even if the person can't exactly i mean i don't have to be i don't have to have gone through the holocaust to know how it feels to be what inside the pans and burners  no pans and burners uh i mean you haven't been put inside one of those burners right the ones in auschwitz uh uhm but you have an idea how it feels how it would feel   uh uhm uh uhm  precisely my point uh okay you don't have to be i mean instead of looking at these things i think girls and guys should just talk talk more i don't know like talk more relate more like like this is she your type speaker a laughs  what what 's wrong with it you know that 's what i meant by in saying that it 's probably the reason why most girls have such a skewed perception of me i mean where is the basis for this stuff what 's the where 's personal experiences where 's the but that 's anecdote have you seen an actual research an actual research  in actual research there are two types of evidence there 's one where you can actually cross reference it through studies like like when you put up a bibliography of stuff like the books you read that you actually do a research with all of those protocols and things and there 's anecdotal evidence this is anecdotal evidence it 's pretty subjective which means it 's subjective it 's not an objective data like if you say something like i don't know i guess i just hate it when people try to box you like this one i mean but sometimes it depends on the person reading uh too much plato on my part laughter  no not really because sometimes women just want to read about stuff like this yeah to read stuff like that but aside from that to have in to have an inter-connection with another woman uh uhm to relate per personal situations uh uhm to someone whom she thinks will understand her so this is a girl thing yeah i mean basically a girl thing i mean the nearest male counterpart of this is playboy laughter  uh no  laughter what there are guy magazines like this  no  no well f h m is one but not seventeen it 's for teens no no no i mean di ba i mean this is what seventeen magazine i 'm speaking as a com major i would know the rationale behind this magazine the title itself speaks the rationale it 's seventeen it 's for teeners   it 's for the teeners  look at look at the topics get kikay hair and make-up word sex and body laughter   oo nga 'no  i forgot what 's with it i mean what 's with it i don't know no no no i 'm just thinking along the lines of one of it 's my catholic upbringing i 'm so sorry laughter  of course i 'm  you don't like that mag and try that one uhm it 's cosmopolitan i think it 's worse laughter  worse it 's not worse it only shows you the latest fashion trends the the latest make-up trends six daring moves for single girls it 's just the title if you 'll browse and read it sex for virgins  that 's that 's yes those wet those starved sexy flying secret well yes no i 'm talking   well  i 'm talking like i don't understand this stuff but i actually do i mean i wanna be chief analyst of the words  but you 're just being human am i forgetting that i 'm not human laughter  no it 's not that it 's just that it 's just that the topics they tackle in those magazines are very very what   normal  yeah in a way but not all and maybe i don't know i guess i 'm still coming from the gestalt i have in reading the republic i mean in the republic in the have you read the republic plato 's republic  some part not all in plato 's republic plato actually chastises homer plato or socrates or plato he chastises homer it 's about saying that homer teaches the wrong stuff to the greeks and that 's why they have a sucky state it 's just like saying why our people are afraid of dying it 's because homer and some of his contemporaries portrayed death as something bad like when you die you go to hades and all this shit happens to you so if i was a warrior if it was my job to defend the republic the state so why would i throw my life away if dying would be so bad where 's the hon stutter look at it 'cause for some there 's glory in dying for your country but that that 's plato 's point that 's not common because the one that they 're exposed to sensitizes their mind for that particular gestalt   in their minds dying is bad meaning it 's not it 's not even if you die a glorious death battle this is remember we 're talking about the greeks we 're not talking about  uh uhm  okay the norse we 're not even talking about christians  okay  we 're talking about a gestalt in which when you die you go to hell or rather to hades and when you 're there nothing 's fun there  uh uhm  i mean look at greek the greek cosmology am i correct with that one yeah the greek but why do they portray hades as a place wherein there are two divisions well that 's according to the hercules movies the starworld movies  homer   don't don't base it on that well well according to that well according to that there 's these two divisions one is if you die a normal cause or if you did something good in your life you 'll be in in a place like paradise this is hercules duri  hercules journey the disney hercules no hercules the series starworld asia of course they 're going to show that it 's called mass media appeal no that 's what that 's the problem nowadays in mass media like this one i guess the reason why i said plato 's republic and all others it 's more like this i mean or maybe i 'm just too much the guardian but anyway like like i said a while ago life is more than just sex it 's more than just getting an orgy chuckle more than just well i agree with that yes but life is more than sex life is more than life is more than life itself but gail you are one of the leaders you 're conditioned for doing stuff that 's more than this  yes you may   yeah but still i 'm a female and i well yes but what i 'm saying is but you see this is a we live in a machoist society speaker a laughs  there are speakin' there are spoken rules regulation on our society that females should abide to  uh uhm  uh uhm right uh uhm i mean why do women wear high stiletto heels do you have to abide by them  well if you were if you 're a flight stewardess you 're expected to be beautiful to be glamorous to wear red lipsticks and brown eyeshadows peach blush-ons and everything the whole stuff uhm the way that women weren't were expected to not vote and not hold say positions such as lawyers politicians and  uhm i guess what i 'm just trying to say is uh the reason why i can understand stuff like this like cosmopolitan magazine heck they they provide jobs don't they yeah they do i don't know i guess   they 'll also show you where where the best where you can buy things at the lowest price i guess that was just something like   and  i mean i guess if it was just about a question of trends i mean this is good i mean stuff like this it probably chalk it up to dialectics where when thesis and anti-thesis meet in order to come up with a synthesis where i don't know maybe i 'm just too much ivory tower coming from where i came from laughter  you know how the atenean thinks sometimes what about if atenean girls read the same things hahaha laughter i think   uh uhm   right   yeah some even read what y m  i guess  i guess i get your point about the thing don't tell me you haven't read the male magazines no i haven't oh come on i 'm a catholic youth leader how dare you   hello  yes i haven't really yeah i find them repugnant   ows okay i mean have you seen any of those male magazines uh no no no we 're not talking about playboy we 're talking about the male variant what f y m   are we talking about  everything playboy the   if we 're talking about playboy those other stuffs they   the f y m the what i find them repugnant have you seen any of the pictures in those magazines i 've seen the pictures and they no not suck suck suck is such a bad term to use right now in that context laughter  oh i 'm not ignorant laughter  oh okay yes if you could insert kissing sounds here laughter  yeah right yeah right yes gail why are you going the other way laughter  gail don't go there laughter  anyway uhm i guess i 'm just angry at th at the thought that most people sometimes you tend to believe what the leftists say about current society because of the stuff you see like the media and even the church tries to keep people 's minds down so they don't rise up against the bourgeois laughter  like what the traditional politicians say right now not exactly mo like the trapos traditional politicians more like well like this instead of teaching people to reach beyond mere animal stuff it 's actually trying to emphasize you 're sleepy no not you 're just tired uhm the baby is tired no i 'm not hello i 'm not a baby anymore  laughter  yes you 're twenty-one anyway where were we yeah something like that it 's i don't know i guess it 's my upbringing i mean my upbringing was more like teaching me that i 'm this that i 'm i can be more than what most people are chuckle  yeah i was brought up to believe in that and in the inherent good within humanity in the potential for humanity so i guess seeing stuff like this trying to keep you in the animal level it 's just like it 's just sad uhm uh uhm that 's what plato was trying to say in his republic  it 's that 's part of what he was trying to say like it should be that education education should be about trying to teach people to reach their highest potential not just give them all the shit of data and that 's it or just trying to make them run through a system wherein they 're just trying to develop people in order to perpetuate the system we call them shicogen in among sci-fi buffs  shicogens salary men uh uhm wage slaves uh uhm people who are slaves of the bundy putring imitating sound of bundy clock  uh okay okay   i mean how many graduates can honestly chart their own course i mean i i guess i 'm lucky i 'm an atenean i mean heck i haven't i sometimes i have the right to choose my own job chuckle  but how many people can do that i mean how many people when they graduate just have to take this job because it 's the one being offered why is it like that why is the educational system like that if you graduate from a reputable and known school you easily you can easily get jobs

girls there 's a girl naman na sobrang tah-dah where is this where 's this boracay i saw it on t v what it 's an international thing or just local   no  pinoy pinoy that 's the thing that 's the clincher it 's all pinoy and the way they were posing especially the guys right when you have male body builders na foreigners uhm foreigners who are male who are body builders they know how to pose

ever you know photos na lang  or somebody you know like you don't have to pay for the person who will take the video  kasi this is the clincher okay  di ba my church did i tell you that it 's so strict the church i 'm going to  what  no no they have an official photographer really they have an official florist really yeah yeah okay and like their florist i have no problem with her you know although i found it funny that they had an official florist but i had no problem with her because you know tina she 's really went around for me and went to the places you know the type no like i feel no stress with my florist but the photographer we went there to ano to glizas so expensive my god okay for the the thing we wanted to get we were looking at it without uhm video coverage huh it costs twenty-five thousand okay   what  twenty-five thousand for fourteen rolls of film it 's fourteen rolls of film and one black and white an album of course only uhm one hundred loose three-r okay and uhm imported frame we told them remove the imported frame you know we don't need that we 'll just frame it ourselves  labas twenty-two thousand  yeah  three thousand only for the three thousand only

uh-huh yeah eighty glizas uhm sixty okay uh-huh they 're giving us two hundred forty three three-r loose glizas one hundred they 're charging eleven thousand wow and that 's that 's even meng that 's even with video oh oh but you 've seen the sample of both uhm uh glizas i 've seen the genesis is it good yeah because they took the debut of caloy 's sister which one genesis yes so they already know they 've worked with vicson  e but you know will the church allow i called already and they 'll just have to take some seminar uh okay and just make sure they follow everything to the letter uh yeah because maybe the problem is they don't want disruption in the liturgical service   yes exactly exactly that 's what they don't want so and i wanna tell them you know like just respect the wishes of the church because like there are apparently there are a lot of outfits that have been banned because they they took the seminar and they still broke the different rules and sayang i mean it 's a nice church people would be getting married there  because yeah  a lot of people are considering that church already yeah it looks kinda expensive laughter  yes it is it is but yeah then again for a church

invitation are you having it printed i found na  yeah v- craft uh yeah that 's good that 's a good but it 's kinda expensive ha  uh a little bit but it falls within our budget uh that 's good we were really planning to spend like twenty we 're spending we 're spending only eighteen that 's no problem no problem what about uhm what else the souvenirs you 're making it right yeah it 's so expensive to get married i swear it 's so expensive how much have you reached already you 're in the five hundred four hundred oh my god laughter  i know when i when when we were talking about it we 're computing it over the phone oh he was computing he was telling me ces four hundred one four hundred two the type yeah and i 'm like what oh my god no way what other expenses have you not added to that well the gown someone interrupts the conversation   anong oras ka uuwi me-ann  oh my gosh oh yeah i have a class uh no no everything 's there already you join us naman o laughter   hanggang anong oras

camille 's class  bakit  that 's not counted why speakers a and b talk in visaya   'yun lang alam ko e  i told my mom that one na you 're mak you 're telling me that you 're making kwento that thing

Philippines	uhm next question what do you think is the more effective review method the self-study approach or or what 's this or the form and the formal thing where you go to class and all of you review self-study or class i think it 's important to have a mixture of both what did you do uh self-review and then go to the review class but actually what i did e i chose the subjects where i was weakest and so with those subjects where i 've not had a good background i would attend review classes  pero those subjects where i felt i i had a strong background i studied it on my own and then i just referred to the notes which my other batchmates ha took when they attended review classes but i think uh most people no i think most people i know who really did well in the bar exams they studied on their own oh yeah that 's what i did i just attended the preview yeah you were always in the gym no i know i regret that now but uh laughter i was uh i i studied at my own pace decided not to keep up with everybody and yes because i wanted to do other things while i was reviewing and then i attended the pre-week pre-week is that week right before the sunday that 's where they give you the areas which uh poss  they feel yeah from which possible questions may arise and which they feel you must concentrate on examiners may change every year 'no  yeah yes you have no way of knowing who the examiners will be  next year no  no  we don't even know the examiners now we only have guesses  now  we only have guesses we don't know for sure who they are like we just know the chairman of course because he 's justice davide he 's appointed by the the kwan 'no by the chief justice chief justice appoints the   appoints him and then usually it 's the most junior justice who becomes the head of the bar exams committee and then the chairman justice davide chose the examiners rumor has it that he chose some of his kwan his close friends cebuanos so political law i well i don't know i don't really care so we have guesses like rumors na naman and you rely on rumors usually some of these rumors are really true like last year i know that they anticipated it that pascual will be the examiner for labor  yes yes  so a lot of people really prepared for that exam yes 'cause he 's very exacting e  he wants you to to phrase it phrase the law accurately and he has his own way he has his buzz words  if you don't write down   what 's buzz words  words that he thinks are important ahhh things are you know which you give it a specific meaning so he wants those buzz words so they had to study his book and he was really the examiner these people are they have they become your teachers before pascual was my teacher he teaches in u p so uh some of them like our senior partner what rene cayetano was the examiner rene cayetano the senior partner of this firm yeah in nineteen eighty-nine labor also uhm labor eighty-nine nineteen eighty-nine most of them didn't know even pia because pia is my batchmate or classmate  she 's the daughter of rene  his daughter  and before the nineteen eighty- nine bar exams there were rumors that he was the bar examiner but pia was saying of course not if he was the bar examiner i 'm good at i should know this is my dad he didn't tell us word  uhm do you think that like you need parang you need to devote like a part of the test to psychological exams also parang just to parang you know to know if speakers c and d speak at the same time  if you don't have the right frame of mind if you 're you won't do it you you can't you can't do well in that exam you it requires a lot of mental energ ano 'yon mental well-being e just to survive that exam and there words perhaps also yeah the tension and the pressure create the psychological tensions that uh normally  pressure  break anybody who 's not   yeah yeah they would unrav yes of course and of course   and there were cases right yes people cracked after the uh yeah during the exam itself they break down and cry or they drink ink or they scream   oh you 're kidding   yeah there are some girls word   no uh   during your exam yeah during our exam what do i didn't know anything about that i remember about the girl who ano who had to be carried out in a stretcher  well  uh no i didn't know about that but i knew about the girl who drank the ink because my classmate was her roommate uh we were so words  oh many of those every year anyway uh law school should be the primary meeting of uh word like we start out in ateneo we start out with five classes we only graduate two  so there there you should already get the the wackos out  yeah  but seeing if you look at many practitioners na you see plenty of weirdoes walking around also that means that uh the practice of law and schizophrenia are not necessarily incompatible 'no laughter  in fact when i when i was in my freshman year we had this batchmate turned out to be a wacko she turned out to be insane at first we but she 's very intelligent e and she writes really good in in poems  uh uhm yeah  poems it turned out we thought she was just weird she was just an artist yeah parang eccentric until she started fantasizing about burning a classmate or saying that she was the wife of a certain person and then she 's being pursued by th the new people 's army and the yellow army and what was this the clincher was that she was the daughter of jackie onassis  uh uhm  uh yeah that was the clincher she would stay out in the rain and then oy chari come in you 're going to be you 're going to get sick sabi niya no i 'm used to the cold i was born in connecticut and my mother was jackie onassis until cory aquino kidnapped me and brought me to this damned wretched place ganon  but when they found out she was you know mentally off-balanced it was really true ha  she passed the entrance exam she passed the interview with flying colors and she turned out to be did they ask her to leave they did uh i see because you 'll pass the bar even if you 're crazy as long as you autistic people can take that bar and pass it and then uh well whether uh whether he is qualified to be a lawyer or not later on is decided by what either the clients who choose him or firm that he works for yeah people who would like to commit him later on word crazy that bar exam is not going to indicate your psychological world view uh uhm uhm joyce you wanna choose a question uhm okay it says that quality of preparation you underwent do you think that having been educated in an elite and di ba yung elite institution gave you an edge over other like other aspirants that 's what i thought the bar exam it was an equalizer some sort 'cause nothing ewan ko feeling nga nothing ever prepares you for the bar exams e   kasi it 's not it 's not the usual di ba yung the technique what do you call that in teaching that you have one professor and then you learn from him parang   socratic method no no it 's the pavlo quer query query  what do you call that  pedag  pedagogic yeah pedagogic method na you parang you share the same universe di ba that there 's one teacher the teaching is not it 's not that way e di ba  it 's this outside you 're a stranger who didn't teach you anything who 's going to choose the question now your his universe is different from yours like you may be ha have been taught different things like in u p kasi i 've noticed we were taught the kwan e complex questions yung each question must you must you must analyze it because it 's not as easy as it seems na parang you don't trust a simple question ganon na you always think no there is a trick in this  kaya during the bar exam i was i was also thinking ganoon no this question is too easy there must be a catch ganyan ganyan 'yun pala it was just it was just simple   simple  just asking me uh you know a fundamental question but i answered in a complex way uhm so you see the training is different and the emphasis is different so that 's the that 's the problem   did you you have to do some adjustment then when you get there  yes yes  speaker b says something but unclear well i thought that uh going to my school was worth the trouble and the expense because no the bar exam is a measure of basic knowledge they 're not supposed to measure uh unusual or obscure uh questions of law now that basic knowledge is something like a common universe all lawyers must share see if you don't know that then you should not become a lawyer  that 's the whole logic of the bar exam  yeah but is the writ of amparo well there so you have isolated you have isolated exceptions to the rule  common universe  but as a general rule the bar exam is only supposed to ask you uh to measure a minimum threshold of knowledge which you must possess in order to be qualified to serve as a lawyer now there are only how many months before the bar exam  that 's the ideal  six months six months it 's impossible for you to go through everything that you 've read during the four years that you uh went to law school but conceivably they can ask you anything about what you learned during those four years and if your school was not very good then that review would be all that you would basically you have to rely on  you have to rely on  i i i recall that as you know my preparation was spotty  i did not devote one hundred percent of my time to the study studying for the bar because i was also busy engaged in other activities like uh physical training so i noticed that when i was taking the exam already i knew the answer to the question not because i had read it during the the months prior immediately uh preceding the bar exam  immediately  well i still remember what my professor told me during the four years during some obscure day when i was sitting in his classroom and i think that is a crucial em they consisted the bulk of my answers they call what they call stock knowledge i 'm sure you noticed that also i did did you yes i did but  stuff that you did not use   i think the question well my personal opinion is that the questions some some of the subjects the examiners were not able to phrase the question correctly okay accurately   uh well   also true  it 's so hard to to know what is he asking for i don't understand he 's asking  what exactly that he wants  that is a common that 's the difference and i really felt because of the ambiguity in the question i was having a hard time trying to de to figure out what he was asking for so i was always in because i was trained in u p i was always i would always think that he would was asking a hard question and he wants me to analyze   can you ask the proctor   no you can't   no you can't  you can't because the proctor does not know uhm he does not know yeah yeah he 's just like personnel in the supreme court he probably doesn't know the answer and he doesn't understand the question he understands it even less so unlike uzoy i i really think that the bar exam is an it 's an equalizer but but of course we have an edge okay in the sense that we have been trained better because there are a lot of law schools you could see a lot of people from the provinces uh uhm and i remember in my in my one in my room there were people who took the exams three times already and they were comparing the paper  yeah

Philippines	i can't believe he stood me up with a gay how would i know  pero si willie there 's something wrong with larry but that doesn't mean willie is gay well willie is psychologically insane laughter  fifty percent and mental uh physically disabled i refuse i refuse to believe that i mean as if i didn't hear anything about it which one about willie or about larry  it 's sad if he is gay he is gay he may not be gay because he sometimes he goes out with one of our friends who isn't gay if if a guy goes out with a gay  mo most likely he is most likely but how come how about larry  goes out with whom  rocky   rocky is straight exactly so he 's not there goes your theory  si larry   kasi parang it could be just a one afternoon date laughter   how pathetic hello hello duh laughter  how pathetically yours  laughter so uh that 's the revelation and he gained a lot of weight  nay he gained a gained a lot of weight as in he has already a beer belly because of the ano umiinom he drinks a lot probably laughter  god i 'm stunned so next guy i 'm stunned really but how can he probably be he doesn't look like one same here elise you 've seen larry di ba  laughter   sino sino   larry you 've seen him   larry  a long time ago i don't remember how he looks like   but he doesn't look gay di ba  he looks   probably he 's a girl trapped in a man 's   body   body  he had a girlfriend before so that 's why yeah but nothing happened well that 's true what do you mean nothing nothing happened as in in the relationship   they didn't get  the relationship broke off   yeah it fizzled out  okay or nothing happened because   uh well i don't know about that laughter well  laughter it 's subject to rebuttal laughter  it looks like like i beg to disagree about him being gay no or not being gay him being gay   he is gay  okay i don't mind laughter  my god his gay friend laughter  he paid for the lunch it was i had a good lunch  at least at least at least at least you had a good lunch yeah good good sense of humor   he 's so funny  that 's why i mean he has a good sense of humor hundred twenty percent yes speaker b laughs   sayang   yes god laughter   oo nga e   yeah sayang   what about the other brother he 's still in london he could be gay also oh god  di ba  like he had a girlfriend and this girlfriend became so  malambing with him i don't know how far she started kissing him and she just he just broke off he didn't like the idea because  because he probably doesn't like something something like a public display no they were inside a room which room the girl visited him  his house   oo nga  now how did you know   he got sick he got   how did you know from the girl 's side maritess knows the girl also from whatever laughter  wherever knows the girl told maritess and told me a friend of a friend yes so i guess it 's true  oh word spreads around   why would the girl  exactly di ba  so it 's either laughter  oh my god oh my god normally two great looking fags speakers b and c laugh  well same as uh mr jerome  he-effect yeah to begi he has his he has a child already  he calls himself jerome   huh   uh uhm   jerome   jerome  he doesn't go by by pepe anymore no not anymore nope okay nope since he became the managing director managing director of uh okay a certain company company x y z   you mean the one he owns  no not the anyway the employment uh yes that one he now owns that employ yeah well i really don't know who finances it okay  laughter i 'm getting confused i guess oh there so anyway   oh is it something like anyway anyway anyway anyway anyway  teka ano baby girl or boy  jerome  first born baby i don't know no idea  basta he got married march okay march   his wife gave birth recently a month or a few months ago   march april may okay oh okay yeah so it it must be premature speakers b and c laugh  is it nine months or is it down payment premature or maybe premature but the baby 's normal speaker b laughs so i guess prematurely normal full term full term yeah okay ibang term term  laughter but premature from wedding there are women who would go old instead of sleeping their way uh  yeah it is possible   because because if you put it that way it makes sense yeah 'cause i couldn't imagine pepe uhm trying to get his way with a girl before they get married i don't think it came from him the idea of going to bed with her  look at this  but as you said he was given a house by the family who by the girl 's family he just said the girl 's family gave him a house   by the girl 's family  yeah  di ba you said he was given a house speaker b laughs  probably not me my sister yeah yeah yeah it was word yeah see what that 's a good uhm   the reason why  incentive yeah exactly di ba  to procreate you know nowadays or gay nowadays but now other women have beliefs   and gay men   ha  have such the same belief as others going to bed with men before engaging in the sanctity of marriage simply because they want to know if they 're sexually compatible right wrong but that 's not the case with this couple yes i think he just wanted to be and generally speaking  oo  can you run that by me again  ano 'yon ano 'yon  again again again   again again okay speaker c laughs  not a lot of women although how how the world corrupts your mind oh not a lot of women would go to the extent of going to bed with men before getting into marriage the sanctity of marriage simply because they want to know if they 're sexually com   society yeah society dictates it and because they want to know if they 're sexually compatible or whatever   but because but because there are other there are other women i know that have still kept and believe in the sanctity sanctity of marriage and you know maintain your self pure and what have you uh uhm before you enter into something like that y'know what i mean yeah but as you said nga some women like to check their sexual compatibility i don't get it i but i don't get it   i guess for them it 's a lifetime  commitment   commitment so since they 'll be doing that the rest of their lives to each his own well yeah well i respect the idea of others it bothers me but in this case this girl really wants to get pregnant   by him because  uh uhm  i think for filipinos most of the time that 's the reason why they go to bed with a guy to hook the man yeah not to try out if they 're compatible uh uhm well speaking from our generation   really  from our generation i guess  oo nga laughter  we 're way i was just about to say that yeah really i can't speak for the other girls the younger ones  exactly  i can't   oo nga  but i mean but you see it even now younger girls sleep at avery early age uh uhm exactly just like someone who 's twelve years younger than me and and proud of it  oo nga  well she even said good luck to you uh yeah yeah   in front of all the men  like saying hey paint the town red exactly and she even said it 's good i already did it  she did what   she made it look as if i was so pathetic i was explaining that i i 'm happy the way i am  i hap i 'm happy with my choice  uh uhm uh uhm uh uhm uh uhm and then suddenly she just   it 's a choice you make  exactly and then suddenly she just whispered loudly whispered  loudly   loudly  yeah she really really made sure i would hear her and say it 's good i already did it hello yeah parang  to each his own exactly it 's sad they they find me pathetic she 's pathetic because you 're not those are things you 're not even supposed to talk it out with well it depends on the kind of approach   that 's our point of view that 's our point of view to them it 's just like and you know the thing is about sex i think if you just tried it once twice even up to ten times you 're not in the position to say if it 's really good or not i think it you should have tried it at least uhm basta  more than twenty times uh   a regular regular or on a regular basis to know if it 's really enjoyable or not but i but i think the way i see things kasi  i agree with you but then the way i see it it 's i think supposed to be enjoyable when you do it with someone you love with someone you   uh uhm   you word   that 's how we were taught that 's how we were taught uh uhm to be with for the rest of your life uh uhm uh uhm pero  that may sound very conservative but that 's yeah no no tama 'yon   kaya lang for someone someone like her i don't think she 's done it too many times unless she really sleeps around  yes   exactly   but i doubt it  so for some   yeah i doubt it also a young girl like her to say na to talk like uh she knows so much about sex exactly uh unlikely e kasi it 's something it 's a skill parang like me i 'm still learning 'no  laughter  yeah i think there 's uh i don't know about other people but i tend to think there 's a certain threshold na then you can say na oh it 's enjoyable it 's ganyan  but especially if you 're just starting to do it  parang you 're just groping around  yeah she may just word  or just trying to convince yourself that you 're really enjoying it because you 're supposed to enjoy it it 's supposed to be the best thing in the world to do  but   exactly   must be the people she goes around with  yeah i don't know she has to prove something yeah uh uhm uh-huh di ba  she may pretend that she 's a sex goddess uh uhm  hello   sex bomb  exactly but actually she 's not   hindi ba sex bomb sex bomb well we sound like sore losers laughter  no no hello that i will never agree with you uh-huh it depends on how you see things it 's true well of course it doesn't necessarily mean that what is right for me may be right for them exactly isn't it follows also that to each his own yeah to each his own correct to each his own  bakit bakit i feel sorry for you because you haven't you haven't enjoyed uhm quote and unquote  ano you haven't tried the joys of sex  ganoon ba 'yon   'yon ba 'yon   yeah in effect in effect speaker a laughs like i wasn't even advertising the fact that i am because to begin with why should i uh uhm  word i had to keep it that way i shouldn't advertise it anyway it was gene who started that discussion he was another gay friend  yeah   uh-huh uh-huh anyway and then there 's another guy like he was telling me  michael was saying he was telling me so you 're going against the grain  yeah but that 's not difficult you know going against the grain uhm   going against the grain then i said it 's not difficult with me because there are no takers i made it look like it 's a joke because there are girls around who are into it and if i 'm going to say i 'm not like that  uh uhm   it 's as if i 'm condemning those two  girls   yeah  so i 'll just make it sound as if it 's a joke and you know what he said a few minutes after you know i 'm a very kind person

it 's still showing uh show i guess it 'll still be shown by that time titanic is still showing huh still showing   how many weeks uh i don't know   three weeks it 's on its third week  more than a month no more more  it 's more than a month yeah  words uh two weeks  ay wait wait you know i told a joke once you know these signs that says uhm coming soon now showing next picture in cinemas right  oh yeah   yeah yeah  i said titanic should should be under the sign which says still showing instead of now showing laughter   still showing   sti still showing laughter  yeah it 's almost   word ghost remember ghost  uh yeah ghost was shown for for two straight months  two straight months   titanic titanic is gonna beat that soon oh i think two more weeks and it would be two months yeah oh  there was there was a point i think they showed yesterday remember channel nine uh yeah did you watch it oh i missed it they were supposed to show that special uh documentary something  docu documentary about the the actual survivors of the titanic uh yeah ay wait you know i watched i watched this channel uhm what was that uhm time and again i think it was n b c time and again and they featured titanic  yeah  first they featured the movies the first movie was uh titanic in the nineteen thirties and then there was the nineteen fifties version  word   there were i forgot how many versions there were but the most accurate uh at that time was entitled a night to remember based on a novel  uh  yeah i remember that i went i visited their homepage you visit their homepage i visited the homepage of titanic the movie uh-huh and uh it says there the complete details of the titanic directed by james cameron blah blah blah but there they show us the history of the titanic and the past movies the predecessor movies of the titanic where this curr this current ano this current version uh followed  oh yeah  uh hey you know what what 's interesting the first few movies of the titanic showed the titanic sinking and then leaving something like smoke and then they believe that titanic did not break  yeah yeah  it was only  it only titanic broke only when it reached the bottom yeah because maybe because of uh uh pressure yes strong water pressure yeah hey it was only this version the titanic james cameron that he featured the titanic the titanic breaking into   actually breaking into two yeah and then the survivors actually claim that before it even sank it broke in two so wow they didn't they didn't do much of a research before uh yeah they just maybe they just sank into word  uh yeah and then and then there was this theory uhm they said when that was before nineteen eighty-five nineteen eighty-five was the time when the titanic was found at the o at the bottom of the ocean uhm they they believe that the titanic sank because the iceberg uhm made a three hundred foot gash yeah i guess it 's the other way round the boat was the one that uh no no uh actually they believe that uhm the iceberg was able to was able to cut through the steel of the titanic producing a three hundred foot damage uh a gash oh uh but then when in nineteen eighty-five the titanic was found they found that it wasn't a three hundred foot gash but only a twelve square meter uh a twelve square meter hole  and then it was shocking because it was only as big as a refrigerator and based on you know comparison of size that 's very small then then how come the titanic sank and then one explanation was because of water pressure  hole   yeah too much pressure on the wa water that causes how many ano uhm uh thousands   gallons of water  yeah thousands of gallons of water per second based on research  yeah  yeah and remember the movie itself where uhm they were showing the evidence of how the titanic sank they were showing the old lady they they showed the the the lowest level of the titanic uh yeah i think i think it was the engine room it turned out at the engine room that 's where the water pressured in it was the water uh somehow hit hit the hit the boat at strategic points as if it wanted to sink it  uh-huh   yeah  oh it 's started from the engine slowly sinking to the second and third level so it was adding weight to the front to the dorsal part of the boat uh uhm is that correct dorsal  uh i don't know no i think i 'm not sure i think the dorsal how do you call it dorsal part of the boat adding more weight to the front that 's what caused it to break   uh yeah yeah yeah only the recent researchers yeah interesting yeah and there was actually a safe there was actually a safe found by a by a i think the russian russian uh research team they they actually i i saw it in the discovery channel i think they opened it they tried to but they can't because of the jam really jammed yeah although they found the safe uhm they they vowed never to touch any of the debris of the titanic uh-huh of course as uh paying their respects to the dead there until they found upon finding the safe they found the safe that 's where they broke their promise speaker a laughs uh well this is a uh a robotic like a submersible  uh-huh  uh-huh complete with robotic arms just like in the movie uh-huh they tried to open the safe although it was still it 's still rusted it 's supposed to be weak right yeah and that should have been weakened they could not they couldn't get it to open uh they didn't bring the it to the surface  they didn't bring  no they just left it there because according to ano according to some survivors they said that that it 's useless to open it because the crew left it empty anyway before it sank uh laughter  yeah was it empty what if it 's true oh laughter  what if inside there was really the heart of the ocean speaker a laughs  you know what wait uh  imagine kung pinoy yung naka-diskubre speaker a laughs filipino crew member you can turn off our destiny toward the states word it just takes one blue diamond whoa the moment it is found there 's really the heart of ocean we will set up i will find we will buy the whole set of james cameron speaker a laughs with his you know wait wait wait i i read this paper and the article manila bulletin uh it states that the heart of the ocean is a fictitious gem   yeah  but some american and i think british uh british jewelers uhm they did make one yeah they did make one

Philippines	hi pam so you 've been here for eleven to or twelve weeks already in la salle how do you find college life as a freshman i 'm enjoying my life here in la salle i mean it 's though it 's very different from the life i had in bacolod but i 'm having fun e  i get along well with my blockmates i mean you know i mean this college thing isn't that bad at all i mean you know i get to learn a lot of things how about you you 're third year i mean you must have you must have encountered a lot of things already oh yes believe me i have encountered a lot of things first of all in my lifestyle it has really changed like in bacolod uhm we 're used to having helpers around we have drivers like if you wanna go to this place you can just say i wanna go to this place and then snap you 're there like and here in manila it 's like you have to commute and with the traffic and everything it takes an hour to get to just one place i mean that 's the least an hour it 's like the least and then uhm in bacolod you don't cook you don't do your laundry while here in manila you 're forced to do all those things just to survive and you have to budget your money also like in bacolod you can ask your mom for money if you need to go shopping and everything and here it 's like you 're on a tight budget and it 's really hard with everything i you know what i find amazing in college is that because since we came from an ex from an exclusive school in bacolod i mean i find it 'cause it 's coed so i mean you know the first day that i entered school or i attended classes it 's like oh so this is this is the coed school that my other friends have been experiencing ever since and it it 's cool though because you know guys are just all around you but sometimes you will just okay i mean it it 's an ins because it 's really different when you have somebody to look forward to when you enter the classroom i mean you know you can get so lazy sometimes and i mean like and like when you have a crush on your classroom i mean woohh okay so i might as well just en attend class because i wanna feel that day so i don't know that part i have to agree with you because i used to be in this class where i was sandwiched by these two cute guys so i was like really motivated to come to class every m w f because it was like i was really so motivated with you know i mean you 're sitting wi with these two guys and then you 're having you 're getting their attention because they need a groupmate and everything so you 're the first one who they come to if they don't have if they don't know what lesson is or something and it 's really fun to have to be in a coed school because we 're used to having an all-girl school in saint scho right so it 's like uhm they 're all girls and then it 's like you face the same people every day and then here in la salle you have the trisem uhm you have the trisem schedule what do you call that so it 's like every term you have different classmates you meet a lot of people and then you make a lot of friends and you know what i mean i don't know but even in a short span of time that you know i 've been i 've been in la salle i mean what eleven weeks there was not yet enough to to say about things and to conclude or whatever i mean i i already i already learned a lot i mean i probably uh now i learned that i mean in college you really meet different people with different with different personalities characters i mean i mean uh back i mean there i can i would see some group of friends like they would dress in this and these clothes that you know i 'm not even i was i 'm not even aware of them but i don't know i guess it uh it 's just it 's just it 's just fun i don't know i don't know the word but it 's just cool to to see a lot of people but i guess the hard the hardest part for me right now is that i don't know where exactly i fit in 'cause since i 'm new here in manila i don't know where or with whom exactly i could jive and i could get along with i mean i 'm close with my blockmates but still i mean eleven weeks it 's not enough time to really say that you know uh i belong here stutter  but i guess that 's the that 's the nice thing i mean that 's the interesting part of it it 's a matter of knowing or adve it 's kinda an adventure or or i don't know you get to seek for something mys a mystery or i don't know i mean yeah i think the studies the studying part is not really the hardest part i think it 's also the adjust adjustment thing i mean you have to be able to fit in with different types of personalities here since you 're new you don't know the the people here and then unlike in bacolod wherein everybody knows everybody because the city is too small and then here it 's like you have to you have to really adjust and you have to adopt your personality with their personality and finding friends is really a difficult thing here but there are a lot of people who are also experiencing that kind of thing so you it 's like it helps to know that you 're not alone and then in the end you always find someone to jive with i guess that 's what i like best about being here in manila 'cause nobody knows me and nobody nobody knows the real me so i can just do whatever i want i mean i ca i can dress what in wha wha i mean i can dress whatever i mean in that in whatever way i want to dress i mean and i guess uhm one thing that probably upsets me is that i remember back in in my l pep the orient thing i mean one of the one of the l officers of the student council told us that you don't have to in la salle there 's no such thing as tambayan and you can just sit in a if you wanna sit in that certain bench you can you can sit there but mo and then i believed that woohh woohh fair everybody 's equal equality is practiced but then as days pass by i mean weeks after i i realized that you know okay so i can't sit there 'cause the athletes are supposed to be there and what is it that that 's college i mean sometimes you just have to say that that that 's the way that 's the wa that 's the way things happen here i mean if say i 'm not saying it that treatment of people or there 's inequality or you know but i guess that the i don't know fun it 's so i don't know jane i mean yeah i agree with you i mean with the new image thing people don't know you so you can work here uhm sensitive angle here or your fun angle here or whatever angle you want so you can dress the way you want that 's really that 's really an advantage here considering that we don't have uniforms thank god for that rule and also with with what you said about the tambayan thing that 's really true because no matter what they say about having equality here in la salle it 's there 's always a sense of hierarchy like there 's always a structure like this part is for the athletes this is for the upperclassmen and then you can't of course you just can't mingle with them just like that i mean but after uh sometime you tend to these people tend to to graduate i mean they graduate they leave la salle and then you take over their position and then people like you in in the first year also experience the same thing as you do so i think that 's just a part of life and that 's just a part of college life that everybody goes through because everybody is struggling to be up there everybody is struggling to fit in right yeah and i just i just wanna ask are you having a hard time waking up i mean i have a seven o'clock class and it 's really a complete burden for me to wake up at se i mean what six 'cause i still have to plan on what clothes to wear i mean okay i there 's an advantage not to not having our uniform but there 's also a disadvantage to that because you know i mean the way they say that no it doesn't matter what on what it doesn't matter whatever you wear it 's good but duh it does i mean yeah i have to agree with that no matter what they say uhm fashion is always a big thing for students right i mean you have to you you need to look your best i mean why look worst when you can look your best i mean that 's always a good model i mean what happens if you meet these people and then you 're not in your best appearance that day so it reflects a lot on your personality too and yes i have uhm difficult time i have a difficult time in waking up since i have an eight o'clock class everyday so i have to wake up at seven and that is really that is really a burden for me that is really so hard and then plus i also go through the same thing as you do in choosing clothes i usually change and then i 'm not happy with what i look and then i change again and then i just tuck all my clothes in my cabinet until i can't see the i can't see the organization of my clothes anymore i mean it it 's really it really affects you a lot right right so what do you think about the trisem system here in la salle well the trisem system here in la salle in one word if you describe it in one word it 's fast i mean if you compare it with las la salle system in bacolod they have two terms a year and if we have our our midterm exams they 're having their preliminary exams and while we 're having our finals they 're just having their midterm exams so you can imagine how how fast our pacing is i mean you 're expected to absorb a handful of information in that short of time and that 's really difficult i mean i don't know how students can cope with that i mean i don't know how i coped with that i mean for staying on la salle for almost three years here i don't know how i survived that kind of pacing when i 'm used to uhm i i need a lot of time to prepare myself for a quiz and everything and then here in la salle it 's like oh you have a long exam tomorrow so you have to study and it 's like everything is really time pressured here it 's like you can really see the importance of your of time managing of time management here what about you well i too am having a hard time especially that i 'm still in my first year and you know period of adjustment etcet etcetera etcetera i mean this is really it 's really hard for me sometimes to someti i used to have a hard time uhm when i wake up in the morning i don't know i mean i would say oh my gosh i have to i have to i have to go to school i have to attend class because you know i mean i i will end the the term sooner i mean in a few in a few weeks i mean the first term i will have my finals already and i can't i can't afford to miss a single lesson 'cause everything as you say i mean here in la salle it 's really fast and and i know it 's a privilege to be here and i just can't you know i i don't wanna be the block i don't wanna i don't wanna waste this opportunity to have a good education and that 's why i 'm really trying my uh trying hard to to cope with this certain trisem system and i think that you know if i pass the exam i might as well i mean i i i can i can cope with this i can i can surpass or i can survive this you know yes i mean being able to survive your first eleven or twelve weeks here is a big stuff already i mean i know of some people who who just stay here for a week and then they go home to bacolod i mean they 're wasting their money and then they 're not even trying that hard but i admire you for being so optimistic and and optimistic and very goal goal-oriented for that

something and when i look at her she knows what i 'm thinking oh you have a connection yeah i think so uh yes i 'd like to believe so you know whenever she 's around it 's as if i 'd like to look at her and not care about anything else so then you see whenever on saturdays we i we basically go to her place huh what do you do oh i what i mean is i i bring her home  you bring her to which home   and   uh to to their home oh and uh it 's as if you bring her home from where  word   where where does she stay she stays with her auntie oh uh they live at pasay it 's along taft avenue oh near la salle yeah yeah i think so yeah anyway that 's how it is uhm whenever oh so she only goes home during saturdays not necessarily only on saturdays and sundays but whenever she could uh okay because you know she 's still a student by the way so during saturdays you take her home to their home yeah and we go out although it 's not as fancy as some people might think 'cause well she 's more or less a high society girl not i mean it 's not that she 's co&ntilde;o you know that term it 's not that she 's co&ntilde;o or something but she 's she is just used to the the good life well and you 're not no it 's not that i 'm not but i haven't been quite pampered no i haven't been quite exposed to that kind of girl well you see anyway it 's uh for personal reasons uhm we try to enjoy ourselves as

watched a movie yeah oh the last movie i watched was jurassic that was a long time ago yeah i know i rather watch v c r oh uh what is what was the last one uh that you saw mr bean the ultimate disaster movie that 's nice i find it very funny yeah i like that movie too what 's your favorite scene uhm let me see there were there were a lot of good scenes but i guess the one when he 's when he was pretending to like goup the stairs and go down uh yeah yeah yeah when he was stutter he was just in his room but some of the scenes are kind of green right the jokes are somewhat green yeah and gross too yeah and you know i i find it very gross when mr bean you know word chuckle that uh yeah that was gross chuckle  it got all the blood still he ate it  yeah but it was really funny how was he able to fix the picture what picture i mean you know uh the the whistler 's mmother uh he got this poster of of the painting uh it 's a poster and uh yeah and then he sneaked up right uh yeah yeah and then he like glued the poster with an egg white yeah  with an egg white  yeah  some bubble gum with with what bubble gum uh yeah bubble gum   he was eating bubble gum yeah chuckle it was kind of funny but it was ano it was nice at least he got off the hook yeah yeah yeah yeah i thought he was going to show the you know the painting with with you know drawing yeah with his drawing  you see when when he uh put it uh what do you call it when he raises his thumbs up yeah thumbs up it was nice although it was not his thumb that he raised uh it 's his middle finger   middle finger stupid uh it 's so noisy yeah is that the l r t yeah that 's the l r t uhm uhm i i 'm trying to write a story what what do you want to hear it sure sure sure although it 's a little morbid morbid yeah you like morbid yeah oh there 's this guy in the first scene there 's this guy and there 's this girl uh-huh uh the girl is like the mistress of the guy so they were in this hotel room and they were doing something you know   oh yeah dirty-minded huh hihihi no and uhm they didn't know that they were being ano they were under surveillance surveillance by uhm what like a private investigator oh and so they were being taped so there was this camera hidden somewhere in the room uh-huh and uhm afterwards like after some days the guy went to the house of his wife aw 'cause it was their anniversary and uhm she liked to cook uh dinner for them uh uhm and they 're supposed to eat together so for their anniversary yeah so he 's there and his wife was very nice to him and gave him the wine and everything the food uh uhm and after he ate he felt groggy dizzy and yeah he was ab he was able to sleep right then and there his wife poisoned him no no it 's not poison it 's like uh marcos 's sleeping pills or something so when he woke up he he found himself tied to like a furniture or furniture a heavy chair or a i 'm not sure i haven't gone into the details yet but it 's like a a heavy piece of furniture uh-huh and he was bound there sitting on the floor uh-huh and he his arms were tied behind the leg of the chair or whatever it was and his feet were bound together too uh uhm and then uh his wife was talking to him and as it turned out the wife already knew that he was having an affair oh and so uhm the wife wheeled in uhm a t v what t v television oh yeah and uh like a v c r and they played and the wife played a tape  oh   and in the tape where you know well the it was the surveillance tape so uh the guy saw himself and his girl his mistress and the hotel room and everything uh uhm and so after that uhm the wife was kind of mad but he was calm uh she was calm yeah and she said that since it was their anniversary she has a gift for the guy so she brought out this box and gave it to the guy and when she opened the box there was the head of the girl oh gross and so since the wife said that oh since since you love this girl you might as well have her so she lifted the head gave it to the guy and the guy was stunned and he couldn't do anything since he was 2 words  yeah so the girl kind of uh took the hai the head by the hair and kind of pushed that into the guy 's face oh god so the guy was able to kiss the girl and yeah you know and and then after that uh uhm the wife left just left the head there where on the lap of the guy and she went out and turned off the lights and the guy was screaming but no one could uh could hear him uhm no one no one heard the guy no because they were living in like this house in the country oh countryside yeah where the houses are far away from each other oh what do you think of it uh it 's kinda morbid and i i hate i have a very active imagination so it 's kinda uh bloody oh yeah me too that 's supposed to be and then the head was supposed to be rotting and everything oh yeah since it has been days since the girl has been dead and the head could have been rotting so will the guy sue the girl for murder no 'cause she 'll uh the guy will probably die from fear of course not why not  i mean imagine yourself you 're in this room it is dark it has no lights you 're bound up and you know that there 's a head sitting on your lap well you could uh you can't you can't really move move it out of your way 'cause you 're bound up yeah i don't know i guess you will not words  uh gross even if you can't see the head you know that it 's there staring at you
Philippines	hey rissa have you heard about arlene yeah i think she 's in maryland right now what is she doing there she 's been there for a year now i guess she 's studying i 've heard that her mom asked her to study there you know just try for a sem or something what course is she taking i don't know but whatever it is i think she 's finding it very easy because she stayed there uhm maybe she 's fa she finds it a lot easier to study there  yeah i guess so and she also has a part-time job there in a grocery and she 's earning two hundred dollars a week  oh good for her  wow maybe she 's spending it on dresses shoes what else magazines uhm number one yeah she 's probably been shopping for weeks weeks hours days the whole day yeah she 's probably having the time of her life well but i wonder when will she be going to visit us maybe a year from now two years i don't know  is she going to come back  yeah  maybe i mean almost all come back here to visit but it 's been too long already what if when we meet each other we don't have anything to talk about well do we have plans for reunion at least for our batch i don't think so because remember jane she 's in japan right now yup and she 's the only one who finds it easy challenging to contact all of us amusing yeah amusing to have her in the reunion yeah without her there 's no reunion as if jane equals reunion chuckle  well she sent me a postcard when i think it was yesterday or the day before and what did she tell you well she 's just asking me to write to her 'cause it seems that all her friends in japan are leaving leaving for i don't know maybe her fellow uh scholar-students scholarships-granted students i think i think she 's staying there for a while for this summer uh i remember her telling me sometime ago that she 's she 's she is going to return here in the philippines next year uh yeah i remember i think they have plans of attending the graduation of their friends  yup  yeah yeah their friends so i thought she 's gonna graduate not yet no i think she 's behind one sem yeah remember she stopped for a year yeah when she was supposed to go to america but so so sad that that plan didn't materialize i mean she waited for a year and then nothing happened so who 's gonna graduate next year in our batch jean yeah you me jean ows yeah she 's going to to graduate because although she shifted most of most of her subjects she took before that was general general subjects is she gonna graduate on time yeah and rachel she 's supposed to have ano five years in college but she she she took summer classes i think   yeah that 's why i think good for her yeah good for her and annabel remember that ann they were annabel is not gonna graduate next year yeah not yet probably one term after i think a year a year after   yeah  how about katherine i think she 's going to graduate too uhm 'cause she 's always having these summer classes although she has some failed subjects who 's gonna graduate with honors oh that 's one thing i don't know i think raquel is running for honors   oh yeah she 's consistent dean dean 's lister break in the recording  hey wait i remember something raquel and i had a plan if ever the spice girls are going to come here for a concert we 're going to go there would you like to come with us no i don't think so i 'm not a fan an avid fan of the spice girls but why the spice girls are so great they 're so good well uh i just i just i just don't find their music 1 word  oh come on i mean stop or how about too much wannabe  i mean these songs are soooo yeah it 's a hit but i don't find i don't really like it the spice girls are so great maybe if celine dion would come here and have a concert maybe i 'll watch that concert celine dion yeah i mean have you heard the song tell him  with barbra streisand yeah yeah quite nice don't you think yeah it 's nice but i 'm still for the spice girls  uhm   especially with gerri the spice girls' ex 1 word  no they 're not chuckle  come on with voice like that yeah didn't you hear the news it 's just news they were just joking when they made that statement i don't think so come on they were too poor to have a surgery even before before the time that they got rich  uhm i just hope that they are going to come here and have a concert have you heard they met with prince charles speaker a chuckles  yeah i 've heard that they met prince charles and you and gerri you know gerri she 's my favorite spice girl she pinched the one who looked like a boy no she does not she doesn't look like a boy well she does   she she was the one who pinched prince charles' bottom really yeah go gerri laughter  well that 's one point for her yeah well i wish they are here already raquel said that maybe they 're going to go here at the last quarter of the year to have a concert yeah but it 's just rumors   i don't think so we can't afford them oh i am going to afford them we are planning to watch the concert from the front row that 's more than one thousand bucks yeah so it 's worth it so yeah we 're going to sing along with them okay it 's nice yeah uh if ever san miguel will be will be in for the championship are you willing to accompany me to watch the game well if you pay my ticket why not hey that 's one hundred fifty pesos well i guess why not since you have i want to watch it in the front row maybe at the back of their bench yeah so you can i don't know what do you want  who are you rooting there for uh ron jacobs oh allan caidic but not nelson asaytono not the bull no way how about ildefonso  tan tanquinsen oh yeah i remember him tanquinsen is good-looking he 's from u s t by the way oh u s t i think uh he 's among the batch of bal david and cantojos  what  oh really yup well hey how about the line-up of la salle how is it going i don't know i have no idea well i remember that uh we still have aldeguer and cali yeah cali ofrecio uh yeah yeah he is the reason why so many students from other schools are rooting for la salle do you know that really yeah why is he good looking yeah he is annabel remember annabel from u p annabel dizon yeah yup when we have a game against u p she is going to cheer for la salle oh yeah well she 's loyal to u p laughter  she 's very loyal yeah well i guess until ofrecio is still there she 's going to   have you heard  what annabel and wheng had a little misunderstanding no what happened uhm i don't really know the bit by bit fact about the story just  annabel told me that she was kind of she was kind of off what uh sh she 's kind of she 's kind of   wait wait uhm what wait wait wait i can't get you  she and louella had a fight because of  oh she was annoyed yeah at louella yup why i don't really know because annabel just told me that she 's very annoyed with wheng and wheng told me that annabel 's reaction of telling other people like me rachel oh i remember that story uh she 's kind of childish she told me isn't that about when annabel came to louella 's class and she wanted to sit in but then louella told her to get out or something but louella meant it as a joke but then annabel took it seriously yeah i know that story  yeah  uh we met at the library and i was kind of shocked i was studying and then annabel just told me that she was very annoyed with wheng the way she reacted to her annabel told me that she wasn't there for her but she was at least she was trying to see a classmate for a second just gonna ask something but then just wheng told her to get out it was like there really is no love lost between the two of them but you know what when i talked to louella she didn't know that annabel was amanda 's friend yeah she had no idea until until i think until rachel told her i think i told her oh yeah because so you 're the one well well it was out of my mouth i mean i can't do anything to take it back so she asked me you know how persistent she can be i think sometimes wheng is out of line you know i mean yeah well she has some problems right now what problems i think she has so many things to do she 's so busy so pressured then she ran she ran for the student council yeah and she had so many jobs right and she felt that no one is supporting her  maybe she doesn't need support from but then i mean we 're in college now come on i mean you could get old as a hundred and one but you still need friends yeah i i don't mean it you don't need friends what i mean is that you can't always count on your friends because they have some some uh some things they are some they have someone else they have other things to do   other things to do but still they have other friends too yeah but still louella needs a friend you know you know she 's uh often a sensitive person  i think sh  well she does not have a

the computer yeah then on the day that cathy is supposed to go marites went to cathy 's house and used the computer okay then cathy left the house since mar is going out is going to type a document but louella was supposed to program something and she doesn't know anything about it okay that 's why cathy was able to let marites use the computer so 'cause she can beep her anytime yeah and when she returned cathy to her house she and marites went bar-hopping or something then when louella heard it i think she got annoyed well i think louella should understand it it 's not it 's not for cathy to entrust her with ano  yeah so many misunderstandings with louella laughter  will louella ever learn to understand oh no maybe she 's just have some issues i think she 's trying she 's trying to change but it 's not enough sometimes it 's hard to get word to understand her that 's right but still we have to give her leeway yeah  well remember when she went there with here oh   yeah i i find

Philippines	what 's up nothing much busy with school how about you uhm quite busy too and with the finals coming it 's really been toxic   yeah really toxic man anyway have you talked to bea have you seen her lately bea three four weeks ago and but you know that she has a new guy right the new guy yeah she made mention of one i think his name is julio i can't even remember oh yeah laughter  the new guy with the long hair laughter  long hair white yeah white yeah do you find him cute do you find him cute okay i haven't really seen him but i think they 're really bagay what do you think uhm i 'm not really sure pa but break in the recording  anyway i had a bad thought i was at bea 's house last night she in she invited me over to uh she uh she invited me to have dinner over at her house 'cause it was her lola 's birthday she even made me sing in front of her family why didn't she invite me uhm because she realized sure that you can't make it chuckle  but anyway anyway and then what happened  ay sorry it 's okay it 's okay what happened but anyway uh she she made kwento about julio so they 've been dating for three months you know that uhm i uh well what i heard was she has a crush on him but not but you didn't know that ton uh sorry julio like her dude no no no really anyway so they 've been going out they 've been dating for three months and like they know that they like each other uhm they confessed to each other already but the thing is uhm bea i think she 's fou found out last night that i think she asked julio if he was like okay he was if he was just fine with their relationship with what 's going on with them right now 'cause they 're like they 're you can't say that they 're just friends 'cause they 're already committed with each other  really  yeah they 're really close and like but you can't say that they 're lovers 'cause you know it 's so sad tony is not uh sorry julio why do i keep mentioning that guy 's name i 'll forget him anyway julio is not yet ready to commit what 's even more sad about it is that bea yeah bea is ready i mean julio is her her first guy i mean she hasn't had any boyfriend yeah she haven't had any boyfriend well julio is not actually her boyfriend but yeah the one she 's willing to commit with  ye yeah and it 's so you know it 's so sad 'cause finally she 's done with her you know playing whatever she calls it games whatever with guys but and now she 's finally ready to have a commitment with a guy and and word  yeah but i 'm sure even though i don't know julio that much i 'm quite sure that he really likes bea a lot maybe he 's just yeah scared so you think that 's what 's stopping him that 's it i mean he is just scared i mean not   well act  what what do you have to say i don't know 'cause if you just if you say that he 's just scared don't you think it 's a bit what lame such a lame excuse to say that uh the guy is just afraid of committing or not yet ready i mean if you love someone you have to be willing to risk it you know what you 're right if i don't know i just can't seem to blame this guy i heard that he had a very bad break-up with his you know former girlfriend and like i think he left for states and uhm so he made paalam to the girl and then the girl you know his former girlfriend his ex yeah his ex uhm told him that it 's okay uh i 'll wait for you 'cause i really love you ganyan ganyan and all that stuff   words  and like so the guy was like okay 'cause he was really in love with that girl and when he came back from from states he found out that just a few months after he left the girl had a new guy huh so okay sad for him yeah it 's so sad sad for him oh yeah so there you know so you think that 's his excuse actually i haven't really talked to this guy so i 'm just assuming that it 's that 's his reason but you know it 's just so why do i keep on saying it 's sad well it is sad but i don't know i mean i 've met guys who like had bad break-ups and all   yeah  but i mean to say that you 're afraid because of your past that you might do something wrong that whatever  well anyway   that 's not how love goes yeah that 's how i think well we don't know their reasons so would let me just ask you what do you think about their relationship right now like they go out they date uhm they 're more than friends they 're you know parang m u = mutual understanding  fun it 's actually more than that more than just m u  well for me i think that i mean even if like she 's saying that she 's okay with that or they 're fine with that set-up i don't think that it is it 's enough i mean you if you really care for a person you have to what be willing   yeah  to risk yeah to take the risk i mean even if you 're afraid i mean anything for love right that 's true well to some extent laughter  to some extent that 's true yeah to some extent 'cause you know but still you have to know your levels  but still i mean what 's what 's to be afraid  yeah  it sounds weird you know what maybe you should talk to bea give her a call or something well yeah maybe i can do that but she 's like she 's so e you could see it in her eyes that she 's so happy my gosh she talks about him every now and then every you know siya na 'yung buka ng bibig di ba laughter break in the recording  speaking of buka ng bibig have you heard from renee lately i was with her di ba  we were in we were at the party but she didn't we didn't talk laughter  have you heard of what happened to her i mean the crying scene and all yeah i did but i don't know the whole story uh so you don't know about mike  both of them  i mean the story of renee and mike you know no no uh okay mike was with a girl that night yeah i saw them i i know that mike liked that girl back in high school   yeah that 's what i know but the thing is you know i mean renee had a crush on him since what since i don't know i think a month ago a month or two ago well anyway and then like one time kasi we talked right and then like she tells me that she 's already in love with the guy   what  i mean okay so you you you know him a month for a month how long have you been talking and then you love the person don't you think it 's a bit weird uhm i think she 's blinded speaker a laughs by the thought that being in love is good i mean it 's a good feeling so initially she ini she 's in love with the thought of love being of finding someone to love maybe you know well anyway what 's funny about this is that she word at a guy who doesn't really like her okay   ahhh  yeah i know it 's sad but it 's not a funny thing actually i 'm sorry it 's okay so so anyway what 's funny is last saturday the guy was there and the guy mike was there and i think he was with this girl sarah sarah yeah sarah whom he he liked ever since  yes yeah so anyway when renee saw this she 's like oh my god laughter  she was embarrassed yeah she was she was and then i don't know i mean her crush on him was a secret right and then what she cried in front of the people who she 's not really close to at the party yeah she did she did how come i didn't see her cry i mean i don't know where you were with whoever i mean you know laughter  that 's correct laughter  anyway anyway and then speaker b says something but unclear laughter  she cried because what because she was i i don't know i haven't really talked to her but ano just the thought of her crying uhm made me laugh okay so wait i don't get it she cried to whom to mike 's friends yeah to mike 's friends i mean she wasn't really close to that that 's what 's funny about it it was a secret and then she cried she told them about it   oh my god  so i mean what will happen of course mike what he might learn about it   mike will eventually know about this   yeah  that chuckle  isn't that embarrassing i mean yeah you really have to talk to her i mean i 've been talking to her ever since and and i can just imagine right speaker a chuckles  you know sometimes she gets so i don't know emotional  exagge yeah  she exaggerates her emotion and then   emotional   yes she does she does she does do that break in the recording  wait lang ha  i think i have to go na  oh

mean i have class and you know what what i think this girl word  well yeah i still do i mean even if i mean we don't talk like what we did before laughter 
Philippines	what would you want to talk about music music what particular music do you want to talk about folk music let 's see where could we start how about the most recent what would be the most recent music that you have listened to reggae music reggae what in particular what would which one  well   which artist well tropical depression   tropical depression papa dom and his group maris yes why papa dom and his group i 've met him he 's this huge character that you see on campus at u p sometimes well where are you going c r = comfort room, i.e. restroom  why do you have to go to the c r there 's just the two of us here just talking about music what about tropical depression  well you know you know me i 'm fond of listening to original filipino music and i i i i i find the music of papa dom an interesting one have they come up with a recent album uhm not yet not yet not yet tropical depression  then you also listen to groups like coco jam  yes would you like to listen to coco jam  no not now i would not want to listen to coco jam right now  words laughter  oh really maybe you 'd like to sing one of their uh english songs for us english song unfortunately i do not know any english song of coco jam  oh i see then tropical depression coco jam  what else what other what other music john denver john denver folk songs folk songs this time armageddon the movie yes starts singing john denver song laughter  were you able to watch that movie  oo  isn't that kind of old an old song speaker b laughs  who revived that song who revived that song this girl what 's her name i do not know the name of the girl the skinny girl who shows herself on m t v uh what else what other folk song do you listen to jim croce jim croce speaker b starts playing the guitar  what particular song is that time in a bottle  very good time in a bottle  speaking of time how can we how can we control time how can we how can we control time how can we maximize time how can we maximize time uhm there 's this concept called minimalism have you heard of that no this concept that deals with uhm trying to do the most number of things in the least amount of time in order to do more with the time that you have and what 's the barometer by whi by which you can say that that you were able to use that time uh it 's really relative it depends on the person so it adjusts to the person   it depends on the objectives yeah the objectives the person whatever so it may appear that you are doing nothing but   but you 're doing something yeah that 's the irony of time  right the irony of time   what are you talking about  how to maximize time uh i see i already mentioned this idea called minimalism  may i know is there something that you 'd like to share what about the group about the topic about time about time then uhm time is precious so you have you have to make the most out of it how do you make the most out of it in your case my case uh being a mom being a mom of course i 've got a lot of things to do uh at home alone uh you know taking care of all the kids i just i i i 'm just wondering how can i uhm how can i budget i mean how can i put everything in a day all the day i mean all the work all the load of work in a day yeah that 's a problem of most people word   of being a teacher at the same time being a mother how about you uh joel how do you how do you handle time i want to say i want to say my stuff through a song through a song another song about time ha speaker b starts playing the guitar again is that about time yes it 's time in a bottle   time in a bottle laughter okay okay so that 's it that 's how you yes speaker a chuckles  c 'mon that 's over simplistic you like another one another one no no i think i think i 've had enough of uh time in a bottle  what else uhm what time is it by the way i 've got to go time is uh it 's five twenty-five do you have to go we have to uhm yes because i need to maximize my time as you were saying a while ago speaker a laughs  we need to talk for thirty minutes and if we need to do that we must make good use of the time given us then so ma'am how many more minutes do we have around uhm fifteen  yes yes yes   we still have fifteen minutes so let 's talk about minutes about minutes laughter another song  you know that song twenty-five minutes  no i haven't heard of that laughter who sang that i do not know you do not know but then it 's a nice song it 's about a man who decided to court the girl when he found out that he loves the girl unfortunately the time is no longer no have you ever thought that those people who who say that they are very busy are the would you say they 're more successful in in what they do in what they do right i don't think so those who are busy uh uhm you can be successful by doing nothing you see people who just call on the phone and watch their stocks and do nothing   just killing their time but at the same time earning money   i suggest that yeah we should put a parameter on how are we going to define success so this time perhaps that 's approp   time and success 'yan  time and success   time and success it 's very dangerous i don't want to talk about that  time and success  but do you want to talk about it go ahead   success what 's success by the way success is getting what you want when you want it getting what you want when you want it that 's it that 's it that 's it how about if you were not able to get it and your objective is not to get it it 's a problem then you 're not successful i suppose you 're successful you were not able to get what you want and what you want   that 's putting aside morality ha because you can be successful in bad things that 's a logical fantasy speaker c laughs that thing you brought up see what come again come again you can be successful in bad things in doing bad things like if you 're a robber then and then you try robbing a bank then you 're successful if you happen to do that but would you say that is success like i said it 's a negative argument   to the good one to the good ones of course that 's another big problem don't don't bring that in that 's morality morality more more delicate topic to talk about than time chuckle  let 's get rid of time because death it 's a deep concept let 's try something else death you want to   how  death you want to talk about death why death because it 's the end of time it 's the end of time so we 're still back in time death it 's not it may be the end of time but it may be a beginning of something else  no particular  actually time will continue time will continue whe whether we are here or not but to for a particular person time will end yes that 's true but i don't want to talk about death why it 's one of those things that you 're talking to it right now  laughter yes you could actually say that but let 's change the topic okay let 's get rid of that altogether why don't we just talk about the kids here the kids let 's talk about the kids here if you were to leave this place which kids would you miss   the school the school you mean the school yes which kids would you miss uhm no definite theoretically speaking  the good ones or the bad ones oh it doesn't matter who would you miss again who would you miss sir joel grade six students grade six students why well as far as i 'm concerned they are the ones who the first time that i taught in this school they are the ones whom i deal with that 's why i believe i 'd like to think about how how uh preschoolers though i 'm not teaching preschoolers now i 'd like to think about how preschoolers would appreciate your teaching them if i 'm to compare it with high school students i don't think that i would be able to handle preschoolers   well because because because preschoolers are very showy  it 's just it 's just like they would hug you be with you kiss you   comparing the game of benjie paras from from that of of who 's benjie paras johnny abarrientos yes yes playing playing different positions yes they 're playing different positions you cannot say that johnny abarrientos is a good player but if you put him in the center position he 'll play the same game  hey are we still talking about time   no we 're now talking about basketball  now we 're discussing basketball basketball basketball is life life is basketball we play the balls the ref in in the school the referees are the teachers the students are the ones who make their their careers they are the ones who are making their playing time so maybe we could go back again to the students yes yes to the students we 're deviating from the topic we can as as referees we can also throw the students out of the playing court which is their room and we set rules we set everything to to put everything in proper perspective so teaching is basketball teaching is basketball the points the points we grade are the statistics yes statistics those students who raise their hands get the high grades they get the chance to shoot the ball yeah and the ball   and it 's their own game and they don't blame anybody it 's their own game they 're playing   unfortunate unfortunately the parents will will blame the teachers blame them upon knowing that they had paid the tuition fees and and suddenly they were the students must go to another school that 's their right that 's their right to criticize and it 's our right to to yes to remove their children especially when they are   those those are the narrow-minded parents and they put the blame so the referee the referee going back to basketball the referee will will give technical technical penalty for tim cone so tim cone gets out of the playing court just so tim cone would be representing the parents 2 words or the parents or the students uh okay and we teachers if we 're to compare it to basketball then it 's going to be limited also like it 's only basketball here in metro manila m b a is that what if what if what if the students uh sooner or later would decide to go abroad o   that 's the olympics the olympics the olympics   you can't compare it to basketball the olympics laughter  it 's the olympics it 's a different game it 's a bigger game  now now now i would like you to listen very care  that 's exactly what we 're doing  as teachers we 're preparing them for a bigger world   carefully about this   a bigger game  yes now teachers are like basketball players once this time it 's us not the students anymore   yes yes  once once the the owner of the school no long she she 's not not the teacher 's no longer competent suddenly it can put me kick them out can we get can we get rid of the basketball it 's getting old try something else let 's go back to the kids i was asking a while ago which kids would you miss if in case you left here  okay okay the kids who play good basketball   i told you i told you i told you for me it 's the preschoolers for you it 's the grade six mr caibal mr marvin caibal he plays basketball very well that 's why i believe even if i i i gave him seventy-three in his card still he shoots the ball we 're mentioning grades and kids now here i hope this does not incrimin incriminate us with or i hope this thing is not used against us

chuckles  her professor okay  you wanna know a secret laughter  let 's talk about abby this time laughter  this is anything and everything under the sun right do you think she 's had sex with her boyfriend how many in a day laughter  no i think she 's still a virgin you know that baby she just adopted it laughter  can't she get into the conversation with us it 's much more fun no  uh yeah she 's gonna die transcribing everything we 'll we 're gonna have to make sure our voices differ otherwise who 's that laughter  uh okay okay you what have you ever been caught kissing oh my god you know for the longest time i wasn't admitting that i had a boyfriend because i was with this guy uhm starting thirteen no when i was thirteen like that but of course that that time it was just m u m u we call it m u = mutual understanding  do we have chuckle  so when i was finally sixteen i go okay this is the time so i said yes but i was denying it totally to my friends my family like that and then one night we were staying in my dad 's office right we we we came from a party and then we were in the elevator he wanted to say good night kiss good night and then i go okay inside the elevator at that time and then when i walked out he had to grab me and kiss me again and then and then so i i faced right the the hallway and then as the elevator doors closed behind me my sister was there oh no and she didn't even know i was going out with him and you know what i said i go pooot makes sound expelling air from the lips laughter  and then that night i told my parents dad what if i answered angelo already you know what he said say you 're just kidding oh in truth i was already going out with him seven months  how about you gina  i got caught words laughter  by no in the car laughter speaker c says something but unclear  by yeah the police laughter  are you serious we had to pay the police one thousand pesos laughter  really oh you know that happened to my friend the police actually got the undies to make sure that they 're gonna pay speaker b laughs  you know the dark spot in festival mall i know in the golf range in festival mall there 's a golf range in festival uhm

door  you didn't even lock  yeah  we locked it e siyempre and then we opened the door and then he goes is she a prostitute no oh my god and then wala siyempre we had to pay what 's the what 's the violation laughter  indecent act laughter  oh no yes i did now i know someone who actually did get caught laughter  no it 's so true no my friend is worst the so the couldn't they get a motel they sleep did you i think can hear you quite well word  have you ever gone to a motel why are you asking me neeyaah i want i want to know you no but i want to you no just for exposure you i have you have i have i haven't  ako i have is it nice it 's ugly dirty all even  no i 've been to the really really nice ones no i go to hotels e speaker a laughs the really nice hotels no i wonder if it because is it not degrading honey let 's go to the motel huh don't i look like a hotel beauty   yeah that 's why i go to the hotel i think the problem is because like motels in in the states they are just motorists yeah they 're i mean they 're places where you actually go to any time not embarrassing to go but in our society you know motels have have developed into something so one you know few hours like we have big billboards   short time  true three hours yeah and it just makes it cheaper kasi i mean a lot of married people go to motels because there 's no privacy at home  right  'cause they have all their relatives living there   and it 's spice  and so they have to go spice yeah we have co- we have a co-teacher yeah as as   married who goes there when you said spice i remember woops laughter i remem at least they 're married i remember when you said spice and i was talking about it a while ago that my my friends who are still with their boyfriends laughter  brokenhearted laughter  no no you have to be a little dirty if you want spice yeah my tito told me if you want to your marriage to last you have to be the prostitute yeah uh that wasn't even my word i said you have to be the whore of your the mistress the mistress and the wife yeah i don't exactly agree no it 's not that i agree i mean i guess it depends on the guys also but it 's if you think prosti i mean it 's so disgusting i mean this person will just look at you as an object and he won't look at you as a person no treat him the same way honey laughter  yeah if it 's fine with you right laughter i 'm just the wife laughter  right now i 'm the mistress laughter  no no no i 'm the nobody 's  the wife gets left speaker a laughs  yeah for mistresses okay i 'm the mistress speaker a laughs  you wanna go into boys chuckle uh the filipino male psyche chuckle  i know right the male chauvinist pig y'know it 's true you you can't live with them can't live without them no but i think you know for filipino males uh particularly i think they behave so much worst because we allow it uh-uhm you know filipinas allow so much from their boyfriends and husbands and they forgive them every time that 's why we make great wives  you know  heehh we make martyr wives but chuckle like my friend said  what   there 's no mart what 's that a stupid martyr doesn't get like crowned or something like that yeah yeah yeah do you think abby is a martyr no to her boyfriend now yeah i think he 's really nice really she 's nice chuckle  let 's not let 's not tell her but you know what laughter  who 's under abby or her boyfriend uh in what sense laughter  who 's stronger who 's under chuckle  no i mean whose personality is stronger you 're under he 's under laughter  in bed he 's under laughter  okay what do you believe in should the girl be stronger than the guy or the guy should have a stronger personality   i think should be equal equal yeah because we don't wanna be dominated as much as they don't wanna be dominated i guess if you see eye to eye that 's better and there 's respect  what you 're  word he knows really yeah you won't find guys who who like equality  you don't like equality  hardly i don't know okay yeah i was telling my friend because some of my friends when they fight you know they they really fight as in physically i go you know what if in day one you made it clear that you cannot pinch me you cannot even you know wh what 's this speaker thinks of a word that would describe an action oh my god do this to me  what do you call it   e there 's no english word for pitik  flick okay he he he   you know  you don't speaker c chuckles you don't speaker c chuckles as long as you don't touch even the ends of my nails i don't think they will but if you let them yes they will so i was telling i forgot who uh i was telling another friend i go you know remember angelo my first boyfriend he was like the school bully but never in our entire cough relationship and that lasted ten years that he even you know pulled one strand of my hair and to think he had a really very bad temper really yeah because i told him from day one you may shout at me or whatever but you can never touch me i 'll kill you laughter  and i think it di it it also depends on how you deal with the fight if you start shouting and cursing i guess of course they 'll retaliate but have you ever seen anyone who 's you know cursing and all that while the other girl 's super quiet no i haven't  chuckle no you 've started eh  i mean it 's e in our society it 's like really strong that guys do not hit girls 'cause the moment you hit a girl you 're you 're you 're 1 word   no it 's marked it 's accepted here in the philippines no in married people married people accept it not really it 's not accepted as well uhm not like womanizing is more accepted here than beatings but if you 're the wife people would tell you uhm to  yeah  leave the guy if you 're the wife would you leave your husband if he hits you once   of course  once just once  yes   once is fine no once is you know outburst  no  i don't even hit people when i 'm angry i know of course so you would once you get slapped it was really big fight just once  just once   no way  just once i think once is not sound   i don't think so you don't leave your family for that i 'll leave my husband i 'll take the kids
Philippines	okay hi riza hello uhm allen laughter  uh okay you 're you 're from the area or as i was saying uhm you hail from the province or what uh uhm i live at ba-y around forty-five minutes away from here what 's what what is ba-y known for ba-y is known for laughter uhm honestly our uh town is not that uh in progress right now really we 're only known for uh some  let me guess right for the bread laughter   uhm  and if you go farther south laguna it 's uh the cheese okay so every time i go down laguna i pass by uh it is in santa cruz   santa cruz yes uh uhm where you buy this white cheese then uh i pass by your town to buy   we are known for the the the bread   the bread known as what do you call this   monay ba-y  yeah yeah that 's it laughter   okay okay it 's good it 's actually sweet and uh the the old people at the office like it  uh uhm  okay and aside from it we also have the production company of food uhm that is dunkin donuts what they produce donuts there yes they produce dunkin donuts and so that 's where they cook all the donuts uh around metro manila uhm no only here in uh laguna uh okay uh uhm they uh produce all those dunkin donuts uhm only here sa only here in laguna for different stores that they have i see so you go home every day and the traffic in los ba&ntilde;os i think is really very bad uh  yeah i go home  uhm during six p m in the afternoon okay like that and   by the way uh you studied in uhm metro manila or in uhm i studied at f e u far eastern university   okay  in recto in manila do you so you you you what do you board boarded there or what  yeah  uhm i used to live in a dormitory when i was in college  okay  i see well when i was in college i lived with my parents and uh by the way i i took up uh engineering industrial engineering  where  at uh la salle one of those uh la salle  laughter why you have uh a notion for la sallites or what   uhm well-off uh students laughter   you 're known for that laughter   well not really uh it 's not   and i i remember when we 're fighting for the u a a p laughter   uh uhm   well uh my time was n c a a so n c a a laughter  so you probably could guess how old i am laughter  uhm so during my time laughter  okay uhm u a a p so when we 're cheering for f e u the la sallites would just simply tell us that our tuition fees are your allowances laughter   uh-huh  oh come on i don't think that 's the case probably 'cause in i in engineering uh where i belong uh really most of our classmates came from the deep provinces  uh uhm  uh uhm you know but sometimes meaning well-off probably they have some a few cattle and  hacienda laughter  no no no not a hacienda probably a small piece of land the usual uh townspeople with you know a few square meters of land that they they till  okay   and it 's always a joke during uhm semester payments that oh my father has has to sell you know a cow in order to you know that 's the normal joke among those people from batangas a beeping sound especially with the oops that 's my cellphone  uh uhm   uh uhm  excuse me uhm are cellphones uh a fad here still a fad or what yeah it is laughter and most of the teenagers uh have them really it 's when you when you ride a jeepney when you look at the right side or the left side they use to laughter hold this a little gadget and sometimes they smile sometimes is it still   they are shocked is it still a fad or is it a it 's becoming a social status or or a necessity uhm i don't think it 's a necessity for youth for the youth yeah well actually it could be a monitoring device of the parents speaker b laughs that 's one reason why why these people have it some but they can off the cell yes but of course they must have a very good reason why they switch it off  oth otherwise it should be kept open and uh it should be always on waiting for messages or calls there are so many alibis of the youth laughter when it comes to gimmicks so i don't think the parents can use that for a monitoring device   do you do you go on gimmicks i mean here in this area me  uhm   so what 's the new place here or what there are several uh places that you can  jers  have you been to jers no laughter  so what 's the i don't go out at night  okay   i usually go home after work but uh laughter sometimes so strict ha you 're laughter  sometimes i go sa uh i go to the place of my friend and just in their house but eating talking uh so you 're more of a friendly uh type and it 's not the outgoing   the outgoing type go in the crowd uh y'know those sosy type they call it  laughter kinda are there are there places here that people hang around i mean here in calamba there are several malls in here we have the walter mart uh okay we have robinson in los ba&ntilde;os we have olivarez   yeah but these are the mall mall types but i mean in the evening  you mean  are there places where the young people can socialize or maybe that 's why they call them sosyal 'no 'cause they socialize at night laughter   in the evening   uhm  uhm there is one place i heard of uh near or beside chowking here in calamba oh i think that 's jers that 's jers okay  i don't know the name   yeah but uh it 's kinda expensive you pay an entrance of i think two hundred  uh uhm  two hun two hundred but it 's i think consumable but still uhm i haven't been to the place uh we dropped by but uh when we learned that there was a two hundred cover charge we backed off and settled for well i not really cheaper place but somewhere uh a place that you know you you don't have to pay cover charge anyway you live at well actually i live in makati in makati yes uh   and you u you used to go here in calamba   no i i work here i work in canlubang so most of my officemates uh it 's part of my job 'no i 'm i 'm with h r  okay  h r it 's my or one of my responsibilities to look around uh where are the places that people can go so where are the peo uh where are the places where people should not go okay so so you 're really interested in people well uh as part of my job i uh i have to have interest it 's not uh a requirement that i follow it 's more of that uh i enjoy uh not really meddling into people 's lives but i i would like them to uhm watchacall this uh to do what they like to do okay 'cause some people they like to do something but uh it 's very hard for them to do it 'cause uh they don't know how to do it uh uhm so what do you find uhm interesting or uh what is the best thing in uh people management well uh it 's a very nice question uh the best thing i would say uh well they have different problems yeah they have different priorities uh there are different ways to make them smile you know like like texting you know some oh some people laugh at these types of joke okay you know you don't know you don't see why the why it 's funny or what okay so you find it uhm uh interesting to know the uniqueness of a human being laughter   wow really ha  it might get developed ha laughter  well to in a sense it 's uh   the individuality yes 'cause each person has his own idiosyncrasies and uh each person has uh well you say the likes and dislikes yeah it 's very basic 'no but uhm what i 've learned through my years of being in h r is that there are ways to cough excuse me to get to people uhm there there there are different ways each person has a different approach   okay  so can you cite some ways that you have learned before some ways well there 's some people that uh you ask about their family and you know yes suddenly they they 'll open up something about work or about a suggestion uh i believe in bonding bonding yeah you have to bond with people and uh well like like for example now you know there 's a certain level of bonding that uh we 're doing really laughter   laughter it doesn't mean anything but uh i 'm not a a psychologist actually i you graduated as i graduated as industrial engineering okay sorry i forgot   but my industrial management engineering it 's a management engineering type and uh well we have subjects about uh human behavior and uh  i see  sociology perhaps well all those -ologies and everything speaker b laughs but uh the most important in the one i remember was on human behavior human behavior 'cause uh basic human behavior is like uh hand gestures the hand gestures and the the the eye contacts and everything   eye contacts  like you you have very good eye contact speaker b laughs  sometimes you you know i i get bothered when people have very direct eye contact why uh i don't know maybe something 's wrong with my face or something 's laughter  oh but do you find it uhm sincere and honest when people look at you straight in the eyes laughter  yeah but uh i like it the other way around that i i look uh look at your nose look at your laughter  i like it the other way around that you know i i 'm the one looking at the person but how can the person respond naka uh if uh well i don't know it it 's different uh sometimes uh people are more comfortable not looking there 's some people that are more comfortable looking but i learned from a friend that when you talk to someone it is ethical to look at their eyes direct uh well of course yes to show your sincerity it 's very basic but sometimes staring speaker b laughs too much uh you know you 'd glan there 's what you call glance a stare and uh i don't know but but most of the people i talk to uh i look at their eyes but of course to show some respect sometimes i i glance away it 's actually a sign of respect glancing away a sign of respect yes okay it 's not a sign of uh indifference it 's more of a sign of respect like especially if you look downwards if you look upwards that that 's a sign of disrespect laughter  okay anyway so what what do you do on sundays i mean if you 're not working or what  on sundays  uhm i usually go out and uhm attend the sunday sunday service okay in our local church in los ba&ntilde;os and i handle ushering committee what what 's the ushering committee uh we are the one who welcomes all those people that uh go to the church every sunday okay there are uh several uh responsibilities

here laughter  yeah but uh filipinos filipinos  okay   and they have they really have different ways of uh expressing their religious beliefs and of course uhm i really am not uh against or for these groups but what 's important is to me uhm for when a person chooses his re his or her religion is if he or she uhm uh watchacall it uhm uhm  believing sometimes   wholeheartedly  yes he must he or she must be wholeheartedly uhm active in in that work   in that belief  yeah in that belief
Philippines	yeah but there was a script what script remember the time when i had to record something for equitable p c i bank there was a script it was not equitable p c i bank at that time no it wasn't no it was called equitable banking corporation oh is that right what ever did you do with that recording i never heard about it again  i didn't hear anything about it and you know they didn't like it no i think i don't think it 's because they didn't like it they were they were a little shy to they were a little embarrassed to ask you to come back 'cause there were things that they would like to to do again like uhm maybe put more pauses or something like that just put more pauses or maybe put some more or maybe to try another way to record your voice because they used another they were thinking of doing something else for putting the the voice recording into a digital format all right actually that that project is not was never used it hasn't been used 'cause when it was done the bank had to merge with p c i already so we just cough tried it on we just tried the program with maybe one class and they had to pick out certain uh items like the history of the bank was not taken up i don't remember exactly 'cause at the time when they wanted to reprogram or re- uh uh how do you call this remake or do the recording again i was already on training so they looked for somebody else to record the the voice part so and because there was already a merging of the new bank you know of the two banks they had to re-design the program now we have a new training program for that the new orientation but they have taken out the history and the functional you know descriptions i 'm sorry the descriptions of the functional the functions of the the organizations but it was still going to be used for orientation right so they decided to make a new program for orientation and then   yes   there 's still an orientation actually it 's been running some of the modules are are used like ah like the parts for customer service parts about values orientation uh and the security but about the the bank 's organization its itself it is not it was not done on any electronic medium they just asked somebody you know from the human resources division to des describe or to talk about the organization and the history because right now everything is in transition so we still don't know how to how to put it in anything permanent like an or something electronic because it would be difficult for us to edit or re-edit or to call the artists again because nothing is final yet it 's still in transition a lot of the uh units of the bank are still integrated especially the branches so anything about its history except for the fact that it 's already on the fiftieth year e most of the things are still you know are still they 're not floating but it 's still moving and it 's still and it 's still how do you call this it 's still going through changes so a lot of the personnel are still being moved around there 's still re-deployment we are taking in new officers we are taking in new you know new employees at the at the lowest level actually we 're open for hiring but then all the more you need like a program for orienting   this is a nice sofa  what all the more you need uh like a program to orient these people that you 're taking in for example to take uh for the new officers of p c i bank to be integrated to the new bank equitable tradition or whatever that is so all the more you need that program to orient them as to how equitable started and who the uh who are heading up the different divisions that 's what i remember from the recording that we did a long time ago  it oh but in terms of how to integrate the organization itself the bank saw it more fitting or how do you call this it seems to be more appro appropriate to explain what the bank stands for to explain what are the values work values what the logo stands for what are why do we have these five elements why do we what are we espousing as an organization uh i think the bank saw it as more appropriate to explain especially to those who are not part of the former equitable banking corporation so what we do right now is just describe what the logo the colorful logo means what is how do you how can you say that the corporate values can be translated or can be uh done in in your work place or as you work so but the history itself or like what are the different organization units are as i said everything is still going through changes there 's a lot of things that are still happening so what we are doing right now is focusing more on the on what the bank stands for the values that we espouse the vision of the bank basically that 's it aren't you getting bored with this conversation aren't we supposed to talk about something else something nicer something how do you call it more interesting no no 'cause i was thinking about how proud i was to be the voice talent of equitable p c i bank  i know  and i was you were i remember you telling me that you 're gonna come out with commercials and stuff like that and that maybe you know if they like my voice maybe they would take my voice as the uh for the commercial that you 're gonna be coming out with and i was really looking forward to that not so much because uh first time i was ever gonna be a voice talent there 's a lot of things that 's really going on a lot before we had the integration also of the two banks we had tried i and the other you know other employees tried to we had an audition you know for the voice for the electronic banking. how come you didn't call me for that  you know like for the  i don't think it was for the no they were looking only for people within the organization and it was not under our unit  oh   it was not our project it was a project of another unit so they were jus you know they just wrote down whoever could be available or something like that didn't you try out for that yes i did like like press eight for deposit press nine for withdrawal press you know press zero or something like that so did you get the job i don't think the the plan pushed through 'cause because of the integration p c i already had that i think so you 're just gonna adapt whatever it is that they have yeah actually we are using a lot of the things that p c i had before a long time but i want to be the voice talent is there any audition coming up anytime soon for whatever   well i 'm sure they 're going to make like new videos if you like you can also uh be involved in that yeah keep me in mind i don't know it 's just that it was a lot of fun i had a great time recording that that time that that was like what three days if i 'm not mistaken uhm i had a lot of fun recording and i was really looking forward to like seeing the real thing like seeing the the you said there was going be like   the output  yeah visuals and there was going to be i don't know you told me there was gonna be a lot of things that they 're going to integrate my voice into the program and i was like really looking forward to that i wanted to see how all these things come about i 've never had any experience in video production or in program-making or whatever this was the first time i 'm not sure if the if the slide presentation was done the audiovisual material is finished or completed already i do know that because they had to re-do you know the voice-recording they asked queenie to tape to go through the recording to do the recording rather i know there 's a lot of things that i have to learn about that the pauses that you were talking about and of course my s 's i think are too pronounced even when i was singing for the choir at saint cyprian 's that was the one thing that my director would always caution me about uhm my s 's are too pronounced and i guess when you 're recording i don't think there 's anything wrong with your s 's oh is that right well did you listen to that taping again   you see   you see it 's different i have listened i have heard the the voice recording but i don't really remember exactly the details maybe i should ask kitty to look for it so that you you can hear and listen to it i 'd be too embarrassed though   i do know that we placed it in c d yeah i wanna see i i wanna see that 's what i wanna see that 's what i wanna hear especially if you integrated the visuals 'cause i wanna see how what you were gonna do with it i was very curious about that it 's very easy i can show you now how you do it  oh but but from trans transferring   no but my voice yeah transferring your voice from the magnetic tape to a digital one  that 's right  that 's right oh we have a different uh software for that then and then you integrate it with the visuals and i want to see you know i wanna hear my voice and then i wanna see what kind of visuals you come up with like see the whole thing the whole project i will ask kitty 'cause i do know that it was already finished oh is that right yes they 're already using it but you 're not gonna use it huh but it 's not your voice that was used because they had to   it 's not my voice  no they had to do the recording i 've been saying all ov since the beginning see i want to see the whole thing and my voice see i keep emphasizing my voice because i wanted like my friends my my family members my old teachers could hear it   they did not use your voice as far as i know they did not use your voice now i 'm sad i 'm sorry i know yeah 'cause becky was asking about it too and of course she 's seeing all the commercials about you know equitable p c i bank on television these days and she goes well i thought you know that you were being considered for that and i said well i thought so too but i guess they decided to go another way she said well she goes what happened to that voice uh the tape right that you did for them like a year ago or something and i said i don't really know uhm i 'm gonna have to ask about it they did not use your voice alre because there were parts you see some of the things that you said were like in full paragraphs right   that 's right we found out that although you would stop at particular points uh-huh we found out that those paragraphs took so long yes we couldn't cut them okay in the middle okay while you were talking on the recording we couldn't stop or just cut it there we found out that we had to record again i see but since again as i said a while ago i was already on training they were a little shy i think they were embarrassed to call you again for free uh since you did it for free they and you were you know somebody outside of the company they didn't want to risk that and then uh see if you were working for the bank it is understood that you might get it you know you might do it for free but then we pay you for overtime uh i see you can file for overtime but in your case you 're a you know you 're not a member of the organization you were uh you were just doing you were doi just doing this you know as a favor but my boss doesn't like those things where you know doing something for favors i wish i could have told her that it was enough for me to like to like s   see the whole production see the whole production you know that was just something that i was really interested in and that was just something that i know would be like a once in a lifetime experience it 's not my line of work i  where i am at right now i don't think i 'm ever gonna be able to do something like that again so i was like that would have been really neat at any rate i 'm sorry
Philippines	how are you i 'm fine thank you speaker a chuckles  really how are you uhm tired uh uhm because i haven't got a decent sleep last night or   uh  or should i say one we for one week how

restaurant which restaurant did you want steak  okay okay okay that 's eleven tuesday that 's my birth that 's my graduation gift ha  thank you laughter thank you so that 's eleven uh on tuesday tuesday uh is that gonna be a problem because ching has her professorial chair   oh  which reminds me that 's the twenty-second 'no  uh uhm and you 're supposed to be ching 's  no but your attendance is required   actually i don't have any role in the program   is that a   neither do i  the thing is we 're part of one and the same department  we should give her moral support   uhm   it 's good if we 're there yeah  so what do you want to do   so that 's going to be a problem  how about can we move it to thursday is that okay yeah yeah thursday but thursday there 's another lecture it 's andee 's lecture i think that that 's the twenty-fourth 'no  that 's andee 's lecture and i think you have a role i don't have a role i 'm supposed to introduce her that 's why i got the photocopy of her c v but apparently it 's dr ching who 's  uh  who  who 's uh introducing her let me see that 's on the twenty-fourth so i i guess it 's going to be the lecture 's the whole morning   no  uhm she 's on the twenty-ninth uh twenty-ninth uh okay  twenty-ninth so that 's that 's tuesday tuesday next week and the week after next 'no  that 's the yeah twenty-two is thu tuesday twenty-nine is tuesday  uhm okay see you on twenty-four eleven o' clock okay unless uh it 's a little   twenty-three i can't i can't because we have a well neither can i because we 're supposed to be together presenting the thing  laughter which reminds me are you ready with the lecture   uhm  more or less can you just remind me before we go so i can give you the or you have the do you have the copy of the final report i do yeah i do i do uh uhm i got it and it 's my my my part is going to be basically uh based on ano 'no on on that and i dr tish gave me the lent me the the c d c d of the i c e great britain component yesterday 'no  and last night i i opened it and it 's a very very cru it 's well well done  so it is beautiful  great britain  yeah i mean they have to do it right if they 're going to start and pioneer the whole thing dan it 's beautiful but i i just have a comment on their syntactic trees uh maybe it 's not the the trees are not really trees e   they 're linear the the analysis of the constituents of their sentences in the corpus is is linear so you know their it is like parsing or words  so it 's not really trees because in the trees you have subsets   which one   uhm   uhm   as in one you have subsets  yeah and you can see the you know know what what they call the dominant relations you know  yeah  so it 's well done yeah at least well you should be able to get some data from that for the presentation  uh uhm for the intro okay i i haven't i haven't sat down yet to do mine but i should i should be able to anyway we each only have twen what each of us has ten fifteen minutes   ten  did you see my e-mail interruption in the tape  you have to submit your handouts uhm at at the latest at the day before a day before the presentation which means tuesday what i got a call from jocelyn jocelyn if we 're coming for ching 's chair lecture uh uhm  besides i 've been thinking though except for that one list of categories that tish wanted me to have as a handout that people can bring with them the rest are going to be on acetate and so i was thinking of just doing it myself  uh uhm but i told her we need an o h p uh uhm uh uhm are you gonna 'cause you 're gonna use one no but yeah i 'll use one  off hand i was thinking of having list of categories uh uhm that 's one acetate uh uhm  header what what are the things that are contained in the header uh-huh just to give them an idea that they can have background information about the kind of words or the persons they are listening to in the tape uh uhm and sample text so that they know when i say just ignore the markups then they don't say what are the markups then i 'd say these are the markups  and tho those will be on uh on acetates yeah i want to do them on acetates  i don't wanna do handouts a lot when i discuss 'cause people don't listen is it the same for you yeah  so we 're okay with that uhm the other thing  can we talk about the the fuse the trip uhm oh can i ask you uh yeah the the schedule has been changed what do you mean it 's still in may but uhm it would be one week later what so it 's going to be may  the the original the first schedule was may one to may seven   seven  now it 's going to be may seven to may thirteen reason since the secretaries are coming along one of them has to be here to be left behind uh and coolly said we can't afford to you know to close the the office for one week 'no  so one has to be left behind and that means that paz 's group will go to cagayan de oro first week of may we will go to palawan second week third week uh coolly 's group will go to iloilo  that 's three weeks in may  uhm   office  is it okay if i ask about the honorarium in regards to a personal plan i have uhm you know how we 're given the honorarium right as in eight thousand but with the daily allowance how are you planning to do that like we did in davao we we will you give us each our budget for the meal and the lodging you know how you had words  the the the the one that we did in surigao was was something different how how did you if you still remember in davao we shouldered our own expenses for food and accommodation i think in surigao we had free lunch uhm free everything is free except the breakfast because we stayed in a hotel but otherwise the lunch and the the dinner but are we gonna liquidate the accommodation and meal money no the one that it 's the allowance that 's not liquidated i 'm not sure the honorarium is   dan can you find out because for me if it 's not pera because uhm i was thinking and and you 're invited too if you want but if you don't have to liquidate the the accommodation and meal allowance can you just give it to us and then i was i was planning to stay in the house and not in the hotel  uhm  uhm then if you want you can come they can come it 's just that of course it 's gonna be more luxurious and you know better facility because i i wanted to do that 'cause i wanted to save because i roel and the kids are planning to come the week after we 're there  busy  uh okay  so are you staying on or yeah uh staying on yeah that 's what we wanted to do because we were gonna go to subic in march okay but then when i said oh i 'm going to palawan and i don't have a choice  what you should do then is tell nilda that your return ticket would be one week later one week later oo  'cause i gave her the new date may seven to may thirteen did you wanna stay longer  no one week 's okay uh and then so uh uh i 'll look into that yeah i 'll look into that that is is you know because yeah i remember in surigao one the allowance i think was not liquidated but the one which had which was taxed was liquidated i 'm not sure it 's the other way around uhm  any news yet on the moa uhm the mo matel uh uhm c o e they have the money it was released yesterday and nilda got a notice from the accounting office that the point five million is already available it 's it 's already been deposited in the accounting office so i made it clear to her that that 's just the first installment because it 's one million per year e   uh uhm  uh uhm and ched might say that it 's just point five million for one year but uh nilda said no it 's just the first installment second installment will will come very soon i i have not talked to coolly about that yet but it 's a it 's a development a great development because we 've been waiting for that since last year so it 's all it 's all systems go for the matel  yeah  do we have the faculty though  we have identified them the thing however is that we haven't talked to to people and we haven't given them the schedule who do you have in mind to teach what the c o e matel uhm the usual faculty graduate faculty plus you cora uh and lily might go might be asked to go uhm remy miciano also i think we have enough except that we have to synchronize the i mean you know to see the the schedule and not hold the courses at the same time that 's why i the first reaction to the moa uh the p h d applied linguistics extension program in ateneo was a little negative i said i i go for deferment of the project to the following year because we might be understaffed uh uhm if all the the extension programs namely lipa zamboanga and the matel uh c o e pro projects uhm are held at the same time on schedule i mean you know same schedule then we might be left with no one to teach the courses on campus and we have three masters and one p h d courses in on campus  yeah  if if i 'll be teaching the matel i 'll i 'll be going to san carlos or that depends on the course  we 're not sure about san carlos yet 'cause i haven't talked  uh all right  and it depends on the course and not so much on the place yeah what course were you thinking for me to teach i was thinking of giving you advanced grammar for philippine languages laughter  no i think you were identified for to teach curriculum design something on materials prep uh okay the one that andee has been teaching all right  that 's exciting but ateneo de zamboanga at the moment is being deferred no uh it 's all systems go also  it 's all systems go  yeah yeah i didn't finish the statement allan said allan e-mailed me back and said danny if we defer to the following year then they might look for ano another school right but we might lose the chance of you know yeah serving that but where i 'm not i 'm not teaching there right  no just so i can pace myself if i can go to europe or africa where in africa in rwanda laughter  no but you know roel 's going to australia in september but i don't know uhm olympic olympic 'no  they have the international pig veterinary society olympic and the olympic month every two years they have this meeting the last time was in when i gave birth to audrey he was in italy then when that year i went to england two weeks before that he was in birmingham wow that was his conference and then i went to plymouth now it 's in sydney wow so i 'm not saying anything yet 'cause he hasn't said if he 's bringing me but i want to go speaker b laughs  but you know but come to think of it i have so many trips this year well many than usual anyway words  so we have i 'm going to did i uh i haven't told you i 'm going to cebu when on march four for tentatively eighty percent going for my grandparents have arrived from the states oh but i 'm staying until only until the sixth so after my class with tish i 'm leaving uhm i yet have to wait for their call on monday before i finalize everything but so far uh as far as i 'm concerned i 'm going there on the fourth then we have like a reunion on the fifth then i 'll be back on the sixth 'cause roel doesn't want me to go longer  uh uhm 
Philippines	sir jimmy my good man shall we commence with this discussion what shall we say victor how many cartons of cigarettes do you have left anyway how many cartons do you have left my friend can i have one carton please laughs  well who do you think the next chairperson to be should be for all you know our chairman and i jimmy we have a mutual admiration uh society he admires my work and i admire his admiration for it uh uh chuckle chuckle laughs  i wonder if this is what leny wants i mean well let 's avoid talking about the administration jimmy old man yes we shouldn't start it victor we should talk about what we know  using an indian accent but as i was telling you the other day when i was in calcutta speaker b laughs i visited the grave of mahatma gandhi and i was wondering there was this man standing there he was wearing a turban he was wearing a turban and he said  come and ride with me in my flying carpet speaker b laughs and i said my friend what do you think i am if i want a ride i will go on a taxi cab i have in fact i must go now to visit my friend my friend anil goldna  and well he has invited me to to watch a a concert of ravi shankar a what ravi shankar a what ravi shankar my friend whatever go ahead  using mexican accent oh jimmy you have no sense of humor speaker b laughs  if you only know what we do in mejico  i was told hey leny do you like this laughs  you know you know you know speaker b laughs why the mexicans only sent three hundred men to the ali mall guevara why mr brias because they only had one car speaker b laughs  hey the cup is smaller right my friend the topic for today is feminism oh yeah  still using mexican accent feminism as i have told you speaker b laughs you are a male chauvinist pig and i have told you that the feminist movement has many many many valid reasons for its existence  using french accent as i have told you in france we have a very strong movement of uh feminism speaker b laughs which was spearheaded by uh madam simone de beauvoir who was allegedly mistress of jean paul sartre hmm speaker b laughs  so i was walking with her one day on the champs elysee and i said  ma cherie come with me to see beautiful city and we shall make love together speaker b laughs and she said piss off you male chauvinist pig speaker b laughs  ahh no she says you you filthy swine you hey vic are you still having the gatherings on fridays although your mom is here already yes of course same thing after eight yeah it 's the same thing except you you 're not invited oh shit okay that 's too bad thanks a lot fine laughs i would wish more women would attend these gatherings like who leny leny would attend leny yes laurene has naira has laurene naira yes in fact that 's about it yeah what did you guys talk last friday aside from your jokes well i was in fact the life of the party such humility no kidding how come you 're the host i i suppose so well i had a nice day with my classes strange aren't they  sings yes it 's true it 's true  starts singing love is a many-splendored thing it 's the april rose that only grows in the early spring  love is nature 's way of giving a reason to be living  dante dante  yes thanks yeah it 's for leny leny wants it for her class for her language class  leny leny leny  what about no she wants uh she wants us to she wants us to record the way we speak in english for her english course literature course  starts singing a song full of names of philosophers; speaker b laughs throughout and the rest of this song has been forgotten where 's victor gojocco he went home why why i don't know why don't you know because he doesn't because he didn't tell me why i see  well i don't do you i don't do you call this a discussion i suppose so no it isn't yes it is i think so it is not yes it is it 's not no of course not yes it is come on let 's have a discussion bugger off jimmy stop it stop it victor cool it will you i 'm trying to sip on this coffee how many more minutes to go perhaps now we can begin uh if you feel it is appropriate so jimmy what do you think about this issue that mcintyre talks about in after virtue  interesting that 's a very boring answer jimmy  you 're not risking anything by saying that exciting it 's very boring as well well remember what i told you in the faculty canteen you made me think about something else words  yeah like yeah you know like he starts off by saying by giving out all the examples words  can you speak up please i can't hear you and why there seems to be no standard by which to weigh the rival premise of the other do you remember what i replied to that theory of yours not quite i said it was just a load of senseless drivel speaker b laughs totally incoherent speaker b laughs and absolutely wanting in sense well you see that 's your opinion well that 's that you 're taking the emotivist  position right now jimmy the point is how so how can we say who is right how do we overcome the incommensurability of these uh-hum premises more premises well i think we have to discover the luminon  huh well then we 'll have the rational basis but then again it 's unknown so what the heck right the  luminon aha the luminon is dead the luminon  well no need to drift into this luminon  realm of reality mr guevara yes dr brias i suppose you 're very right about that so where do we drift into oh prof guevara take freudian example you might say we might be drifting back into the coughs excuse me uh but uh jokes aside please continue with your theoretical expos&eacute; but as of now they 're very incoherent which they  my ideas i guess how many more minutes to go hey uh jimmy should i say prof guevara since this is a serious discussion   yes yes dr brias what is it  don't you think that life is beautiful aren't these beautiful feelings so wonderful  don't you just feel like rising up jumping and saying  praise the lord hallelujah i 'm saved  yes i do victor i really do i mean i believe in god you know point well taken speaker b laughs  what a life what do you think jimmy yes but a woman has a right to her own body yeah of course that means if she 's pregnant does she uh does that mean she is permitted to abort the baby that she has ahh good point  you think uh you think that a woman is only as old as the man she feels as a what  i 'll repeat the question you think a woman is only as old as the man she feels  or to say that chauvinistically do you think the man is only as old as the woman he feels i think that is said more appropriately now dr brias i think so hey jimmy could you ask your wife to cut her nails my back 's a mess speaker b laughs  that 's a good joke vic good joke you know jimmy 's wife likes to talk while she has sex so she called him up the other day from her hotel room and then what happened you tell us speaker b laughs  i believe that god is everywhere where everywhere where 's that all around where 's all around in heaven and in hell as st augustine would say  you know   is he in you also i suppose so yeah anyway getting to more serious matters hey leny i hope this thing works for whatever you wanna do with it huh yeah leny i i hope it works well five forty-five i don't think i 'll ever be happy what 's leny taking literature for uh 'cause she likes writing she likes lit she enjoys it she 's studying she 's studying yeah her doctorate program

little woman dying to come out speakers b and c laugh  ahh coffee yes please enough enough did you take marcel in louvain i took valium speaker b laughs and marijuana  speaker b laughs  patty valium ivan demerol megadon sorsogon amphetamines and occasionally i did take a dose of xylocybi for that uh pseudo-mystical experience  i wonder if this thing turns off automatically  speaks gibberish, with these words coming out distinctly manila de la salle university mohammad cymbal leoncini guevara brias saddam hussein  i didn't know you knew how to speak thai no this is baluchistani speakers b and c laugh  yeah you talk baluchistani after all  more gibberish, with speakers b and c joining in  in fact when i was in louvain i used to speak baluchistani with this guy old victor old victor kevin o'brien and even mark o'brien kevin o'brien 's brother so uh old victor really got into baluchistani and uh he uh he well as wolf would say his is already a case of advanced what was it what was it  ahh psychosis no not psychosis schizophrenia schizophrenia and uh old victor had this vocabulary so we had to learn it foreign words and then numbers we had numbers uh foreign words  all numbers that 's the only thing i remembered from my first lessons in baluchistani baluchistani and we would go to this bar it was called uh jesus christ what was it called it was called uh uh now i forget i used

Philippines	how are you i 'm fine i 'm always fine oh really nice of you to be fine you don't have a class anymore i don't have a class since it is my break time oh is that so so what was your last class my last class well technical writing  oh what is it all about what is it all about isn't it that you are teaching technical writing so why do you still have to ask me oh yeah just kidding you know i 'm almost words exhausted  laughter words  sorry  you 're joking me  if there is somebody who is going to ask about technical writing it should be me since sometime uh uh ano  so that i could even words   yeah yeah yeah yeah i understand that  but anyway what part of technical writing i mean uh the course outline have you tackled already i 've tackled already so far we have talked about uhm the definition  okay   we talked about the properties uh-huh how many properties did you talk about well i could not remember everything anymore but i made sure that i was able to talk about the properties starting with a  up to mention> z  oh i believe that well in my own understanding since you know i 'm also teaching the subject right i think the properties are very important isn't it what do you think it is very important that 's why i told them that they 're not supposed to memorize it only but you also have to apply all the things that you have learned from the properties me too we have the same you know you know okay what else well what we are going to talk about right now  words   words ask questions about pertaining this subject because i 'm not that knowledgeable sure anything well i 'm gonna we are going to talk about properties what else other things that we are supposed to talk well i believe that you have to proceed now with the basic uh techniques because these basic techniques support your lesson in properties you know uhm properties actually the concept of studying the properties is to achieve appropriateness now in line with appropriateness we have to see to it that the students may also know how to achieve appropriateness so i advise you ha i advise you to tackle the basic techniques before the prelim exam okay so do you have do you have a note on that i don't have a note but then whatever are the things that i 'm teaching about technical writing i usually refer it to  from from my two sources which are uhm the basic technical communication  uh-hmmmh oh yeah that 's like a book that 's that 's a nice book  sorry  words  so i consider that to be a reference book in this subject yes yes sure the other one how about the other one the other one i forgot the title uh  it 's here technical writing   technical writing by  word soria and mogol word  that 's also nice yeah it seems complete well so far i don't have any difficulty teaching yet because we haven't tackled yet those uhm difficult things that need to be tackled about  okay   so at this point in time i 'm still having some time uh teaching about that because it 's quite easy at this very moment well if you find some difficulties in the future just if you need my help just approach me okay who knows i may able to help you with that okay so let 's help one another one one more thing apart from apart from uhm those things that i 'm supposed to teach them what do you think are the best projects that i should require the students words to apply the properties that they have learned from this subject oh that 's a nice question   okay  uh for me uhm they have only one project for that subject they 're going to bring a finished product a finished product which they did not buy from the market what do you mean by that okay uh one of the basic techniques that we will tackle is about description of a process okay okay now in that description of a process you will be learning the different procedures to finish something now uh in line with that i am requiring my students to bring with them a finished product but this finished product which will be their project is related to their course like for instance uh uh a wall decoration or a lamp okay and they could try to assemble that using the so called materials so our agreement is this they can buy the materials from the market but they need to produce their own they have to come up with a lamp or they may have to come up with a wall decoration or they should come up with an electrical project anything that has something to do with reports and this may be the application of all the things that they learned in technical writing  why because in the matter of presentation they have to apply unity coherence organization and of course logic okay so that is one project that actually i only require them to submit one project e  but apart from uhm apart from the requirement that they are to supposed to pass uh-hmmmh are are they supposed to also explain about that particular  project   yes definitely they have they have to explain it they have to to present to the class the methods that they followed the materials that they used okay and then the way they assem assembled that particular project what about the proposals what can you say about that in terms of proposal because you know there is already this uh this trend right now that they are not making their own proposal they just they are just asking somebody else to do it for them so in terms of proposal i am not sure whether they can finish that or they do this all by themselves or they just ask somebody else to do it for them so you you feel then that it is not good for you to require them to make a proposal it 's not that it is not good but i think it 's not the best way of knowing whether they learn something from technical writing  or not but you can also do that provided provided ha take note of this provided that these students will be doing their proposal inside the classroom but the problem is how can they gather data  so meaning you still have to send them out for for data gathering   yes  and then they have to show me the gathered data but then from my own point of view uh if there 's one thing that they should really learn about is on how to make a proposal  yes of course   because once they become professional uh they would be required to make a proposal and that 's one way of generating money for their uhm for their boss  uh-hmmmh  uh-hmmmh because if ever they come out with a big proposal they might be assured of a business that would yield profit to the company that they are working for i uhm you have a point you have a point and i would like you to think about that you know because you have a point okay now the the problem is you know i i would like to require them to make a proposal but the problem you know is that perhaps they have to defend the title present the title and defend it otherwise i will not be sure whether that particular proposal is had been written by somebody else or they just bought it somewhere so perhaps the best way that we can do right now if you want them to make submit a proposal is that they have to present a certain title okay now uh i scanned the syllabus and i found out that uh you did not include words  i found out that you did not include report writing  as part of the uh syllabus is that so that 's the last part of the there are there are some portions there there 's a portion there wherein uh there is a need for you for them to uhm study about report uh-hmmmh but then i found out that uh there was no specified report that they are supposed to words  okay like for instance annual report   word report  okay  you know the reason for this is i was thinking of the time the time frame that i think that for me ha for me what i 'm doing is that after i have already finished discussing the steps the tendency is i usually let them make a scope but that is not a project it 's just an assignment it 's the application of the five steps and you feel that uhm you 're not you 're not supposed to dwell on that particular topic i can because you feel it is not that important compared to other no no no no i am not saying that it is not important but what i 'm telling you is it 's not supposed to be treated as a project it is supposed to be a uh an assignment an exercise an exercise yes because if it is a project you know they are good e they are very good in in buying copying something especially now that we have the internet they all they just get it from somebody else but i i require i require them to do a proposal i require them to present a progress report a preliminary report in the sense that it is just an exercise okay one more thing uh-hmmmh uhm i 've noticed from my students that they are not that motivated in studying technical writing maybe because they felt that it is not uhm useful to them uh-huh now in what way could i be able to motivate my students in such a way that uhm they are going to study and be interested in the subject matter uh okay so that 's the point now let 's see in the introductory part of the subject i always pinpoint the significance of technical writing in their chosen field of specialization and i always tell them that actually technical writing  is a boring subject okay why because you need to well let 's say they 're not gonna memorize it but they have to understand everything by heart isn't it because we 're talking about the principles now but to motivate them okay to like the subject so that  i have to i always emphasize to them the importance of this because they cannot perform their work in the future without knowing how to prepare technical reports because this is half of their their lives when they become professionals this will be half of the profession that they 're going to tackle and the work that they 're going to do and another thing is that i always tell them that  technical writing is a preparation of the thesis writing  they will have when they will be in a year  and i always emphasize to them that they cannot graduate unless they have to write a thesis and for them to come up with an effective and complete thesis they need to study technical writing  and that 's good ano you  yes   you you require them the uh proposal in accordance with words in accordance with their courses but then since we are talking about technical writing  we at times encounter students who are having difficulty writing uh-hmmmh so naturally uh since some of the problem that they are encountering uh deals with grammars okay we at times go back to the basic which sometimes eat most of our time  yes  uh-hmmmh now what do you do with those students who dos not even know how to write simple english or sentence well well that 's a problem but you know sometimes if that 's the case uh i have to i have experienced tutoring students that 's a good word  it 's very very hard but you know i cannot blame the teachers in in their previous english subjects because you know he cannot cater to all right to all sixty students right so there will always be this problem but you know sometimes we have to spend extra hour and extra patience you know not only teaching their subject but also going back to this particular uh grammar thing because they cannot write without knowing their word so that 's the only thing i can offer them it 's just to tutor them with word past subjects especially in grammar 
Philippines	yeah we were talking about your passion for books you you know you bought so many cicero and now even that very humble uh book you 're still interested uh how come yeah i think uhm it 's the it 's about my desire to learn a lot of things  you got it from your your parents and your uncles are  ano teachers 'no  yeah my my grandfather is a retired supervisor too wow and  supervisors mean uh means  supervisor means he 's in charge of uh of a of a large   overlooking different groups i think several districts a supervisor is higher than a principal supervisor is higher than a principal  it 's a   yeah  it 's a step lower than the superintendent superintendent  superintendent meaning it 's superintendent is i think one or two steps higher a superintendent oversees a division a region a division okay like what is what is higher than a superintendent uh it 's already the department or division  words decs acronym for department of education, culture, and sports chairman okay yeah decs acronym for department of education, culture, and sports chairman superintendent and supervisor supervisor there are different supervisors there are uh supervisors for like english math and different subjects uh yeah of a certain province of a certain yeah of a certain province uh-hmmmh so you so they 're not he 's not in charge of the school he 's in charge of a department in the school like the english department no actually he 's in charge of several schools in the province uh-hmmmh okay uh i don't know what the division he is right now but basically a supervisor depends on the size of the province sometimes oversees two provinces or even three and you 're talking about maybe fifty schools maybe more than fifty schools wow so if you 're a supervisor not a subject supervisor you 're an administrative supervisor you don't you don't only oversee like the the specific subject that you 're in charge but you 're administering  words  so he 's he 's an administrative supervisor yes he 's actually supervisor two because there 's also a supervisor one what 's that uh a little bit lower in designation but it 's consider does it pay well uh now i think it pays well it pays well but before of course with the the salary scheme in the public in the public education in the philippines it 's really it 's really i don't think it pays well but as of this time i think the pay is good and that is the father of your father   yeah the father of my father yeah my father is an engineer but my the family of where my father came from are actually teachers the sister the youngest sister of my grandfather is a retired master teacher what 's a master teacher uh a master teacher is actually in relation to salary he 's he or she is equivalent to a principal but uh he or she decided not to hold administrative position but rather stay in the classroom and teach ok so uh in salary they 're almost the same uh as the principal but doesn't have administrative role master teacher master teacher yeah but is that category still being used today yeah yeah so what what will qualify someone to become uh a master teacher a master teacher actually achieves that position after a long time you really could not become a master teacher without without really uh having that experience in the classroom for a long time because that means you have to earn the respect of the other teachers then you have to respect also the the you earn the respect also of the the parents of the children that you that you have taught so you it only it only means that you have been in teaching and you have mastered you have mastered teaching that you are an effective teacher for a long time so there there are act it 's actually one of the rankings that uh every teacher in the public school in in visaya you know so they can after a long time of teaching maybe they can they can apply for it master teacher yeah because in the public school there are rankings like you 're you 're an elementary teaching you 're elementary teacher one elementary teacher two  so   elementary teacher three when our graduates passed the the board exam they   they words to the public schools the first the base category is yes sir it 's basically just an elementary teacher or  school teacher  one  maybe one  it depends  elementary teacher one   it depends on where they 're assigned also because you 're like you are a uh uh grade one teacher or grade two teacher or grade three teacher but there are still ranking there are still rankings uh on those levels because you have to also i think you also have to earn those rankings because the what do you call this the the division office or the supervisor 's office oh i don't know if they have they have to undergo testing but i think they have testing and it will also depend on the different evaluations that the division office or the district office will receive and they will rank the teachers and your salary also depends on those rankings so what is the lowest uhm teacher one i think teacher one and then teacher two teacher two depending on the grade level there are also grade levels e  so if you 're uh you 're uh an upper grade level teacher one way or the other and you have a you have a higher ranking you will also receive   a higher salary  so uh one who teaches high school gets a higher salary compared to one who teaches grade one no no there are rankings in different uh year levels  uh  uh-hmmmh so you also will be ranked okay so if you 're ranked the lowest you 'll get you 'll get the lowest salary  talaga  i think the problem the problem right now uh with public schools is that sometimes even in getting a higher rank or getting a promotion for that matter is usually dependent on whom you know in the office and sometimes even with evaluation that 's why other people get higher rankings is because the evaluation are also at times manipulated by the students no by the by the principal by the by the other people administering the rank so let 's go through the ranking teacher one teacher two teacher three   teacher two teacher three yeah teacher four and different is it is it only until teacher three uh i don't know right now because it has changed e pero in the past kasi like if you are a grade one teacher uh if for example there are like uh one hundred teachers in a division or in a district for example okay you might be an elementary teacher one elementary uh grade one grade one teacher  word  you 're a grade six teacher but based on the rankings and in uh together with all the other teachers in the district you 're ranked like if you are one hundred and you 're ranked one hundred that means you have the lowest rank ranking so that means your salary will be given uh you will be given i mean the lowest salary based on the scale because they have several scales e  several scales   yeah so you will be ranked uh with all the other teachers in the in the district and then in your school you will also be ranked uh really with all the other teachers in the school is that true yeah even right now even right now so if there are twenty teachers you will you will be ranked where are you in my gosh even in private schools no private schools they don't have that only public schools only public schools i think it is because of the issue of salary and promotions oh because if you go uh if you go higher in the ranking system in the end you you will realize that you 're already like you can already be promoted to principal or assistant principal or maybe if you don't want to be a principal you can words in retiring as a master teacher  a master teacher  tsk tsk tsk the the youngest sister of my grandfather is a master teacher my the eldest sister of my father she 's already a school principal she 's also uh i think a master teacher also wow my auntie one of my auntie right now the sister of your brother my the younger sister the sister next to my father is a is i think she 's a grade six teacher she 's also a master teacher uh not yet uh the brother uh the brother of my father the one before him uh-hmmmh was when she 's also he 's also dead now huh yeah he 's already older than your bro father older than my father uh the brother the brother before my father uh he was i think elementary grade teach elemen  uh grade six elementary teacher so we 're they 're basically they 're all teachers so my desire for books maybe i have i got that from from from the  words my father 's family  the teaching clan no i notice several people from bicol it 's either they are teachers or priests or military men military  talaga  well, one brother of my father is a is a constabulary trainor in camp crame before now another brother was a major in the army and like several cousins of my father are are actually in the police force so it 's either military or religious leaders priests nuns or teachers and i think in bicol that 's common because basically bicol is a religious is a religious region oh yeah why is it religious oh maybe because of the strong influence of catholicism in the province my grandfather for example is a priest uh no he is uh he 's called an he 's he 's a board member of the parish and during holy week he would usually act as one of the disciples remember during holy week they you would see like men uh like uh asking for donations uh-hmmmh they 're in like in costumes like they 're apostles the disciples during the time of jesus so they would usually do that as the part of the work of the parish they would usually act as disciples or apostles during the holy week and ask for donations they walk from uh they walk from the parish to the different  barangays   words  no they 're in sandals but dressed in dressed in like the apostles like they put long clothes and who are the people who usually do that they are the parish board most of them are members of the board of the parish are they respectable men and women respectable   they 're usually considered also as respectable religious leaders like the elders of the land similar to that  yeah  they 're not they 're not uh priests they 're uh laymen but they also act as lay ministers cough  so they can also like they can also like give communions they can also give uh they can also officiate mass they can also uh is there a priest in the family with us in among the distant relatives there are priests in fact parish priests and i don't know if we have a bishop already among the the uh the pura  yeah the surname pura uh it did did the did your relatives originally uh did they originate uh from bicol  pura  actually the pura clan our clan came from uh they said it originally came from iloilo uh but later on migrated to the bicol region migrated to the bicol region they 're businessmen and later on became teachers and other leaders but i don't know uh because most of us came from there most of most of those that i know with that family name came from that province from iloilo from iloilo  interruption  so the pura ha  yeah but i think the desire for books is can be traced can be traced uh can be traced to my father 's family uh my grandfather has maintained his own library   what is your what is your ay  really the father of your father the father of my father has maintained his own how many volumes does he own uh when i was younger i think it 's a lot there he had about uh maybe three big shelves something bigger than this well maybe something as big as this but it 's maybe five layers wow and he had three of those when he was alive

three semesters 'no then uh the following year there 're going to be another two semesters plus this coming sem so that 's a total of three semesters with nine nine units per semester uh hey you mentioned earlier that there are foreigners also studying there well how how 's the atmosphere over there uhm meaning the locals and the foreigners yeah there are we 're doing fine with with the foreigners you know they 're uh they 're friendly also and uh you know you can learn from them uh the way their culture are the way they they value things and they uh the way they uhm treat us you know uh yeah you can you can uh be friends with them oo  yeah like what kind of foreigners are there uh most of them are the koreans and uh uh malaysians the burmese yeah we also have uh americans argentineans  it 's like uh uh an international school that you 're in  oh i see laughter ha ha i 'm in that you 're in if you 're there laughter o  well all of you talk in english you mean that 's the common language that you use that 's the common language to use in in the class but uh if you 're talking with fellow uh filipinos then you can you can converse in tagalog oh i see but if you 're talking to a foreigner but some of them you know uh the foreigners can also understand uh filipino so uhm they they would like to learn also our language so yeah they you can talk to them in english then with uh some filipino words to help them also to learn well how about how about the age i mean are they all the same age as you   you 're still quite young   the age   oh you mean you  yeah you know uhm uhm some of them maybe i can say that they are around forties the thirties the from thirties forties to fifties uh only a few are uh in the line of twenties oo i  oh i see  so some can pass as your grandfather words   laughter yeah you know the first time i was in the class uh the the first day of my class in a t s uh they thought i was the youngest in the class yeah looks can be deceiving looks can be deceiving laughter and my height too yeah you can pass as a 'no just cute as a what as a grade schooler yeah a grade schooler it 's a compliment by the way laughter  yeah that 's a compliment okay thank you laughter   o so you are planning to enroll this sem this coming sem yes well actually i have here a brochure or a catalogue of another school of another school yes it 's quite near our office it 's around it is also in makati uhm i 'm kind of thinking which school would be best suited for me of course our school is the best laughter  well of course laughter whatever you say but you know what uh what kind of uh degree program would you like to be into  i mean would you like to be a missionary or a pastor maybe you can get uhm m div masters in divinity in mission or m div in pastoral studies something like biblical studies well uhm well i really like to work in a school as a counselor or even as a teacher even a seminary teacher you know i enjoy i enjoy teaching  a school  teaching maybe you can get the same uhm degree program as i am uh as i am into okay which is uh that 's m a in christian education but you can get the the m div in christian education which is uh a higher you know a higher program because you you learn uh greek the hebrew oh you learn the greek language you mean they teach greek yeah they teach greek and hebrew in m div courses but in m a courses they don't teach we don't have to uh we don't require to get that uh subject oh i see okay uh yeah but uh you know m div is much uh uh it 's much difficult but uh it 's more challenging if you are in that uh course so those courses uhm mold you into a pastor or uh more likely yeah more likely into a uh pastor or a church church leader type yeah church leader sounds interesting well what other courses do your school offer  yeah   we also have uhm master of arts in laughter interruption by another person  hold it ha  sure  laughter chris chris so uhm yes where were we where were we laughter  you were talking about we were talking about the uh m div in counseling right i 'm telling you about another degree program called counseling oh hey that sounds very interesting yeah you can enroll in that uh field if you want to if you have if you feel you have the gift of being a counselor oh you know i always imagine myself talking to uh high schoolers teenagers about matters of you know the heart or whatever their schooling i really enjoy their company you know that might be a very good field for me yeah maybe you can you can uh enroll in that course the thing that uh your school and this school that i have a brochure with offers the same courses does it offer uh counseling program also in that school you uh the one that you 'are saying counseling program yes i think so they have yeah it says here that they have actually they already have a schedule a schedule for the year yeah uh-huh  uh uh is it uh the schedule is uh uh only in a m i mean in morning and afternoon well i 'm planning to go to that school tomorrow tomorrow morning to inquire about to inquire more about it okay it 's quite interesting because in our school we also have evening classes in some subjects particularly the the old testament survey or new testament survey but it 's very quite far from where i am yeah it 's quite far from your place of work in makati right 'no but uh uh the joy of seeing me there speakers a and b laugh the joy of seeing me there and uh with uh some of my classmates you know we can make you happy that definitely makes me feel

Philippines	 some words missing ms lising oh loy belated happy birthday yes thank you i 'm sorry did i wake you up no no no i was looking at t v uh okay so nothing i wa i was just passing the time uh all right you don't you don't mind my calling oh i don't mind you calling and i enjoy talking with you  laughs sir did you do you remember dr bautista mention to you about the direct conversation data also for the international corpus of english did she mention that about what uh remember when we had the project on international corpus of english yes uh well part of the uh data that she needs for the project is the direct con distance conversation which is a telephone conversation yes so do you mind if i record our conversation did she no no she told me that uh all right uh i told her i 'll be happy to talk with loy  i was expecting your call but you must have been very busy  uh okay  yeah because i 'm data gathering sir i 'm trying to be uh well i i 'm in one school at seven to ten thirty in the morning and i have one hour or so to get to another school by twelve o clock well by the way what 's what 's the thrust of your of your research well it 's uh psycholinguistics and sociolinguistics in nature uh it 's a look at uh filipino-english bilingual children 's language acquisition and it 's trying to explore whether there is a relationship among their degree of bilingualism uh in relation to how their parents talk to them and metalinguistic ability their ability to control and analyze language  uh  well that 's very interesting yeah so i am not into language planning laughs   words i hope you 're recording this now yes sir i am i just turned on the recorder so yeah  yeah  so uh when do you expect to uh complete uh gathering that sir uh i 'm almost half way through uh the data gathering requires that i individually test twenty-five to thirty children from three different schools uhm all of the schools based on tuition fee that are asked for them to pay are categorized in the middle class section so well there are supposed to be three levels well i think in the words i think there were the ilustrados the rich and then the poor that 's it   so the the middle class appeared actually uh the middle class appeared in the philippines and uh but what i am interested in is uh how the middle class  right   uhm  i remembered you in one of your talks i remember vividly how you mentioned that uh one of the driving force of the creation of the middle class is the requirement for uh putting in place english as a medium of instruction in school do i remember what you said correctly you see words in the middle class especially the uh upper middle class you can divide the upper class again into three uh upper middle lower something like that    and of course it depends upon your criteria that words  uh-huh   yeah   words something like that i consider myself belonging to the middle class not upper but you see uh in other respects i belong to the upper class uh i lecture around the world and so forth like that  uh-uhm   yeah   yeah  uh-uhm so it depends on the criteria  words so for example the middle class in the united states would be different from the middle class in the philippines  words i think should be words  of the country like words a special case their middle class is i think different from our middle class   something like that uh so it is a very interesting study uh  yeah yeah  uhm i 've done i i think i need two more sessions and then i 'm already finished with the last test in the two schools after which uh i i need to spend another three weeks or so in de la salle zobel in alabang and then after that uh perhaps just another couple of weeks to go back to the parents uh who may not have submitted their conversa conversation data yet at that time uh and more or less the data should be complete so i 'm thinking i 'm i 'm thinking about march the latest should be end of march for the data gathering sir what i 'm trying to do at the same time when i 'm not able to gather data is try to already you know uh manage it in a certain way so that uh by the time i 'm finished with all the three schools uh simultaneously i 'm also uh able to do something with the data and not well are you do you have any pre-determined uh grid of  words or classifications of words  uh-uhm uh yeah the the some of the factors some of the variables that can be in the grid are are uh the results of the tests i have uh validated i i tested them with the validated comprehension uh test which uh dr de ocampo from u p diliman made it 's a validated what uh it 's a comprehension test written uh well uh in her case it was uh the the the kids had to write their their answer but for me since my respondents are pre-school students so i individually administered the test and then i took uh i i was the one who who wrote the answers on the paper is that right they are not recorded pardon sir yeah they are not recorded on tape the responses yeah uh in some cases yes in others no so for instance uhm for all the students what i do with them is first i have a very short interview which aims at familiarizing them with me and at the same time uh trying to gather some salient information such as who spends most of the time or who spends time with you at home things like that and what language they use when talking to you and who reads to you at night something like that and then the second part when i 'm done with that very short interview uh it 's a comprehension test in both english and filipino comprehensive what comprehension test uh-huh comprehension test uh-huh and it also it tests for their level of bilingualism in terms of whether they 're able to understand both english and filipino equally well or they 're dominant in one of the two languages yes you see this is it uh this hasn't been studied my suspicion is that in the philippines  especially in the public schools uh you you know the public schools and the private schools well of course there 's uh  words  indeed there are some private schools that somehow they 're not the kind of words   uh-uhm   uh-uhm  private schools right  words  you said that you are going to you are recording them uh i 'm recording after the comprehension test the next test which i give them is called the it 's called an arbitrariness test what it is sir is like uh it tests for their control of the language right so yeah you use control of the language uh you know there 's the term semilingual uh right what i see now in the philippines words  uh-uhm i 'm tired of that words  the way i i look at it where i come from uh words  people around here like that a semilingual is a person who neither has control of the subject matter nor the language  facility uh-uhm  words many teachers now this is why i would like to i i would be happy to words  wherein we would uh study uh the semilingualism that is being uh  deve developed having a semilingual class in the philippines who do not know who can have no control of the subject matter they have no control of the uh many of them don't know first they don't know the language according to and then it 's it 's not that only that they do not know the english language uh you know the words  and therefore the worst thing is because they do not know the language they have no control of the language not only that they they do not know the the content in other words when you are speaking uh when you speak you have some control of both language and content now uh if you don't uh if you have no control of both that is you are weak in both then you are a semilingual  and uh there are so many semilinguals in the philippines now   and many of them teachers  uh-uhm   uh-uhm   uh-uhm   laughs yeah that 's very unfortunate  some teachers come to my house and then they are very afraid especially my relatives because i speak to them in english and they would shift you know and i say no i want when we talk in english everything must be in english i don't want a mixture and so they are very nervous  yeah   uh-uhm   uh-uhm   laughs  that 's why they avoid my they avoid me they don't come to my house uh these are relatives the relatives of my wife and my relatives of course i 'm harsh on them but uh you know in the schools this is just guesswork now this is i have no data but uh based on certain uh well words teachers to professionals they give examinations to professionals boards something like that for teachers  now i have a booklet here and i don't know where i got it but anyway i think a friend of mine or something uh anyway uh many of them do not know have no control of both languages i say languages because they have no control of the of say filipino and they have no control of english then they do not have control of the subject matter they don't words so laughs  words  and then many of these people become teachers so it 's good you know uh of course the lawyer the lawyer 's mistake goes behind bars uh the doctor 's mistake gets buried underground  yeah   right   laughs and the teacher 's mistake gets multiplied and the teacher 's mistake goes on spreading the rot  laughs  so i mean this is tragic  and the worst thing is uh words or a lawyer or a doctor i am conceited to think that i have the brains for any of the three uh and but my father said look it is also economic now you are the eldest you are the oldest among six children we are very poor my father was municipal treasurer long ago and uh he said uh i want you as the oldest to help that is your duty so i want you to take up normal to take up teaching uh and you can easily be a teacher if you graduate well the interviews were done mostly by americans and so uh because of poverty and not of my choice i became a teacher i became a teacher uh well of course i was in the news the other day whether this is good or not because well the you know uh james joyce 's ulysses  the stream of consciousness the novel that started the genre of stream of consciousness continued by thomas wolfe in look homeward angel and uh uh you can't go incomplete title have you read those novels  yeah   work uh-uhm uh i think the first one i did i did that when i was doing my literature in australia  look homeward angel  yeah well then well you see i have two masters degrees one is in psychology and the other is in english literature uh-huh okay so there was once upon a time i thought i 'd be a great writer but uh i got over that something like that now if you are recording this conversation it would be very interesting to be played back  laughs i can bring it tomorrow i 'll be there tomorrow for your uh the dr vilches' professorial lecture you 're gonna be in la salle tomorrow right yes i 'll be there good i will as usual i will deliver the uh sometimes they are long i tend to talk and talk and talk and talk and there is no  words  we don't mind for one the affair is done in honor of you so you can talk as much as you like and i think people are fascinated when you talk because you are very funny  laughs i don't know well but you see i cannot make it too long because the food is waiting and some some of the people who are listening look back at the table where the food is well anyway so i 'll see you tomorrow yes sir i 'll be there yeah but you know you mentioned about being interested in finding out whether how semilingual especially teachers are you know you 'd be interested if i 'm able to manage the data uh later you 'd be interested to find out that what the results would be because apparently uh what i 'm doing in the study is to see how one of the parents of the child talk to the child and and the child how the child talks back to the parent so i 'm recording that uh and i 'm doing that to find out whether the parent would be talking mostly in english or in filipino or code-switching in those languages are these structured or are they uh what 's the opposite of  structured  are the interviews that you are recording structured uh well it 's not it 's not arbitrarily done what happens is that i have created uh an album of pictures that don't have any text uh so there is a structure yeah it 's it 's structured and controlled in that sense but at the same time uh what i 've done is well for one the pictures have to meet certain criteria such as they they they shouldn't be culture-bound the items they would see in the picture yeah yeah and that the pictures are easily accessible in both english and filipino so i i was able to come up with those pictures  yeah  are they photographs or drawings uh no uh you know i ended up i ended up borrowing my daughter 's bedtime storybooks and i was able to find there items that are easily accessible in english and filipino and then i just scanned and printed them out   and yeah then when i spoke with the parents i either met with them i 'm meeting some of them uh or i call them over the phone i just explain to them that i 'm just interested in the way they talk to their children so no specific uh bidding in terms of saying whether it 's english or filipino uhm so it 's yeah  yeah  uh i see 
Philippines	hello sir yes yes uhm good afternoon sir uhm good afternoon so sir how are you i 'm fine i 'm i 'm okay uh that 's good uhm ay anyway before i forget okay uhm happy father 's day belated uh yes uh thank you very much  ha you 're welcome   that is uhm chuckle that is a a greeting that uh we fathers highly appreciate  yes yes of course well how was your day yesterday how was it celebrating father 's day yesterday was a good day  oh   uh we were in the province we had visited my in-laws and uh i had a i had a good time because i was with my family and uh   yeah   uh oh uh i ate a lot yeah ha ha oh really and it was a good day oh lucky are you you were with your family me my dad is not here uh-huh he 's abroad really so he just uhm gives us a call and then he just does the usual  uh-hmmmh  he uhm what do you call this uh and we just greeted him and you know say some things and and yesterday it 's really an emotiona it 's really uhm what do you call this it 's really become very emotional okay because you know uhm being far from your father is really really difficult especially for me i 'm an accounting student and   yes  you know if i 'm dealing with very hard problems regarding my uh my course i could not ask anyone because he 's the only accounting in the family uh and also my lola but then she 's not here with us  oh   so it 's very very difficult for me and  so your father is an accountant working  abroad  yes  yes sir where is he working  wha what uh uh and how long has he been  working abroad  uhm   uhm  he 's been working at i m f and world bank for two  yea two years now  wow  yes chuckle  that 's a good that 's a very nice that 's a great institution huh yes sir actually i was also ano e uhm what do you call this i was also aiming for that kind of uhm uhm profession that he that he 's having right now   okay  but but you are in accountancy yes of course but but then you know the the the what do you call this   the demands of the yes the difficulties of uh being an accounting accounting  student are pretty how shall we put it speaker a chuckles   yeah yeah  uh demanding very demanding yes yes very demanding because you know all companies need  accounti accountants right they cannot run the business without accountants because who would take care of their resources but the accountants uh-hmmmh and it is where with the with the uhm papers that accountants are are making it is where they get their uhm uh what do you call this  ano nga yun laughter  oh my god why oh my god i 'm i 'm so nervous why are you nervous because i 'm with attorney bautista i 'm going to talk to him about anything   but you 've never been my student we 've never been i 've never had the privilege of teaching you uh yes sir so don 't feel nervous  chuckle i 'm really sorry i mean oh my god i mean i don 't know what to say oh my god  laughter let 's talk about your uh your family how many brothers and sisters do you have oh we are only two uh yes i only have one sister we 're both girls  yes   i see  and you are the elder or the young  i 'm the eldest you 're the elder daughter of your uh of mr  valenzuela speaker a chuckles   yes  yes uh-huh and what does your mom do uhm my mom words she 's a housewife but uhm she can sometimes she can can uhm what do you call this teach ay  she does some tutorial jobs something like that yes to high school students because okay she ano when she wa she was in college she was taking liberal arts okay but then unluckily she she she did not uhm make it to the uh what do you call this to the last year of her studies because she got married oh yes but then then it 's okay with her because well being a plain housewife and being a very good mom is you know well don 't i don 't think we should uh uh use the adjective plain when it comes to  housewife because it sounds a bit derogatory you know   uh okay so  uh okay   yeah yeah  it doesn 't sound right but well of course that 's what we hear  no  we always have that impression when uh when a a mother does not work she is just a plain housewife yes oh but in reality uh they the these these individuals are these are the silent and the bonafide  heroes of of our uh of our community  uh-huh   uh-hmmmh  had it not been for your mom di ba   there would be a a i mean you would not be where you are today and uh you really owe her a lot in the sense that uh her she has given you the her gift of presence that 's one thing that working moms and working dads cannot give their children and their children as you have just pointed out you 're  already you 're already a young lady and yet you miss your father  uh-huh   yes  uh-hmmmh you 're already i believe of voting age are you not uhm uh   not yet not yet but actually i 'll be turning eighteen in july  na  oh so, you 're going to celebrate your debut anyway as i was saying uh well children need the presence of at least one parent whi while yes that 's true but of course uh the reality is that uh our uh demands our uh our milieu our environment is is such a way that uh we no longer have the presence of in some cases no both parents because both are either working abroad or they send their children to the  prov uh to to manila and they are province-based therefore they don 't see their children because of these certain uh uh realities whether they are economic realities or social uh uh realities some things we just have to accept  uh-hmmmh  yes but i guess in your case you can still be thankful because of course because your mom is around and your father while he is working abroad by the way uh is he is he working in the states  yes  yes he is uh so he is working in the world bank is that in new york or is it in uh is it in uh washington  d c  washington d c  ayan washington d c uh-hmmmh so when is he scheduled to come back and pay you a visit actually he doesn 't have any plans of coming back here in the philippines because he he he wants to uh bring millions of dollars first  chuckle  uh-huh here and uh he wants me to finish first my studies uh-huh yes he he has his personal uhm uh he he has his personal what do you call it  nawala na ko   he has his personal  uhm plans for yes for the future so i don 't know i 'm always asking him but   so he 's not coming back to you let 's say christmas visit no no he 's not oh yes that 's very actually that 's very sad but then it 's okay are you sure about this yes how do you know that he has no plans of paying you a visit this christmas uhm we were always talking about it e and actually every time he 's telling me that thing i 'm always crying because i really really miss him a lot uh you are a mama 's gir uh a ma uh a papa 's girl actually no  when he   oh  here 's the story when he was still here in the philippines i used to hate him   because of some things that i don 't understand  uh-huh  uh-huh but then when he 's gone uhm   when he 's out yes when he went there i understand all of those things why why he 's doing that thing  okay  oh or it 's just because of for us it 's because of us it 's all for us okay okay wait what is your nickname  pat   pat  you can call me pat or patis  my parents used to call me patis chuckle  okay pat  take a deep breath speaker a takes a deep breath  okay okay now you are more relaxed are you relaxed  speaker a takes a deep breath okay you have to take uh a deep breath when you are uh nervous or agitated or when you 're made to speak before an audience of two thousand three thousand people yes you know you have to take a deep breath that is one thing that we should remember speaker a chuckles when we especially when we speak in front of an audience  uh-hmmmh  yes thank you so much   remember that while while you cannot see me visually uh-hmmmh uh and that 's why i see no reason why you have to be nervous  speaker a chuckles or or anxious uh these these uh tips that i give you when you speak before an audience you have to produce this uh aura of control of of confidence of strength and we can only do this if you know if we are uh how can we put it  no if we are in a state of relaxation yes it 's it actually it 's a how would you it 's a you draw a fine line between a relaxed uh mode and a tense mode uh-hmmmh but you got to be more on the relaxed mode that way you can produce that aura uh so that 's one thing that you need to remember when you when mr flores is going to ask you to speak in front of an audience or conduct an interview  exhale inhale exhale exhale now let 's go back to the topic okay you said you hated your father i am pretty surprised   yes because before why did you hate your father your father is your father how can you hate your father uhm uh it 's just that before before he 's not that close to me and you know uhm i mean nothing it 's just he was working he 's always at work uh-huh was he working for a bank before he got his job at the world bank   he 's working at commission on audit before oh yes he worked there for i think five years  wow and before that where did he where did he work  yes and then uhm only there he started uh his work there sa in coa in coa yes but he he 's only been in world bank for two years yes wow so there was a time when your dad didn 't work yes yes uhm when i wa that was then two years oh he he decided to just you know stop working and take a rest for a while and how did he how how how was he able to support you in terms of education your your your daily sustenance uh he has his savings uh he has   already  yes of which uhm enough for my high school actually that was only two years so my third year and my fourth year uh-huh it 's okay i i lived uhm you know i graduated in graduated in a private school so where was this uhm at roosevelt college san mateo branch uh yes i think i i know that that school that is along j p rizal uh yes correct actually that was lamuan lamuan branch the one  in the  that 's marikina  yes yes that 's it uh my school is near us it 's in san mateo uh i i think opposite that 's in the opposite because i think there 's also a roosevelt uh school in marikina uh-huh yes is there is there a school there is that is that is lamuan uh-hmmmh roosevelt lamuan so uh what other things are you required to improve your english communication skills aside from uh uh talking uh or rather conversing with your teachers over the phone what other exercise did mr flores ask you i think uhm reading reading yes okay but i do love reading uh-huh but then you know we we can uh uh develop our speaking   skills through reading right  pat   pat hold it uh yes  interruption that is the the occupational hazard ha ha ha  ayan  wait so where are you now what do you mean where am i now are you in are you in uh s p c uh yes yes i am now in second year college no i mean i mean the phone ahh i 'm i 'm at home oh oh yes and this is ne near san mateo yes sir i see speaker a chuckles  how long do you do you spend uh your uh waking hours on the phone  laughter  uhm actually i 'm not you know i 'm not fond of uh talking on the phone good that 's good because because you know i do i uh uh i mean i prefer to do a lot more things in school i mean i mean reading like doing my assignments than rather than speaking with someone else on the phone   correct  because it 's not worth you know it 's not worth doing did did were you provided a reading list this semester a list of uh literature of books that uh uh you have to uh uh uh yeah uh no actually uhm uhm uhm most of our teachers they didn 't ano they don 't assign books i mean they don 't give us some uh list of books of which we can use no they just you know let us they will just ask us to read uhm or to find a book which fits the topic that he is giving us but not necessarily  he is giving this particular book for us to read aside from mr flores he gave he always he is always giving us references so that is good for us i i uh at least we can uhm you know we can have these references with us unlike you know cramming and looking for   something   uh   uh-hmmmh   okay   have you ever checked any of those references yes i did actually i just bought the other one what was that

ningning eight there were eight of us ahh so you were eight how did you find the movie it was disappointing why very disappointing how come many went to see that film because the story the story in the movie was very different from the story in the book ahh in the book so it means you have read the book . yes is it right that there are three books no ma'am there there are five books now ahh five books five books i guess uh i think it 's the other story what story is that that there are three books uh uh lord of the rings yeah i remember ahh yeah right lord of the rings it 's already complete right the three the three books are were already shown yes in the movies have you seen all the three no because i didnt i dont like lord of the rings   i think it 's too dark  uh  uh why did you say you were disappointed in harry potter because the story was very unlike the story in the book ahh so   there were many changes ahh there are many changes if you havent read the book you wouldnt understand the movie uh-huh so that 's it what about troy have you seen it troy uhm not yet not yet anyway you know the story but if you are a fan of brad pitt for sure you 'll go to see the movie  chuckle   i 'm not  you 're not okay you see my co-teachers went to see that movie  i think there were   have you seen it ma'am  ten of them your former teachers teachers in the old building they went to see that movie last last week  tell me about your classmates my new classmates yeah your new classmates most of my classmates came from private schools ahh private schools yes how would you assess your performance  uhm i 'm just starting to get the feel of college life uhm or   so i havent havent recited that much yet   in my class  uhm  how do you find it is it really different from high school in a way it 's different in what way 'coz you 're not really pressured to recite uh-huh unlike in high school the teacher would call one by one and you have to recite in college if you dont want to recite you dont have to  unlike in high school  you dont have to   yes  but how will you be evaluated as a student  uh   is it not a part of the grading system i think mostly it 's the test the test yes uhm how many units did you enroll uh fifteen units only why fifteen are you not underload no  why   uh the load in u p is very unlike the load of la salle and ateneo because it 's lower  ahh ahh it 's lower so fifteen units is the regular load uh yes ahh okay  word high school unlike in uh the other universities i think there unlike in la salle it 's twenty-nine twenty-nine yeah it 's twenty-nine and in some universities i think the regular load for students is twenty-six ma'am i cant hear you  twenty-six  ahh you cant hear me i think the the regular load for other universities is twenty-six twenty-four something like that i think it 's in p l m it 's twenty-nine uh twenty-nine also yeah because jescel 's course in p l m is nursing uh-hum and her load is twenty-nine units twenty-nine units yes what are your courses or subjects uh natural science wow history communications math math one social science p e and n s d p how many subjects all in all does each subject have three units each no no how many only two uhm i think it 's math and science has have three units ahh three units the others one or two ahh really you mean to say even the subject i i what 's that uh communication yeah it it you mean there 's only one unit for that subject yes ma'am uhm how come it 's different from the other universities i think i 'm not sure uh you 're not sure  anyway   pero i i know it 's only one unit it 's only one unit and how much did you pay for my course it 's five thousand twelve five thousand yes five thousand twelve uh-huh for for the first sem for the first sem you have two semesters yes ma'am uh-huh by the way somebody asked me this morning 'no  some students in v mapa regarding uh upcat upcat yeah the deadline for the submission is on june eighteen june eighteen so that is on what date is today friday fifteen sixteen i think it 's a friday friday uh-huh by the way how much is the application form uh three hundred three hundred pesos ahh so when you took the upcat it was three hundred pesos  but i heard a different number  yes  i think it 's three fifty now three fifty now yeah three fifty that 's why some students you see they they 're having problem now with you see three fifty that 's already big amount 'no  i thought that sections one and two have already done their forms yeah i heard from ninang that since last may   they were there and they were arranging for their forms to be finished  uh-huh  ahh so they 're they 're almost done with their forms  yeah i heard from ninang  how did you find the test last year it was easier  ow  yeah compared with compared to that of la salle and ateneo ahh so because the math in in the upcat it 's in filipino ahh it 's in filipino  yes it has two forms  uhm  the one part is in english and the other part is in filipino  uy that 's good  hmmmh   they really uh   so those who 're not that good in math they 'll really understand hmmmh u p is really promoting 'no the filipino language actually i think 'no uh mathematics now is really taught in filipino is it in u p or no ma'am it 's in english uh it 's in english the only subjects that are that is in filipino in our school is kasaysayan   kasaysayan   kasaysayan   kasaysayan uh-hmmmh we 're encouraged to speak filipino instead of english how do you find your professors my favorite professor uhm i think will be my history prof really because she 's very lively lively and she makes kasaysayan ng pilipinas  interesting interesting by   you wont be bored ahh you wont be bored yeah uh how what 's the approach she just takes it as as if she 's only telling a story yes  ha  as if she 's only telling stories hmmmh unlike in high school my favorite teachers were english teachers speaker a chuckles my en my english teacher she 's very strict  really  strict i 'm very sorry but she 's very strict really yeah she 's very bo boring she 's boring really yes ma'am  wh why did you say that she 's boring i dont know because is she bookish i mean does she depend on books no why very unlike very unlike hmmmh is she old no she 's not that old hmmmh i i think many u p profes professors are very young right she 's very young actually ma'am she 's very young uh very young because the last time i attended a seminar at la salle our speaker then was a very young professor and at that time  she doesnt smile that much   ha  she doesnt smile that much ahh really she doesnt smile she doesnt smile at all i think really and for the whole period uh uh  just like today  why   uhm uhm uh-hmmmh we did so many activities so you had english today yeah  today is my day for english  uhm uh-hmmmh does she give regular quizzes yeah she does ma'am uh she does and everything is graded everything is graded everything is graded from homeworks to seatworks   really  just like in the high school laughter  it 's like in the high school at least in college we dont have to write yeah really you 're right uh actually in college you will not be forced to take down notes no you will not be forced to recite you said you write but you see uh reciting or recitation helps a lot in but in math we are obliged to write  uh-hmmmh  uh you are obliged to write yes uh-hmmmh uh so you 're enjoying your math laughter   no   why did you lau  no you still dont so they   my professor my professor in math was the professor of my brother when he was a freshie ahh so   and he knows my brother  and he expects that i will be good in math as well i would like to raise my hand and tell him sir dont expect anything from me i 'm not good in math chuckle at all   so  at all speaker b laughs  so you already have uh enough background about the professor through your brother actually my brother said he 's nice uh he 's nice i think he 's our relative again he 's our relative relative  daw  oh speaker b laughs  really i 'm not sure according to my brother my lola told him that mister regaspi that 's the name of my professor mister legaspi regaspi  re   re regaspi yes uh-huh his name is george allen regaspi is our relative from from my in my father 's side uh-hmmmh what time do you usually leave your house it depends ma'am 'coz uhm mondays and thursdays my first class would be eight thirty so normally i would leave the house at seven ten uhm but on tuesdays and fridays my class starts at ten oclock so i leave at nine nine ten are your rooms at u p air-conditioned yes all of our rooms in u p are air-conditioned hmmmh although some do not work uh-huh by the way how 's your mom my mom  she 's okay  yeah  she 's breathing chuckle  uh so no one in the family got sick these past few days uh fortunately none ma'am oh that 's a blessing because many people got sick these past few days because of the weather right we 're very healthy people laughter  actually even if you 're heal healthy with the kind of weather we 're having these days you see you will really be sick in the morning till noon it 's very hot then at night when people are about to to go home suddenly it would rain right uhm classes will start on june twenty-one right ma'am yeah uh on monday  hay hannah we 're so bored in school  you know   i 'm guessing that your high school students are bored we teachers are bored i mean what do you do at school aw would you believe we were required to to clean last week monday and tuesday and then just these past two days we had a seminar uh yeah i hea i heard from ninang  that you had a seminar nga  oh what did your ninang tell about the seminar she was very inspired by the talks ahh inspired   by the mass even by the priest because she she said that ano it teaches the teachers to have a better relationship with students okay really that 's good actually of the two speakers yesterday i really liked the the second one it 's doctor sayo uh her talk is really inspiring it 's about professionalism and actually i i got much from her sharing you see the experiences she had when she was an elementary and high school teacher ahh yeah the one who was given the scholarship ahh really by the nun by the nun the nun or the teacher oh i 'm not sure uh but you see uh some teachers just didnt mind the seminar i mean some teachers didnt uh take the seminar seriously it 's a pity to think that the staff planned an activity like this and still they wouldnt mind at all they wouldnt yeah some teachers kept on talking at the back even if they 're seated in front they would just talk speaker b chuckles   it 's a shame  it 's a shame that 's why this afternoon when mrs bernardo closed uh i think before she closed during the evaluation she really 'no cant help it but  they didnt appreciate the talk  she told them she told the group that most teachers were not listening

it 's just too what it 's just too uh what dyou call this so toxic everything the traffic is bad you know the environment is uh messed up it 's not a good place to raise children oh yeah but  okay well uh honestly i cant relate 'coz i 've never i dont have a province you know and i 've never lived in one for any period of time well then manila is your province exactly so this is as provincial as i can get chuckle yeah but i do i can see from what point of view you 're coming from when you talk about simple life and simple desires and simple needs yeah but i 'd think that you know you 'd have you 're given the opportunity and you have so much potential going for you you should utilize that yeah but the thing is i could make my own opportunity when i 'm there well it 's not just about manila you know you know i 'm not saying that i just dont want you to sit back and relax and do farming that 's my point chuckle  do what farming yeah you know raise carabaos or chuckle what  chuckle  you 're so lame you know you have this this this concept of a province as if it were a a barrio or an undeveloped place what did you want me to think you see that 's it okay you fine correct my perception what am i supposed to think i i dont even know which province you come from you know what that 's your bias so it 's not a bias yes it is it 's my ignorance  chuckle  it 's not a bias at all  chuckle  there 's a difference nah okay never mind chuckle  anyway i 'll i 'll send you off to bed thank you very much for participating in this little experiment of pauline hi pauline hi pauline 
Philippines	what do you want to talk about i dont know what do you want to talk about how are you na  i 'm okay i 'm okay how 's life with you life uhm be more specific what do you want to know how 's your how 's your personal married life na nawala that that uh uh can we not talk about that laughter  are you still married  ha  are you still married yes i still am are you still with the guy no what guy i dont know chuckle  who 's the guy your your your your husband no i 'm not with him anymore i i told you that already yeah i know i know oh anyway have you been talking to james  no i have not why what 's new you know what there 's this common friend kasi of me and  bianca okay   okay  we have a common friend do you know sam i think i introduced you to him a long time ago when we were still in college e  what 's his name sam sam okay you told me pa nga that he looks so chinese  e  okay that he 's so chinese ganyan  uh-hmmmh okay so anyway i have met sam like uh two months ago we had coffee in uh in robinson 's okay and then ever since he 's been texting me you know asking me to meet up and then he 's been telling me a lot of things about james  a lot of bad things about james   uh-hmmmh  like what bad things well you know like uhm you know before kasi  it was him and bianca e  yeah okay they were an item and then suddenly james came into the picture and started telling bad things about sam about sam to the people in bianca 's dormitory oh really yeah okay so yun that is basically what we 've been talking about and it 's not as if i dont have any uhm uh you know it it 's not really hard to believe because i 've never seen james sober  e you get me sober hey what do you mean it 's it 's like he 's always mad he 's always angry he 's always he 's temperamental you know so it 's not very hard to believe things that sam told me about  james   uh-huh  okay and by the way yes this is what he claimed ha  yes he has been seeing james around every time in social gatherings so i was just wondering if you have been talking with james i havent talked to james for a long time as in this i thought you 're best of friends we are but you know when you 're you 're in you 're working you 're in business you tend to drift away because busy with the business i dont really meet up with a lot of friends anymore  james for two thousand and four i think i met up with him once or twice lang  and then what did you talk about  wala lang parang sandali lang i mean we maybe we just buy d v ds i tell him to buy d v d for me and then he brings it to my office or brings it to my home and that 's it we dont even get to meet you know you didnt talk about bianca  no the only thing i know is that bianca is in china  and   i was the one who told you that no yeah he told me that also and he and he visited bianca  he was supposed to visit i didnt know if he he visited bianca last month uh so he did in china so he did yeah so natuloy 'yon speaker b chuckles  i didnt

does it feel to be elbow to elbow with the big men come on well they 're not that big big boss but they are medyo me kabigatan na boss so you know okay na yun  i get to talk with all the material managers they were here from the five breweries so that was okay why do you always have to meet up with them i mean words  it 's was a rare opportunity for them to come here all of them and uh uh so

house  ah ganun  she came to my office uh she went to your room daw e  office yun  uh that 's an office uh office yun yeah okay i think it was the office not house  e i was thinking why do you always

's maintaining it 's maintaining maintenance and then you just meet up to have lunch ganun  and then you pay for everything yeah well that 's part of business and then they really order yeah of course

i bad i dont feel happy for bianca  well i dont know i never i will never like james for her never i dont know i dont know words i dont know  palibhasa best friend mo yun  no i i dont know talaga e  i mean i really dont know oh what when is she coming back from china five months from now that 's the end of her contract  temp uh temp temporarily permanently uh well i dont know if she

back here and then go back i really i really dont know her plans right now but she 's it 's the end of her contract in five months okay and she told me she 's missing james very much so probably she 's going home okay uhm you know mushy stuff that she 's been talking about every time we email each other uh-hmmmh but she told me she 's really popular there ha uh yeah yeah that 's what she told me well bianca has uh you know has a look has has the uma thurman look ha  no i think uh i guess uh i guess ha and this is also her her guess because of the fact that she can speak english well not all chinese can do that not many chinese can do that and then she 's very young uh-hmmmh and she 's an english teacher already and uhm i think she has this uhm look that somehow pleases chinese men you know the the  bianca is pretty you know not for not for many races not for many what not for some cultures  talaga  because i have i have uh introduced bianca to some men that i 've met uh who are not either chinese or filipino and they dont find her pretty oh really yeah okay okay she 's okay i mean she 's pretty but uh there are a lot more prettier girls but she is above average pretty which is important speaker b chuckles  you just have to be above average then you know there will always be guys chasing after you hmmmh if you 're average lang uh you know you 're you 're not always in the loop but if you are above average then uhm you know every now and then you have a new guy uh courting you wanting to be your friend etcetera etcetera oh yeah okay james is just one damned lucky guy to have her well you know maybe because he 's a bad person

you 're not exactly you know bleeding or anything oh oh oh what does he look like i mean describe his head   words gonna look like a lab the dog 's trainer vanderbilt 's trainer thinks that she 's a lab  o and then but alam mo 'yung she has these  topak moments yeah  na she suddenly just lunges at you as in ferocious ha   talaga  yeah  strange   labs dont do that oh then you should meet lancelot  ha  you should meet my dog why lancelot oh  'yon pure breed 'yon   di ba i mean they 're they 're not like that i 've been looking for a mate i 've been telling you  hay naku  it 's so hard to it 's so hard to find a word  for my dog  ay naku you know what what uhm not mate-wise ha pero i found the best vet ever where mandaluyong where in mandaluyong ah you know what i cant remember exactly where but what 's the word mandaluyong what 's the name of the ano  the name of the vet is doggie land doggie land yes and you know what as in when guggenheim was like really bad we brought him lang to our vet here in the village  oo  and talagang i really felt so bad it was so strange ha because our whole family was sick including guggen what ás in jason was sick i was sick why karen was sick why the maid the cook wasnt feeling well  o  and guggenheim was sick as in the whole family and then we brought him to the vet  o   pina-confine namin kasi high fever oh my god  o and then so when i was feeling better  pssst  my dogs are barking oh i heard i hear i was feeling better na and then guggen all  parang he was deteriorating  baka naman he 's old now how old is guggenheim well he 's only what seven eight   pssst only what he 's like seven years old that 's old no but by dog barking word live to like thirteen well yeah eleven to thirteen  di ba  yeah so we brought him uh we moved him out of my vet because i was so dissatisfied and i brought him to this doggie land nga   o   wow alam mo 'yung when you watch on animal planet  yeah in the it 's really like that vet well  ganon  maybe i should go there as in they have complete with pure oxygen for your dog  talaga  they intubated him really pure oxygen they gave him all sorts of you know uh drugs to help you know stabilize him they gave him a cold drip because high fever he had high fever uh-huh they gave him sponge parang 'yung ice bath yeah as in  galing   talagang galing galing  so what what was he sick with you know they they told us that i can hear karen yeah it seems like kidney failure  ay my god did you give him ano he had pedigree before did you give him pedigree we gave him pedigree before  ay you know i 'm scared na  because i gave my dog also that e  yeah and apparently before that that scare nga with pedigree came out there were already dogs who were dying because of kidney failure yeah 'yun na nga  i 'm scared na e  yeah dont dont na  no i i i stopped na after pero  he 's had like you know one or two sacks already oh and eto ha  what the vet said was it 's very difficult to diagnose so just keep your eyes open for 'yung symptoms  oo  parang guggen had the symptoms we just didnt know like he 's always thirsty always thirsty always thirsty oh my dog 's not always thirsty the and parang they lose their their desire to play well no well not my dog yet  'yung oh no no not not not lose their desire but the their tolerance for activity exercise gets diminished  talaga  yeah so look out for that oh no and and oh my god he had those oh no  pero ang yung kay guggen what was really strange pa about it was the night before he got sick  oo  he was jumping around yeah yeah like  oh no   word  well i 've been wanting to ano i 've been wanting to have my dog checked but my my vet naman said you know it 's not really that ano naman it wasnt that uhm what do you call that they 're not sure of that really uh-uhm that it it that the food was really causing the ano and like you know my my vet was like you know uh the the shots that you like the anti-rabies di ba  yeah distemper whatever yung ganon apparently there are other injections that my dog wasnt getting yeah yeah like what like there 's this thing for the gleptospiro  leptospirosis yeah yeah yeah there 's a shot for that why not who 's what what 's that vet doing i dont know what what my vet has that my vet 's incredible that 's so sad this this little woman who who can like stick her hands inside the dog 's mouth  oo  oh my god no as in i was shocked he was giving he was giving lancelot ano what do you call that yung heart guard  oo  or or yung and and yung for  de for deworming and stuff like that  yes yes  so she she gets she gets the tablet breaks it into into little pieces  oo okay and slams it down you know lancelot 's throat as in like oh my god wont he bite you  then then she said it depends on the dog she doesnt do that for pitbulls and dobermans yeah dobermen chuckle dobermans  ayun   hay sobra kaming depressed when ano  when that happened as in  oo  i cried so you have a new dog not yet i 'll give

Philippines	yeah hello jimmy  how are you hello what are you doing i 'm fine i 'm just sitting here doing nothing uh-hmmmh uh-hmmmh uh-hmmmh uhm i called up just to you know ask you something  i is that fine with you that 's okay with me uh okay because you see last time we saw each other where is that in uhm what 's the name of that coffee shop again uh starbucks no it 's not starbucks the other one uhm in ha in where is that figaro uh yeah figaro   yeah figaro and i i told myself i really wanna sit down with jimmy one day and just ask him anything under the sun you know okay i find you very interesting giggle  same here okay so uh-hmmmh what are you busy of these days nothing really except that i 'm working on my paper and my thesis oh yeah i heard so when will be your colloquium well supposedly this term i think next month that is in august oh good luck then huh yes good luck thank you very much i need that okay i know you can do that i 'm sure you 're very good and with sterling around i 'm sure you can do it okay anyway and of course after that one what 's your plan  uh-huh uh-huh  well i plan to conduct it already so that i would have the results by by december  and i 'll start writing hopefully submit the final paper by march of next year  uh-huh  oh that 's good  so you are very focused  thank you  oh as always you are very organized  thank you   systematic and focused so that means by next school year we will be classmates in the p h d i still don 't have any plans for p h d you mean not for now uh-hmmmh uhm what about words  uh i just i 'll see what will happen uh-hmmmh so you want to what spend perhaps your life with more exciting things uh nothing exciting for the moment  not no no no ideas for now  uh-hmmmh  uh okay so what would you like to ask me  chuckle i i saw one time all about your what 's that arts what 's that your drawings sketches sketches   yes oh yes so why why aren 't you doing sketches anymore this time to be quite honest with you my schedule is very busy uh-hmmmh and uh it requires a lot of uh focus time and hard work so it 's almost impossible to release it down to sketch  uh-hmmmh  i see plus the fact that i have a lot of papers to check and a lot of students to meet oh i understand yes usually what mood do you need so that you can start any sketch i i can 't exactly define the mood but it 's it 's just when it occurs it 's there and then you you sort of sit down but it 's it comes regularly when when when uh you you start doing it so it goes on and on for a month or so i see but if you talk about mood in terms of days and any time of the year it 's almost impossible i see i see but do you need let us say uhm do you need say a bottle of beer or a cup of coffee to keep you going or something like that  no  not necessarily oh not necessarily so what prompts you to let 's say get your paper and pencil and uh start sketching sometimes i see other people 's work and uh  uh-hmmmh something comes up in my head and uh sometimes i say oh i can do something like this or i can i think i can do something better than this or i think i have an idea brewing somewhere so that 's it   i see  what about love is it a good motivator you think love uhm it 's never worked for me oh oh why  uhm that 's something unusual uh i thought for artists it 's  sometimes  i cannot recall any instance in the past where love was really an inspiration for you know a force in my work but it 's very hard to really explain what what would be an inspiration it 's just that you have an itch inside you and you wanna do it you wanna sketch and that 's it it doesn 't have to come from anyone it doesn 't have to come from anywhere it just occurs  uh really  i see i see what about if you are depressed i 'm sorry if if you are depressed depressed   sometimes depression yes uh-hmmmh depression is is uh is a driving force it 's quite powerful in fact because you   even more powerful than love you find a way of expressing the you know the frustrations the depression the negative feeling and sometimes they come out in in work either in sketches so oh yeah if you could consider you could consider it uh a force as well to reckon with oh so have you sketched uh anything before in which you were depressed  uhm yes in fact when i was raped when you were raped laughter you were raped i want you to expound on that what do you mean uh physically emotionally when you are when you are violated oh that 's what you mean for the first time you cannot sleep you wake up at three in the morning staring at the ceiling wow i can imagine uh-huh and it 's hard to talk to people because people are not always  you think people are not always understanding and open to your you know experiences and you just keep to yourself and you don 't know where to run for help oh oh you sound very emotional  so  drawing and sketching can be a very good release uh-hmmmh some of the negative vibes vibrations that you get from very unpleasant experiences i understand uh-hmmmh you sound very emotional today speaker b laughs  jimmy huh well i 'm just a little bit serious today that 's all i have a back that 's killing me  laughter oh yeah i understand so when do you plan to i mean get another sheet of paper and start  uh   uhm maybe when i retire that 's about ten years from now oh don 't tell me you 'll go back to sketching only when you retire yes because i want to sit comfortably in a nice house uh-hmmmh in a garden perhaps where i don 't have to think about checking papers  laughter wow  talking to students who are begging me to change their grades  speaker a chuckles or i have to put up with with a p h d you know p h d courses none of those things uh so are you telling me that you don 't really consider taking p h d course  i 'm not saying   i mean in the years to come i 'm closing my doors to that it could be okay i can consider that as an option okay but it 's not like it 's not like it 's number one in my list uhm what about love life love life i haven 't had one in a long time you have any suggestions  chuckle oh speaker b chuckles  you want uh what a blunt answer to that well i 'm not too sure it 's good to discuss that on the phone maybe over a cup of coffee sometime  chuckle   yeah   true true  yeah i look forward to that i look forward to that okay that 's interesting you know uh-hmmmh uh what about you   talking about love life i i think it 's nice to have one yeah you were telling me you have not had that love life for quite sometime already what about well how can you have a love life if you sit on a desk   facing a lot of books a lot of people who talk about theories  uhm  but you can always insert that in your busy schedule dear yes but if you 're so busy you have no time to go to the  burol or the funeral or you have no time to go to the malls and you have no time to gimmick so how do you expect to meet people  uhm  so how do you but i 'm trying to think about that now lately it 's been it 's probably time for me to start you know  relaxing a bit uh-hmmmh uh-hmmmh so finally  okay so what prompted you to at least have that idea again well i think i need some time for myself any 1 word  not could you suggest one oh i 'll tell you over a cup of coffee as i said a while ago yes i think that cup of coffee is is is well anticipated uh true true uh anyway uh so what will you do after this one after what after aft uh yeah our conversation  after  well i 'm going straight to the hospital and get my examination because my back has been killing me for three or four days i can hardly move and it 's painful  i see  yeah last saturday you also complained about that right exactly it 's been chronic uh which is why i went to see a doctor yesterday uh i hope that 's not because of old age chuckle  well it definitely has nothing to do with old age i think i see probably something else fatigue overwork perhaps i i can 't tell i don 't really know that 's already a sign that you have to give yourself a break yeah relax wind up go somewhere uh-hmmmh so uhm tomorrow uhm is thursday  o saturday what do you plan to do on saturday saturday i have work to do again work yes i have to teach a group of students uh so   so we have to make a little our ends meet i see  what students   well actually  we have to earn a little spending money uh what students from here from la salle   no they 're from they 're filipinos actually professionals oh i see   they want to gain some confidence in speaking english oh i see my job is just you know give them well practice opportunities to speak english and give them some strategies and teach them how to convey ideas in a very systematic way oh so these are all professionals yes that 's correct oh so you are making money during weekends   not really  actually just barely enough to make ends meet i see i see   i 'm not really after so much money pay my bills yes oh oh uh sundays   sun   sundays  i don 't know usually i just stay home but that ' s the perfect time to relax  i usually go to the malls you don 't go to the malls did you say that i do go to the malls and look for books  uh i see books yes books i like books uh-hmmmh uh what about movies do you do you ever do do you ever look for books yourself yeah i do i do but lately you know i 've been reading this children 's lit i enjoy it because of my son  i see   it 's all about harry potter   so does he read already pardon does he read already yeah yeah he he reads but for now i i read it for him  uh-hmmmh   okay because it 's all about harry potter but how young is your son four and a half going to five actually four and a half going to five  yeah   i see   go going to five okay so he loves actually stories like like that of harry potter so i need to know actually the whole story so i can tell him i can relate to him  you mean you read him harry potter yeah he likes it even without pictures without pictures he loves actually the names you know he would you know repeat the names when i say say i see hermione granger and then he would also say hermione granger actually just the names of the characters and the names of the places he you know he is fascinated with them i see oh that 's interesting to know yeah uhm i like my son to be uhm what uhm a book worm later  chuckle  okay oh what about sundays you mean you go to the malls just to look for books  what about relaxing   yes sometimes i i i like to walk around that 's my my mean my my form of exercise where do you usually walk around well anywhere in the malls also in the mall makati sometimes uh-hmmmh  what 's your favorite mall  when there 's no trouble i go as far as south mall in laon in in uh las pinas las piñas ah true so what 's your favorite mall my favorite is robinson 's place robinson 's place what is in robinson 's that 's not in it 's the people that are there  uh yeah true the people 
Philippines	yes are you there yes oh how are you doing i 'm fine thank you how about you uhm i 'm not not not really fine why so exhausted you know why what did you do uhm just through with our last subject with semantic analysis dear uh-huh and we had a quiz after that uh i was the presenter i had a report uh-hmmmh how was your report uhm quite good quite well just alright i was not able to finish the presentation i had to cut it because it was already time uh i was able to present only about half of of all the slides that i prepared oh really and you know the l c d didnt work you know you really cant count on these i t gadgets and all these stuffs it didnt work and so i asked my my classmates or good we were only around nine nine or ten to just compress around the laptop  uh-huh  uh-huh and then they were they were actually craning just to see the the screen okay   uh-huh  so they had difficulty looking at your visuals  yeah true true but at least they enjoyed they enjoyed the presentation i guess  well i guess   yeah well dear you 're a total performer oh thank you dear  anyway   you 're welcome  and so that 's why at this very moment i i 'm so exhausted i really wanna eat or wind up or go somewhere uh-huh i think i 'm kinda hungry too oh what about uh robinson 's uh cinnzeo yes words  yeah i wanna indulge ice cream or cake or coffee or just plain coffee uh-huh what do you think that would be great oh yeah i love their cinnamon roll oh i i kinda uh what i 'm smelling it already the the cinnamon wow yeah the butter and the chocolate the nuts  and the butter  and the and then while while drinking coffee we 'll talk about semantics giggle  oh yeah and pragmatics yeah your presentation about semantics yeah uhm okay you know what 's that i wanna i wanna wa watch a film but oh my god it 's what 's this it 's still metro manila week right yeah it 's the manila film fest uh the manila film festival yeah and no english films being shown  nada none  ha  so of course i wouldnt watch volta or whatever  chuckle but i heard it 's the top grosser so far which one volta yeah volta oh okay so pathetic anyway uhm hey uhm speaking about films which reminds me you know what i i where where did i see that i think it 's in the internet i i i read something like a review of the troy the movie remember that brad pitt troy yeah yeah i 've watched it too oh but of course i was a bit confused with the you know uhm the introduction or something about troy actually the background perhaps you can shed light you know you 're the authority here when it comes to literature uh-hmmmh uh-hmmmh uh well actually that movie is a compressed version of different literary works what what different you mean it was not only based from iliad no the iliad talks about the tenth year of the war up to the death of hector oh oh that 's something new huh oh yeah uh-huh but even prior to that there were already works that pertained to the gods the goddesses and the heroes of troy and greece uh-hmmmh uh-hmmmh maybe what the producers of the movie troy did was they compressed everything into a single commercialized film with a romantic plot and all the works oh yes oh yes  words to impress viewers so they would enjoy it uh-hmmmh uh-hmmmh and there were a lot of differences words    yeah actually there were a lot of what  differences okay well what i know only is the iliad i i dont know the one you were telling me is that it was based from many works so aside from iliad uh-hmmmh uhm so what there were there are some confusing parts there like uh uh a lot of them were able to escape from troy is that true no that 's not true because isnt it it 's only ae what 's that aeneas right aeneas yeah the father and his son were the only men who escaped from troy that 's according to iliad no no not that 's not in the iliad uh-hmmmh the later work by a greek poet oh i see but according to iliad it was only aeneas who was able to escape right uh-huh uh-huh the women they were the women they all became concubines of the greeks oh briseis briseis became also a concubine you mean briseis briseis i forgot the love interest of of achilles achilles uh did she die at the end i dont remember anymore uh briseis in the movie she didnt die uh-hmmmh she escaped right yeah she was able to escape the pillaging of the troo of the greeks but in the in greek literature i forgot what happened to her  uh-huh  oh i see okay and what what else uhm who who is now the character of legolas what was the character being paris paris paris what about paris wasnt that the start actually the start of the troy like uhm of course he abducted helen right he abducted helen and uh took her to troy yeah was it was it like that in in iliad yeah it was also like that no because in the film i remember in the film uh uh like uh paris and helen were like romantically linked right but in the original version in iliad helen was actually given to paris as a gift oh yeah by aphrodite  yeah  by aphrodite yeah okay or or what 's this it 's not actually a gift or a bribe  for choosing her as the for choosing her as the most as the fairest woman yeah her words hera and athena yeah athena but in the film okay uhm it it looks like paris and helen had what had an affair an illicit affair and so yeah because in the in greek literature when paris came to sparta uh-huh menelaus wasnt there so he had the chance to abduct helen uh-hmmmh but in the movie he saw there menelaus and hector  yeah  they were all in sparta but actually it 's not true oh it didnt really happen oh i see okay uhm another part in the film that which i enjoyed not really i enjoyed or which i remember uh-hmmmh based from the iliad is the fight between hector and achilles oh yeah how did you find that yeah that was sexy right   it 's a very realistic portrayal what about the what about the performance of achilles there like or or achilles or he was he was kinda dancing yeah they were like dancing flamingoes chuckle  okay it was like what it was like a choreographed fight a choreographed fight i i was supposed to say that a choreographed fight uh-huh uh-huh okay and then in the original version achilles was supposed to drag the body of hector inside uh troy right inside the walls of troy right no it was uh when patroclus was killed by hector they created a funeral pyre for him uh-huh and then when achilles killed hector he dragged the body of the body to their camp to the greek camp that 's already in the film but in the original version around troy no no not around troy around the walls dragged hector 's body around patroclus ' funeral fire oh i see   funeral pyre for eleven days i see i see okay uh-huh but originally i mean did the did the father of priam did king priam really retrieve the body of hector in the original version he was able to go to the greek camps because hermes helped them hermes is the messenger of the gods yeah yeah hermes of course i remember yeah he was able to cloak priam oh  disguise him so he was able to go to achilles ' camp uh-huh but in the movie the gods were absent none of them were there yes yes yes which makes the movie realistic right okay because there were no gods or or goddesses in the film right there wa there was a uh mention of it okay but just a mention right they didnt appear that 's the liberty of the director to do what he wants so that the movie will be commercially viable uh-hmmmh oh true uhm okay so that 's all about troy i 'm waiting actually for the spiderman two i am waiting for that one too   oh what about uh watching it together or with tina perhaps what about that oh sure uhm i 'm sure we 'll enjoy watching it well that is of course if we dont have assignment in our subjects or if i wont be preparing   or we have no paper to check  yeah no paper to check or if we have no reports or no research work you know uh-hmmmh uhm uhm okay what is this where 's tina do you know where tina is i think she 's reading a book oh book all about i dont know i cant she 's reading a book again we just came from our classes and we read uh a great deal again of of what all about concepts and ideas and she 's reading a book again what could that be uh she wants words  actually i havent i havent started the harry potter five  uh-huh   as much as i want to it 's there on my table have you seen it yeah it 's so thick how can i start it i still have what i still have one report to do in semantics i still have to do a paper in corpus oh i cant afford to read anymore book five of harry potter   although i really want to   so reading for you has become reading  has become a luxury for you  harry potter is  oh yeah yeah chuckle  i do it while i 'm in the bus you know uh-huh or while i 'm inside the c r yeah  oh   that 's when i can read okay uh-huh but when i 'm here in school or in the class oh i have to check paper or read assignments or review or what do a paper oh or stuff like those well my friends also collect harry potter books and they think they enjoy it i dont know why because i havent read any of the harry potter   i was telling you already to start reading them maybe you can convince me to read them words oh i 'm always doing that one dear laughter  i 'm just telling you to start reading laughter okay i dont know i cant find any reason to read   you have to start with harry potter one what about the first book or what you can do perhaps is to watch the film first i can lend you one and two i have them with me one and two the film and then uh read books one and two and then you compare and you 'd love also three harry potter three uhm the harry potter four is already very thick  but have you   i have seen harry potter one but i havent seen harry potter two but you have watched uh harry potter one yeah yeah   that 's still the best version of all uh in my own perception the harry potter two uhm not really the three i hate it  uh-huh   the three i think is the worst version the harry potter one is still the best uh-hmmmh yeah that 's my own perception anyway what else uh so when when will the regular showing resume like after this week we can already have english films maybe after gloria 's proclamation oh that means uh uh what july one un until uh thursday you mean maybe june thirty june thirty or july one uhm when is the what about the manila film festival uh what 's this now award awards awards night something like that i dont know i dont know the schedule but i think it will be held at the p i c c or c c p but uh when will that be what i 'm after actually is the star talk version of that  laughter the tigbak authority that 's why i 'm interested because if if the awards night is already finished that means i 'll i 'll have to watch the the star talk hey that 's today right the star talk is saturday  uh laughter  yeah today oh then i missed it i was oh my god you wont even be able to watch it next week because you also have a class oh i see oh yeah okay because i enjoy the kuwan you know  tigbak authority you know of the star talk okay especially when yeah i also enjoy the tigbak authority you know if the subject is all about the outfit during awards night i love that yeah chuckle  i 'm waiting for that and i was saying i was saying hey there 's another awards night and i look forward to the tigbak authority  version of this one yeah it 's really very funny uhm and i like the you know okray okrayan  part oh yeah anyway chuckle hey you wanna eat now okay oh where starbucks it 's it 's nearer than harrison 
Philippines	i will describe some of the methodologies used 'no so that you have an idea of what kind of research goes into these types of topics okay  now uhm i 'm not i i remember when i gave a talk last time i don't consider myself primarily a psycholinguistics a psycholinguist 'no  i 'm sort of a closet psycholinguist uh i i took courses with psych uh with psycholinguists but i never really established a uh continuous research program in psycholinguistics 'no  although i have always included language variables in my researches so actually the when i was trying to think of topics to write these were like my wish list the things i should have been doing but but uh maybe you would be in a stronger position to look at these topics uh i got interested in language research in psychology mainly because of the bilingual experience of filipino 'no  uhm and so my entry point into language research is bilingualism and uh most of the topics that i will be rattling off start off from bilingualism now uhm first there will be several clusters of topics here and the first thing that i thought you might find more interesting or you might be able to identify more easily is the implications of bilingualism to education we have a bilingual policy uhm the reality is most of the teachers code-switch in the classrooms many of our students are at least bi or almost all are at least bilingual many are multilingual uh polyglots 'no  uhm one question that has gotten a lot of attention is what is the consequence of using either the first language or the second language or the third language to learning to thinking in the education process uhm there have been studies and i 'm sure brother andrew talked about them of the consequences or the impact of bilingual education but as psychologists we have to focus on the more micro effects what i mean by that is how did using the child 's or the student 's first or second language affect his or her learning of a particular subject matter so it 's focused more on the individual 's uh learning or thinking 'no  now when we do that in cognitive psychology we tend to be very very focused in terms of the cognitive abilities involved for example since most of you are language teachers 'no you might be interested in reading uh how is it for example that students come to develop reading skills in filipino or english does it make a difference if we teach our young children to read in english or filipino or does it not make a difference at all you must have heard of some of the studies done in this line 'no  but uh what i want to start thinking of maybe is look at reading not as a global function but a unitary function look at reading as an activity that has many many different smaller parts for example reading actually involves at the most basic level word recognition pattern recognition this is a very perceptual process 'no  at a higher level it involves understanding meaning literal meaning of the text at an even higher level it involves making inferences it will also involve applying information things like that 'no  so some researches a student of mine for example looked at uh how i think she studied kindergarten or grade one children uh perform as regards these four levels of uh reading comprehension she found out that as far as uh uh word recognition was concerned what made a more important impact was the language used for teaching  and uh we think it 's because word recognition is primarily a perceptual process so if you have more experience with words in uh printed words in english you would be much better uh at recognizing them simply because you have more experience processing these types of words printed words when it came to comprehension literal inferential and applying information students always did better with their first language but these were early learners remember these are people who were just starting to read 'no  uh there were similar findings done by uh an ateneo researcher and this time she studied uh students with three languages cebuano english and filipino and the results were pretty much similar but she focused on comprehension comprehension was really better in the students' first language most of these studies have been done with early learners 'no  i am not familiar with them i 'm not familiar with other studies that look at higher level learners 'no  and uh maybe later on we can look at other variables a class interruption occurred  okay so i was talking about you know uh possible things i was just talking about reading 'no   yeah  uh and then you can think of other things that you might be interested in when looking at reading 'no  for example if you look at reading fiction you can look at uh whether students are better able to make inferences about motives of the character 'no  are they able to uh understand subtext or subplots better 'no  are they able better able to establish motivation certain events things like that 'no  uh are they better able to appreciate literary works are they better able to uh see nuances 'no in the narrative structure things like that this would be for more advanced students because earlier we were talking about early readers 'no  you can look at very specific things like how do they inter interpret symbols 'no  are they better able to to appreciate metaphor in their first language in their second language that 's just reading you can look at writing also 'no  are they are are they better able to uh do exposition in english or filipino there 's a lot of anecdotal evidence or or anecdotes from teachers who say that when their students write in their first language tends to be more tends to be richer tends to be more original and when they write in english they tend to be more clich&eacute; they tend to resort to stock phrases things like that  maybe these things need to be documented rather than just relying on stock or anecdotes 'no  you can look at their expressiveness maybe uh the range of techniques they use when they write is uh wider for one language or the other we don't know that yet we don't know these things 'no  you can also look at the depth of their ideas 'no  these are the kinds of things that you know people always talk about  that 's right  you know my student writes better and this and that but you know we have not done the research that will support these types of uh conjectures 'no  aside from the task we notice i was looking mainly at the task you can look at the variables related to the learner what do you mean by that well we all know not all bilinguals are alike 'no  there are so you can look at the types of bilinguals you have uh simultaneous bilinguals those who grew up listening to two languages or three languages you have additive bilinguals subtractive bilinguals 'no  you have multilinguals of course that that creates a totally different situation altogether so you can consider a range of variables related to the learner as regards bi level of proficiency 'no in l one and l two that might make a big difference 'no  you can consider things like level of knowledge of the subject area uhm i sometimes think that people who are experts in a field could not be as dependent on language 'no  they if if they know the subject matter very well they would not be as constrained when it comes to talking about these things 'no  so that 's one layer of studies that you can do just looking at whether it makes a difference to use english or filipino when it comes to these very specific aspects actually focus on language skills 'no  but if you look at how they do uh my work is in mathematics so i look at how these things affect mathematical tasks you can look at how they appreciate history you can look at how they appreciate uh their studies in religion 'no  this can apply to any of our uh subject matter  the methodology usually involves a simple comparison 'no  same group of subjects two sets of stimulus or two sets of tasks one in l one in l two or another in l three and then just compare the performance afterwards so it 's rather straightforward in terms of research design of course if you will if you will deal with the learner variable it will involve different groups and so you can then combine maybe learner variables with task variables more complicated research design there but you might get more rich information uh richer now another layer of studies still related to bilingualism and pushing it a bit higher is trying to find out not only what the differences are but trying to find out why those differences exist so let 's say they do better at appreciating metaphor in filipino then you might want to know why is it something about the filipino language is it something about their proficiency is it something about the text for example 'no  so it is not sufficient that we say students do better in english or in filipino the next step of studies would have the next step of studies would deal with the question why do we see these things 'no  because i always feel that why is always more convincing 'no  it is much more satisfying in terms of providing explanations of course this is much more difficult to do you have to generate hypothesis you have to try to get data either to verify or disprove your hypothesis but this is the fun part in my work in the area of math it 's trying to make sense of the pattern of the results that is always more it 's much more creative it 's much more challenging so i would be word  you know it 's everyone has an idea of why it 's better with one words  it 's a matter of testing it in ways in which you can you know reasonably conclude this hypothesis and not that hypothesis so and then another set of studies would be related to still related to the why but it will require a finer analysis of english and filipino as languages that would require well i suppose they have courses in linguistics english syntax like that 'no  yes by that i mean you can begin looking at the different structures of language or the two languages from the most basic the phonology  maybe that has something to do with it maybe the lexicon has something to do with it 'no  or maybe it 's the syntax that has something to do with it the most exciting studies in this area had looked into syntactic and semantic differences in l one and l two and predicting differential performance of learning oh who are these who are these uh oh uh there are actually few and far between uh i 'm trying to think of a study that would be illustrative  let 's see  you see many of the studies i don't understand laughter  because it 's a comparison of english and korean oo 'yon na nga 'yon na nga turkish and english but for example uh okay one of one professor i was working with was comparing spanish and english okay and spanish seems to have 'no uh this is i can't remember exactly what she has done she hasn't published it yet so i cannot but give me one minute i 'm sure i can give you an example  uh uh okay in italian in a lot of the romance languages they have gender markers for the verbs you know everything 'no  so in a set a sentence in uh in english would have maybe just one word that marks the gender in the same sentence in italian you 'd have three gender markers it marks the verb everything 'no  and so some people speculate that well does that make the italian reader uh more mindful of factors related to gender i don't i 'm not sure if that study has been done but i know someone has been talking about that something that has been sapir-whorf hypothesis 'no  yeah that 's it people are testing sapir-whorf in a very very fine-tuned way one very good demonstration and this one i understood laughter  uh this was done by people collaboration of american and hong kong psychologists 'no  and uh this is not related to literature in any way but it might be it turns out there are words in english that refer to personality constructs that we have a happy-go-lucky personality we have an extrovert 'no which embodies a set of personality traits okay it turns out there are no counterparts in chinese okay but in the chinese language they have also their own set of terms that correspond to a set of personality traits uh one term she gave refers to someone who is very creative outgoing but very close to the family 'no  it 's a different complex okay in a study they did they came up with a story which describes a person okay and from there you can infer the subjects were required to make an inference about the personality of the individual what other personality traits would this person have okay the same text was given to monolingual chinese monolingual english speakers bilingual english-chinese speakers  uh the chinese and bilingual speakers were from hong kong hong kong chinese the english speakers were british okay uh interesting first interesting comparison was that when they looked at the sets of traits inferred by the monolinguals they found a totally different set the ones who read the text in english the monolingual british speakers english speakers describe these people according to the english stereotypical term okay  the monolingual chinese described these results consistent with the chinese terms but they were reading the same story they were reading the same information but the constructs that were evoked were determined by which lexical units were activated but you might say well these were british compared to monolingual chinese in hong kong and if you know anything about hong kong the monolingual chi the monolingual chinese are probably not very cosmopolitan 'no  you might say it 's cultural differences 'no  so the interesting comparison now would be the bilinguals how could the bilinguals read the text in english half read it in chinese and you find the same difference uh it 's the language so there 's something it 's the language and so the same the bilingual the same pool of bilinguals they have the same culture pretty much homogeneous experience come up with a different personality description if they read it in chinese compared if when they read it in english  that 's a very powerful description 'no  uh i i 'm trying hard to think of a parallel study that can be done in the philippines and it 's it 's not something that i have enough time to think about no but some people have been thinking along these lines 'no  but something like that in that case it was the lexicon that they were looking at so there were lexical entries in english that did not have counterparts in chinese and vice versa and it had an impact on person perception and this is not far a far cry from inferring motives of uh fictional characters for example and there are other studies that relate to you know relating syntax most of these are extreme examples uh okay now i remember one there is this controversial set of studies done by bloom which bloom not harold bloom i think it 's harold bloom anyway but he he said that in the chinese language there is no conditional  if if   if  and he says because of that chinese speakers cannot reason with a condition oh my god something like that if x and y they cannot do that but it 's very basic in philosophy di ba  yeah something like that and he has some data showing that effect other studies have been trying to show you have bad data you know you did not phrase the chinese he was not a native chinese speaker so his phrasing was not appropriate and things like that 'no  so you you can extend it but that requires very fine knowledge of the language you know and the types of differences and the the thing is if you look at filipino based on tagalog the syntax is very different well they come from very different families 'no 
Philippines	the reason of immanuel kant thus far we have seen the uhm two kinds of knowledge or judgement according to source namely  a student answers with a very faint voice a priori and a posteriori  alright a priori and a posteriori  if you were asked to de to define the two types of knowledge how would you what is an a priori knowledge against an a posteriori knowledge  yes mister word   a priori knowledge is words  alright so it has something to do with what is the source of that knowledge where we uhm acquire this knowledge either from experience in which case it is a posteriori or from reason from the mind itself in which case it is a priori  we have also uhm seen that there are two kinds of judgement according to the relationship of a subject and a predicate and what are they  yes  either synthetic or analytic alright it could either be synthetic or analytic and how would you differentiate them uh yes  synthetic the predicate is words  alright so if the predicate is already contained in the subject you call it   students answer in chorus analytic  and if the predicate is not yet contained in the subject you call it synthetic could you give me examples first of an analytic proposition where the predicate is already contained in the subject yes a square has four equal sides pardon a square a square has four equal sides could you give me an example of a synthetic judgement  yes the triangle is small the triangle is small no matter how hard you look at the triangle you would study the concept of triangle it wouldn't tell you that whether it is uh big or small and so you must have gotten the idea of small somewhere else fine then combining the two the two classifications of knowledge we have uh the kinds of judgement how many kinds of judgement are there altogether there are three kinds of judgements namely yes  very faint voice uhm analytic a priori synthetic a posteriori and synthetic a priori  good so analytic a priori synthetic a posteriori and synthetic a priori  could you give me an example of the first an analytic a priori judgement utters the name of a student but unclear yes  very faint voice a circle is round  alright if i say a circle is round that is analytic a priori  could you explain why  first explain why it is a priori and not a posteriori then explain why it is synthetic or analytic or you can do it the other way around you can first start with why it is analytic and then why it is a priori  no one  yes uh sir uhm what do you call this uhm analytic because uh the predicate is is contained already in the subject alright the predicate is already contained in the subject true even if you remove the predicate just by looking at the subject circle you know right away it should be round okay so the predicate is already contained in the subject  then why is it a priori  uhm sir because uhm we already know that a circle is round from reason we don't have to go beyond reason beyond the concept itself okay we don't need experience to know that a circle is round the very concept the concept is uh is uh from the mind okay the very concept is close to the idea that it is round and so the source is uh not necessarily from from experience of course when i draw a circle on the board and i say look that circle it 's not really a circle is it that circle is small then it is from experience it is a posteriori  but if i just say a circle is round i don't mean any any circle in particular the circle is round the very definition of a circle then the source is reason itself it is a priori okay so uh we have the first type of judgement an analytic a priori judgement i don't think there is there is any uh great problem about analytic a priori judgement usually our definitions are analytic a priori judgements okay i don't think there is any much problem here there 's also not much problem about the second one synthetic a posteriori judgement could you uhm explain it uhm sir uhm right now the wall is green the wall is green okay the wall is green could you explain sir the predicate words  uh uhm so and why is it correct uhm words  yes so you don't if i cross out green if you just look at the concept wall you would never have guessed that it 's green so this is an expanding judgement you add something new to your subject wall  so this is synthetic okay and if the concept of green is not derived only from the subject then where could we have gotten it from experience and so the source is a posteriori not a priori okay so this an example of a synthetic judgement which is at the same time a posteriori  okay any questions now let me uhm could you give me examples of synthetic a priori a posteriori judgements there should be many synthetic a posteriori judgements sir the bag is full the bag is full yes another yes the car is red the car is red fine another  yes the room is big the room is big okay almost anything at at all that we talk about in everyday life i suppose is synthetic a posteriori judgement your our examples are very very basic examples but when you are for example talking about talking about somebody else if you know what i mean by that uhm you are murmuring something or well whenever you are indulging in that you are uhm actually forming synthetic a posteriori judgements okay so many judgements we do in ordinary life is synthetic a posteriori okay when we are trying to define a concept most likely we are doing analytic a priori judgement okay so these two are not problematic and so immanuel kant would center would focus his attention on the third type of judgement namely synthetic a priori judgement synthetic and so the predicate is not contained in the subject but a priori because the source of the expanding judgement the source of the new information is remarkably not experience but reason itself okay do you see the difference i would not be surprised if the source is experience okay but here the source is not experience the source is the mind itself how is it that the mind is able from itself to give rise forth knowledge a knowledge which is not taken from the subject only but rather is outside of it added to it expanding making our knowledge grow and yet the source is the mind itself remarkable okay but according to immanuel kant there are lots of examples of synthetic a priori judgement and in fact no theoretical science is ever without it if you care to open your text once again on page eight  roman number five   in all theoretical sciences of reason synthetical judgements a priori are contained as principles  so you cannot encounter any science any theoretical discipline which does not have anything to do with synthetic a priori judgement and so his examples are all from different disciplines so the first one is from mathematics starts writing on the board  the second one is from the natural sciences  and finally the third one is from metaphysics the intent of immanuel kant is to exhaust all sciences beyond the mathematical sciences mathematical mathematics beyond the mathematical sciences the natural sciences and metaphysics what other science is there this second one is supposed to include uh such disciplines as uh biology zoology astronomy physics all of them are incorporated in number letter b okay so let 's start with uh mathematics his example is okay, explain what his example is  students answer in chorus seven plus five  alright seven plus five is equal to twelve now before we uhm we uhm judge the correctness of immanuel kant 's intention let 's first try to find out for ourselves whether this is really a synthetic a priori judgement first is this synthetic yes why  why yes because the predicate is not contained in the subject because the predicate is not contained in the subject could you tell me which is the subject seven plus five  seven plus five is the subject and which is the predicate  students answer in chorus twelve  twelve  twelve is not contained in the subject seven plus five  what is contained in the subject  seven okay is contained in the subject plus is contained in the subject five is contained in the subject but not twelve  so that if i say seven plus five contains seven then that 's an analytic judgement if i say seven plus five has plus that 's an analytic judgement if i say seven plus five has five that 's an analytic judgement i just get it from the subject itself but when i say seven plus five is equal to twelve according to immanuel kant i will need intuition i will need intuition for me to be able to know that seven plus five is equal to twelve we are so used to seven plus five is equal to twelve that we don't think about it anymore but take the first that the child who is learning this mathematical formula for the first time okay when presented with seven plus five is equal to question mark the child who is facing this problem for the first time would not have guessed that the answer is twelve  i suppose he would use his fingers i suppose he would use sticks i suppose he would use dots or dashes okay and then afterwards he would count and counting them all he would arrive finally at the concept twelve okay so twelve does not come from the subject itself it is therefore synthetic judgement but is it a priori or a posteriori  yes mister word  sir uhm it is initially a posteriori  it is initially a posteriori  very good but then time goes on it it becomes it later evolves into a priori  alright but later it evolves into a priori  when was it when it was still a posteriori  when i was counting with my fingers when i was using sticks or apples or pebbles in counting them but later on when i don't use any more of these and i just say seven plus five is equal to twelve this is already a priori judgement okay so all knowledge begins with experience but it does not necessarily follow that it arises from experience initially in the beginning i need experience but look at the power of our mind sooner or later we we draw from all that we experience and we generalize we universalize we make our judgement necessary every time that you have seven added to five you will always have twelve necessity and universality and therefore you have an a priori and no longer an a posteriori judgement okay so far so good  now can we now move on to the natural sciences  can you give me the first example of kant  what is kant 's first example  yes unclear answer by a student  yes but how is it uh expressed in our text  have you found it yes  very faint voice in all changes of the material world the quantity of matter always remains unchanged  do you see that class okay  in all changes of the material world the quantity of matter always remains unchanged  or in other words the more popular version of it is could you repeat that  matter can neither be created nor destroyed   matter can neither be created nor destroyed  okay class that 's our first example  matter can neither be created nor destroyed  let us test this judgement first is it synthetic or analytic  why synthetic words  prove it prove it is it synthetic or analytic yes  sir because if you take off the predicate you 're just going to words  alright fine so if you remove the predicate what is your predi what is your subject anyway your subject is matter  does the idea of matter tell you immediately that it can neither be created nor destroyed no it cannot reveal to you the predicate the subject does not reveal to you the predicate and so the predicate you must have taken from elsewhere not from the subject okay so it is not analytic it is synthetic very good
Philippines	you 're free to ask questions and comments throughout the talk words  as i get older i find these three-hour sessions more difficult yeah i feel fine with two hours but three hours we 'll have a break in the middle okay i was asked to speak with you or tell you what i know on child language studies in psycholinguistics is this what you want yes brother yes okay so i 've divided my presentation into two parts uh one is the uh uh in general and then we 'll have the break and then after that we 'll have the uh uh the second part which is the field as it is uh uh found in the philippines you know what what i can now share with you some of the uh literature in the philippines okay uh i have been away from the field for some time now uh as you grow older and you have many other duties you find that much as you would like to pursue interesting places for research you can no longer do it this is one of the most painful things for me in terms of uh leading the life of a scholar i 'm doing a lot of administrative work i 'm one of the few administrators i think in the world that has tried to keep up intellectually with his field of research while doing a lot of administrative work well i find that i 'm happy to be words in the area now which is the area of sociolinguistics specifically i 've been doing a lot of work on national uh language development i suppose if you ask me who 's the most knowledgeable person in national language development probably i would say it 's between dr sibayan and myself he is a dear friend he 's eighty-two and i 'm fifty-seven so i hope that tish would be our successor laughter  hey we 're all getting old uh but this is part of the uh again the culture of rise and fall of the human beings and their self-actualization because i find the topic of child language fascinating i like children although when they grow up they turn out to be horrible laughter in the sense that they don't follow anymore what you tell them to do and they keep making mistakes it seems the present generation needs to make mistakes before you can really do before they learn and i 'm hoping that in their middle age they would pick up wisdom but uh it 's a fascinating field uh i guess if i if i weren't an administrator i would certainly devote half my time to child language uh research because i find it fascinating uh plus the psychic reward of being with children is something since i 'm celibate i don't have any children they 're very nice until about words laughter they 're about school age and then they become colossal pains in the ass then you you appreciate what it is to be a celibate but that 's neither here nor there laughter  but anyway uh uh but i cannot now i 've been trying to get people involved in child language because this field is wide open you can do it all you need is time and intelligence it doesn't need expensive equipment and yet really i 've had no takers the ones i tried to train in the beginning have not continued in child language they 've gone on into other fields and but in the states and in europe especially in the states it 's fantastic the field is only about thirty years old really serious research on child language began in the early sixties and now it 's thirty thirty-seven years the literature is vast uh there is a quarterly journal on which i 'm on the editorial board you can find this in the linguistics library uh of a bibliography of uh applied linguistics uh it 's a and if you want to see the entries the last three months or the last six months on child language acquisition language acquisition in general you find piles and piles of entries on the thing because there 's a tremendous amount of research going on and what i don't i guess here in the philippines the biggest drawback to research is the fact that people don't really have time  everybo if you have if you 're in any way halfway talented you are asked to do ten thousand other things then you end up uh not really words  if nobody asks you to do anything consider that a form of an insult because it means you 're not talented for anything laughter  uh but the moment you show any kind of talent in a school or institution they keep piling you with work   i know that  so anyway uh so the long and short of it is uh i 've been trying to train people for child language studies and uh i 've not succeeded there is nobody right now on this campus for example who is seriously pursuing child language studies i wish i could get somebody i 'll hire that person on the spot uh to fu because to create a good department you need subspecializations in the department so you know this person will handle literature the literature of a special kind this person will handle child language this person will be your psycholinguist this person will be your sociolinguist that 's how you build excellence in your department uh you cannot build that uh you know the way things are going unless you have this vision beforehand so the the field developed around late fifties early sixties and the pioneer was a harvard uh psychologist by the name of brown roger brown and he gathered with him a group of disciples the most outstanding of which was a woman by the name of ursula bellugi who subsequently moved with her husband to santa barbara and there continued their work there although i presume she must be close to retirement by now alright uh side by side with brown and a contemporary a very old man now is a marvelous universal linguist by the name of charles ferguson who is now at stanford but he 's officially retired as far as i know and he had a disciple by the name of catherine snow who did a lot of work and then i studied under a second generation person by the name of dan slobin who is at berkeley and a very fine man and then later on there was a whole spate of disciples after that the most productive of whom at one time was a pair called uh heidi dulay a filipina but you know natio naturalized american citizen and then a woman by the name of marina burt they did some pioneering studies in child language studies in the states and now it 's impossible there are so many specialists all over the place but these are the pioneers you 'll find all their books in my library actually if you 're interested in this field almost every issue of language which is the official journal of the linguistic society of america has a very good one or two very good articles on child language either a regular article or what you call a review article so you can pretty much gauge what is happening in the field and you 're very welcome to look at that if this is the kind of thing that uh turns you on and if you 're a linguist and you have your own child uh or co-produce a baby uh uhm chuckle  to study uh to study your child and some have done that but i have to see the results you know yeah i just have to words  brother what 's the bibliography you mentioned that 's in your linguistics library the index of applied linguists i mean  bibliography of applied linguistics you can ask my secretary in fact i 'm looking at it right now bibliography now therefore it 's become a subspecialty in psycholinguistics and in general for language theory because i would like to show part of the reason people get interested in studying how language emerge emerges in the human species is a fact that this has serious implications for language theory and for the uh what chomsky calls the theory of mind  in other words the brain  and if you look at the field the way it has developed there are different kinds of studies you can study what we call cross-sectional you get children more or less of the same age and you study uh what they have in common what they have that 's different you can do longitudinal studies and these are mostly case studies you study two people one or two people and see how they evolve from the time they 're merely producing babble like uh infants you know to the time they start talking which is roughly about twelve months to the time they start using sentences which is roughly uh eighteen months and the first full sentences grammatically correct uh are about twenty-four months so that by thirty-six months the child becomes fluent in the native language this is the normal schedule of human beings but there are individual differences of course uh then there are case studies of individuals uh especially bilinguals multilinguals children who grow up speaking more than one language which most of us belong to that category we grow up in the philippines bilinguals uh we normally speak the home language and then we speak filipino or tagalog and then if you come from an affluent home you begin with english even as a baby depending on the uh on how often your parents talk to you in that language and depending also on the yaya the child has alright uh then you have uh ethnographic descriptions you know of how language language is used in a community which could be a modern or an ethnic community up in the mountains you know like the kalinga-apayaos and some of the non-low land people who still pretty much live a restricted life alright so uhm now uh depending on the uh uh growth of the discipline and the number of people working in it uh the there is a historian of science whom i who died only about two or three years ago who wrote one of the minor classics of the twentieth century by the name of thomas kuhn you 'll find the book it 's called the structure of scientific revolutions  and uh of course not everybody accepts what he says now but i think basically the outline is still good he says in all the sciences there is what we call a prevailing paradigm where everybody who does that science is expected to follow that paradigm or model of doing things now what happens then is after a while that paradigm shifts you change the model completely but as long as the model is there it 's pretty much assumed by all the practitioners that that 's the way we do psychology that 's the way we do guidance and counseling and there are paradigms you know that 's the way we do things in physics that 's the way we do things in chemistry and so on and so forth the way we do things in child language studies is we make certain assumptions which i call the frame of reference because i don't want to call it a paradigm p a r a d i g m because some people don't feel comfortable with that uh with that term they get confused they get threatened a word that is easier is model a mental model of something or if you want something neutral say so you don't get upset uh frame of reference  when people 's we have a frame of reference for everything  that 's one thing modern psychology and modern cognitive psychology especially has shown us it has tremendous repercussions in philosophy especially what we call epistemology or the theory of knowledge  i don't know if any of you took up epistemology in college well if you went to santo tomas i 'm sure you did chuckle okay and uh the epistemology they teach you at santo tomas uh epistemology they teach you in seminaries the epistemology they teach you in about ninety percent of uh cat catholic colleges or colleges taught by former seminarians is really out of it in other words the paradigm is about one thousand years old and it 's really pass&eacute; but when i was taking epistemology i had to study that when i was i took up epistemology about nineteen fifty-seven nineteen fifty-eight okay uh the there are modern theories we now know more about the theory of knowing that 's what epistemology is how people learn things how people think how people perceive very often what you see is not what is there outside but what you expect to see  and when it comes to approaching reality there is really very little that can be called objective you approach reality uh with the uh the paradigms of your uh discipline  and you have a mental model of everything that you do uh whether in the field of morality in the field of literature in the field of ethics in the field of human relations in how you treat human beings and so forth and so on everything we are inter-subjective people we 're not really objective people  and the thing is unless you obtain a liberal education and you become aware that you think this way because you are what you are because of your history then you think that your point of view is the only point of view that 's valid and you become very narrow-minded  but on the other hand you have the other extreme if you have no center of your own you have no shared convictions then you 're the victim of whoever talks to you last i have met individuals like that they tell you whatever they heard last there is no center part of education is you form your own center and then you judge future encounters against your own center and while your center can continue to evolve it doesn't mean that you pick up every single new idea that comes into the scene uh as if you are a tabula rasa  nobody 's a tabula rasa  you sort of uh eventually uh form your own convictions
Philippines	okay so may i just ask from from you in a one-fourth sheet of paper your comments about what just transpired words because it will help the department head who was here a while ago if you know her department head of management to uh determine whether it will consider taking in words  you can comment or discuss the topic entrepreneurship even though we are not really an entrepreneurial group or belonging to a class taking up entrepreneurship it would be better really to find out what entrepreneurship is all about 'no 'cause many a time students take up courses to really train themselves to become employees and as we mentioned last time employment is very much different from self-employment okay so if you were to define entrepreneurship you will say something like uh it is the ability 'no of a person to perceive the products or services needed and or wanted by a segment of society and to deliver these needed products and services the right kind of products and services if we may just uh emphasize it 'no to the right kind of buyers because it 's possible that you may be catering to the wrong customer at the right time and place and of course at the right price and terms of payment you will notice there are a lot of adjectives uh nouns preceded by the word right 'no  the right products or services the right customers the right time and place the right price and terms of payment and the ability to be able to perceive and effect such a transaction is something that an entrepreneur should be able to have okay actually society or a nation develops only to the extent that we have a lot of these entrepreneurs around so if you can say that society 's development is really a function of the presence of entrepreneurs if we have more of these people okay the right kind of course 'cause there are entrepreneurs who are unscrupulous okay they follow certain bad practices in business so we are referring more on the right kind the right kind of entrepreneurs 'no  if we have more of them then it is safe to assume that development of a certain nation or society will really be seen okay so how fast a nation develops is also dependent on the number and kind of entrepreneurs that we have okay suppose we have a lot of entrepreneurs in a given country like the philippines suppose we can say we are an entrepreneurial society what will be some benefits of having this kind of a set-up where more and more of the individuals are turning to become self-employed individuals rather than being employees what will be the benefits now there are about five of them some of which you already know some of which are rather obvious but maybe some of which you still are not aware of one is that entrepreneurial society will experience a generation of opportunities for employment 'no  we will have more and more opportunities for employment okay because the entrepreneur is the one who creates jobs okay not the employee so if we have more people getting to be employed what normally will be the consequence for one thing we will have uh an increase in productivity okay because if people have more money to spend then they will be in a position to buy products and services okay and if products and services are being patronized being bought by more and more people then firms plants okay factories will be encouraged to become more productive okay so it 's uh it 's a chain effect 'no  so productivity is essentially a function of the presence of employment among the people second benefit here is that entrepreneurship improves the quality of life of the people now why do we say quality of life or the living standards of people well for one thing entrepreneurs are supposed to be noted for innovation or for that innovative spirit 'no now they keep on looking for new and better ways of improving our way of living example may be in the realm of the home okay  yung mga nagluluto diyan naglalaba diyan   sa cooking before hindi kilala yung mga microwave and all that 'no but now it 's already an in thing okay before we didn't know about this washing machine and so forth but now it 's very much an in thing among families even even maybe those belonging to the c level okay even in agriculture our farmers before didn't know about certain implements or ways of plowing the field without so much you know hard hard uh hard work and effort and so forth but now they are aware of certain machinery okay even in telecommunications dati wala yung fax but now 'yong fax is maybe an ordinary thing to many of us okay even in computers  dati walang computers pero ngayon we are developing more and more of this in different sizes shapes and so forth so the quality of life is definitely being improved 'no  even among uh mothers 'no they care for babies before hindi kilala yung mga different types of uh what 's this plastic panties and so forth but now ang dali-dali nang bumili no'n therefore overnight you don't have to bother yourselves waking up and you know changing the baby 's clothes and so forth whenever they wet the bed and so forth but right now you can you know have a good night 's sleep without being bothered by this kasi merong plastic panty and also the bottle feeding bottle meron na ngayon nilalagay doon sa bottle na plastic 'no  you don't have to be sterilizing the bottle now okay i know that because we still use that at home okay now the third one a third benefit here is that entrepreneurship contributes to more equitable distribution of income what do we mean by equitable  because as you probably know in our society it is something like a pyramid where the tip essentially about ten to thirty percent consisting of upper a or the a class 'no while the rest about seventy to eighty percent consisting of the masses okay  kaya sinasabing equitable distribution of income at the moment maybe wealth is concentrated right there the tip 'no  about ten to thirty percent at the maximum while the rest are probably living below the poverty line okay if we have an entrepreneurial society and more and more people having jobs more and more people having sources of income then wealth of a nation can be distributed more proportionately more equally okay because uh if there is inequity in society we normally would expect something like dissension coming from the masses the people who are supposed to be deprived of certain wealth now what could be some examples of wealth aside from money of course we have a most important wealth 'no land that is why in our government the centerpiece of the aquino government is actually reflected in that law which is the carp comprehensive agricultural reform program or law carl okay that is why the present government also has this bill actually already enacted into law so that there could be equal distribution of wealth ano'ng ibig sabihin noon  if we have this implemented the kalakalan twenty which is a countryside development program where industries are dispersed in the rural areas 'no so that more and more of development can take place in the rural areas then the people who are residing in such rural areas will be somehow encouraged to stay there and not migrate to the urban centers like manila and as you know when they migrate to the metropolis what normally happens we have congestion we have traffic we have squatters and normally we have a rise in crime wave okay so entrepreneurship somehow contributes to an equitable distribution of wealth and because that happens poverty somehow is reduced we cannot really eliminate this 'no  if you say you want to eliminate poverty that may be a tall order that may be utopian 'no it 's something ideal what we would like to have is a reduction in the incidence of poverty okay the fourth one is the utilization and mobilization of resources for great national productivity now what are resources resources would involve many things 'no like our natural resources that is why we would like to encourage more and more of our entrepreneurs 'no not only to be extracting the products from mother nature and exporting them right away 'no all with the end in view of generating dollars that is something good but sometimes we go to the extent of going beyond what is necessary and in fact what is what is more important as we mentioned last time 'no is to generate some kind of value added to our uh extractive industries what do we mean by that so the logs that we get hopefully we can add some value by using these raw materials and coming out with products like furniture tables and chairs and so forth that our own people will be producing and if we do that then there is the value added component okay so instead of just exporting the logs in their raw form we can use the raw materials and come out with a more concrete product okay so we not only generate employment but it is possible that we can also save on dollars the very thing that we would like to get when we export products why do we save on dollars because maybe some of the furniture and fixtures will words  so the fifth benefit 'no is entrepreneurship brings social benefits these social benefits are made possible by our government now what are these social benefits they come in the form of infrastructure okay roads buildings dams and so forth as well as certain basic social services like the collection of our garbage okay drainage system the maintenance of peace and order the presence of our law enforcers and all that will be made possible if we have more and more businesses being set up and from which taxes will be paid to the government okay so the government can only produce such uh activities which are supposed to be of social benefits to us 'no if they have revenues and these revenues come in the form of taxes coming from the businessmen the entrepreneurs okay so these are the five particular benefits that we can derive if we have an entrepreneurial society now what 's the next here so we already know what 's an entrepreneur but are there certain types of entrepreneurs basically it 's just two the really pure one and for lack of any term or phrase the not-so-pure-one okay what do we mean by the pure entrepreneur  the pure entrepreneur is someone who is able to create the idea create the business set up the business whether it 's a sole proprietorship or maybe a partnership or later on a corporation and then nurse the business to a certain degree of health okay that 's the pure entrepreneur so someone like leonardo sarao with his jeepney like socorro ramos with her national bookstore with narda capuyan with their ikat okay and many more even like mr henry ford with his model t mr rockefeller with uh his oil refinery business okay however there are urban entrepreneurs whom we cannot really consider as pure in the sense that they did not start the whole thing from the very start they probably just inherited the business so let 's say your grandfather dies leaves you a million or a billion pesos or maybe leaves you a business to manage that may be the second type or maybe you just bought a business the so called franchising so yung mga jollibee mcdonald wendy 's and so forth they are also in franchising so you put up a store bearing the same name you run the business the way the mother company runs it that is franchising okay  hindi ikaw ang nagsimula nun pero dahil hindi at least you didn't start it you got it from someone else in fact you just pay royalty to the mother unit to the mother company okay so these are types of entrepreneurs now why do you think individuals become entrepreneurs some of them start out as employees okay so he works for a certain company for five ten fifteen twenty years like probably many of you will and then later on decides that he will have a shift in his career from employee to self-employed why do they become like that there are essentially certain reasons for going into entrepreneurship and i 'll cite to you about four one is after let 's say devoting ten to twenty years of your productive life let 's say you graduate twenty by the time you reach forty or about middle mid-life 'no sometimes you experience some boredom monotony or in psychology something what you called burn-out  what do you mean by burn-out   kumbaga sa kandila nauupos ka na  you 've almost given-up everything in terms of your productive years and now parang wala na wala ka nang ibubuga okay so burn-out another is you have reached your peak 'no and therefore you are experiencing plateauing you know what 's a plateau 'no plateau parang lumakad ganon na it 's all throughout like that so there is no marked increase or significant change for the better as far as you 're concerned and there 's a tendency that you will decline just like any product just like any company after maturity you may have the tendency to decline to be phased out okay
Philippines	this month is holy week then after holy week is already uh unholy week laughter  i mean review week then after the review week you have the finals 'no  do not forget the requirements that i 've asked you to do specifically the one on the drama 'no words  then i gave you already last time the matters for the paper do not forget those because you may run out of time words  we go on and uh continue our discussion of the nature of poetry we started on this last time we have already some ideas as to why we said uh poetry in our present society seems to be not as popular as it used to be in the earlier period and we said that in general what was the main reason for this do you remember what we said about this uh last time miguel what would be in general the primary reason why we have this particular attitude of disinclination for poetry and uh why poetry is unpopular sir poverty you explain sir since uh before uh words poetry is very popular at that time but but uh after we we our our economy became unstable uhm poetry became became words biglang nawala sir kasi it 's very impractical now to to to so why is it now let us say quite impractical as you 're saying when we try to pursue the matter of poetry what makes it impractical because uh we only uh we have to we only think of our survival we we don't have time for leisure right so probably the idea of leisure time is no longer no longer available for us since uh as we said our poverty dramatically demands that we pay more attention to some other basic needs of course we are generalizing on that 'no  the uh the rich society or the rich members of society in our society have all the leisure time and have all the money to pursue artistic activities but we are talking about the ordinary common people which would form the majority of our society so what does that illustrate there miguel it illustrates that art and literature to be popular must really address a segment of society that is ready for them and how how will we be how will we be ready for such kind of art and poetry when will we be ready in for such things maybe uhm when our economy is stable yeah economy will be stable most of our people will be above average okay and have better economic situation why because it 's very obvious you want to learn you want to appreciate art you have no money how can you how can you get the means by which to appreciate art poetry what what do you need to read the books where the poems are supposed to be found or to listen to poets read their poems or to have discussions of poetry but if you have no time and money you will exclude yourself from such kind of activities it seems these we said uh were activities that refer to the spiritual intellectual development of man in a poor society you have to attend first to the development of your body before you can attend to your mind i think that 's very obvious if you if you make a study of the third world countries in this uh in this world you will find that they have all of these countries have really much the same situation as we have in terms of the popularity of the arts that 's the tragedy of a poor country this country the poor the poor people cannot really even if they want to attend to the necessities of the mind because they are still attending to the necessities of the stomach no matter how you may like to improve your intelligence your artistic uh sensibility if you are poor you have already a lot of obstacles no in front of you before you can improve yourself that 's why if you notice in our society you people you belong to the better-off segment of society the more fortunate compare yourselves to people of your same age who are poor you have all the advantages  there 's this guy from uh promdi as we say he 's poor he wants to study but he has no money where can he go he can't go to la salle where presumably there 's quality education so where does he end up he end up he ends up in one of those corner uh universities in manila where the educational facilities and instruction are not quite at par with the ones we have in la salle or ateneo or some other private schools he has already a disadvantage  talo na agad siya 'no  not only that he has no money he cannot buy all the books that you can read and increase your grade and when he graduates he graduates with a kind of lesser lesser intellectual development than you do because in la salle you have all the facilities you have all the good teachers of uh literature laughter but those other people you observe you go to i was in p u p last saturday i gave a lecture on literature and they have a different culture over there they don't talk about literature as we talk in class they still talk of literature as if it were part of the struggle to liberate the society from the oppressions of this and that society in short the way you tend to look at literature will also affect your appreciation and your understanding of it and as i was saying since literature pertains to the mind really in terms of effects it 's an intellectual activity if i 'm not concerned with my intelligence because i 'm more concerned with my body i 'm at a disadvantage in terms of effects we do not realize that 'no  you people who are in that kind of advantage but you should because you have all the facilities the means by which you can improve your mind at the same time that you 're planning to improve your body then when you graduate you have your degree and that guy has a degree from p u p who gives a damn about a college degree from p u p if you apply in makati for a job will they say uh p u p this is what this is the guy we get no you have all the advantage your parents are already there in the institutions you want to apply at probably your parents own the institution so at once you are vice-president this poor guy this poor uh uh wretched fellow from p u p starts as a janitor so wala na   hindi siya makakahabol sa inyo  that 's what i 'm meaning because of that disparity in your social situations that 's how it is in the poor countries 'cause you know from your studies ninety percent of the of the economy of this country is in the hands of a very few they 're the ones dictating the trends and the developments in our society if you don't belong to that ninety percent whether by birth or by employment you lose a lot in terms of advancement  so what are all of these things anyway insofar as poetry is concerned can poetry help you any better when you graduate from la salle will poetry a knowledge of poetry be an advantage to you when you apply for a job in a bank will the bank manager when he is processing your application paper tell you could you recite to me this or that poem so i 'll know if i get you laughter  of course not  di ba   di naman itatanong 'yon   marunong ka bang mag- determine ng metaphor or simile those things will not help in short again poetry is useless for such practical purposes alright it 's useless you can live and die without having read a book of poetry and god will not take that against you it will neither lessen nor add to your being a human being in the sense of practicality right it has no functional value in short unlike engineering when you take up civil engineering or chemical engineering undoubtedly that 's why you 're taking them up you will be very much using them when you graduate in poetry no why are we taking up poetry why read poetry at all isn't that isn't that quite uh strange why not just let the situation be don't read poetry anyway it 's not useful for us why all of this talk about relating it to your life and so on why is it part of your curriculum in this university anyway you won't be using it at all after you graduate its use of course will not be in the practical sense its use will be something else its use will be a personal use for you and that 's very hard to see if you 're not used to that kind of uh thinking you 're not used to that kind of attitude towards art why do you see a movie for instance why do you listen to a piece of music is it the same as when you read a piece of poetry you don't think of any practical advantage at once or any practical result when you listen to a piece of music do you but why do you listen to your favorite musician the great masterpieces of your favorite singers andrew e for instance laughter  what do you get what do you get out of that uh irwin why do you listen to music in general for instance   ha irwin do you listen to music  ha irwin  si irwin yes  irvin irvin uh oo nga 'no  irvin you listen to chinese music yes so why do you listen to chinese music what do you get out of it inaudible answer  oh explain what do i what do you mean by entertainment so you can relax okay yeah that 's a good word relax  hindi ba gaya nga ng sabi sa mass peace you want inner peace there are only two ways you know go to god or go to art you see both can give you peace sometimes god is very busy for mere mortals like irvin lim who 's irvin lim anyway laughter  so many billions of people in this world and there are more important people than ir irvin lim so don't go to god you probably can go to art chinese music japanese music filipino music modern classical whatever because you want to relax and i imagine what you can relax with irvin is that kind of uh comfort that kind of peace isn't it  kasi very often you listen to music when you want to forget your problems problems of your stomach the problems of your practical everyday life isn't it you notice that you go to something not practical you can easily go to mcdonald and eat your yourself away but that will not give you peace isn't it it will give you indigestion laughter  that 's not peace even if that 's the most practical thing you should do to solve your problem you go to something spiritual you see and that 's it and that 's personal you cannot say since i i enjoy this piece of music you should also enjoy it no because there will be quite a lot of differences between you and the other guy i do not say that you may not get the same effect but the degree will be different that 's why you have favorite musicians favorite pieces favorite writers if ever you read literature and so on di ba  they are your personal link to some kind of inner peace that you would like to get the same with poetry you know if we look at poetry as a means by which such kind of relaxation can also be achieved then probably we will have some kind of change of attitude towards it we won't dislike it right at the very start you go to poetry like you go to music it will have no practical value to you first but it will have personal value for instance the first time you see this kind of idea in this poem an idea you never touched on in engineering or chemistry or whatever  ngayon nakita mo rito and then you realize that is true  yon lang realization of the meaning of that idea is already a joy isn't it 'cause knowledge is joy knowledge is power or you just listen to the sound of the words together  magandang pakinggan  the rhythm or the rhyme even if you don't understand the whole poem but there may be certain parts that appeal to your sense of hearing  'yan that 's already a form of enjoyment or because of the poem you 're able to imagine certain things that 's it the joy of imagining what before you had not thought you could imagine that is also enjoyment so those small areas those small effects of the poem may contribute to some kind of changes inside you a change that or changes that are really as i would say more personal than anything else what we do in a class like this in poetry is try to formalize only is try to substantiate all of those things that you can possibly get from reading poetry so that in a way we can all see at the same time something that can be seen but i repeat it is a highly personal activity since we 're in a classroom we could try to see whether this is possible on a larger class scale  as in our definition last time you remember our definition of our working definition of poetry could you repeat that manuel what what what did we say was the working definition of poetry poetry is a kind of language that expresses more than prose words  okay expresses or says 'no more than prose writes on the board  alright poetry is a kind of language that says more or expresses more than prose and says more says it more i 'm sorry intensely than prose so we have two two aspects of the definition and that is what we have just tried to illustrate 'no  this area of intensity and quantity it 's quantity  this one is quality 'no intense
Philippines	okay in action research that means that lewin was interested in transforming a life problem okay a real life problem into into controlled research and so he would observe something that 's wrong with the environment with the society okay and try to research that okay using a carefully controlled study and always it 's a controlled research and always using a theoretical framework he never did research without first having a theoretical framework okay which is how research should be done as you all know okay so he first observed something that 's wrong with the society came out with a theory that would explain that and then tested that theory okay for example one of his important researches is that of group decision making  okay a firm it started with a firm hiring him to look at the low productivity of the firm they are a factory the factory had very poor productivity very low productivity so lewin went to the environment observed what was wrong okay and he found that the workers were not motivated to produce  the workers had long hours they had a quota for the factory they had to fulfill a quota per day and so the first thing he found out was that the work was simply too much for the workers okay and the workers had no say okay about what they should be doing at work okay so what he did made his theory was that if you allow the workers to make their own decisions regarding their work okay then they would produce more  okay in your thesis if we allowed you to do a topic of your choice then that would make you work more di ba than if we assigned you your own topic okay so what he did was he grouped the workers into smaller groups asked them to come up with what they thought was a reasonable quota reasonable working hours that was presented to management okay they tried it out and they found out as a result of that group decision making productivity indeed went up they 're very practical very approachable  okay another relevant research especially at that time the nineteen forties in the u s racial discrimination  it was still a very big major problem and one of the problems was that the blacks of course at that time were already free so they had problems integrating into white communities okay because of discrimination  his theory about that is that discrimination exists because of segregation because the blacks lived in one community and the whites lived in another community if we allowed them to mingle okay if we mixed them okay then discrimination their attitudes discriminative attitudes would decrease okay so 'yong research niya quasi-experimental okay in one housing settlement in one housing settlement where there were several apartment buildings in alternating apartment buildings are black and white families okay so in one building it 's purely black families in another building purely white okay in a way it 's mixed but still segregated 'cause they 're still in separate buildings compared to another housing facility okay wherein in all buildings the families are mixed black and white okay where would you think discrimination is more likely to exist bad attitudes a student responds  in here why   kunyari you went camping with ateneans okay and we put you in separate tents okay compared to in this type wherein you 're together in the same tent where would negative feelings more likely be encouraged students answer in chorus  when you 're in separate tents and the same was found in this research when they were in separate buildings discrimination was more pronounced  discrimination was also found in stores in department stores wherein there were black personnel and white clients were complaining okay about black salespersons  so lewin wanted to see if having a black salesperson really is detrimental to sales okay because of the complaint of white customers okay so he interviewed customers as they went out the stores okay and asked them would you buy from a black salesperson and many of them said no and yet when he went inside the store and observed okay it was not true they were buying also from black personnel there was no difference between a black and the white personnel okay they were buying from any salesperson regardless of race  okay so with this research he showed the complaints of white clients were not founded and there was no reason to take out black salespersons because sales was not affected by their color or their race  other research seems to counter what lewin did words  wherein he says if you want attitudes to change you should change the behavior first  where usually the belief is if you want behavior to change change the attitude first he showed through his research that the opposite can also be done and he showed this in policies by changing policies of universities regarding admissions  this practice is still being done in in several universities in the u s okay wherein they have a quota for different racial groups okay and they have to fill that quota so if their aim is to have twenty percent admissions black admissions they have to fill the twenty percent  if only fifteen qualified they should still active actively recruit five percent more okay  ganoon talaga  active recruitment to fill the quota okay to make sure that the races are represented in the universities and he said only if you forced universities to integrate black whites indians asians okay so you 're changing the behavior you 're forcing them to go together in one place eventually it will result in change in attitudes  okay think of one group right now which you cannot stand if any  ano  iraqis iraqis if i force you to be together in one room even for a week  sobra naman kayo miss  or hindi in a nicer place in uh a beach house okay kung andoon kayo anong mangyayari  okay in a nice place if you are put together in a favorable setting such as that your attitudes will change and by forcing you to change behaviors you will force yourself to get to know the other group okay and he showed that also with his research now because of this lewin now he was given recognition in that every year there is now a kurt lewin award given to a psychologist who has contributed to the study of social issues  are there any questions about my favorite psychologist  i assume you have no criticisms  and so words i like about lewin his major theory is in topology the one that we discussed last time physiolo psychophysical field he also branched out into other areas okay all of these are very different from his psychophysical field okay  walang tanong  okay we 'll move on to a new topic clinical psychology  during the renaissance okay so that 's around the fourteenth to the fifteenth century mental illness was viewed very differently what do you think were the early views of mental illness  abnormal yeah abnormal but what 's the cause of it evil spirits evil spirits demon possession witchcraft and so on  okay for example one of the first books to be written about what actually was mental illness was the mallus mallificarum  that 's a that 's a book the title of a book  in fourteen eighty-seven written by two bishops so it had the approval of the church  it had three sections  literally every words  it had three sections first it gave proof that witches exist  the second part which is of more interest to us is it gave descriptions of characteristics and behaviors of witches okay it gave descriptions of characteristics and behaviors of witches and if these descriptions were read by psychologists today or by you you 'd recognize that many of them were actually traits of mentally ill people like symptoms of depression hallucination paranoia schizophrenia okay uhm if you were to read it today you would recognize it as actually symptoms of mental disorders okay and at that time at that time it was recognized as behaviors of being a witch  okay the mallus said that witchcraft comes from carnal lust okay witchcraft comes from carnal lust which is then which satisfaction then is sought from the devil  okay and he says the reason why there are more women who are witches is that this carnal lust is never satisfied in women students laugh  okay according to the two bishops who were men who wrote mallus mallificarum  and in fact at the time about eighty-five percent of all witches who were executed were women  talagang mas marami talaga  more women were witches or identified as witches  and part three of the mallus describes ways of identifying witches  okay like for example one way is by burning at the stake  'pag hindi sila nasunog okay they won't burn that means they 're a witch in which case they 'll be killed okay now if they die at the stake it means that they were not witches but soon they die so either way as soon as the person is identified as a witch wala na talo na okay no matter what trial they use the witch or the alleged witch may end up being dead  okay so because witchcraft is believed at that time to be caused by demons or devils the most popular form of taking care of of what we now know as mental illness is by either by killing by executions okay or by driving away the evil spirits  for example here are some paintings sixteenth sixteenth century paintings okay this one shows exorcism okay of two men who showed symptoms of mental illness and after exorcism the demons came out after which they were cured in this very small picture two people burn at the stake and while being burned again the demons were driven away and so whatever the method the logic is to drive away the demons from the body  in fifteen forty-seven in london the first institution for the mentally insane was constructed it was officially called the saint mary of bethlehem okay but its nickname is old bedlam   kasi ang gulo magulo sa loob  okay at that time there were caretakers who took care of the inmates they had a very small salary okay so what they did they allowed outsiders to go into old bedlam pay admission and then look at the inmates okay  parang zoo  okay here 's again a painting of old bedlam  eto yung mentally insane here are two rich ladies who paid admission to go in so they can view the inmates at that time other disorders other kinds of mental disorders were not allowed in the institution like for example if a person is suffering from depression okay the person is allowed to roam the streets because a depressed person really will not harm anyone okay and if a depressed person is in the institution it 's not fun viewing a depressed person or it does not make for attractive viewing so the kinds of people that they put in are those which are schizophrenic and those who are violent those who are chained okay it attracts more viewers than  institutions of that kind they were now all over europe but in many of those institutions the care provided was not really to cure the mental illness but more custodial care okay so simply giving food and shelter to the people who were already in the institutions the violent ones were chained okay and what is common at that time once you go in really you practically never go out okay because those people do not become cured of their mental illness  philippe pinel was the first to institute reforms in these mental institutions  his interest in studying the insane began when a very close friend of his suffering from manic depression came to him one time and told him about the problem  okay at one point during one of his manic fits okay the friend went into the woods okay where he got lost and was eaten by wolves and so he was greatly disturbed by that and he spent the rest of his life doing studies on the insane okay so doon nagsimula ang interest niya on the insane his philosophy was that the insane were not animals okay that should be viewed but rather people who need treatment  when he wrote an article okay describing how the insane should be treated it caught the attention of a government official who was in charge of hospitals in paris and that 's how he became he was assigned to this ment mental institution for men word paris in seventeen ninety-three  the first thing he did was to unchain some of the inmates okay with very strong opposition from the other supervisors one of the men that he unchained okay was one who killed one of the guards okay with his chains manacles and he had killed one of the guards before and yet when he unchained him the man suddenly became very gentle and two years later the man was completely cured okay and assisted pinel in the asylum the insane asylum okay so he showed that humane treatment okay is always necessary for curing the insane and the reason why they were not cured is because of the inhumane treatment that they were getting 
Philippines	 words allows some teachers especially those of us who do other things other than teaching to run wild at least once in a year in the past two years i 've done just that uhm it allows us to teach the way we want to teach now i am a poet as well as a teacher i think robert frost said something about uh vocation and avocation in my case voca uh my vocation is poetry my avocation is teaching but as uh robert frost says it 'no my vocation and my avocation like my two eyes make one sight  and i would like to share with you this sight for for uh our alternative class i would like to experiment uhm in terms of creativity that is a shared kind of creativity i believe that all students have have it in their hearts and in their minds to write poetry now it might seem impossible but uhm you 'll never know unless we try  now i have i propose to do three very very simple things today i will i will share with you what i mean by creative reading and creative writing and then uh we will look into two kinds of poems one which i had done and this is written in the experimental mode we tried this out uhm we had uh a huge workshop with the philippine educational theatre association peta you 're familiar with peta and uh we had uh a festival of the arts and at fort santiago  they they placed the poem on a sheet on a large sheet of paper and uh we invited the audience to write their own poetry based on the poem because the poem is not a dead text  the poem is a living text so when you read you also make your own poem in effect so this poem can replicate itself can be written in many in as many ways as there are many different kinds of readings so i 'll be giving you the text later on and then we will see if we can do something about it uhm either uh individually or maybe by dyads 'no since this is a large group the second exercise that we will go into after we have done the first one is uh to make some very very short charms 'no  charms are one of the oldest forms of poetry and it is hinged on the idea that words can heal as well as hex or hurt do you ag do you know this do you understand this i think you 've tried this once in a while use words to love or to heal and uh you can also use words to hurt or to hex 'no like when you say madapa ka sana 'no that 's that 's hexing now in poetry it is a very specialized form i will give you a model for this we will read the model first and then you will do your own now this is not impossible because i have tried this out in uh in some of my litform course code for literary forms classes uhm the litform class that i have here uhm we will try that when we reach poetry now after we do uh the two poems if we still have time and if you still want we can go into another writing exercise uh we will try to write our our own stories based on a story 'no using uhm how we feel and how we think about things okay uhm is that clear to you what we are here for  any suggestions or comments so far  none okay uhm i will can you please help me uh distribute i only have fifty copies of the of the text so maybe uhm people can share the the text okay  okay again that as a teacher and as a poet i believe that there is a very direct relationship between reading well and writing well so if you want to be writers if you want to write more clearly you have to read lucidly  uhm how does one read a poem one goes into the heart of it 'no  so there are many levels at which you can approach a poem and one of them is and the best of them is to use your imagination when you are reading uh the words because the words have to mean more than what they are put together they should mean like music they should move you in its own melting 'no  now uhm i have written here on the board one of the one of the names that you encounter in the poem chikibu  she is uh a court poet she was writing poetry in uh heian japan in the heian dynasty and uh she wrote very very short poems which however like little dynamites they were deadly when they exploded 'no inside inside the person because then the person had to be changed forever when the poem reached the heart of that person the person was not the same anymore after reading it well or after hearing it well now iz izumi chikibu is used as an allusion in the poem sagada stills 'no which is our first text for today uhm the other person that is in that poem if you look at it very care carefully there is another name there uhm yes anyone yes you found it maskere are you familiar with eduardo maskere no you 've never heard his name say hello to him  mas maskere is a filipino he recorded with his camera he did not have any uhm formal training in photography or art of photography but he recorded with his camera a very simple one when he started the life of the cordillera and its people in the nineteen fifties and uhm a group of people who have seen his photographs have put it together in a book entitled maskere  it won the national book award in the philippines about uh three years ago and uhm he has presented to us unforgettable pictures of uh cordillera the northern part of the philippines which i think we should all visit sometime in our lives if you haven't seen the banawe rice terraces you should try to do that not as tourists but as a but as students of culture your own culture because it is i think it is the epitome of the best 'no in the in the spirit of the filipino we always hear very negative things about ourselves as filipinos but if we do that uh if we go we go up there it is a healing process now eduardo maskere used whatever light was available maybe like all kinds of artists whether you are a musician a poet a photographer uhm a painter you use whatever materials are available and then you make the best out of it now here uh he has presented uhm the cordillera i will show you some of his pictures so that you will understand who eduardo maskere is by the way this is part of good reading if we encounter words and names that we do not know we try to get to know them and love them 'no  learning is loving well if you don't love what you learn it will not mean anything in one 's life i think that 's what we mean by alternative education the ordinary education is facts what you memorize and then throw out after a term the real education is what you keep 'no and that which grows with you as you grow older and it gets better as you grow older okay here 's the picture of sagada have you have you heard of sagada it is uhm about you go from here to uh bontoc for about eight to ten hours and then another two hours through very very rough but beautiful terrain and then you reach sagada i think it is the skyworld in the philippines if you want to know how the skyworld looks like and how the sky beings used to be in the midst of the philippines you should visit sagada but again i warn you not as tourists but as lovers of your own culture  this can you see it maybe i 'll show you i 'll show this too this is the picture of the cordillera if you if you 've gone to baguio maybe about ten or fifteen years ago when you were still children and if you had a magical childhood that probably uhm made its effect on your imagination it 's uh this is the vision of the the photographer of the forest as well as of the the mountains of sagada  i think this this is one of the best uh photographs that eduardo maskere he 's he 's a self-taught photographer but uh it 's pure art because he saw with his heart   phrase of the cordillera people here 's the man who is uh the artist 'no and the singer and he 's playing on the nose flute okay uhm there 's another picture of a warrior very proud being with full dignity and integrity very very unlike many of the filipinos now  much better than many of us now  okay now i 'm showing this all to you because when i wrote that poem sagada stills it was occasioned by a a visit to the bontoc and cordillera area and uh when i reached sagada i realized what it is what it was like to imagine as a filipino would imagine but because when one writes one includes a whole world of experience one includes one 's reading also and i have read izumi chikibu uhm i 'm very much attached as a poet to the japanese and chinese uh poets and uh izumi chikibu is one of the best uh women poets that i have ever encountered one of the best poets in the entire world if you read just this haiku or it 's uh it 's a tanka it says in this world love has no color yet how deeply stained my body is with yours  now if you don't sigh if you don't understand that you 'd probably have to experience it first okay uhm now what will we do with the poem that you have uhm  will you will you please open that uh you have your text with you  this poem was recently published in the tampa review of florida and uhm i think it 's because they were trying to put together an experimental uh volume of experimental work i was trying to experiment with sheer creativity as a poet i believe that creativity is communal it is done by an individual but it is within the context of a community now since education i think effectively kills our creativity in many many ways uhm it seems as if poetry or the writing of literature is the is the province of a very select few very rare people we call them weird sometimes 'no weird weird and wild but uhm i think everyone can write if they know how to see with the imagination not just with the eyes the eyes are literal 'no but the imagination is metaphoric now it is in the metaphoric level where you can write something now when i wrote this uh poem uh as i said it was occasioned by uh a visit with a friend to this beautiful place in the philippines and i realized the the limits of art when you are in front of something so beautiful 'no  you can try to paint something you can try to catch it with a photograph maybe maskere is is uh luckier than i am because a single picture as they say is worth a thousand words but i work with words as a poet so i was trying to capture what maskere had captured now when i wrote this i tried to experiment with the visual form of the poem as you can see it there when i first finished this and i showed this to my daughter my daughter is twenty-one years old she uh yes she she said the immediate reaction that she had was how does one read this and i said exactly read it anywhere anyway you want 'no  that is my great experiment now as i said there will be as many poems as there will be different kinds of reading i will just share with you what my chinese friend did okay when he saw the text he looked at it and he said i 'll read it the chinese way how is the chinese way  yes  they read it from right to left  from right to left isn't it also from top to bottom okay so that is possible 'no  but my but my daughter was more uh playful with it so she played hop-scotch with it do you know how to play hop-scotch  step-no you know how to do that and then you jump like this you can do that with the poem too so if you are playful 'no you can play with the with the whole text and then you can make your own poem what we will do is i 'll give you about fifteen minutes of quiet to just meditate and and look at the poem and then you write your own version and after that you write there on top where my name is as author marjorie evasco and chet chan because that 's our poem okay uhm is that clear to you now before we go into that exercise let 's read that first try try to read it the ordinary way okay meaning to say syntactically in terms of its syntax the poem is trying to make some sense but like a poem it can make many other senses or many other uh meanings so ordinarily in the usual way how you how would you read a text you go from left to right or like this okay so we will try that that 's the most ordinary and maybe what most readers will do i 'll read it because it 's in my it 's my poem okay  sagada stills in a floating world if with images if with words i you could catch on photographic film on silk paper a likeness of you of me in sagada i would have you would have to set a thousand years with master of austere light measure maskere chikibu to learn the process of rendering silence of staining sound  okay i will not explain my own poem because it is a shared poem as i as i told you it is a love poem 'no okay
Philippines	the last time we met we were talking about space the different kinds of space and the metaphysical uh consequences of these we said that uh metaphysics or the problems of metaphysics were born essentially in the context of the general perception of space as euclidean we said that euclidean space is structureless and empty in it the application of uh the parmenidian postulates results in uh a an ontology which begins with non-being and ends with non-being therefore humans especially philosophical humans who encounter things in space are surprised why there are things rather than nothing and therefore uh are moved to search for explanations for the things in space the analogy there is with uh a blank screen a blank movie screen without contents in it now supposing we have uh a movie in the movie screen but we cannot find any projector anywhere nor anything behind the screen we would wonder why there is a movie going on without any projector projecting anything on the screen the uh question we would ask would be similar to the question we ask why is there something rather than nothing however we said that uh in non-euclidean space the existence of things in space specifically space-time uh changing and with the history would be unnatural we have therefore a mind which expects euclidean space to be there okay and wonders why there are things in this we ask for an explanation we did not realize that the space we had was the euclidean as a matter of fact the mind has thought for a long time that euclidean space is the only possible space it was only in the eighteenth nineteenth century that the idea of non-euclidean space is became uh cough uh perceivable through the efforts of name uh name and name and finally by name  this is a happy thing for philosophy particularly when einstein came along and deduced from from uh his theory that space-time word space-time would have contents not only contents but contents which interact with each other and which interact with space-time itself okay there were problems of course with the with the uh relativity and one of the problems of relativity was its seeming uh conflict classical conflict with quantum mechanics which uh relativity we said was deterministic while quantum mechanics is essentially indeterministic and the two would not be reconciled until in recent years uh we came up with super strings and perhaps super membrane uh space-time  okay uh so it seems that uh the ontological question is no longer impossible to solve william james had believed that there was no bridge between being and non-being and that was because william james although he lived in the twentieth century was not able to connect relativity with existence similarly uh alfred north whitehead also made almost the same almost the same remark he said there is no reason why this flux history this flux rather than another flux has been illustrated apart from history in other words apart from the given uh forces of nature already there without this given given history and no reasons can be given why a particular history rather than another history has been illustrated okay now we shall uh go on to another problem in philosophy and this is the problem of causality somehow instinctively men have believed that events have causes that no events can take place without a cause this was the conclusion of such uh pre-socratic philosophers as parmenides and anaxamander uh leucippus democritus plato aristotle and so forth democritus uh put it uh succinctly as follows nothing happens without a cause or reason 'no  okay whenever something happens we always ask what 's the cause 'no  what is the cause in other words it seems that belief in causality is ingrained in the human mind 'no  kant uh believed that uh powers to perceive causal relationships are also ingrained but he said it is ingrained in the categories 'no  the categories the structures of the mind which by which we experience an orderly universe kant believed that it is impossible for anyone to experience a completely disorderly universe the only universe that can be exp experienced are is a universe that is orderly and the ordering apparatus are the categories  okay let us first uh explain them the two current uh hypotheses about causality the first one who came up with a hypothesis about causality was of course david hume 'no  david hume was an empiricist  he followed in the tradition of john locke berkeley george berkeley and finally himself david hume now david hume following his tradition and then bringing this to the logical conclusion his logical conclusion uh thought 'no that the materials of our knowledge are essentially two 'no ultimately reducible to one namely impressions and ideas impressions come first then ideas  simple ideas must have an uh antecedents in simple impressions you cannot for example think of the color red unless you have seen the color red before if you are born color blind you will not know what redness then is if you are born without the sense of pain you would not know what pain is but you can having these simple ideas you are able then to combine them 'no into complex ideas which you may not have experienced before 'no because of the imagination the mind has two powers imagination and memory memory in memory okay we have ideas of things we have experienced in orderly sequence but in imagination the ideas may be jumbled 'no in any order we wish that 's why we are able to write fiction we are able to draw strange characters 'no etcetera etcetera  the although in imagination the mind is free to combine ideas anyway it wants 'no  nevertheless there are certain tendencies of the mind which uh make it tend to associate certain ideas with each other 'no  it 's the law of association okay and the laws of association are governed by three mechanisms contiguity in other words two ideas closely associated with each other okay uh become so associated that the existence of one the impression of one will involve the other contiguity resemblance two ideas which resemble each other recall each other and the third one is cause and effect this is the one we are interested in cause and effect cause and effect again is uh associated through constant conjunction cause and effect is associated through constant conjunction sir so that sir 'yong uh so uh words  three three mechanisms 'no  okay uh contiguity resemblance and cause and effect okay in the process of the constant conjunction of ideas the happening of impression the happening of one impression recalls the other 'no  okay whether the one that is uh previous that the antecedent one is called a cause and the uh what was the other of antecedent antecedent and i forgot it it 's not consequent  consequent is a logical term anyway the one that follows is called the uh word  now since david hume was an empiricist he wanted very much to analyze just what from the viewpoint of empiricism are the elements of causality  okay he was able to distinguish three elements namely succession there is a succession of events 'no  uh let us say for example you have a you want to smoke a cigarette you want to light your cigarette 'no  alright there 's a succession of events you get your lighter 'no  flip it the lighter uh uh lights up okay you bring the light to the lighter to your cigarette and it comes in contact with the cigarette okay the cigarette lights okay and you blow out the light of the lighter that 's it 'no  okay a succession succession of events 'no  a succession of events okay the second one is contiguity 'no  contiguity contiguity according to david hume is an element in causality 'no  the cause must come in contact with the effect 'no  the cause must come in contact with the effect okay the light the fir the flame of the lighter must come in contact with the cigarette before the cigarette will light 'no  we somehow believe that gravity also exhibits this kind of of uh property 'no  there is in other words for hume no such thing as an action at a distance 'no  it 's always some kind of of contact between the cause and the effect yet it uh what what governs the law of association the law of association yes what were what are the words  oh what governs it what governs it resemblance of oh okay resemblance uh contiguity resemblance contiguity the same definition  oo oo  the same definition the same definition they are close together closely associated with each other contiguity okay i guess i guess in causality the contiguity means contact 'no  physical contact 'no  the contiguity in causality means physical contact in the former one i guess contiguity means close association okay the third element is necessary connection 'no  the third element is necessary connection so we have succession of events contiguity necessary connection okay supposing supposing i throw this piece of chalk let us say this is a piece of rock 'no  this is a piece of rock and this is a piece of glass supposing now i throw this piece of chalk to the piece of glass there 's a succession of events  the glass breaks 'no  the glass glass breaks upon contiguity 'no  upon contact 'no alright okay and then the necessary connection is i believe now that it was the contact of the rock with the glass that broke the glass 'no  alright 'no  it broke the glass okay so he now analyzed where this necessary connection comes from 'no where this necessary connection comes from because it seemed that from the viewpoint of empiricism it has no objective basis he thinks that i could just as much believe that upon contact with the piece of glass the glass will harden rather than break 'no  or upon contact with my cigarette the cigarette the cigarette will will freeze rather than burn 'no  so there is no logical connection between the cause and effect the necessary connection then is not logical but psychological 'no  it 's not a logical connection it is a psychological connection i have no impression in other words according to hume of a necessary connection between the cause and the effect 'no  ice-phi:s1b-008#126> okay so he says then then 'no that the element of necessary connection is due 'no not so much to the logical connection between cause and effect but to habit and custom 'no  the constant conjunction of events between cause and effect creates a habit in the mind okay to associate the two so that the happening of one will cause the other whether the effect or the cause you have an effect you recall the cause you have the cause you think of the effect 'no  it is the habit that establishes the psychological feeling that there must be a necessary connection between the cause and the effect 'no  this is a comple completely empiricistic analysis of causality and that in short gives you the humeian concept of causality causality is not an objective relation between things it is a subjective imposit you might say imposition 'no by the mind on the world as far as the world is concerned the objective world is concerned things could happen differently 'no than what the mind expects uh things to do uh to happen okay now uh kant of course we all know that kant read this book of david hume and kant one of you know was a dogmatist he when after reading it he said david hume 's book had uh awakened him from his dogmatic slumber 'no  okay he got some important ideas from david hume called causality but he did not agree with hume 'no  he did not agree with hume that causality is due to mere habit 'no engendered by the constant conjunction of impressions  ang kanya naman sabi niya there seems to be an element of universality and necessity in the cause and effect relation if it were merely a case of habit and custom there would be no sense of universality and uh necessity so he said where then is the locus of this feeling of necessity is it in the habit he agreed with hume that it is subjective 'no  the locus of this feeling of necessity is not objective but subjective he says it must also be subjective 'no  but it 's not habit it 's not custom it must be an innate structure of the mind 'no which he identified as two 'no the intuitions composed of time and space and the categories composed of twelve categories one of which is causality 'no  in other words causality is a category of the mind this category of the mind 'no imposes itself upon the phenomena so that we necessarily think in terms of cause and effect 'no that the world is necessarily ordered in other words the orderliness of the universe the laws of nature 'no are necessary they cannot be altered 'no  but the necessity is not out there the necessity is in the mind 'no through the operation of the categories  'yan 'no  so we have two different uh theories about causality
Philippines	so we move to another topic okay we finished uh testing significant difference of two groups of three groups 'no okay so the the final the final uh part of the of elesta two elementary statistics two is about correlation so what do you mean by correlation  yes albert  relationship okay what else diana what do you mean by correlation   words anything unclear response of a student  it 's okay uh salvador the relation between two groups relation between two groups  anything else  what is meant by the term correlation  common condition or yes pardon me common condition common condition  excuse me so in elesta one elementary statistics one you studied uh correlation and what was the type of correlation you studied  what type of correlation did you study in elesta one pearson product moment pearson product moment  when we have pearson product moment what are we trying to determine in terms of relationship how do you know it 's gonna be pearson product moment  unclear response by a student  when do you use pearson product moment correlation jason pass pass okay arnold pass i didn't study that you didn't study this why unclear response by a student  uh rafael what is what is uh being related when you use pearson product moment  oh jerry  elesta one it 's still in elesta one it 's not even elesta two  pearson r yeah pearson r  when did you use pearson r yes to determine the agreement between two variables  to determine the agreement between two variables to determine the agreement between two variables agreement is it agreement  agreement may i may i see who did not take up pearson  how come you didn't take up pearson in elesta one unclear responses by the students  who was your teacher  unclear responses by the students mr cordero and also mr alonzo  stat one o one  yes  yes marni miss words cordero uhm mr words  yeah i remember yeah yeah he went to taiwan i remember okay you 're excused from not knowing miss 'yong pearson word a at saka b again again a at saka b a at saka b okay  okay so it seems that you didn't take up pearson product moment correlation 'no  not really that extensive between the sum the sum of the of the what the sum of the products of x and y tama  don't give me the formula don't give me the formula i only want to know the concept okay don't give me the formula okay so let 's uh let us words   miss miss is that the exact word is that a the exact words yeah this is taken supposedly in elesta one that 's why we assume when you go to elesta two you know this very well okay so the pearson product moment correlation for those who just uh had a casual casual uh introduction to it okay pearson product moment correlation is used when you want to determine the relationship okay the same term that you were giving the relationship between two two variables which are expressed in interval or ratio scale  okay so the prerequisite here is that the type of scale that you have is either interval or ratio usually in psych =psychology you have uh test scores test scores now the size of a correlation coefficient ranges from negative one to positive one okay  okay it 's negative one to positive one so any value that you get which is more than one that means your answer is wrong what does it mean when you have a negative one to a positive one word  okay we have a graph  this is the y axis and the x axis when it 's negative it means that the higher the y the lower the x  so that 's the relationship between the variables the higher the y the lower the x  when it 's positive okay the two of them increase the same way as x increases y increases so the line is straight okay clear now if you graph the two scores the x and the y okay and you can't seem to draw a straight to draw a straight line uh either in this direction or in this direction okay this may indicate that there is a zero correlation that means there 's no relationship between the two variables so a negative one and a positive one is you have such a straight line this only happens theoretically okay what usually happens is that you can draw a straight line forcing it 'no but the points do not exactly fall there but somewhere close that 's why you can form a straight line there but not exactly passing through all the points okay now when it 's like that you can have a moderately negative  it 's moderate negative 'no okay this one 's clearly negative so this means that somehow it 's negative but it 's not perfect 'cause if you have a perfect one it would be uh the line would be very straight this way but we don't usually have that same way with the positive we don't have a clear straight line writes on the board always there with some points falling there okay so of course when you have a zero words that means there 's nothing there 's no relationship at all between the two variables so what makes this a zero are the scattered dots the scattered dots okay how do we describe a correlation coefficient okay the answer to the pearson product moment correlation is a correlation coefficient usually when we have point three to point seventy-nine it 's moderate writes on the board  below point three that means below point three or point twenty-nine below point eighty and above high  okay okay so the coefficient describes the degree of relationship between the two variables okay so when we hit a point eighty this means that the lines are pretty are quite it 's pretty much this way that means the dots the y and the x meet almost in a straight line okay but not yet perfect because we only get a straight line when we words  now if it is moderate that means many points are outside that line and if it 's zero we are words  okay question question  no more okay were you taught how to compute it in elesta one okay now pearson product moment correlation is one of the easiest one of the easiest you should know that by now okay one of the easiest type of correlation easiest okay what other correlation uh types of correlation did you study in elesta one  spearman okay spearman  okay what else  pi  yeah but you have words what else point-biserial some of the other students answer in chorus and their voices are inaudible  point point biserial point  ano 'yong point biserial so is this all yes we agree students respond in chorus   kasali sa test 'yan miss no no way  no way there 'll be another set that 's why you 're not gonna take this i was told i was told by mr cordero and ms bernardo that words   so wala na si pearson there will be another set another set with fancier names with nicer names okay class now that you know something about it 'no okay there should be something that you know about it okay  miss walang pearson  okay so since you 've taken up the basics already okay whether or not you got uh you got a full lecture from mr cordero or not but he told me you took it okay so now we proceed with different types of correlation okay you will notice these types of correlation were used essentially when the variables are interval or ratio okay so the variables may be initially interval or ratio and then converted to ordinal okay now we go to another set of correlations okay which hopefully you will find useful as you when you write your thesis  okay so what 's the first type of correlation that we 're gonna take up okay the first type would be the cramer  okay cramer cramer coefficient so what 's cramer   cramer is used when you have two nominal variables  two nominal variables so what 's an example of nominal variable  telephone numbers telephone numbers  sex sex and then  what 's an example of nominal frequency type of variables unclear answer  i d number okay oh for example you count the number of males and females in this class that 's nominal  twenty and then five you count the number of freshmen sophomores juniors seniors in this class that 's also  nominal nominal okay so all you have are frequencies okay now there are times that you want to correlate two variables which are expressed in this manner okay obviously you can't use pearson anymore you can't use spearman anymore so you use cramer  cramer coefficient okay what 's cramer coefficient the formula is writes the formula on the board  okay by now you 're familiar with the with the big letter x squared this is the chi chi okay so when you use cramer coefficient you have to compute chi -square words  you 've got to compute chi -square okay so what else  so l here will be the minimum number of rows and columns rows and columns  miss anong word tayo  it can be two by three three by three students say something unclear  so how do you test the significance okay obviously you look at appendix c  so degrees of freedom would be r minus one r meaning rows okay k 's we mean column so they use uh they use the symbol k it 's really c you want c it 's okay r minus one and c minus one  minimum number of rows and columns minimum number of rows and columns for example  so you have uh two by three right two by three contingency table you have a two by three contingency table it means that what 's l what 's l  two how many how many rows do we have  three  how many rows do we have  two  which one 's the smaller one  two  two that 's l  uh okay how difficult this is r equals two whichever is the smallest number that 's l okay it seldom happens to be two because if it 's two you have to use phi coefficient so if it 's more than two it 's uh it 's not a two by two table you use uh cramer 's  miss but you can always fix that kung kapareho na  yes whichever is the smallest one  miss kung pareho  they you it cannot be the same because the phi coefficient is used word two by two  three by three three by no it 's seldom the set up  words it 's still three by three whatever is the smallest number  ma'am pa'no kung one whatever is the smallest number that 's it okay where is the two by two usually it 's lopsided okay  get it   yes miss do we need chi -square for the formula yeah you have to compute chi -square first okay so the chi -square here of course this time you know it by heart we hope you have to compute chi -square first chi -square okay are you  how many should we have in chi -square part two no this is uh you just need uh you just need uh  to show word  you need to you need to determine expected the way we do it here you have to compute expected first  so we have to look what kind of chi -square a student sneezes  there 's no need obviously it 's not a test of goodness of fit it 's not all you need automatic every time you see uh this it 's always always always okay but let 's take an example 'yan break in the recording  if you have this data okay we assume that these are organizations student organizations in la salle there are about six okay then we try to find out whether there 's a correlation between year level and uh year level and uhm participation in student organizations let 's put freshmen  okay you want to find the relationship between membership in student organizations and the year level is there a correlation between the two okay so let 's use chi -square first teacher walks and writes on the board while students talk  okay to compute your students talk  okay do it now  you solve it you solve it genevieve correct students talk  okay break in the recording  okay student organizations affiliations student organizations and level uh year level of students of de la salle okay so since we need a chi -square so what was the first thing that uh we should have done with it students answer in chorus  okay get the expected okay so what are the chances uh computed the expected already right so forty-nine the first the first column will be forty-nine the first row rather will be forty-nine  okay so you see here the expected already 'no like this time from forty-nine times twenty-two divided by one hundred forty-four is seven plus forty-nine so we need to do it for all the cells here okay all the cells all so after computing e for each uh cell then you add it all up you should get an answer between seventy-five point zero nine to seventy-five point twenty-five okay
Philippines	 words are faces of the same thing  this this particular theory is called cultural materialism in england  it is called new historicism in the united states there are some minor differences between the two theories but they are not significant enough to concern us here in this class  so when when we say cultural materialism and new historicism we mean the same thing alright the term cultural materialism was of course coined by raymond williams  now cultural materialism is a term that is that is more or less self-explanatory marxism as you know is dialectical materialism everything is materialistic and everything is material and the method to analyze everything is dialectic alright cultural materialism applies marxism to culture see one of the problems with all the models of marxism that we have studied so far is that the place of culture is not very clear  it 's not certain in conventional forms of marxism whether culture should stay in the base or whether it should stay in the superstructure  uh it 's supposed to be an ideology culture is supposed to be an ideology but whether it is material or not is not clear so cultural materialism starts from from the marxist analysis of culture in a sense cultural materialism can be called a post-marxism in fact it is sometimes called a post-marxism it is it is a continuation of marxism in the sense that the techniques and the insights of cultural materialism could not have been achieved without marxism but on the other hand it is a reaction to marxism because cultural materialists realize that marxism is extremely limited in its grasp of culture so basically cultural materialism believes that all culture is material immediately therefore we are in the area of bakhtin and company  remember that it was bakhtin and company who said that uh base and superstructure cannot be distinguished from each other as much as we would like to distinguish them because they are both material and the material is language now cultural materialism does not believe that the material is language so unlike bakhtin and company the cultural materialists uh believe in something else actually they believe that the material is economic it 's still marxist uh the base is still economic but uh literature or culture in general is part of the base in the sense of bakhtin in the sense that base and superstructure form a continuum alright so cultural materialism then means that culture is regarded as a material object which therefore behaves in the same way that other material objects in society behave  now uh new historicism is is defined as uh old historicism influenced by newer things in particular post-structuralism uh neo-marxism and feminism yes sir according to eric david a culture is either material or immaterial an immaterial culture is for example a belief a traditional belief for cultural materialism everything in culture is material including beliefs and ideas and attitudes values etcetera everything is material it becomes material when it is expressed in language that 's bakhtin  that 's bakhtin   but in cultural materialism you remove the language part so how can they prove it as something material  so how can they say that it is material if it 's the manifestation itself is not really palpable  it 's not palpable but it 's material for example if i write a poem and and i well first when i have to write it i use a pen which is material i use a paper which is material i send it to a magazine which is material the magazine sends me uh uh talent fee which is material and in other words i get paid as a worker for my poem which becomes a product so in effect i am part of the economic base my poem which i thought was intangible and impalpable and as you call it turns out to be something exactly the same as uh as a toothpaste tube right except that it doesn't occupy space as in in my mind but it occupies space in the magazine as well as on the piece of paper that 's what uh taking the whole culture as material  okay uh uh now the key insight of raymond williams as far as cultural materialism is concerned is the insight that you find on page one two three at the bottom  three last line  residual dominant and emergent cultures  they 're really kinds of culture or aspects of culture residual dominant and emergent now this is the key insight from which cultural materialism and new historicism come  raymond uh raymond williams realized that if you look at a culture there are really three kinds of cultures in every in everything you study in every culture there are three things or aspects or types or shapes or forms that you can distinguish first there is that aspect of culture that you see all over the place that 's the dominant culture actually we should talk of three cultures the dominant culture is the culture that exists among the most number of people kind of the majority culture that 's the dominant culture now the dominant culture of the past which still remains today is the residual culture  so as time passes the dominant culture becomes residual the culture of tomorrow which is already here but is not yet dominant but will be dominant in the future is the emergent culture so it 's kind of like past present and future except that they exist in the same society in the same culture so looked at synchronically a society has three cultures looked at diachronically you can see the progress from of a culture from uh emergent to dominant to residual  so let 's give some examples to make it clear let us take technology because that 's the simplest alright today the dominant culture in television technology is colored t v if you go to any of our houses the chances are we will find a color television set in our houses that 's dominant  about ten or twenty years ago uh there were very very few colored television sets most television sets if they had any were black and white today you still find some black and white sets  so black and white television sets are residual color television sets are dominant  what are emergent television sets well we don't have very many of them in this country students answer in chorus but unclear  uh but that 's still television that 's still the same thing it 's just uh portable there are portable black and white sets  stereophonic  for example in japan if you go to japan and you want to watch a show in english you turn to the you turn on the t v set you switch on only the right speaker and you hear it in english you switch on the left speaker you hear it in japanese  there was an attempt uh some years ago to introduce stereophonic uh television broadcasting in this country so remember they you were supposed to attach your television set to your stereo and then it would come out stereophonic well that kind of fizzled out because it was too expensive but soon enough eventually all our television broadcasts will be stereophonic so eventually it will be english on one channel on one speaker filipino in another speaker or uh or stereophonic i mean uh stereophonic sound  that 's clearly emergent because the technology exists  it exists with some people but uh it 's not yet there for most of us  okay so that 's what it means what emergent means is that it exists it 's not only an idea it exists but it is so uh minimal that it doesn't really affect most of the people  but we can see that eventually everybody will have that whatever it is so eventually every television set will be stereophonic just as every television set now is colored alright a t ms in banking is dominant now a lot of people now go to little machines where they put in their card and get money but there are still a lot of people who go to a counter and talk to the bank teller and get money from a real live person that 's residual if this were not dominant banks would not invest so much money obviously they think that there 's enough people who are using cards to justify all this expense 'cause you can see a t ms all over the place eventually there will be no more actual bank teller because this would be the residual culture right what 's the emergent culture in banking china banking has it now this is not an ad they now use a telephone  you don't have to go to a bank to use this machine i don't know with china bank it 's their advertisement uh i don't have an account with them so i don't know if it works but their advertisement said that you can use your telephone to do bank transactions  that 's clearly emergent nobody has to go anywhere anymore a t m you still have to go out of the house and do this stuff yeah sir so we will not be using paper money anymore yeah of course of course   credit line  but that 's another that 's another aspect altogether credit cards cash uh in the philippines dominant is cash in the united states it 's not cash that 's residual if you go to a department store and you pay cash they kind of look with this funny look in their faces and say you 're paying cash this is really strange you know you usually pay by check or credit cards  but emergent is a student answers but unclear  kind of like kind of like credit cards a student answers but unclear  so what does that mean a student answers but unclear  uh but that 's still cash that 's still cash in the future you won't have anything except your one card uh which is your social security number which you use for all your transactions that will be your banking card your driver 's license etcetera  and there won't be all these so many cards that you hold in your wallet that will be the future in fact they have that already sometimes they use the same card to do all kinds of things like they do now okay you get the general idea alright electric typewriters  ian if electric typewriters on secretaries' desks is the dominant culture what is the residual obviously students answer in chorus  the manual typewriter obviously the manual typewriter what is the emergent uh nestor the emergent sir uhm computer word processor the computer alright that 's easy enough right no problem with that how about uh warfare culture of warfare warfare uh in the last in the gulf they were using basically tanks right that 's the dominant culture just tanks  so beverly what 's the residual culture sir guns guns uzis and stuff all that thing and the emergent culture charina sir scud missiles nuclear yeah missiles see how easy it is this was a very simple insight it took a genius like williams to figure it out but it is such a simple insight  what is of course deep about it is that history is linear it keeps going so that eventually tanks will be residual i mean nobody will use tanks anymore uh everybody will be using missiles at that time some emergent thing will happen which will make missiles uh kind of look old-fashioned will we know what that is no we won't know what that is see the emergent culture emerges only when something is dominant you can't predict the future that way these things exist they are not ideas  it means that anything we have now is bound to disappear after you know so many years of course in the past past in this century uh things have occurred in a at a very fast pace i mean the changes are so fast that we can actually see something that is just emergent becoming dominant a good example is the typewriter i mean all of us oh well maybe not you but i can remember the days when everything was manual  but now everything is electric at that time the electric typewriter was really an emergent form and i remember that you remember the days when there were no computers that 's only about ten years ago the the word word processing started only in the eighties so ten years ago nineteen-eighty there were no such things as word processors so clearly we all remember the days when uh that was not emergent  what that means what this particular model means is that when the word processors become the dominant uh tool that is used by secretaries there will be something else that will be used that will be developed alright how about uh betamax sets the v t r machine malou malou is not here no uh uh yeah christine
Philippines	chapter thirteen which is uh the chapter the uh we 're trying to find out whether the principal teachings of christianity starting with uh creation which we finished last meeting and salvation which we also finished right uh now we come to the question or teaching on the kingdom of god and eventually uh no no ahead of that we will have the question of sin love and sin alright now let 's go first to love because that 's actually the uh ahead of the kingdom of god we have already defined uh the love we are talking about is wishing and doing sometimes not doing what is really good for another for the beloved okay and we said also that loving is not in the heart but it is in the in the will huh which in psychology you will call our affective part affective faculty affective with love 'no that 's the will while that which pertains to the mind or to the intellect uh we call it you don't remember cognitive cognitive for knowing okay so you have cognitive this corresponds to what we call here as intellect and we have here what we call the will and both of them are aspects of what we call rationality your being rational means you have intellect you have a will the will for loving intellect for knowing okay and the all the physical organs including the heart they simply manifest uh what we have in our uh mind or what we call intellect or will sir question uh yeah sir how come sometimes like when you don't want or how do you explain uhm people who want to fall out of love yet they can't help but still be in love with the person uh uh fall out of love and you 're still in love yes in the first place christianity tells us we should love everybody  they 're emotionally attached  you should love me laughter  that is what christ said and i should love all of you but you see this is love has different degrees you know so here you have a zero you have one hundred degrees you love your boyfriend or girlfriend almost boiling point right laughter  uh you love all men that is a command of god uh love everyone including your enemies right now where will you locate them this is the area of love somewhere here is the area of non-love huh no love no love huh you may say hate or whatever huh no love uh there is by the way a an area where you are neither hot nor cold uh   indifferent  indifferent and what does the psalm say because you are neither hot nor cold i will vomit you out of my mouth you know a symbolic way of saying if you are indifferent you 're out 'no  so uh all men should be located in this uh scale the teacher writes on the board right our definition of love by the way fits your sweetheart and fits your parents fits your friends it 's the wishing and doing sometimes not doing what 's good for another right sometimes not doing uh or something something huh now you have to do what 's good you know you know to do what 's good uh but is love always doing not necessarily 'no  love is not always doing uhm i know what your difficulty there you are connecting not doing with what is good right yes you put you place it in ano in the context there is uh always doing something is not necessarily a sign of love always doing something for another is not necessarily uh a sign of love for example okay uh you said you love me and you will uh uh do things for me okay uh let 's go to bed oh no no things like that right you 're not doing you 're not you are abstaining from uh anything you know so so there are cases where you will not have to do it what we are trying to uh emphasize also is that love is not just wishing they said hell is full of people who were always wishing to do good but they never actually did good any student in la salle always wishes to get to study harder but not everybody actually studies harder not all those who are wishing would be studying harder okay so uh this is where uh we are supposed to put all people we have to love them huh we have to love them and the real challenge of christianity is that we also love those people who we should be hating right  love your enemies  and it is very difficult but unless we forgive we will not be forgiven and there are many things there in the bible which tells you that and there are people who have actually uh done it the classical example of a very recent saint saint maria goretti huh who was uh stabbed because she was resisting rape and uh when she was dying uh the priest was called and the the first thing asked her is do you forgive your killer you know the one who stabbed you because if she doesn't forgive neither will the priest give absolution  hindi puwede  as christ says you must forgive one another if you want to be forgiven by god now when you forgive that 's already a sign of love right sign of love incidentally that man became the chief witness uh for the uh beatification and eventual canonization of saint maria goretti he repented while in prison he never got married and uh eventually uh asked to be a gardener in a monastery so the rest of his life was spent uh it was like the second part of the life of mary magdalene right second part of mary magdalene okay so uh love we have been talking about love love love now what about sin 'no  some of us think that sin is so far away 'no  sin is only for priests or talk about sin when you take religion but you see all these practices that are committed in our society for example kidnapping for ransom uh cheating on people with whom you uh sell things for example uh cheating in the construction business where you put inferior quality of wire and then sooner or later the house burns down due to faulty electrical wiring and all of these forms of cheating are considered sins right so what is this uh sin in the old our father is known as a trespass right and a trespass means violation violation of what violation of the law violation of the law of what of love love of what of god of fellowmen the teacher writes on the board  so that 's ano that 's the definition very simple anything that violates love true love okay is sinful  so you disrespect your par if you love your parents you respect them right when you disrespect them it 's a violation of love  so we have that now there are two theories that are rejected with regard to sin some people say sin is merely subjective it 's all in the mind huh it 's all in the mind there is really nothing sinful it 's all in the mind there is no fault of such thing as pornographic it 's all in the mind you know there is nothing as a lewd dance it 's all in the mind 'no  lambada oh okay it 's all in the mind whatever it is 'no  uh i steal your car you accuse me of having uh committed uh a sin no you see it 's all in the mind you know for me it 's good 'no  i never do something which i think is bad i always do something which i think is uh good so the rapist thinks that what he 's doing is good so why punish him for doing what he thinks is good if you believe in this thing that wrongdoing is all in the mind you know the other one is an error of thinking that it is uh objective huh objective and nothing subjective in other words you have the objective norm of morality with its corresponding uh punishment for violation so for example when you kill a man under the law that man must be punished either by capital punishment which is death or maybe by life imprisonment or number of years in jail or by firing squad or whatever alright you agree that that is the law okay suppose your five-year-old uh brother while at home with your mother finds the gun of your father it 's loaded so he gets it goes to your mother who is cooking in the kitchen and then you know he has seen many things in uh t v you know shooting playing around then he shoots your mother and your mother is killed will you now say hey little boy you are guilty of matricide killing of one 's mother now you will be brought to court and condemned to death electric chair will you do that  students answer in chorus no  why because in judging the guilt of that person you just don't take the law like that you have to consider the subjective condition of the person right some years ago there was a beautiful woman i don't know who she is who was found walking near the old international airport totally naked under the law that is what do you call that public scandal she could be charged of public scandal in photography overexposure laughter  but you see it so happened that it seems that lady is a little bit out of her mind so you can't put her to court and imprison her for uh what is that indecency or public scandal so where do you bring her you bring her to the mental hospital have her treated see so what does this show it shows that in sin there is uh sin implies an objective element which in other words is the norm of behavior and a subjective element for example knowledge consent that is why if you remember your catechism oh what makes a mortal sin what causes a boy to commit a mortal sin those of you who learned your baltimore catechism i think you learned your catechism under vatican two already but before vatican two we would memorize and try to understand the so called baltimore catechism oh what constitutes a mortal sin very serious matter full knowledge full consent okay full knowledge full consent the little boy that the in the example i gave you has no full knowledge he doesn't know what he 's doing because he 's not yet in full use of reason  and the uh young lady i told you about a while ago has no full use of his reason he 's out of his mind okay and so although there is an objective norm violated the two examples i gave you are not guilty of any sin okay because uh they don't have this clear enough the moral norm is different from the uh uh what do you call this uh legal civil law where you say ignorance of the law excuses no one right  ignorance of the law excuses no one  in uh moral theology eh true ignorance excuses you from moral responsibility for example uh if you know or you think it is monday huh suppose you are in uh the mountain area you have lost track of the of the uh days you have no calendar there for example and you think it is sunday and yet you treat that as though it were monday then uh let 's see actually it is monday but you think it is sunday if you work are you guilty of violating the sabbath rest or sunday rest no huh if you think it is if it is uh sunday it 's actually sunday but you thought it was monday and you work you don't violate if it is monday and you think it is sunday and you o you observe the sunday rest then okay alright okay so it must be true ignorance not feigned ignorance even if it 's you have tried to verify and there 's no way of verifying the what 's the true day okay then you have to depend on your conscience sir does it come with a responsibility that you should be responsible enough to yes but there are times when uh you err because as they say to err is human right so there are times when you are in a position where it is impossible to get the correct information okay alright so uh this is uh the meaning of sin and it is not something that is out of this world no all these things you read in the newspaper are sinful acts sinful acts words  uh one thing i 'll tell you this the more love goes up 'no and let 's say non-love huh uh non-love will naturally go down uh non-love will entail a for example you know indifference uh  and they have an effect on progress or development even physical progress not just your uh progress in the non-physical area for example i 'll give you this progress or development in a non-physical area suppose uh at home all the members of the family they love each other okay plenty of love there then one day you go home and then say wow i got sixty in our test in codevel you know  and if your brothers and sisters say okay we know you can get higher try again next time you know and so on and so forth perhaps your spirit goes up and you resolve to study harder but suppose your brothers and sisters say yeah buti nga tanga ka e laughter wala you know you see that will not put you up right so the same is true with this for example respect all other 's property is it here or here where you respect other 's property is it here or here it 's here if you respect other 's property there will be no hold-ups there will be no robberies there will be no stealing
Philippines	before we take up the caucasian chalk circle  i hope everybody has read it how many of you have read it only one laughter from students   nabasa ko po 'yong start lang pero hindi ko natapos  that 's alright miss 'yong summary lang  summary where did you get the summary  the students answer in chorus miss sa library  you looked up the summary first alright now we will take up the caucasian chalk circle which i expected everybody to read to have read i 'd like to sort of go back and trace the development of uh the drama so that you would understand more or less what uh bertolt brecht sort of uh innovated if you call it uh innovation 'no of what he did and i hope you remember what you have seen like for instance the japanese play the noh play the film that you saw and the kabuki because i will be referring to this i 'll also be talking about the chinese drama traditional chinese drama which is called in the west the peking opera okay alright if you remember in the greek theater when we were talking about the greek theater some very interesting aspects in uh the script especially that of sophocles' oedipus rex  you find two characters at uh a time on stage talking about the problems the problems uh word you create are associated with uh what the gods had uh decreed in the case of oedipus rex it was a matter of uh defining fate you know the role of fate in the in the life of oedipus the one interesting thing about the greek theater is that it had a chorus and the function of the chorus was not just to speak out on the apparent uh thoughts of the character what was going on in his mind but also the greek chorus tried to tell us about what happened in the past so that we would fill the gaps there in your knowledge of the plot so that 's the greek greek theater also we noticed that in the presentation of the plays in the amphitheater in greece they had not much of what we would consider today as necessary on a realistic stage the backdrop the scenery the effort to make everything illusionary there was no attempt at that in the greek drama break in the recording  notice that the language used was exalted language poetry was used right okay and the characters who participated or the characters the characters of the stories were noble characters noble characters mostly uh rulers kings queens and what happened to them so that the fall of these characters the tragedy would really create an interesting impact that of pity and fear and eventually of course this would produce catharsis i think we defined that 'no in tragedy now that was classical tragedy then elizabethan tragedy which we took up also showed something else  the tragic flaw in the character consisted in the excess of the virtues possessed by the principal character and uh again we have uh noble characters we have exalted language poetic form hardly is there a shakespearean play that has prose uh the prose parts if there are any are usually spoken by the fools by the jesters there is always that nobility that is excud exuded even in the dialogues  and then after that came the romantic plays the romantic plays of course again uh portrayed uh things that were fantastic fantastic stories fantastic hap happenings then came the period of realism i think we talked about this among the first dramatists you might say involved in realism realistic plays were ibsen and hauptmann the teacher writes on the board  okay ibsen you know very well as the author of  the students answer in chorus the enemy of the people  okay the enemy of the people  what else did he write  the students answer in chorus doll 's house   doll 's house and hedda gabler and  the students answer in chorus doll 's house ghosts  okay you remember what it was uh words made this realistic what characteristic uh what characteristics did his plays have that weren't found in the earlier plays what kind of uh heroes did uh did ibsen have ordinary the common man 'no  okay the common man and uh well in the case of ibsen there was a principal character there was a a tragic hero but not in the sense that the tragic hero in in the classical way the classical or elizabethan manner  but still tragic  this is now the common man and uh with hauptmann in the weavers you have another kind of hero it 's not just an individual but a group so we have now the collective character the collective hero the masses the masses now realism was shown of course in the presentation of some uh almost true-to-life occurrences problems that we would also meet in our lives and we could relate to and the attempt at illusion in the theater was done now what is it uhm you were made to accept everything as if they were all happening uh in the the image of uh a of somebody going to the theater and uh waiting for the lights to to dim and then the curtains opening and what did you find there you find a uh a scene that is almost like what you would ordinarily find in actual life complete 'no  so that you you accept this as a a different world altogether and you are transported into that world you accept that world as if it were uh really there as if you were there in that world and this is brought about by scenery word with the idea of course of the fourth wall uh you know what what this is in the drama the fourth wall you have let 's say this is the stage uh this this is the fourth wall but it 's as if you as spectator here you are watching what 's happening inside a room with this wall removed this fourth wall removed so everything here has to be has to be uh has to look like the real thing if it is a let us just say let 's say it 's a living room it has to be complete with the living room furniture so that you are you agree to be deceived as it were you enter into some kind of an agreement with the director with the actor with the playwright that you are going to accept this as true and so for a while when you 're watching the play you are transported into that world transported into that world you are a spectator separated from that world as it were by this uh proscenium here by the apron here of the stage and so you 're watching you 're just watching you 're not participating alright you are there you empathize with the characters you 're one with the character characters on stage and you go through the emotions that the character also goes through the same idea as with uh with the earlier kinds of play now what happened later what did bertolt brecht introduce that was to depart from this realism  post-realistic plays well first let 's go back to realism we were talking about ibsen 's uh social realism there was also psychological realism the probing into the motivations of the characters and uh this was of course uh uh spurred by scientific uh experiments scientific advances at this time freud and jung carl jung were the ones who were uh often uh referred to their their probings into uh this psychological make-up of individuals became the uh basis for the very realistic portrayals of the characters one such play is miss julie by uh strindberg 'no   miss julie probes into the motivations of some a young girl and uh why she attempts uh to take her life towards the end of the play that 's psychological realism social realism of course presents a social problem now you saw that in enemy of the people and you saw how it was word  but there were rebellions against uh too much of this realistic illusionary theater or what we would call realism uhm there were attempts to present what we would call a presentational way of a presentational theater these are all representational uhm such an attempt we found in arta arta okay and also in the staging of uh in the staging of uh death of a salesman death of a salesman  while there is still there uh the there is still the probing into the psyche of the individual uh you see that there is an easy switch from an easy switch from past and present and back to to the uh past and then to the present again 'no  okay uhm another rebellion you might say which could be considered a core of expressionism would be the brechtian theater uh the brech the brechtian play 'no  bertolt brecht was marxist bertolt brecht was a marxist so when you look at his plays and the manner of presentation you are aware of the social commentary that he puts in there but brecht 's theater which is often referred to as the epic theater has been influenced by a lot of things among them of course the greek play where you find the chorus included in the epic theater the elizabethan uh conventions of well the lack of sets you know in the elizabethan theater we pointed out there were no sets really characters talk about the moon and so you know that it 's supposed to be night there is no moon painted on some kind of canvas background one character would come to the front with a spotted uh crane and that would stand for the arden forest and the lights were not dimmed nor brightened to show a change in uh in hours uh brightened to make it look like it 's daylight or dimmed in order to make it look like it 's night so that 's that 's not done at all in the elizabethan theater everything is presented in in a bright light now bertolt brecht borrowed these conventions and he borrowed also from the uh japanese and the chinese way of uh presenting their stories their dramatic presentations uh those of you who watched the noh theater the noh play did you notice how the characters came on stage  where did they come from  you watched one student responds in tagalog  okay uh the characters would come from the dressing room which is connected by a bridge to the main stage  okay and even as the characters would a student asks something  one character at a time even as the character moved from the dressing room to the stage you know that he 'd be speaking his line but very very slowly okay slow motion very slowly and he would move very very slowly uh and then he would say i am so and so he would introduce himself in other words he would be speaking directly now to the audience in the realistic theater the actors and the actresses would really uh speak among themselves only they would be oblivious of the fact that there is an audience watching them they would be in a different world altogether each one is supposed to internalize his role so that he can act out as uh expected but in the brecht theater brechtian theater there is that direct address to the audience so that the audience is participatory not just a spectator audience iba na it 's an observer audience and you find that in the and you find that in the noh the japanese theater and in the chinese theater 'no  in the beijing opera or peking opera that also happens the character would come on stage and would say i am so and so from from that part of china and i have traveled or i am going to travel three miles towards this city and then he walks on stage he circles he makes a he goes around the stage three times or on the stage three times and then he would stop at a certain point and he would say i have arrived at the city okay so this this would show that he has traveled three days yes steph a student gave a long comment but unclear  okay so there 's that direct address as i said to the audience and also uh a lot of telescoping also of events this traveling for instance is supposed to be done uh symbolically or it 's just suggested there 's symbolism there uhm and then there 's a lot of mime beijing opera does a lot of uh mime miming and the chinese actors are very good at this even in having to step over a stile to enter a house when there is nothing there they they they do that very well opening windows so mime is there  and what did brecht do when he evolved that kind of theater he had stories presented but uh included they were not told chronologically they were they were not told realistically but he involved he involved uh chorus choruses what else he involved uh mime he involved acrobatics  the dressing was done right there on stage so there was no need for going backstage to change costumes that that was done in many uh brechtian plays all they had to do was turn around and remove the costume and there would be the other thing underneath uh the other the next the costume needed for the next scene would be there underneath and that would remind you of what they do also in the japanese theater they did that in the kabuki right and in the noh theater they did that also okay uhm what else did he introduce he introduced music uh this would be part of the play itself the the songs were chanted or were sung and there were usually ballads which he adapted and he did not require actors with good singing voices
Philippines	yes chapter eleven we should start with chapter eleven we start with chapter eleven chapter eleven you if you remember when we took up chapter nine we left out the last part of the discussion which was on bureaucracy you remember okay we did not discuss bureaucracy because bureaucracy is a topic that is to be covered with the other institutions now after chapter nine we took up chapter ten which is on family and family is not a bureaucracy okay so before we go to the study of chapter eleven on religion let us go back to chapter nine that aspect on bureaucracy and take a look at what that is so that we can by the way because somebody 's taping the session you don't have a quiz  yehey   teacher addresses the one taping the session  you wanted me to conduct the lecture rather than have uh sige  okay  yehey  but you have to talk louder so your your voice can get recorded students make noise  okay so uh what we are going to take up before discussing religion is the subject of bureaucracy mitch do you want to start uh o ako pala ano teka muna  i 'll have to discuss it so what do we mean by bureaucracy  what do we mean by bureaucracy  don't you have anything to say about bureaucracy  what what do you know about bureaucracy  anna a hierarchy of of jobs or tasks now from your understanding from your familiarity with the term what does bureaucracy in a sense uh uh make you think of  red tape   red tape okay what else checks and balances  red tape  just what is red tape  when it is when one person goes to another to an official and then words  one person goes to an official a person who needs something let 's say in an organization he 's asked to go to an official and then he 's asked to go to a higher official and it goes on and on and words  uh-huh any other idea edwin  red tape   words the long process of a person trying to ask a favor from an institution a long process involving request for favor from an institution what about it when does it become red tape  does just having a long process uh make it red tape  analie i think red tape is a kind of hindrance that uh-huh makes uh a process which is supposed to be this this short yes uh-huh   long  okay so the idea is there what else can we say about bureaucracy  from your own familiarity with the term you don't you 've met the word bureaucracy okay so that brings to mind uh implies red tape  another wilson uhm bureaucracy is a system uh if an in an organization which is supposed to make a process more efficient but in many cases it makes it even more inefficient  bureaucracy you say is a system okay what is in that system ramon system of checks and balances well let 's say uh you 're talking about the system here presence of procedures you 're referring to the existence of rules regulations uhm what else let 's take a look at what bureaucracy is really it is defined as what it refers to students answer in chorus but answer is inaudible okay it talks about a particular system but that system refers to a hierarchy of what a hierarchy of positions in a large usually when we talk about large organizations this is a secondary group setting 'no  a large organization which makes possible  what  the performance uh the performance of certain tasks okay which makes it possible for the institution or the organization to perform its tasks and functions okay so look it refers to that hierarchy and by hierarchy you 're thinking about what what comes to mind what does the word brings to mind students answer  pyramidal that means what does it always have to be pyramidal it brings to mind layers it brings to mind what  students answer in chorus levels  levels more appropriately ranking di ba   may mataas may mababa  so ranking there are people at the top and people at the bottom excuse me we have to end this break in the recording  what transpired before you because we will use that to discuss when we talk about politics and education okay so let 's go back to what we were discussing uhm when you when you talk about bureaucracy you 're actually referring to what a hierarchy of positions in a large secondary organization which makes sure that the tasks and function of that organization are accomplished okay now when you talk about hierarchy you imply ranking there are people at the top all the way down to the bottom and all these people are necessary to make this organization run or function now uh that is why uh i suppose it will be very easy for you now to connect the existence of a hierarchy the presence of what different kinds of people running the organization and the necessity for procedures rules and regulations to make the entire organization run smoothly as a result of this need the presence of the hierarchy uh to ensure that the organization runs smoothly you may encounter certain problems that 's why one of the problems you have encountered is what we call red tape  isn't that uh uh a fact that if you have a large the larger the organization what have you learned the larger the organization the  students answer in chorus more complex  of course the more complex the more important it is to make sure that each member of that organization knows what he or she is supposed to do isn't that right okay so therefore you must have what systems systems you must install systems so that this organization will be able to operate smoothly efficiently effectively if it 's an organization that is uh what whose goal is to deliver services  the services have to be  what is the test of the performance of the organization the what the results or the act   performance that services are actually delivered to communities that it 's supposed to serve how do you do that if you do not ensure a smooth flow of operations so they would like to be efficient they would like to be effective so you they set up what systems systems of procedures okay systems involving procedures involving rules how to how to now when they do that what happens is i it 's really for this purpose the objectives are noble di ba  they want to deliver in that that example that we presented let 's say the what i mean ano a department a government uh uh agency department of transportation for example or a department for social services 'no  so what happens is they want to deliver they want to perform well so they want to deliver what they 're supposed to deliver now uhm in the interest of performing well what happens is they become fle uhm inflexible you have set up systems and procedures right now people follow that to the letter so what happens is you have inflexibility okay and what happens is because this is a large organization with a lot of people with a lot of functions what happens is the procedures become long-winded right that 's why you are referring to red tape   parang matagal bago magawa ang isang bagay  take a look at something you are following up uh what we call paper-chase in government not only government educational systems all of the other institutions from religion so you have next education the economy and the political institutions all of these are what  large organizations or involves excuse me all of them involve large organizations which tend to become if they are not already what bureaucracies okay so all of them would have problems like this problems of wanting to perform well and as a result encountering other problems like inflexibility so they 're so inflexible such that what do we what do we see in in in the case of processing papers if the a certain person it 's like if this is your pi piece of paper and the routes for this paper is from person a to b to c to d before it goes out again to you  di ba okay so paper in paper out  what are the stages or the routes that are taken by this paper a person a b c d what happens what happens in actual situation these these are only four people usual or these these might be four persons or four offices or four units or four departments okay now what happens if there are departments to go to it would be more awful because there are people in the departments who take charge of that there are two or three persons in a department in a unit uh who have to take charge of that what is going to happen to the process it will be lengthier longer right  kaya sinasabi natin red tape di ba okay now what happens when when this piece of paper goes to a and if let us say a is not there  the whole system is held up okay the whole the processing is held up or delayed so you have to wait for a and sometimes the inflexibility can be carried to such an extent that nobody else takes the place of a so if a is on vacation for two weeks you 'll have to return maybe two weeks uh you 'll have to give two weeks more to the processing if it will take a matter of one week for paper in to paper out  what happens a will have to be out for two weeks and the the paper cannot move from a to b because a is absent so you 'll have to be to add one week of processing plus two weeks of absence by a so you have to have three weeks so it 's longer it takes longer now why does this happen because you have what very clear-cut procedures only a can sign something like that what is that for perhaps it is to meet another objective of the organization which is to make sure that things are done in proper  order order proper systems so you have a system of check and balance  hindi puwede na hindi dumaan dito for some kind of what approval sanction okay so you have uh a very long-winded process resulting from this particular instance so we talk about what in the bureaucracy you have red tapes in the bureaucracy the bureaucracy becomes so inflexible okay if the person is not there nobody else can take his place so the system gets derailed or gets delayed is held up okay now isn't that what we experienced take a look why why do we say that this is true even in religion take a look at our catholic church which is one big what  bureaucracy yes bureaucracy organization in the religious institution there are many others i suppose every other church organization would qualify as a bureaucracy the iglesia ni kristo is another big bureaucracy the different protestant churches would be bureaucracies in their own right 'no  so take a look at positions even what did i say the other time did i mention this about even in the in the heavens you have a hierarchy from the archangel down to the cherubs the cherubims 'no  with the head and then the word like that okay with the wings and then take a look at the catholic church from the pope down to the bishops archbishops all of them the priests down to the laity okay right so now take a look at educational institutions de la salle university isn't the situation the same you have what the president okay   vi executive vice-president  all the different vice pres all the positions and down to what the teachers the faculty down to the other personnel of the university down to your security guard all of them occupying what different ranks different positions that is uh that 's supposed to guarantee that this organization is going to flow is going to run smoothly so have haven't you tried uh to sample some red tapes during let 's say what what times  enrolment registration students give reactions  okay now we move from educational system to what  government government political organizations so you want to apply for a driver 's license at the l t o okay now that 's why you see what i am i would not want to rationalize i would never want to rationalize graft and corruption or bribery
Philippines	what we should do this morning is to just recap what we had discussed last meeting uhm arrive at some form of synthesis as to the the interests the leading interests of adolescents so probably what i can do is add more to what we have shared we had an interesting sharing last meeting about concerns and interests of adolescents uhm and i think predominant in our sharing last time was uhm  what was it uhm boy-girl relationships that particular area has been shared with i mean shared about extensively as well as parental overprotectiveness as far as that area is concerned now it leads me to another interest another leading interest of adolescents which is self-direction and in that area okay in that area we have expressed some of our major concerns for example uhm let me just go through uhm some of the uhm expressions of uh assertiveness of adolescents and uh i think uh one of the ways by which we one of the forms by which we express that assertion is our demand that we have privacy as far as males our males are concerned our private properties laughter are concerned our desire to be allowed to use the telephone and no extension no extension lines being opened when we are on the phone okay we we assert this and this is part of our desire to be i mean desire for self regulation okay so if this is not respected by parents it can become an area of dispute a source of dispute alright one other way by which i think this was shared last time one other area by which we ex we express our assertiveness is in the choice of our activities okay choice of our activities choice of companions choice of course vocation okay uh where we would like to go to school education and again if this is if this is uh not respected by parents or if parents encroach on this it becomes a source of an area of irritant as far as uh parent-child relationships are concerned this was mentioned last time okay uh another area which i think you also experience but which was not shared at all last time is the freedom to use your allowance the way you want okay is that still uh is that still uh what looked into by your parents do they do they investigate how you use your allowance at least that much i think many of you experience freedom greater freedom to spend your allowance the way you want to alright the wish for your own room okay di ba  and then the desire to lock it when you want to and open it when you want to di ba  yes rachel long question but microphone didn't catch it, about sharing a room with a sibling  okay so you 're saying that that 's a good a good way by which you can establish or foster better relationships with siblings  and uh well uh of course not sharing it with parents and i think that 's a uh sharing your room with parents at the adolescent stage is i think out of the question it 's unhealthy and uh you wouldn't want to do that laughter  okay alright one other way by which we we assert assert our our desire for self-regulation is uh yeah this was shared last time we feel very much distrusted if we feel very much distrusted if they ask us where are you going with whom are you going and uh where will you be going okay what time are you coming back okay uh in other words bottom-line the adolescent is saying trust me so that i can i can manage myself better if you don't trust me then all the more probably i will foul up okay so adolescence really is a time where we are most concerned about managing ourselves and testing the grounds for self-regulation just a minute teresa and if these are not allowed by parents then you have a rebel in your house yes just like uhm rooming in words sa  family namin words mom i have this party to go to 3 words i 'm gonna wear this dress  laughter  including that oo lahat set out lahat  okay  o sige  alright in other words you 're saying that uh if all the information all the data needed by your parents are already provided for or provided by you then it makes uh it provides 1 word  it will assure you words still  nasa 1 word ka na   1 word ka na of 'no  being given information okay let us add some more input these were the things shared last time 'no  let us add some some other leading interests and concerns and maybe you can check it out whether this really was a concern of yours uh primary and foremost is appearance isn't it okay adolescents are very concerned about appearance because from experience you know that it is a major factor in what in being accepted by others so there is this concern as to how you look uh body build skin complexion uh breath how you smell laughter okay isn't it uh also uh following latest fashion and style in fact you know some some adolescents uh worry a lot about you know being in  you see that adolescent culture can exert a lot of pressure on us don't you experience that what to wear uh if i wear this i am i feel i think i look baduy and i 'd rather not so there are two there are two courses of action one either one will withdraw or exert a lot of effort go go through uh a lot of uh maybe go out of your way to really be in  as far as your crowd is concerned what else what are other concerns as far as appearance is concerned body measurements i was talking about it legs waist arms di ba if you 're tall or short or things of that kind hair on the body you know so girls in particular go through a lot of inconvenience just so they will be good-looking okay one case in point those of you who wear braces di ba it 's such an inconvenient uh what is that it 's such an inconvenient appurtenance you know uh but i know of somebody who has been wearing braces for thirteen years some reactions from the students  thirteen thirteen more than two years now who has who wears braces here who can tell us do you know that who wears braces  dati wala na  uh anna how was it three years three years ano lang 'yon corrective  lang ano  okay lovelyn uh giselle laughter  how many years three and a half three and a half was it fun laughter okay that 's a case in point you know uh it 's you know you go out of your way to a lot through a lot of  nagsa suffer i mean a lot of inconvenience so your teeth will look nice okay uh and also a lot of expense laughter very expensive but but be but because you know there is a lot of premium attached to good looks uhm in other words one major obsession of adolescents is looks what about the guys what what are the what are the what are the concerns of the guys as far as as far as appearance is concerned oh don't tell me vic you are not interested in uh following fads and teenage what do you call that teenage fashion laughter  you did not think about it never thought of it with all your friends student answers but inaudible   ha  nothing out of the ordinary anyway uh this this is a major area of concern and worry of adolescents you want to look good you want to be accepted and you want to be you want to be uhm have a nice appearance because it is at this time that the opposite sex is also another major area of interest all right appearance i don't think there is any question about it all of us have gone i have gone through that you 're going through it and uh it is uh for me a an established fact now second another area of interest check this out uhm creative self-expression did you at one point write poems students answer in chorus  yes no laughter  uh going back now try to read your poems that you have written you know how okay poems uh letter writing uh stor short story writing and uh well another another outlet for self expression is the diary uh the diary now so do you think this is a lot okay let me put it this way a lot of creative work of adolescents are mainly attempts at self-expression emotional self-expression rather than sheer talent do you agree do you agree all of you did it 'no all of you went through it now do you think that you have talent laughter  there is the talent that really uh the real thing actually this is uhm our creative work our creative writings are of course indications of cognitive maturation okay they are signals you know they are signs that we are going through the cognitive maturation phase but at the same time it is serving us a very important function and that is emotional expression now do you ever wonder uh you have a question there rosa okay do you ever wonder why you also talk a lot during this stage adolescence particularly the early adolescence there is so much you know talking you just you know when you see friends parang you can't stop talking why there is just so much to talk about well again this is one form of expressing oneself when you talk on the phone it 's just endless and you know to the dismay of parents parents you know uh get very much irritated get very much uh uh pissed you know by by burning telephone lines but of course if you look at it from the perspective of emotional expression you know developing conversational skills and the like which is a need and interest of adolescents then perhaps parents can become more understanding about this now uh do you also wonder why televiewing okay is a very important occupation preoccupation movie going alright uh some did did some did you listen also to soap operas  laughter okay okay soap operas now what what is the function of this well do do you know what the function of it watching television romantic stories etcetera etcetera word i recall watching soap operas words they are able to distinguish the good and bad side of it well okay the good and bad side of it but you know we 're talking of adolescents what is the what is the function performed or played by this uh by watching television you know you like you like going to the movies it 's a very important activity a primary activity in fact why ina do you see what this is you know do you know that this is also a form of ventilation for adolescents a form of ventilation when you see let 's say your problems being acted out here you know by uh by by sharon cuneta by sheryl cruz and the like laughter  or uh you know uh on television for example manilyn reynes on uh  young love sweet love  you know that is one form by one way by which you can express yourself emotionally well it is not expression in the real sense of uh the term but it is one way of ventilating things that are already being experienced by the adolescent okay all right uhm a question from a student not caught on tape oh vocation choice of a course yes this again is one very important interest and concern of the adolescent maybe at this point you have made a decision already have you are you settled in the course that you are in or you 're still entertaining second thoughts about continuing on in the course or wanting to shift to some other you know some other uh areas of specialization it 's not uncommon though you know to hear of some some teenagers who in their second year have not at this at that point decided on a course i have seen adolescents who move from one course to the other fortunately probably for you here in la salle it 's not easy to shift okay it 's not easy they don't make it easy for you but in some other universities you know you can shift from one course to the other so that many are in the university for several years without finishing a course because they move from one they shift from one course to another i know of some people who even in their third year fourth year are still not happy about the course they landed in mainly probably because of the lack of intelligent decision-making process or lack of assistance you know in the in the uh decision-making process for a for a course 1
Philippines	we start on the pretext that uh language testing practices uh have always emanated from language teaching practices it 's the uh it 's usually the case that language testing has always followed language teaching traditions it has never been the other way around it 's not although allan davis in one of his articles once uh hinted that maybe the time uh should come when language testing should dictate language teaching trends i don't know when that would happen it hasn't happened  anyway we 'll start with uhm developments in language teaching or language education in general because it is those developments that have influenced uh proponents in language testing to conceive the way they did they 've done so to think of uh the one of the first notions of language uh the acquisition of language in that is that it 's structural so we uh the first developments of linguistics is uh structuralism the first considered uh considered to be the first school of linguistics among the first is uh the thought about the structuralism and growth of language meaning to say that language is uh predominantly the concern with language is its form not so much on its meaning meaning is there only as a crutch to the form that we understand as a form  uh the view is that language is a system of habits of communication and habits of communication consist of four linguistic layers the sound layer the phonology the morphological layer the word structure the syntactical layer the sentence structure and the lexical layer or lexicon or the vocabulary so it is uh anyone who wishes to learn a language must concentrate on these four layers of language sequentially uh uh in sequence you start out learning the sounds and then when you 're ready i mean you have acquired the sounds you 're ready for the next higher level which is the words word structure and when you 're ready for the word uh you have mastered the word structure then you can proceed to the sentence structures and so on so you don't uh uh like the notion in descriptive linguistics where you 'd have to start out with the sound system the written is only secondary and it 's the oral that is of prim primary importance so once you have acquired and have mastered what you 've heard then you 're ready to speak that 's why uh uh in structuralism the language teaching methodology that predominated uhm which is based on structuralist view of language is the audio lingual method which is audio listen lingual speak so listen first then speak that 's why it 's called audio lingual or in other words aural oral approach so these two are they mean the same the uh the uh approach to the learning of language through the sound system first and then when you have uh mastered the sound system you 're ready to speak then you 're ready to read and lastly to write that is why with the audio lingual method they they emphasize on the neat sequence of l s r w the teacher writes on the board  listen speak read and write never alter the sequence when you teach a language you always have to discuss listening first then speaking then reading and writing  then uhm of course there are other methods of teaching language that uh became known like suggestopedia like the total physical response approach the direct method  of course before everything a before the uh even the structural approach you have the uh the uh grammar translation approach  we learned it that way first in our time as uh young learners in school we learned through the grammar translation approach first and then uh then i think when we were in the intermediate grades that was when the structure approach uh became prominent i mean as far as i am as far as i can remember we started to learn language through the grammar translation approach then you had uh what 's this the silent way approach uhm  c l l community language learning c l l yes community language learning notional functional approach and then the notional functional approach so i think i emphasize that even though i say there are other methods that developed after the audio lingual method or the aural oral uh approach then in between we had the teacher writes on the board t p r we had suggestopedia we had c l l we had silent way direct method and whatever else then prominent the next prominent kind of method of language teaching was the notional functional approach the teacher writes on the board  now why why do we distinguish this from the previous what is the uh legacy of the notional functional approach in uh does anybody know meaning meaning here we think of a l m as focusing on form form then meaning meaning is there only as uh an aid there to the understanding of form now came the notional functional approach which emphasized meaning meaning uh in fact form was out of the question if you recall uh during the era that uh concentrated on the notional functional approach they say it didn't matter how you speak that language it didn't matter how you listen to the language what matters is whether you used you put across the message the meaning and and what matters is you understood what you 've heard or what you 've read never mind grammar uh that was uh the uh outstanding feature of the notional functional approach is that it concentrated too much on meaning to the neglect of grammar that is why i remember that of uh the proponent of uh the notional functional approach was david wilkins teacher writes on the board  the notional functional approach is a british tradition and uh david wilkins himself realized the shortcomings of the notional functional approach in that because of too much emphasis on meaning the con the result was uh poor grammar so it that that was a bleak uh fate for grammar that is why david wilkins was among the first to because he realized the shortcoming of the notional functional approach he was the early proponent of communicative teaching so together with this uh word  widdowson widdowson they collaborated to uh develop the communicative approach so we can say that the notional functional approach is uh a springboard to the development of the communicative approach of of course the communicative approach is so unlike also the the previous in that this one says form first than meaning meaning first never mind form then with the communicative approach the teacher writes on the board meaning first plus students answer form right so it is form then meaning meaning never mind form then meaning first then form so you recall that uhm it was important to note functions of language functions they must have meaning i mean a message function how do you function in language is not so much the understanding of form but more on the usage the use of form to function in language that 's the thrust of the communicative approach it 's not so much that you know so much in structure but whether you can perform the structure that you know effectively so function first is identified then the relevant grammar or language forms that go with every function will be identified in in essence that 's the communicative approach identify the meaning first the function first and then identify the form that goes with the function can you recall uhm john oller who was one of the first uh linguists who said that uhm you recall oller was a proponent of integrated testing integrated testing he said uh anyone can score ninety-five percent or even one hundred percent in a language or grammar test but that is no guarantee that that person who scored so high in a language test can ever function in a language can ever perform you know the extent that he knows of the form of language so what was more important then i think that was the beginnings of the realization that what was more important was not knowledge of form but the ability to function with that knowledge of form so oller 's i think is pivotal oller 's view of a distinction between integrated test testing and in discrete point testing was pivotal many people realize that really if you think of it yeah someone can be very good at grammar someone can be very good at you know uh performing in written paper and pencil test but you cannot be ve very sure that that person can really use the language so in we use another uh nomenclature we say we need form use usage i recall dell hymes one of the early anthropological linguists who really exerted a lot of influence uh in the developments of social linguistics who said there are rules of use without which rules of usage would be useless  so i think i have said already in the in this the same class minus the two of you the two anecdotes that i 've had to really uh exemplify the importance of what dell hymes said uhm i recall a friend uh we we just graduated from teaching from p n u she was assigned to her school in antipo antipolo rizal my friend is a beauty and until now she 's still a beauty break in the recording  the american peace corps volunteer before he came to the philippines had a crash course in tagalog in sacramento california so he was really well-armed linguistically he knew that uh the kind of tagalog that he need he needed to uh get along with uh teachers in antipolo rizal naturally when he that american peace corps volunteer first saw my friend he was attracted kasi nga beauty eh  uh pardon me lin uh shaolin i said something in tagalog okay so he said can i visit you tonight of course my friend was elated that he would be visited by an american she would be visited by an american so anyway that night it was a a celebration of sorts in the neighborhood because at that time it was a big thing to have an american for a suitor and you know in the provinces the houses are built such that you have a balcony and the balcony is the place where suitors are entertained i think for the reason that laughter if anybody sees you there you cannot do hanky panky you cannot do some foolishness there so they were there my friend was entertaining the american peace corps volunteer in the balcony at the house now sev he came at seven o'clock eight o'clock no move in the provinces the rule is you visit only for an hour no less uh no more i mean no more go home laughter  and then you go home laughter  so the american was not aware of this rule he stayed on my friend of course was aware of this rule but she was willing to violate the rule because she was enjoying the peace corps volunteer 's company nine o'clock came still no move to leave the two were enjoying themselves the parents were getting uh laughter panicky what would the neighbors say you know why are we tolerating this but of course my my friend 's parents did not know english and again even if they knew english in the provinces they are very timid they will not uh venture to they would not venture to be offensive to the guest anyway so they were panicky inside my friend and the the peace corps were enjoying themselves ten o'clock came still no move to leave at that point really the my friend 's parents were really really uh very embarrassed what the neighbors would say eleven o'clock laughter no move to leave no move no move to leave at all and this of course the american did not have in his training he wasn't trained for social meanings he was trained only for linguistic meanings and so at when eleven o'clock came and still the american peace corps volunteer was not to leave uhm making move to leave my uh my my my friend 's parents started to do paralinguistic signs because they could not they didn't know english they were again uh not very confident with what they the little english that they knew so my one of them started to to close with a bang the window within view of the balcony with a bang no effect laughter  the american did not know that laughter  then next they did was to roll a mat in the sala again within view of the balcony no effect then they turned off the lights in the sala not not in the balcony yet still no effect  your friend was deliberately ignoring these she was deliberate she was willing to be reprimanded to be scolded later so uh i think that was the last straw they were really exasperated  so my my friend 's mother approached my friend it was really uh too much already they reached the point where they could no longer tol tolerate the peace corps volunteer so my friend 's mother went to her and pinched laughter her ear one of the ears paralinguistic pa rin 'yan   oo paralinguistic pa rin 'yan  so my friend said you better go now laughter 
Philippines	so it is now appropriate for the weekend it is going now to be a weekend that you will be doing some more in statistics are you ready okay take this down the following data the following data are the ages the following data are the ages of a sample of twenty-five automobile sales people in the united states and a sample of twenty-five automobile sales people in western europe  you got it 'no  alright let me repeat  the following data are the ages of a sample of twenty-five automobile sales people in the united states and a sample of twenty-five automobile sales people in western europe  now let me write the data on the board the teacher writes on the board  the different data that refer to the ages of drivers in the united states and in western europe okay the requirements you ready for the requirements  the students answer in chorus not yet  alright finished class okay now what you should be doing is you 're going to discuss the findings of the data that you have okay you have the data representing the ages of uh sales people in the united states and in eu in western europe so you are going to display the data separately by a words  second you have to calculate the mean the median the first quartile the third quartile the range the inter-quartile range and the coefficient of variation these will be discussed today number three the shape of the distribution whether it is negatively skewed positively skewed and then number four discuss the findings how do you discuss the findings you are going to compare the uh the two data sets the ages of u s drivers versus the ages of western europe is the homework clear alright so for today we are going to discuss the measures of variation because we finished measures of central tendency last wednesday both for the uh grouped and the ungrouped data you recall that we calculated the mean the median the teacher writes on the board uh the mode for both grouped and ungrouped data okay now tell me what 's the difference between grouped and ungrouped data what is the difference between grouped and ungrouped data susan uhm grouped data are characterized by words like for example you have words  alright by grouped data we mean data that are arranged into a what frequency distribution by frequency distribution we arrange the data according to categories or classes and then we tally the number of variables or the number of values that would be included in that particular class okay so now we said last wednesday also that if we will only be dealing with measures of central tendency some problems may come up like the problem on employee a and employee b wherein both have the same average uh performance but if you look at the variability of each value then you would know that one employee is better than the other employee why because we looked at the uh dispersion or the spread of the scores from a point of reference called the mean the point of reference class may not only be the mean it could also be the median or the mode but the usual procedure is to compare every value from the mean okay now let 's begin the measures of variation or variability alright the first and the simplest is the range here alright let me see i will add oh here is the range the first measure of variability is the range if you 're given a set of scores class immediately you calculate the range what is the range somebody in the class answers but is inaudible  highest minus lowest very good  the teacher writes on the board x highest minus x lowest it is the distance of the highest score from the lowest or vice versa how far away is the highest from the lowest so that if i have case a let us say this is one class the highest score here let us say is a hundred the lowest score is ninety-five or let 's say ninety so what is the range the range is  the students answer in chorus ten  i have another case b  the teacher writes on the board the highest score is ten the lowest score is zero  ten what is the range the range is also ten i have case c alright the highest score is a hundred the lowest score is zero what is the range  the students answer in chorus one hundred  one hundred okay now we have three groups of students here we have three classes we said the highest in case a is a hundred the lowest is ninety the range is ten in case b the highest is ten the lowest is zero range is ten in case c highest is a hundred lowest is zero the range is a hundred now can you have a description of the abilities of the classes here yes manuel describe to me the three classes uh case a and b case a uh the variable of uh more or or less pareho lang words  so that more or less the students are of the same ability case what about case b are we not going to discuss case b for case a case b pareho lang ang average nilang lahat pare-pareho lang ah maliliit ang difference nila eh pero whereas case c word case b mabababa   whereas case a words case b mabababa uhm so therefore sa isang range equal walang masyadong words  oh continue manuel what uh what can you conclude from the range you 're saying that in case a the abilities of the students are about the same as well as case b the abilities of the students are also about the same what about case c the abilities of the students are what varied are varied right class varied you have a very bright kid and you have i will not say it any more laughter  now in other words this group is a variable group the variability is so large the larger the range the more variable is the group do you understand the smaller the range the less variable is the group the more similar is the group that is why if we are going to describe case a and case b we have a homogeneous group a homogeneous group same ability group same ability in case c we have a heterogeneous group heterogeneous group so that if you are given only the range you are given an information about the variability of the class or of the group is this clear uh is this clear so that 's the simplest but the range class only depends on two values on the highest and the lowest you really don't know how the values in between vary that is the limitation do you understand the limitation of the range is is that you would not know how the values between the highest and the lowest va vary so if this is your highest and this is your lowest you know the distance you know the spread of the highest versus the lowest but the the scores the teacher taps on the board in between you don't know this is the limitation that 's why we have to go farther down let 's go to a measure of dispersion which is the variance let us go immediately to the variance number three the standard deviation and number four the coefficient of variation these are the four okay now the inter-quartile range is defined as is also one of the measures inter-quartile range now we to okay up third quartile right so q three minus we also to okay up first quartile right minus first quartile this is your inter-quartile range it is a measure of uh variability because if we ever say this is your normal curve this is your q two this is your q one this is your q three it is really q three minus q one this is really your inter-quartile range q three minus q one do you understand so let me repeat that this is q two the median first quartile third quartile inter-quartile range is q three minus q one so in other words this is the the inter-quartile range okay now but we will not emphasize on that we will emphasize on two three and four we will focus our attention on two three and four the variance standard deviation and coefficient of variation alright  let me begin by a very simple example alright let 's say the teacher writes on the board let 's say we have a small department store and uh we are going to record the sales the daily sale of this small store let 's pick one item and the item is the designer jean alright let us record the daily sale of the designer jean of this particular store let 's say on monday this store sold one pair only of designer jean on tuesday two pairs on wednesday three on thursday four on friday five you know there are other items also but we are only concentrating on one specific item that is the designer jean so if we take the average sale of this particular unit what is our daily average daily sale how many  the students answer in chorus three  three so how do you get the mean so we take the summation of x the teacher writes on the board three six ten fifteen summation x divided by n or fifteen divided by five is three average daily sale is three three pairs of designer jean now if i want to know how each day is doing each day 's sale is doing in comparison to the average i am going to take the deviation from the mean right so that let us prepare another column which is x minus x bar what am i doing here i want to compare monday 's sale with the average daily sale on monday they sold only one design one pair of designer jean and if you compare it with the average monday 's sale is below the average by how many pairs  the students answer in chorus two  by two because you sold two pairs below the average you have a negative deviation right this is actually one minus three this is x is one x bar is three one minus three so you would have a negative deviation minus two because you have a negative deviation we want to make this positive how do we make a negative positive in algebra  the students answer in chorus taking the absolute value  taking the absolute value or squaring right how do you how do you get rid of a negative value in algebra take the absolute absolute value or another way is by squaring so let us square the deviation from the mean so that minus two becomes now plus four the actual deviation is really two two below because you sold only one pair and the average is three pairs so one minus three is minus two but we don't want to handle negative deviations we want to get rid of the negative sign so we are going to square and squaring a negative means positive four minus two becomes positive four now you say this store sold two pairs and if you compare this with the average this is now two minus three square and this will give us one plus one on wednesday the store sold exactly equal to the average you hit the average on wednesday so this is three minus three square and this is zero deviation on thursday the store sold four pairs and the average is three therefore you have your one pair above the average on thursday alright so we compare four minus three square this is one and on friday we sold how many five pairs and the average daily sale is three so that what is the deviation from the mean inaudible answer  two pairs right above square that becomes five this is now five minus three square becomes four now do you know what is happening on this column here yes or no you know what is going on here what is going on here ms viduya what are we doing here we 're getting the deviation from each other in other words we have some pairings every single daily sale with the average daily sale in in statistics usage we 're taking the deviation from the mean but that is really very technical if you want it to put it in ordinary language we 're really comparing every single value every daily sale with the average daily sale this is in ordinary language in statistics we 're saying we 're taking the deviation from the mean but sometimes other people will not understand that what are what are they doing if they they they 're taking the deviation from the mean we 're actually comparing every single value this is the sale from the average daily sale that makes it more meaningful to you right
Philippines	that becomes our background against which we can discuss uh judge the different theories that we will uh encounter when we do a review of the history of grammatical theory but without a measuring rod you won't know how to evaluate 'no  so that 's why we have to do also a little bit of linguistic analysis but this is not a course on linguistic analysis it 's a it 's a course on uh on grammatical theory so it 's actually a consideration of the various uh grammatical theories that were worked out by man in in the effort to understand the structure of language and how to describe language as efficiently as possible so uh we have the first uh the c here we are now on c because we finished a and b and so we uh we 'll talk about linguistic analysis and uh we find out that in our modern approach to language uh description we identify the different linguistic units in terms of their composition their distribution and their uh various functions okay uh okay now we say for instance p is a phoneme and it has aspirated p in english in initial position followed by a vowel before a vowel then it is uh in after an initial uh consonant it is p without aspiration these are the different distributions in initial position when it is followed by a vowel it is aspirated when it is uh after a uh consonant like spit spit it 's not uh before consonant uh it is not uh aspirated so there 's non no aspiration we can actually put that writes on board but that 's very narrow transcription then in final position we we did say that it is always released a big difference between that and english uh eh in tagalog in tagalog you say takip  we don't release the p ha takip uh uh halip ganon   ulap   halip   ha   ulap   ulap  you see p is not released so fina in final position in final position okay so this is just distribution 'no  now the phoneme p is in contrast with the voiced counterpart which is b  now how do we how do we uh identify the p the phoneme p  because it is bilabial we will we 're going to go into the details of this then it is stop stop then it is voiceless you see how you breathe and then aspirate it here aspirated plus aspiration in uh initial position uh and in final position uh released as as opposed to tagalog which is unreleased 'no  so now what are we doing when we say it is a stop and it 's bilabial it 's voiceless what what are we do students answer briefly but inaudible  this is the composition yeah these are the various features that compose the phoneme p  so first by composition and then we do it by distribution cough   distribution  and then by function because it has a contrastive function in other words uh p and b in english are they are they 're signals uh minimum signals of distinction they are not themselves meaningful but they distinguish meaning pit and bit pit and bit in english would distinguish so there is differential differential uh uh meaning that that they signal the difference between pit and bit 'no  but in themselves phonemes do not have meanings okay but now cough they can also have referential meaning in that they refer to pit and not to bit  in other words bit is a different kind of experience that they refer to as different from pit which is a difference in meaning okay so now i have given you we i find that we have to do some articulatory phonetics if only to so page three of the handout uh if only to make you uh aware that this was the result of a lot of work by panini he he was panini he he was a hindu scholar who tried to uh uh his name is panini  no pa pa that nasal pa pangini the the eh dot under here this means the nasal nasal vowel uh a nasal uh word panini nini nini oo  he he he did he actually uh analyzed the vocal organs speech organs very accurately 'no and you see what happens is the diaphragm from the air hits the uh the lungs and then we ex exhale uh some air 'no  now what happens is like an instrument like a flute 'no  we we can modify the vocal tract so the pharynx and it goes to the oral cavity normally when it 's done then the uvula uh blocks the nasal cavity okay so the vocal cords are the ones that uh vibrate they are the ones that are very oo they produce vibration 'no and and from the shape of the uh vocal cords you can have whispering when when you whisper the vocal cords are fixed and there is a little outlet at the bottom 'no because the vocal cords have a two uh what do you call these caritoids  those are two bones that uh are more or less triangular in shape and when they do like this uh you you have what is called whispering  and in and there is a a little bit of air that that escapes and that is word harsh sound speaker breathes to demonstrate his point ha ha ha  yeah that the position of the vocal cords is like that but normally the vocal cords are open and that 's the one that vibrates and that causes vibrations in the air   air  and that 's the one that gives you high frequency or low frequency depending on how how often yeah the pitch varies depending on how how often the the vibrations occur if it 's very high sound the vibrations are very fast if it 's very low sound the vibrations are slow are slow  slow  okay uh then there from the stream of air coming up from the diaphragm and the lungs ha  then you you have some what is happening is like that something like this 'no like uh like the saxophone but in the saxophone the air this thing is coming from there not and not this one is the opposite the air is coming from inside 'no going out then this this uh oral cavity becomes a resonating chamber and there is a velum here that that the velar velum is that middle bell-shaped organ that if you look at the mirror and look at you open your mouth you will see we call it tonsils a student chuckles   uvula   students answer in chorus uvula  the uvula in french that uvula can be made to vibrate speaker demonstrates the vibration oh that 's so the speaker demonstrates the vibration the r in in a in in french is made by making the uvula vibrate o red o red o yes o red oo  but otherwise the function of the uvula is to close the nasal cavity so that you have a clear oral passage 'no  okay so there is what uh you have 'no  now what happens is that there is a series of occlusions and uh and partial occlusions so that you produce the different sounds of speech but the main thing is there is an instrument for making noise 'no  that that 's what 's called uh the speech organs 'no  they are the ones that are really responsible for articulating language and because these speech organs have to move uh ther there is the tongue blade there is the teeth and so on so the the speech organs have to move from one position to the other in order to produce the sounds that 's what causes linearity in what we hear because there is a sequencing of before and after because the movements of the speech organs uh also shift from one position to the other to produce uh these various sounds okay now you you look at it 'no the look at the uh consonant chart now here is a consonant chart uh and then we will look at our uh our sagittal diagram it 's called sagittal diagram  that 's it 's called sagittal because sagitta in in in uh latin means the arrow it 's the side diagram  sagittarius yeah sagittarius yes from that that same uh root see if you uh halve the uh if you divide the uh face of man or the head of a man can you get the sagittal uh diagram of here 'no but you see uh if you look at this again i 'll come back to the consonants the the very first type of sound tha that is produced is bilabial sound so what what is involved in the production of bilabial sound  upper lip and lower lip   the two lips upper and lower lips okay there you see at the on your diagram okay the two lips okay now if it is uh de dent uh  dental sound no labiodental   students answer in chorus labiodental  no the lower lip  lower lip and the upper teeth  fa fa fa   f fricative or the fricative f that becomes labiodental 'no now interdental  teeth upper no the tongue the the uh thing for instance when you say thing thing oh  upper and lower teeth tip of the tongue the tip of your tongue is between the two teeth the upper and lower teeth 'no laughter   and lower teeth  yeah okay then uh after that uh you have uh  alveolar so that when you uh make thin then and fat and that and then pit and bit then you come to alveolar the alveolar means that your tongue the front blade of the tongue is touching this alveolar ridge there is a ridge at the back of your teeth the gums the gums on the top at the back of the teeth are this is called the alveolar ridge  and in english you say cat ten ten but not in tagalog in tagalog we say ten ten  it 's dental  dental oo   ten ten tao tao we we hit the t   maraming tao  no laughter we laugh when we do that because that 's what the americans say tao mga anak tao   maraming tao   maraming tao because they are used to putting the tip of the tongue against the alveolar ridge   students answer in chorus alveolar ridge  okay that 's what produces that uh what do you call the uh sound of english t and d uh it 's alveolar then alveo-palatal sh and dz  what happens is the the middle part of the tongue is put up against the roof of the mouth 'no  uh sh you hear this the shin shin and chin chin and chin uh in chin there is an element of stop but this one is friction yes friction chin or uh vision vision   vision   vision ther there is a d and then the k and the g the back part of the tongue is against the  velum against the velum oh the velum is that part of the section of the back part of the mouth that is soft that 's called velum 'no  when we were students when we were students we had to to use a uh a mirror and look and fix it  mirror  but you are not actually going to be phoneticians so you will have no exercises in phonetics because we had hours and hours of it transcribing what we hear sounds of different languages and we had to be very particular now uh there is such a thing as narrow transcription and broad transcription   narrow transcription is what we call phonetics 'no  everything we hear we symbolize but in phonemics 'no we are concerned with the phoneme and we are concerned with classes of sounds here you look at this class of sound p has this different variants 'no these different variants p aspirated uh p non-aspirated and p released in final position these are only variants of the same uh p the class of p and you know english speakers do not distinguish between p aspirated and p non-aspirated they cannot hear that they they still consider that p but strange strange because they would they 're expecting that explosion to be there in in the initial position if you they don't hear it they think it 's a b that is pronounced because b is not aspirated yeah  aspirated
Philippines	what skills can you claim to take  shooting shooting in terms of what inaudible answer  composition what else  timing and editing composition timing possibility another one is editing okay another skill is what sound-mixing sound-mixing sound-mixing okay so in the word project we 've sort of summarized these skills so we 're moving into two other important skills for shooting which is lighting and recording today we 're going to discuss just the basics about lighting the more advanced uhm discussion of lighting will be the cinematic course next term then next week will be recording okay we 'll do a little bit of recording today but we 'll talk more about recording next week that 's march thirteen okay  i 'm presuming in this course this talk on lighting between now and before we have the break you had already some idea of lighting in your fotogra course code for photography courses right yes fotoup course code  some of you took up fotoup course code  so a lot of this is basic it 's a review and because it 's basically a review i can ask you to demonstrate already certain concepts how many have taken fotogra course code here okay and some of you have taken additional fotoup course code  so what we 'll do is review and the best way to review is to do a hands-on review okay much also of this discussion is taken from this reading which i will give you hodgeton pages eighty-nine to one o six please take that down you 've got to read that hodgeton page eighty-nine to one o six  your basic material for producing images is light right okay without light then you could not be able to produce a subject the image light interacts with the chemicals light interacts with print in all stages light is critical for that was as far as still photography is concerned what do you think is going to be now the major difference between light for still photography and light for moving pictures the cinematography what is it about light that is different light as we see in reality with light that we see in film or in pictures  and what do we do about that difference in the medium of film or video flores sir the light varies so you have to always uhm fix the setting of the light with the uhm word  okay what is the basic difference between light as we see all around us and light that you see in pictures in film artificial  is it totally artificial even if you use artificial light sources what is your aim you highlight the subject whereas light in real life uncontrollable yes beyond control alright very good light in real life is uncontrollable light in real life is dispersed light in real life has no direction light in real life just falls and surrounds you whereas light in film and pictures has a certain control you are after a certain effect and usually the effects would be number one to make the subject visible number two to be able to separate the subject foreground from background so to create effect number three to accentuate certain features of the subject for example you want to accentuate texture you want to accentuate form you want to accentuate uh tone of a subject and fourthly the most important characteristic of light in film or video would be to create a certain mood okay so you have those four basic purposes of light in film could you run that again what 's the first one sales uhm make the subject visible uh to make the subject visible okay number two cuison to differentiate words  okay in other words creative depth number three lim accentuate texture tone okay then number four paragao to create a certain mood to create a certain mood okay so with these four purposes in mind our question now is how do we control the light what is our guideline in controlling the light first let 's talk about basic quote and unquote rules in lighting 'no  as with editing camera movement sound-mixing what do you think is going to be our basic guideline in lighting i mentioned certain three things editing camera movement sound-mixing what was our guideline in the three in order for it to look good  how do we know editing a good cut is is well done how do we know that sound-mixing is well done how do we know that the camera movement is very well done  continuous what is the key word we 've been operating on inaudible answers  no  of course there are those are ways of achieving continuity it should be  it should be invisible in other words lighting does not call attention to itself in the same way that editing camera movement and sound-mixing does not call attention to themselves okay so what do we mean by invisible lighting  does that mean there will be no lighting chuckle  montalban the better uhm they don't see that we 're uhm since it 's not natural they don't see it as not natural it looks like it 's part of the whole scene  alright so light when you say invisible lighting lighting should be as realistic as possible or approximating the natural light that we would find in the scene  lacson you have a question yeah but can it be possible like you want let 's say you want to exaggerate light so you want to make it more to look fancier you could play with the lights so it would look there is a certain context where that is acceptable words okay like for example a a scene wherein the whole style of the film is purposely expressionistic when we say something is expressionistic you want to show your feelings for the subject so you want to show distortion you want to show exaggeration if that style is consistent throughout the film then the lighting should go with that style okay nevertheless you still don't notice the lighting working that way okay because you would say that for that kind of a situation that would be the right lighting if you use a realistic lighting in an expressionistic setting what happens you notice the difference you notice the lighting so as much as possible you try to notice it okay so that should be the first rule lighting should be as realistic in a scene as possible the second thing would be never state what you can imply never state what you can imply what do we mean by this do not be so literal batac do not be so literal okay how can lighting be literal and how can be lighting how can lighting be implicit so we can talk of literal lighting we can talk of implied lighting actually implied lighting is not the term the term is indirect lighting  when does lighting become literal when does lighting become uh implicit in the scene batac since you mentioned it  i can't word the word  o lacson i think it 's word time words  it 's artificial so you 're saying implicit lighting is like artificial yeah you don't have to use real sources yeah okay in a sense 'no  but what we mean here is that when we say yes ballesteros not necessarily like uhm combination of everything the script and everything let 's say uhm it 's dark something like that and then the becomes dark so okay let us look at an example from uh kisapmata   o you notice right we have a poster here uh charito solis charo santos and vic silayan okay this is an example of lighting which is not direct but implied so tell me what you think that is i 'll be turning off the volume so you can concentrate on lighting  okay so what did you see on the screen rocha what did you see on the screen well it 's dark and the faces are just ano lightened okay do we see every detail on the face no do we also see every detail in the room  the students answer in chorus no  okay so how how do you connect that example with the rule that we just talked about or with the guideline the second one never state what you can imply sales long response from the student unclear  alright so you don't have to light everything in order for a scene to be completely visible you can choose to light and emphasize certain parts of a scene okay also you notice the way the light is manipulated makes use of a lot of shadows in fotogra course code what do you call this when you do portraiture with a lot of shadows you took your fotogra course code  what do you do to the subject if you select certain parts of the face to be lit you allow the shadow to form part of the shape of the face of the person what do you call that technique students answer inaudible  what there 's a word you mold molding okay you mold the face in other words you let the light and shadow interact so as to reveal the shape or the texture or the figure of the subject okay so in that particular case we did not have to see the entire room we knew they were in the room we did not have to see every detail on the face of course for that particular situation the important thing was the dialogue so the lighting could have gone that way otherwise if the situation changed maybe the lighting could have been different okay third one would be a third guideline would be determine and motivate the placement of the source of light we usually call the source of light the key light  the major source of light the key light some cinematographers when they light a scene they would usually start with the major source of light because around that light they would build other lights so for example if two people are talking by the window as was happening here in kisapmata if we see the window in the scene then naturally if it 's morning we would expect that the light the key light would be placed by the window because naturally there would be that would be the source okay if it 's a night interior where would you put the light if the set is interior and night time where would be the natural source of light  outside  let 's say i don't see the windows i just want to see the room  the lamp the lamp okay so the lamp the table lamp would be the source of light  can there also be an outside meaning from outside i mean say the moon  okay   example  so for example if the scene would show the window 'no or you want to suggest there 's a window then you would make  put light put light there but that would not be the major source of light you 're just highlighting that however if the action happens by the window and you see the window that would be the major source of light okay otherwise if you don't show it you can always suggest it but if it 's happening at night you can have the table lamp as the main source of window which means that the brightness of the lamp should be bright enough to cover the entire scene and you would add other lights around in the room to boost up that major source of light okay a fourth uh guideline would then be plan the lighting of the film in advance  since you 're only not you 're working not only with the single source of light you have to figure out then how to coordinate the other lights one good practice would be to go to a place and observe the kind of lighting that goes on you know uh for example going to a place at sunset how do the shadows fall how bright how fast does the light go or morning you 'll notice if you go to a specific room like your own room how many have locked themselves up in their own room the whole day students laugh  have you ever noticed the changes of light natural light in the room i 'm talking about light through the window the quality of light in the morning is different from the quality of light at noon and as it goes into evening and even at night there are different changes of light at night the light at twilight is different from the light at midnight is different from the light at around two or three in the morning or the light at moon night full moon night or the light on a half-moon night there 's still some relation 'no  and a good cinematographer like a designer is able to give you those shades of difference 'no  as for yourselves since you 're starting we 're not after those subtle shades of difference what we 're after first is that you can make the subject visible we know who 's in the frame you can make the subject look interesting and when you place the lights there 's a reason for placing the lights that way any question for those four guidelines okay let 's go now to uh sources of light and properties of light basically we only really have two sources of light in fact for every scene there 's always one key light  why is that so why can't we have two key lights what are we trying to duplicate in real life remember we said lighting should be as realistic as possible so why is it that in every scene no matter what the source of light is there 's only one key light
Philippines	we continue with the lecture on herbert marcuse and we told you that there were three influences on him namely hegel 'no freud and marx last time we uhm explained to you the influence of hegel on uh marcuse and we told you among other things that for hegel everything is in absolute unrest and so therefore nothing is static nothing is congealed but everything will continue to flow today we 're going to take up the influence of freud and if possible also of marx on marcuse this is found in the book of marcuse entitled eros and civilization   eros and civilization  what in a gist is the influence of freud on marcuse first of all according to marcuse this is marcuse 's interpretation of freud that according to freud there are always two forces in human nature that are at loggerheads one with another the positive is called the eros and the negative is called thanatos  you all know what eros means in greek  eros and thanatos writes on the board   eros means love in greek  thanatos means death but here in this particular idea freud is trying to tell us that in every human undertaking there are two forces that are continually battling one with another one is eros and he calls eros the builder of culture the builder of culture writes on the board  and thanatos is supposed to be the destroyer however he says the stronger the eros in other words when eros is on an upbeat thanatos is on a downbeat if eros is down then thanatos is up what does it mean let us take for instance the building of culture it 's something interesting because you know you never i 'm sure uh looked upon it in this manner look at the way marcuse explains it he says culture and civilization require a sublimation a desexualization for culture obtains a great part of the mental energy it needs by subtracting from sexuality what does that mean it means that if i want to be a great writer if i want to be a great artist if i want to be a great researcher and scholar i cannot be at the same time be oversexed meaning to say sexuality is energy right the building of culture requires energy if i already spend a lot of my energy on scholarliness on art on culture and all that what happens i have already removed part of my erotic energy and what would happen later on there is nothing left if this is down that will go up meaning to say i 'll become destructive i will become cruel why because i don't have any sexual expression i uh do my work all the time all day and all night i have no time for play and what happens that energy which is repressed will express itself in cruelty in violence you might ask what is marcuse trying to say simple he says how can you explain that the countries that are most cultured are the most destructive how can you explain germany supposed to be one of the most cultured in the world was capable of exterminating six million jews how do you explain that here is a country full of culture produced the three b 's bach brahms and beethoven produced schiller goethe how come that it is capable of exterminating six million jews and the explanation of marcuse is because the erotic energy was so repressed so suppressed and that energy had to go and be expressed sublimated in another way and that is why he says look at the most cultured countries in the world they are the most cruel and violent meaning to say do not look to the you know the little uh individuals like uh pol pot like idi amin these are little you know little uhm butchers what did pol pot really do maybe he exterminated let us say one hundred skulls one thousand skulls ten thousand skulls have you ever seen a picture wherein we have here a an entire wardrobe all containing skulls and we are alarmed we say what cruelty oh my goodness what are ten thousand skulls against six million in other words the small minds of pol pot and idi amin were not enough to be able to to prove enough cruelty to be genocidia  why because it did not really have what it took but he says look at germany the one that has really produced the great musicians the great philosophers remember you count hegel fichte schelling etcetera  they were the ones who had produced the most cruelty what is the reason because of this energy of eros that was so suppressed they built culture they had no time for play they had no time for sexuality and so what happens that sexuality that was suppressed that energy for sexuality that was suppressed will come out in thanatos  alright you know let me give you an instance you might say does that mean that uh i should therefore give way to my sexual energies so that i will not be cruel well in in a way let 's look at it from the individual point of view like your fathers your fathers your own fathers a father that works very hard a father that is morally upright a father that has no vices is usually is a father who is a little strict and sometimes cruel with his children why because he says son daughter if i can do it why can't you look i work eight hours a day i do everything for you i 've no time for play and that 's the reason you 're prosperous but look on the other hand on the father who has a number two or maybe a number three or who gambles who drinks he is very kind to his children why because he wants to salve his conscience he wants to say look i 'm indulging myself let me at least be kind to you how much will you need for this here what is true of individuals is true of countries and marcuse is telling us very clearly the explanation why the countries that are most cultured are without our meaning to underestimate them they 're the most cruel now you might say germany is there any other country that might have been another example the answer is yes and that is the united states the united states the united states is supposed to be the bastion of liberty the united states the americans are supposed to be the apostles of what fair play democracy but look what they did to vietnam and now to iraq but never mind iraq for a while let me concentrate on vietnam vietnam what did they do to this small town called my lai writes on the board  you know what they did to my lai they razed it to the ground why because the vietcongs were coming and they told the people of my lai we are going to burn your town in order to save it what kind of logic is that  i 'm going to kill you so that you won't be sick   ha  and that 's exactly what it did it dropped napalm bombs on my lai up to now there is nothing that will grow in my lai and you might say how can the united states such an advanced cultured country how can it do that could it be that something that you will not hear that uh africa ghana or where did idi amin come from something that cambodia cannot do you might say oh my goodness the most primitive are the most cruel that is not true the most civilized the most cultured are the most cruel yes what about uhm they were words japan something very uhm sexually promiscuous yet uh we had also the words   uh it is the time element that changes that oversexuality came after they had already conquered everything so what happened the soldiers became soft they had no work to find anymore so what happened they started to have catamites look it up in the dictionary if you don't know what a catamite is they started to indulge in in sexuality why because there was nothing else but before that look at the legions of rome the legions of rome were the most uh uhm how shall i put it the most disciplined why because they had a lot to conquer and because they had a lot to conquer they were more they were more disciplined they were sturdier now after that when everything was finished they are now starting to decline uhm if you uh get hold or if you uhm attended my lecture on arnold toynbee sometime ago you would have known that that 's the way it is with civilizations there is a kind of birth of civilizations genesis then a build-up and then once the apex is reached there is a tendency to fall down this has happened in many countries rome rome at first it was a building of culture the moment they reached the apex there is no other way to go but down now let 's go to iraq the united states what did it do to iraq what did it do the united nations just said look uh you 're going to save kuwait but what did it do it bombed baghdad of course you and i were secretly rejoicing wasn't it of course you and i were saying oh down with saddam but that 's not the point the point is how can a country like the united states allow such an idea of exterminating almost almost exterminating an entire country just because of kuwait this is an example of marcuse 's explanation that the most civilized countries are the most destructive not the primitive countries but the most cultured countries like germany wherefrom he came and the united states which is now his second country do you have any questions about it this is a this is a way of explaining that uhm that 's the way it goes the more civilized you are the more cruel you are because take a good look which countries are producing the most destructive weapons which countries the most civilized germany the united states britain france russia why because of their civilization not in spite but because of their civilization because they knew a systematic way of demolishing an entire an entire clan or entire race look at hitler my goodness how could anyone in his right mind accept the doings of hitler the germans would you say for instance that the germans were uh stupid they were not they were very cultured how come they accepted maybe it was because they knew that uh after all after all that is said and done hitler was there he was their fuhrer and so therefore whatever he did was just acceptable to them besides there was a carrot dangling in front of them deutschland uber alle germany over everything and you know when you dangle that carrot in front of any nation what nation will not accept even now the united states look at what happened after the uhm after the the declaration of uh or the i say declaration of war it was not actually a declaration of war but the hostility started on january seventeen and what did the american people do they were waving flags they were wearing t shirts that would reflect in order to show that we are with you with what come to think of it it was destruction it was the extermination of a people and yet they were for it why because in the end they will say rah rah rah the united states i am not against it as i told you we were all secretly rejoicing that baghdad after all was going to be bombed and we were secretly hoping that in one of the bombings saddam hussein would be there and dead you and i are guilty why we are supposed to be cultured and yet at the back of our mind we are hoping that in one of the bombings saddam hussein would be one of them perhaps another person who is less cultured less intelligent would not even have thought of it now there you are what is the explanation it is because lack of play will make a person more vicious any other question you 'd like to ask me alright if you 've no other question then let us now go to the part of marx on the part of marx  marx you all know based his teachings on hegel as i was telling you last time hegel did not realize that by espousing a theory of the thesis and the antithesis producing the synthesis he would spearhead the communist movement but now what is the influence of marx on herbert marcuse let 's begin with the following what is marx saying to us why does he make a big dent on the mind of any young student in other words why are there many marxists in our midst and i am not going to be surprised if right here in this class there are those who are majoring in political science who are young marxists why is this so let me single out a few ideas marx is famous for entfremdung  what is entfremdung   entfremdung means alienation what is this idea of entfremdung or alienation look after the industrial revolution when machines started to take the place of human labor it became very clear that machines were going to take the place of what was or what used to be the work of individuals let us begin before the industrial revolution alright
Philippines	so whatever you get out of ten is your percentage grade right let 's say for example you get six out of ten sixty percent i 'll just put that on your recitation grade so over all whatever recitation points you get we 'll just average it and uh it 's going to be considered over a hundred okay now i haven't checked the papers yet so most probably i 'll give it back to you by wednesday okay but anyway oh is there a tape recorder uh oh sorry so anyway uh i got conscious because the tape recorder is there but anyway i 'll give everybody a chance to speak so we 'll all get recorded laughter  come on oh it 's not running it 's just there for display no no don't worry about it just imagine it 's not there okay now don't worry about it you don't have to be conscious laughter  it 's not going to take a picture of you laughter  okay so uhm this is a course which is supposed to talk about contemporary national development and before we go further into that uh we have to talk about development and growth first as contrasted with one another okay so i think in the in the quiz i gave you i asked the question about development right so what do you think is development ms maralit myla sir uhm the process of development is the process of improving the quality of life it 's the process of improving the quality of life the end-all objective of course of development is to improve welfare right so when we talk about an improvement in welfare it automatically means an improvement in the standard of living but anyway uhm let 's try to get a more comprehensive definition of economic development so aside from improving the standard of living is there any other thing aside from the process of improving the standard of living is there any other thing you would like to add to what ms maralit said ms lee mirabel aside from aside from that uh economic development is increasing people 's freedom to choose so increasing people 's freedom to choose so if you have a wide variety of choices it means that you are also approaching development why for example words  uh uhm so is it good for us or is it bad for us  so for the consumer it 's generally good right if you have a wide variety of products to buy which are going to satisfy you it 's generally good so aside from process of improving standards of living aside from having a wider variety of choices is there any other thing uh you would like to add to de development  ms de leon where are you ms de leon de lara sorry de lara let me write this down again can i borrow your pen please  o ms de lara uhm it involves changes in structure uh words  okay so let 's talk about the actual gi definition given in the text okay so if you take a look at different economic development textbooks you will find different definitions but if you take a look at the darish text i think it gives the most comprehensive definition of what development is okay so let 's try to give that definition and let 's look at it one by one okay writes on the board  okay now so in all my economic development classes as well as in all of my conadev course code for contemporary national development classes i normally start out with this definition okay and then i ask the rest of you to try and translate it for me so it is a multidimensional process which involves changes in structures attitudes institutions inclusive of sustained increases in output creation of more jobs and eradication of mass poverty  now in the definition do you find economic growth there ms de lara yes where is economic growth there in the definition sustained increases in output okay so when you talk about sustained increase in output this is actually the definition of economic growth so going back to the quiz i gave is economic growth the same as economic development  ms de lara uhm for me economic growth is part of economic development so it 's not necessarily the same right they 're not the same because economic development covers a wider scope compared to economic growth economic growth is just talking about sustained increases in output on the other hand development covers a lot of other things outside of economic growth right so the answer there is they 're not the same okay now if you read the darish text and you were able to give me this answer this is an automatic five points for you now if you gave something which is close i give you a four if you if you write something there which has the idea and uh despite writing it in different words although the idea is the same i might give you a three or a three point five out of five points now if it 's if it 's really far off uh i can give you maybe one point five or one okay but anyway as long as you give me an idea which is relatively close to the definition i 'll give you points for it okay now let 's try to talk about the definition phrase by phrase okay what exactly is the meaning of multidimensional  mr gello pronounced with a j uhm gello pronounced with an h  gello pronounced with an h sorry it involves different aspects of the economy so multi means many right multidimensional so it means many facets or many faces so aside from having a multidimensional process it involves changes in structures so let 's take a look at structures  okay so development involves changes in structures multidimensional process let 's take a look at the structures one by one what particular structures are you aware of  uhm what is a structure in the first place  april de castro  ha what is a structure anyway it 's like a framework framework correct so a structure is a framework now what kind of structure are we aware of existing today uhm in your everyday life it 's a set-up right it 's a framework so in our everyday life do we know of any structure which is existing  uh let 's be more specific in terms of people so when you talk about classes of people how are they categorized commonly uhm bale their purchasing power uhm their wealth so people are normally classified in terms of income brackets right so when you have different classes of people you automatically talk about social structure di ba  as part of development ms de castro is there anything you would like to change regarding the social structure yes what 'cause uhm if we words still go on with the present structure i don't think we can achieve uhm uhm a development probably because most of uhm it 's a the prevailing framework is uh bale that the rich are getting richer the rich gets richer and the poor gets poorer what exactly is the existing social structure in the philippines can you show it  is it possible to illustrate social structure in the philippines how does it look like  upper middle middle class so in what form does it look does it take so it looks more like a pyramid right so if you take a look at the social structure in the philippines it looks like a pyramid why is it considered a pyramid small parts bale the top of the pyramid which consists of the upper class is relatively smaller than that of the lower class okay so when you talk about income classes and you talk about a specific number of people okay there are only a few people belonging to the upper income class and then the majority belongs to the lower income class or what we call the masses okay  mga masa okay now if you talk about the actual income which goes to them you can also make use of a pyramid to illustrate it but this time around it 's inverted right  di ba  a majority of the income in this particular case goes to the smaller upper class while a small portion of the income is distributed among the masses so this is the existing social structure in the philippines that 's why you have different classes of people upper middle and lower class okay now if you go outside of the philippines especially if you go to india for example there is a stricter social structure okay so they have the caste system wherein they have four social structures which are more rigid and there is no way by which you can move up if you are born in that particular structure you cannot move up anymore you 're stuck with that particular class on the other hand for countries like the philippines okay despite people belonging or beside despite a lot of people belonging to the masses there is still a chance to move up as long as you become successful in life right now as part of development is there a need to change the existing social structure ms de castro said yes why ms de castro uhm because if we maintain uhm the the actual distribution of income as it is i don't think that uhm there would be uhm as if uhm evident words uhm a clear development of that could be seen from the lower class what is the consequence of a growing lower income class ha  what is the consequence of expanding this base let 's say for example this base keeps on growing is there any consequence to that  uhm aniceto  uh what what is the consequence of a growing uhm lower income class  oo what 's the consequence to it uhm more people will be uhm needing uh needing needing jobs uh they need to uhm have a means of living so we 'll be words  so it creates a greater population pressure right aside from these people suffering from low income but aside from that is there any other uh consequence which is drastic ms uh ms casigura unclear statement by the student  uh so let 's say for example the lower income classes are suffering from poverty if the poverty gets worse and more people become poor what is the consequence of that uh what are we experiencing today what problem what 's the biggest problem of the military  sir, insurgency insurgency what is the biggest problem of the police  crime crime so when you talk about insurgency and crime this all leads to social unrest okay social unrest so if you do not try and change the existing class structure it will lead to social unrest especially if the mass the masses increase and they suffer from more poverty okay so when they 're in poverty it 's automatic they suffer from low levels of living but what i was asking for was the consequence if you don't solve the problem ultimately it 's going to result to more crime it might result to people joining the insurgency because they want to change the whole system okay uh so that 's one what other structures are you aware of mr toledo what other structure are you aware of which needs changing aside from social structure political uh political what about political  what exactly is politics mr toledo  when you say that politicians are uh no let 's let 's rephrase that when we say that uh people are playing politics what exactly is the meaning of that when the word politics comes to mind what 's the first thing you think of mr toledo power power okay power so when you talk about political science it it studies the reallocation of power right  pagka ang mga tao namumulitika ibig sabihin ano  they try to influence people right and of course influence comes with wealth and power okay now what exactly is the existing political structure in the philippines mr toledo  what kind of government do you have uh democratic form of government right democratic form of government now is there anything wrong about having a democratic form of government is it efficient is it able to provide enough public services what uhm mr toledo unclear statement by the student  uhm so most of the rich people have the positions in government okay by the way when you talk about our government okay the democratic presidential form of government it 's divided into three branches right judicial legislative and executive so mrs aquino and all of her cabinet members belong under the executive house right it 's called the executive because they execute they are supposed to execute all of the policies they are supposed to implement all of the programs when you talk about legislative law-making right law-making and then when you talk about judicial they take care of settling disputes okay through the courts the legal system now there are different types of democratic systems right you have presidential you have parliamentary question in the philippines uh do you think the presidential form of government is effectively giving public services to all of us mr catabian where are you uh oo 'yong gobyerno natin ngayon is it giving efficient services public services for all of us present government sir uhm in my opinion  o in your opinion  hindi masyadong marami words  delegation of responsibilities why did you say that 'cause sometimes the responsibilities overlap overlap so it 's not red tape anymore it 's a matter of defining function sir red tape is another thing  red tape is another thing let 's talk about something which is more concrete something which we experience every day something which you can blame on government   garbage  o garbage garbage right garbage something which you can blame on government all of us pay taxes by the way none of you are paying taxes yet but your parents pay taxes we pay taxes okay so we expect efficient public services but what is the problem efficient services are not being given okay and garbage is one example garbage is piling up everywhere collection seems to be very very inefficient in fact drainages are being clogged because of garbage the reason is there aren't enough dump sites okay so what is happening so it must be the fault of the government right
Philippines	but you know these are expected and so far uh you know we probably proceed and finish the voting 'no without much uh you know problem violence etcetera  now the canvass itself that would start some time you know uh between the hours of four and five kasi hindi naman magsisimula ng three 'yan e  uh no uh nap 'no and gaby because according to the election code 'pag may mga tao pa 'no within thirty meters from the polls eh siyempre itutuloy 'yan 'no  so ang experience namin diyan is uh the polls would naturally close when i say close 'yung bang talagang isasarado na 'no mga about five thirty 'no to six o' clock  palagay ko diyan and hopefully you know uh nap has the voice of an angel na magiging peaceful 'yan throughout 'no   because the second process to me is the most important e   dyan kasi 'yan nagkakagulo  even to the second process my my theory applies in the sense that the cheats will be there will cheat if allowed by the comelec if allowed by the armed forces and if supported by the president that has been the experience i 've been uh observing i 've been analyzing political exercises in the country for several years i won't tell you how many years laughter  and in my study there could only be cheating on a large scale if there is a connivance and a cooperation between the president the comelec and the armed forces and if you look into the character of the military brass they 're also no-nonsense people like the comelec people so the cheats would not be very comfortable or would not succeed in cheating under the circumstances under any of the process at any stage of the of the election i think also in a manner of speaking nap 'no your uh uh you know statement that the cheats would probably not have their day it 's because there are many watchers inside 'no  simply because there are many positions 'no that are being elected kanina nga noong pumasok ako believe it or not 'no uh when the polls opened mas marami ang watchers e  uh so i think in a way that will also uh not so much eliminate 'no but minimize 'no  but this is something that we have to see  sumisenyas 'ata si gaby  i hate to interrupt your discussion gentlemen but at this point we 'd like to break and bring the viewers to listen to ms josephine reyes and dong puno from z m m music break in recording  in fact i would like to get back to pastor israel parlade whose groups had asked the different candidates in pasay to sign a covenant of unity for hope uhm while the church has a moral force pastor parlade there is no punitive or coercive force of the church i mean what are you going to do for example if you are going to see that your covenant has not been observed by some of these candidates what are you going to do given that situation we leave that to the lord in prayer trusting really that the lord honors the prayer of the righteous are you going to fulfill a prophetic role in the sense of saying that certain candidates did not live by their word and therefore the citizenship be guided at that point well before they signed the covenant we made it very clear to them that they 're not dealing with men that they 're dealing with almighty god and we made them realize the consequence of abiding in the terms of the covenant blessings for their families and uh for those who 'll violate the terms of the covenant curse for the candidate and reproach upon the family for life that 's a very strong statement actually when you think about it these these these are messages that these candidates should be thinking about  yes yes  let me move on to reverend noli estabillo who represents as assistant pastor the jesus is lord fellowship  this is i understand uh one of those groups called born again christian in their in faith can you tell us a little bit more about about how large this group is uh reverend well uh jesus is lord fellowship is a a part of the philippines for jesus movement which is a coalition of bible-based christ-centered fellowship ministries and churches in the philippines chairman by  the national chairman is brother eddie c villanueva and this is a national movement yes nationwide composed of more or less uh more than three hundred fellowships around the country uh what 's in your mind when you made decisions about the activities that you were going to be engaged in what was the source of your guidance uh well you see really we cannot really separate uh our concern and burden for the nation from the bible because the bible speaks uh uh uh openly about the nation and what is the condition of it in uh psalms in proverbs twenty-nine verse two said when the righteous are in authority the people rejoice but when the wicked word rules the people mourns  but what about post-election this whole moral suasion and moral force that is exuded by many of these church groups how will you be able to continue in terms of and continuing to energize from your own moral direction the government for example of this country well we are commanded by god in the bible in second timothy chapter two to pray for those who are in authority that we may live a quiet and a peaceable life   what about if you see something that is not being done according to what you interpret as biblical instruction again we leave that to the lord because uh you see it is within the sovereignty of god in daniel chapter two verse twenty-one he said he changes the time he changes the season he removes things and puts new things so it is within the sovereignty of god to place uh those who are in authority  sa palagay n'yo ba reverend estabillo 'yong mga nagdadasal ninyong mga grupo ay talagang nasa isip at nasa puso nila na ang binabasa nila sa bibliya ay dapat mayroong uh expression mayroon ring nakikita na ito'y nakikita sa sos sosyedad  yes of course we should not only read the bible but we should live by the bible is there a way in which you are able to for example monitor the activities of your membership in in terms of their political activism uh well  kung ito ay tama  as i said kanina hindi mo talaga puwedeng mapaghiwalay ito 'no  and our members have been really praying for foremost for our nation thank you very much reverend estabillo  i we will take a break and i would like to thank the guests that we have had who have already spoken ahm we want you to come back and join us in halalan ninety-two music  we will show you a video of president aquino voting in tarlac  that was his joke 'no  well anyway you can see she is voting like any ordinary citizen alright she is wearing her signature yellow color her favorite color ina  laughter is it probably for good luck alright so there she is  she stayed uh for only a few minutes at the booth i i 'm sure she knows exactly who she would vote for alright that 's kris aquino   o good there is this her first time to vote how old is kris i think this is her first time to vote if i 'm not mistaken yeah alright that 's another presidential daughter  it 's pinky or viel alright there you have it the entire family went all the way to tarlac to vote there 's ballsy aquino-cruz  alam mo ina tinatime-an ko si presidente kung how long it would take her to vote  kasi ako kanina noong wala kayo sinabi ko nga dodie 'no it took me six minutes uh 'no with all the sample ballots that i prepared myself 'no baka si mrs aquino mas kukunti nap but laughter kukumpletuhin mo 'yong benty kuwatro   kayo naman   at saka uhm 'no one minute and a half minute na siya riyan   kayo naman laughter   hindi ho kasi most people have a list   apparently she still uh apparently she is still going through the tedious process words of her preferred choices look i 'm sure she has twenty-four like most of us all of us had lists prepared at least the four of us i 'm sure before we got there we knew exactly who we were voting for so on the average like what mr cayetano said it takes about six to ten minutes per voter so ako kasi e ang ginagawa ko kasi kahit na mayroon akong kodigo siyempre tiningnan ko muna 'yong kodigo ko at saka uh sa mga senatorial nagbago siyempre ako 'no kaya it took me some time  pero kung talagang susundin mo 'yong kodigo mo easily four minutes tapos  mr cayetano tapos na ho si pangulong aquino   o ayan inorasan ko siya  so two minutes and fifteen seconds  palagay ko 'yan straight  hindi na nag-isip ok lang 'yon 'no dahil per time 'no dahil kung meron siyang sample ballot tama lang 'yon 'no   ngayon sabi nga ni nap baka iba ang binoto laughter   nagbibiro naman kayo  it was a quick uh voting for mrs aquino as you can see she is almost done  nilagyan din siya ng indelible ink kagaya nating lahat 'no  exactly how long is this indelible ink supposed to last two days two days two days at least two days and it will just fade away  alright it 's wonderful news a lot of people i mean some naughty people are claiming that this is not as indelible as it should be  hindi basta nasa cuticle mo indelible 'yon unless you cut your finger your fingernails laughter   hindi you have another finger added to it <  pero talagang mahirap alisin   tapos na hong bumoto ang pangulong aquino   hinihintay na lang niyang matapos ang kanyang mga anak music  so ladies and gentlemen you saw the president herself cast her vote at hacienda luisita in tarlac kasama ho niya ang kanyang buong pamilya na bumoto  so gentlemen is there anything you 'd like to say about that mr rama has been very quiet well as i was saying that the voting process itself has been solved by the comelec but it is the counting plus continue the canvassing because you have to read so many names you have to read from thirty to forty names here in metro manila you have to read forty-four names thirty-four names but uh shifting to other topic i did notice that there are several foreign observers who are here watching the election process and several uh foreign correspondents  yes  now what do they think at this at this at this stage of the game that 's one thing that we should probably find out uh what is verifiable is that uh many of these foreign correspondents have been writing about the election process of the philippines and they take a very dim view of our democracy here and our election process well uh they have been influenced also by our media because we have people in media who specialize in bashing our election process bashing the constitution bashing our democracy but uh sometimes we should know how how to count our blessings do we realize that there are very few third countries in the world that hold election democratic election and there is probably none of all those who have uh emerged from a dictatorship to restore democracy while going through the election process this is very uh you know delicate process and we should be happy and some of these third uh countries are watching us with some admiration and fascination that we are able to do so uh uhm so i would suggest that we should be a little more positive yes uhm philippine politics may have its flaws but we should still count ourselves lucky or word   yeah   if you are a foreigner and you watch and listen to all these uh the confusion ballot boxes not arriving official ballot not arriving people cannot find their precincts etcetera 
Philippines	good evening and welcome to a very special edition of g m a news report we 're very glad that we have uh been able to put together on this program for tonight some very distinguished people very key people who will uh figure out very prominently in the news insofar as uh helping the people affected by mount pinatubo 's wrath cope with the crisis of this most recent crisis you know we 've had typhoons we 've had earthquakes and and and uh floods and these are natural calamities that have somehow uhm shocked this country all in in two years ' time or even uh just in a year 's time and these natural calamities somehow have drained the resources of this government the very limited resources of this government but at the same time has also brought out the best in the filipino people and for tonight we 're going to talk to these uh very very busy people and maybe talk about the process of how they are trying to uh help up in these uh relief and evacuation efforts ongoing in metro manila as well as in the affected areas around mount pinatubo and i 'm very glad that uh rey punongbayan is with us here i talked to him this morning and i asked him to sleep at about twelve noon so he can make it here thank you very much he is the person in charge of the philippine institute of volcanology called philvocs for short minus the l phivocs phivocs phivocs that 's how he pronounces it and of course uh a very good friend of mine married to my contemporary in saint scholastica 's uh undersecretary of the department of trade and industry we have undersecretary ernesto ordo&ntilde;ez thank you very much and we have the undersecretary from the department of uh social welfare social welfare linda laygo and also the governor of pampanga governor bren guiao well they tell me that uh my reporters tell me that they had a difficulty looking for you this morning and i told them that i had gotten in touch with you and that you 're going to be here i 'm sure a lot of people in pampanga are watching us tonight  and at the same time may i at this point also tell you the people out there those who would like to extend some help to the victims you can uh give your donations to g m a 's operation helping hand uh here in channel seven edsa we receive any kind of donations food medicines uh clothing blankets uh not so much for cash but if you have cash we will also accept it you can call telephone numbers nine nine six seven five three and nine six four six five zero okay we will begin and very quickly the question to uh dr punongbayan what happened the last three days friday saturday and sunday now you want that uh yes just very   friday saturday and sunday huh friday saturday and sunday okay that was the fourth eruption episode of the volcano  yes  and it 's uh as predicted it 's gonna be long duration yes so it started at one o'clock uh friday and ended uh thirty-six hours after that uh it started with a big explosion and then after so many hours we counted a total of twenty or so uh explosions most of these caused uh the eruption column to rise to about uh twenty to twenty-five kilometers up up there uh there was a complicating factor and that one was the uh passage of the typhoon and uh it 's almost over the top of uh mount pinatubo the consequence of that is the lower circulation of below ten kilometers is to from the southwest to the south to the northeast and above that ten kilometers above the circulation is from the northeast to the southwest so what it effectively did the effect of that is deliver more ash towards the southwest and unfortunately metro manila is along its path so it distributed more ash on in metro manila but aside from that it not only affected metro manila it also affected palawan and all the way to cambodia so so that 's the kind of uh blanket ash cloud that was created by that uh eruption typhoon diding was already predicted by pag-asa way back yes was there not uh also uh an opportunity for phivocs to determine that there could be ashfalls as a result of the typhoon well it 's hard to project that   that 's not within  it 's hard to project that it 's hard to project that because you have to determine the amount unloaded by the volcano uh during that time during the passage of the typhoon and it created a wide blanket instead of just uh looming it directly to the west it spread out  so you have a thick blanket and at the same time a wide one so that it affected metro manila but that 's not the only thing that happened uh because of the amount of material that was taken out from beneath the volcano there was a great void created underneath and we suspect that this void was compensated for by the collapse of the summit part of the volcano so that at the end a crater was formed  so you have that as the net effect a large a large amount of material removed from underneath and collapsing of the summit part are we supposed to be happy with that well uh i think so uh first uh let me tell you that uh we now have a means for determining the amount of material that was removed by the eruption so that if we measure the volume of the crater uh we shall have an indirect measure for the amount of the material uh that has to be unloaded uh there is such a rule that uh if you have such a volume of magma underneath ten percent of this will have to be erupted so that the eruption is over so we 'll we 'll have uh an idea on how how much uh uh was unloaded during the four episodes of eruption just in the news tonight we were talking about uh some reports unconfirmed though uh about mount isarog is there any possibility that it could be acting up because of pinatubo no no it there 's no connection  wala bang koneksyon itong moun mount unzen in in japan well that 's gonna be a long connection if you have to put a connection but volcanoes act independently of each other and they have their own slough for going down from the magma reservoir the needed ingredient for create uh for an eruption  independently  so they have their own tracking system to speak of uh uhm so uh pinatubo can erupt and matig which is close by will remain silent and so will mariveles corregidor palay-palay and taal you haven't noticed anything in taal volcano or mayon well uh there was a coincidence of inactivity between taal uh and uh and pinatubo in fact uh we were monitoring pinatubo yes uh no taal taal taal and then pinatubo started showing signs of unrest but indirectly because uh this volcano has rested for about six hundred years and had done nothing since then so we had a steamblast on april second and uh suspecting that there is something going on we set up a seismograph just to see if there 's really something going on and lo and behold there were many volcanic quakes recorded but going back to uh i 'm not i 'm not finished yet with the story of the uh the creation of the crater uh so we have an indirect measure of the amount and i think uh we have an approximation of about one cubic kilometer of magma a minimum from the total magma below cubic kilometer cubic kilometer   that 's how much in tons that 's one kilometer by one kilometer and one kilometer thick and that 's a lot of material and if you uh produce ejecta uh if you double the volume so you 're talking about two cubic kilometers of uh ejecta that 's ash and uh pumice produced so i think uh the volcano has somehow unloaded what should be unloaded and only a fraction may remain to cause further uh eruption okay we 'll get back to dr punongbayan and talk to our other guests right after some very very important messages music break  okay you 're back with us on g m a news reports we have a special report on mount pinatubo and we 're very glad that you 're here with us governor bren guiao of pampanga is angeles within your jurisdiction it being a city well it is a private city but it is within pampanga yes of course it is but are you directly involved in the day-to-day operations of the city no i 'm not directly involved but i am involved in the sense that uh uh some people in angeles come from the different towns of the province i see okay the question is why did angeles seem unprepared they were aware that there was an imminent eruption considering that clark had started evacuation angeles uh obviously was unaware and was unprepared for evacuation uh well uh tina i cannot speak for the officials of angeles city but i 'd like to speak on behalf of the province uh we had been preparing for this uh since we had uh heard from uh director punongbayan about the possibility of eruption you know our disaster control council in pampanga is adjudged as one of the best in the philippines uh now i 'm not saying that uh we are prepared for instance uh we are now uh attending to one hundred twenty-two thousand evacuees from different parts of the province and some are coming from olongapo and torolles  and i cannot imagine you know feeding one hundred twenty-two thousand people uh uhm undersecretary ordo&ntilde;ez here was computing at the minimum we 'll be spending one million peso a day uh to feed uh this number of people  now uh it 's not easy that 's why when i am asked tina whether we are uh feeding these uh evacuees adequately my answer is no  i don't think anyone can feed or give enough food to that number of people yes yes we will go into that uh logistics of uh feeding evacuees in centers that have been put up but but my original question was why why was angeles uh unprepared uh a lot of people who are now in metro manila i understand come came from angeles they they just abandoned their homes uh late afternoon and there was no help whatsoever that came from the local government who was in charge at that time all this was going on well as i was telling you tina uh angeles is a chartered city yes what hap where 's the mayor is he any the mayor was there the mayor is there and uh you know i think this is not the time for me to blame anyone yeah i know we 're not blaming anyone but people just wanted to find out and get an answer as to why it became the way it did well i would like to believe that they were really caught flat-footed they did not uh expect this magnitude of uh the eruption  and uh perhaps uh as what you said they did not take a cue from clark field  yes  uh you will recall that somebody said that perhaps clark field was over-acting over-reacting but then uh uh apparently they had a basis for their uh uh moving fast enough yes and got away from clark field did you not advise angeles about the possibility of the effects of ash rain  well  uh we had a were they properly informed no uh we organized a meeting i tried to convince them that they should prepare a plan uh in view of the uh forthcoming eruption and did they show you a plan or was this in place the mayor did not show up i see okay so going back to that statement that it would take a million pesos a day to feed about a hundred twenty thousand people in angeles in pampanga alone in pampanga in the entire province how are you getting uh i mean i know where you 're getting the money most likely from the budget releases from the government but how are you doing the the purchasing and distribution of all these relief goods well aside from the initiatives of the different departments and the governors uh this morning secretary garrucho met the manufacturers and uh we had a very good ally in dr carroscoso of the philippine charity sweepstakes office in that he promised to pay them within two days if they gave their products at manufacturer 's price with a discount so for example sardines which sells from six to six fifty uh uhm we got it at five twenty less ten centavos per ten  rice uh we 're getting rice for eight pesos and twenty centavos per kilo and in the market that same rice is about ten to eleven pesos and what the manufacturers like about this is that with dr carroscoso 's help they 'll get their money within two days we 're talking of philippine charity sweepstakes office yes yes
Philippines	 surveys and researches point out that deep down inside men and women want in intimacy practically the same thing number one unqualified love and loyalty number two faith and intimacy in a recent survey of one thousand two hundred men by dr loni barbach a clinical psychologist the respondents revealed that men don't always want sex most husbands just want the physical attention one that 's manifested by touching and cuddling most men who are single said they didn't always want sex even if it was immediately available to them what they wanted was romance and the feeling of being needed but what happens when romance and sex are gone can love survive without them let 's find out the philippines ' queen of talk who either enjoys the abundance or the lack of romance and sex in love ms jullie music  i think i 'm going to be uh tongue tied tonight because we 're going to talk about romance and i 'm no expert i 'm only an expert in the art of expecting laughter not in the art of having but you know there are they say that politics is the art of the possible for me that is a better definition of romance the art of the possible what is possible in romance what is possible in love whatever you dream of having the illusion of love the hoax of romance that 's what we want in our lives women need it for to get along uhm through the hard through the rough edges of the day but men expect it that 's why all all the magazines that i have read the articles are always addressed to the woman how to make your love life better how to please your man but they never tell the men what to do maybe tonight we shall find out because uh we 've got three guys and the problem is they 're all single maybe they 're single because they don't want to lose the romance in their lives chuckle  so when we come back you 'll find out who they are music   an interview clip love should be sustained by romance in its many forms some people might think that love might not be present or existent any more and yet they 're appalled not really appalled but surprised why they still feel what they think is love so perhaps uh my answer is yes uh and uh yes uh you know love is upheld so love love love is sustained by romance music  that was angelo castro and uh guests started to talk all at the same time   hoy teka muna teka muna teka muna  quiet quiet first quiet first laughter  they can hardly wait to jump on the topic before we jump into the topic i 'd like to thank uh angelo castro he 's been such a nice guy so gallant you know plugging our show at the last uh in the last twenty seconds of the world tonight and uh the world ended tonight with the world tonight bowing out after how many years  thirteen years thirteen years so angelo now that uh you 're not on the world tonight maybe one of these days you will allow yourself to be here on our show laughter  so back to our topic romance romance romance it 's not valentine but women and and i think nowadays men are always looking for that special spark that we call romance uh a touch a look a gesture that uh expresses something inside the heart and maybe uh our guests tonight can tell us more about that beginning with mr manoling morato i think manoling is a very romantic person manoling can i tell them your secret yes yes laughter  you know many people think that manoling is afraid of women wha to come close to 'no  but he had a romance and unfortunately that girl perished in a fire sometime ago and that is the reason manoling 's romance lives in the embers of his heart oh laughter  correct correct yes uh okay so so you would be the perfect person to talk about what happens to a man 's life when romance goes away in in this case it it went away with the person well jullie i i 'd rather listen to the young people tonight because i don't know what they 're up to these days  yeah well you have to share with us  yeah yeah laughter  i belong to another generation that 's it we will compare the expectations of your generation   and i i think medyo pass&eacute; na 'ko ano   oo laughter  no never never  pero makikinig ako and i i 'll try to uh speak out and man manoling doesn't mind uh to express his love to his mom  he is he is one he is one person who who looks at his mother uh and puts her on a uhm pedestal  i don't i don't  well uh i 'm not a mama 's boy jullie she 's like my daughter uh she 's the daughter laughter  i rule over her  oo  she 's totally helpless without me   well i i think that happens you know yeah as as a child grows older the the roles are reversed  change of roles  yes now ms cynthia patag hi jullie single forever i don't know everybody knows cynthia so i don't have to read all of these except   oh really except what she said the necessity of romance and sex is dependent on the kind of love the couple enjoys did i say that yeah speakers a and c laugh well do you believe uh that romance is missing in your life because you 're single well we we by romance you mean the rituals of courtship whatever whatever it means to you  we  uhm kailangan ba 'yan   kailangan mo ba ng romansa  me now yeah speaker c laughs  my gosh well i haven't i went back to college after twenty years and i 'm graduating october two if you have   congratulations  thank you  congratulations   you think i have any room for romance i 'm shell-shocked you have no room for romance and yet you 're  not  not not 'till i with a thesis ha  uh-huh  pagkatapos ng thesis ko october two i 'm going off  ang ibig mong sabihin you have to have a block of time focus for romance focus no no for love to come in you need a chunk of time say from three to six this is my time for love and from six to six i have to immerse myself in my books  ganon ka  jullie you you have to define love no no how can i we cannot if i could then i would be the greatest ano sage in the history of the wo in the civilization of the world i cannot define love but maybe you can tell me what romance is  okay   you 're you 're going to graduate with a degree in literature  ehem yes literature okay now let 's give you the test laughter  alright after reading shakespeare and uh marlowe and uh whoever else okay in the context we 're talking about love in the context of a relationship romantic love there are two persons i won't say the gender uh uhm chuckle  uh and and your question is can love survive without romance without romance uhm platonic love yes oh yeah by definition   but uh romantic love no it cannot it cannot survive without romance  no  because there is uh sexual desire which definitely needs a consummation uh uhm but but somebody told me that uh if you were to get married or to get into a serious relationship it wouldn't be with a filipino  ay na naman   o mamaya mamaya   ayan na naman   o mamaya mamaya mamaya mamaya laughter  for now let 's let 's go to lara  i haven't been talking anyway laughter  anyway you 're spoken for laughter  anyway so lara lara fabregas she 's an actress and uh regular in the drama series saan ka man naroroon  you know a title like that speaks volumes saan ka man naroroon  romantic mga role mo do'n   kontrabida  uh uh romantic i guess 'cause all my evil derives from the fact that i 'm a scorned woman uh-huh you 're a scorned woman and you must have your man and i have to have my man and i 'll do what it takes i 'll kill wow that 's romantic that 's romantic so natatakot nakakatakot sa mga lalaki  yeah yeah i guess it 's pretty aggressive right   but some men it 's very obsessive love there 'no  uh-huh but some men like strong women to come come on to them i don't know i mean maybe some people would like to think that a woman would go to that extent would you in real life no i wouldn't you know your father will kill you first yeah no i think you can't force somebody to feel wha how you feel you know you would love for them to love you back but  so  so why are roles like yours so popular and classic and and and ubiquitous and identified words  eternal because of a perniciois patriarchal system where where the men speaker c laughs  okay where the men write the stories of course where they write the stories and they brainwash the women yes right okay okay yes but you you you deserve to be punished you deserve to be punished for  words  you deserve to be punished for grabbing a man away from his wife or his girlfriend  naku jullie mamaya na laughter  okay okay  words eh violence against women na ito laughter  yeah okay okay  si dr mario katigbak naku ito yung romansa daw magkano two pesos ano twenty pesos a day ano 'yon laughter  i i i cannot answer this remember if abanse pinay is here yeah dagger looks dagger looks yes willing to give them jewelry what 's that trips abroad trips abroad  oo  actually it 's giving them love  and then   give them love oo  but that 's all romance what does it take to make make a woman happy less than twenty pesos a da   love  tender loving care laughter  no what he was trying to say in that commercial was that the man has to be physically fit di ba   that 's right that 's right that 's right physically fit to you know the physical aspect of romance that 's all it was dealing with uh-huh like like you said you devote all the time   i don't wanna look at her anymore you devote all your time to your studies and uh mario naman believes in devoting a part of his life to being physically fit in order to please and pleasure his lady love  gano'n ba  is isn't that you know it 's non-chauvinistic you don't think so the pharmaton =a brand of vitamin is supposed to be given it 's supposed to be given  alright  you 're not supposed to mention that name laughter  well i did already laughter i don't take it so you don't take it you don't need it no need no need no he 's supposed to be giving it to the woman to his wife to his wife that 's correct  oo no no he 's supposed to take it no i think it 's open to it 's open huh to individual interpretation uh okay okay   and i won't say any more about it okay what is your individual interpretation of a romantic affair uh of a romantic affair uh you know i i think that you know a lot of romance really depends on the people i 've always held that you know that you know like you can go anywhere you know uh a date can be a perfect date  doesn no matter where it is as long as you 're with the right person you see it 's really it 's really chemistry   chemistry  it 's not something external i think but but the two of you have to express it it cannot take anything for granted because if you don't let it out if you don't demonstrate it true true   that 's when it begins to wither and that 's what we 're talking about tonight how do you keep the fire going how do you keep the flame burning di ba  uh like in the case of manoling he didn't have the chance to light a conflagration 'no  okay mr ryan agoncillo is uh another commercial model and uh he 's a part of a morning show he for him romance is an expression of love so it cannot be taken out of the equation of uh uhm uhm romance striving love thriving with or without romance it has to have romance now in your commercial you you were asking you 're asked about being in heat ano  do they allow that on t v what oh no laughter oh no who 's your target here well uh laughter  they allow that on t v in m t r c b they did they did thankfully thankfully for his sake   because they think uhm not many people understand what it 's trying to say well uh are you in heat it has a double meaning because in the in the story uhm the the elev elevator lights go off and uhm anyway they went out and then uhm you 're sweating yeah and i was offering my my drink and i was kinda see laughter  oh my god dagger looks i was trying to offer her my drink and uh and in order for her to cool down instead of asking her na uhm mainit mainit ba or naiinitan ka ba i asked her are you in heat laughter  she ended up slapping me so you know uh she did yeah so she resurrected her pride and speaking of pride
Philippines	the official statements by the united states that there is no more renegotiation that they will either agree to or even allow well but uh   what do you expect them to say laughter   eh sasabihin ba naman nila eh of course pagna- reject eh i mean that 's the iba-bluff-in talaga tayo  i mean mas ma 'kung mas veterano sa poker 'yan eh  so lahat ng pananakot 'no  we will be terrorized into uh running this through the senate and that we cannot do  dahil we just got it now there are several folders and that is uh expected rhetoric so hindi kayo naniniwala kay senator lugar senator all the other senators there congressman solarz uh stanley shregger of the u s embassy ambassador weisner  kasi it 's not in their best interest uh-huh okay senator pimentel any surprises uh among the documents that uh you 've had the chance to look through today or was it uh purely as pre-advertised well actually dong we we took a quick look at the uh you know several folders and documents that were sent over just a few minutes before coming to this program and there isn't any indication that there is anything new uh uhm that can persuade us to change our minds now mike has pointed out that uh we are all yeah we are we are indeed friends of cory there 's no question about that but in this particular case it is not so much the friendship that we have for our president or you know the esteem the respect and the love we have for her that are of primary consideration we would look at this point in in the in the in the light of what is in the best interest of our people and as rene pointed out that is exactly the reason why uh uhm i feel for example that the level of compensation is totally inadequate and unacceptable uh okay i know that uh senator saguisag was probably only half-jokingly saying before the program began that he was being sandbagged because of the of the random comments we played from the public but honestly that was really a reflection of what of what the people are really saying and people are saying and you know this is already the argument being made who are the senators to make this decision for the people when it is very clear what the people are saying how how well we are we are only the representatives from the people as mandated by the constitution to act on this particular issue uh on on the treaty on treaty matters that are to be entered into by this country with other countries including the bases agreement  uh uhm  that is our these are our functions as senators okay you wanted to well yes dahil it is really the fundamental question e  are we a voice or are we an echo uh-hmmmh do we lead or do we follow why are we here because the people voted us here and as i said yesterday nga in my prayer the only one who knew in nineteen eighty-seven as to how we would be voting on this uh uhm  iisa lang  uh-huh  e ang panginoong diyos e  uh uhm we did not know the stand of manong johnny of erap of butz uh uhm but he willed that we be here at this moment in time  kaya 'yon nga the voice of god should be the voice of the people siguro  so 'yon nga we listened very respectfully to any constituent 'no  but again 'yon nga sa huli niyan eh we consult our consciences like in the case of nene and myself uh uhm  matagal kaming nagsama pa sa p d p laban nasa platform 'yan eh  uh-huh so there was no surprise no meaning we are behaving as advertised i see and when we were elected it was partly what we stood for so there was no misrepresentation on the part of nene and me okay what about that senator osme&ntilde;a i know you that you 've been going around the country and you 've been taking a sounding of what the people are saying on this particular issue what is your uh feeling of what the people in the country is saying well i think that the the few samplings that was done on the screen are reflective of what the people out in the countryside are saying uh uhm in fact in general santos uh the rotary club of general santos uh somebody suggested and said you tell those people in manila if they don't want sangley out there move it to saranggani bay uh-huh which is the bay in general santos and that is the same thing in cebu uh the students in the university of san carlos were for eighty-seven percent in favor and these are students not necessarily residents of cebu but who comes to cebu from northern mindanao and leyte and negros uh uhm so i think that that is that is the sentiment of uh the constituency that is out there now i will i will grant that under our constitution regardless of how people may look at it the constitution says very clearly that it is our responsibility uh uhm the twenty-four of us to ratify or to reject a treaty uh uhm uh uhm and so the problem really here is that when we were when that constitution was ratified in nineteen eighty-seven perhaps we were not really looking at all the provisions because we were anxious uh uhm to get a constitution in place and when we ran for office in eighty-seven we all ran under the uh mga at what is it pangkat ng pangulo  uh uhm uh uhm and nobody really examined whether the senators that we are electing to ratify a treaty that is going to expire in nineteen ninety-one whether they are in favor or not and therefore whether i would support or share their views  wala namang we were all elected uh as the ticket of cory so you know that 's so in a sense you take that as a signal that you are allowed to vote what you really think uh what your conscience really says well it 's not a signal it is the reality of it all it is the legal reality of it all let 's take a break when we come back let 's start at uh with some issues why why for why against what are the reasons for the positions of the senators on these points we 'll be back commercial break  okay before we go to substance some some mechanics senator tamano is there time people are worried that september sixteen is about a little more than two weeks away is there time for a real intelligent discussion of all of the issues here i don't think the uh there is time enough and that is really the problem we have so little time uh-huh now we have so little time but there is no preparation for the eventuality that the americans will really leave come september seventeen uh uhm we have not even passed the uh bases conversion uh authority uh bill uh-huh so what we are creating here is a vacuum and that is one of the main reasons why i am for the ratification of this treaty we need a breathing spell in order to prepare for the reality of the americans leaving because there is no doubt that these americans will leave but let us be prepared for it we are not prepared now especially because of mount pinatubo uh uhm senator pimentel does the shortness of the time make any difference to the antis words too much would it be any would it be any different well, the difference would be in the fact that uh the bases agreement will be scrutinized to the minutest detail and all the pros and the cons of the argument will be brought out but the whole trouble is precisely uh a couple of days ago rene and i stood on the floor of the senate asking precisely when are we going to receive a copy of this uh proposed agreement considering that even the the most in insignificant bill before the senate takes uh days if not weeks uh-huh to pass so is there a real possibility that at the end of this period there will be no action by the senate that 's a distinct possibility and probably in the sense of uh just returning the document uh-huh  nandoon naman sa manglapus-schultz na a committee will be formed and i understand the president is selecting the members of the committee uh uhm for the orderly withdrawal  diyan puwedeng ipasok kung ipa- privatize na ba 'yan dahil one of the more onerous conditions nga sa nangyayari ngayon philseco cannot even repair uh soviet vessels 'no  uh uhm anyway itong mga intrusions into our sovereignty i see  samantalang kung ma- privatize na 'yan ay dahil to me itong asset na ito 'no na declining kuno cannot really be duplicated elsewhere so i don't believe that the americans will really leave all that quickly in other words uh probably what they will do is work for the election of a pro-bases president and a pro-bases senate so ano bang mangyayari diyan dahil may special relationship daw tayo  will it be very bitter and permanent will it be some kind of a lovers ' quarrel na after a short period they 're back in bed but under more honorable conditions you know everything is possible pero 'yon nga it 's not as if binomba ka na iraq o vietnam o afghanistan  uh uhm or cuba uh uhm  e hindi naman ganoon ang mangyayari diyan e meaning it 's localized 'no we suffer 'no with our brothers and sisters 'no  of course in clark well the good lord himself liquidated the problem  pero sa subic ito ang pinag-uusapan natin ngayon  there is a chance for orderly withdrawal and whether i like it or not whatever we do now can be undone uh uhm in a few months uh uh by president pimentel or whoever laughter  i mean uh nothing is ever permanent naman diyan eh  okay now so cough let 's talk about what the positions of the senators are senator osme&ntilde;a for example in your case you are for the ratification of this uh particular bases agreement why what are the principal reasons why you are in favor of it well the the most uh used reason that i have always advanced is the economic reason uh uhm the repercussions upon our economy upon our stability upon the uh uh inflow of foreign investments that a withdrawal would bring about and i am using this because this is the understandable this is the stomach uh uhm the issue the gut issue the gut issue but there are other issues 'no  there 's the issue of the security of the asean and the pacific and our role in the family of nations there 's the issue of uh whether or not we will isolate ourselves and withdraw uh uhm uh there are the there is the issue of the support for our local military which i think is a real issue uh uhm uh uhm because our military is by the by the testimony of our own military leaders are saying that uh the military 's uh capabilities will drastically collapse if the uh support of the united states is removed  uh uhm  so these are the these are the other issues now in the course of the debate uh those of us who are the ones who are in favor have allowed those who are against particularly you know uh abueva and a bunch of u p professors put out an ad in the papers which really angers me 'no  because that 's supposed to be a citadel of truth u p   uh uhm  it 's supported by one point three billion of public funds and it has now turned into a wra uh into a machine to warp the minds of the young uh uhm and uh so  laughter okay alright so you know uh they they say that it impacts on our sovereignty it impacts on our political maturity it impacts on our national development all these arguments really have been unchallenged by us because we have concentrated on the economic issues uh uhm but i don't accept any of these arguments that they are advancing uh uhm okay now senator pimentel just so that we can see the issues at hand what is the basis the principal basis of the anti uh at least your own personal anti vote yes uh from my point of view dong uh the the traditional argument uh do not convince me like uh the bases are an infringement of our national sovereignty because i feel that if you can vote no to the bas bases or vote yes that is an exercise of sovereignty   exercise uh uhm  and uh that they are magnets to nuclear attack or nuclear attack i don't think that that is uh you know a a very cogent reason now considering what is happening in the world
Philippines	 magandang tanghali ho sa inyong lahat ito na naman tayo sa talakayan ng bayan ngayon kasama po natin si secretary monsod ano po uh siya naman po ang magpapaliwanag kung totoo 'tong mga sinasabi nila na malaki ang mawawala sa ating sa ating bayan pag nawala po itong mga u s bases ano po particularly 'yong mga sinasabi nilang economic benefits na nabanggit ni congressman guerrero kanina  uh mrs monsod uh uh can you explain to us uh what this uh ben these economic benefits that 's supposed to be can be derived from the bases and how it will effect how it will actually affect our uh country  oo uh before we go into that yeah i 'd just like to comment rod 'no that you said that you talked about the military implications last week and now we 're talking about the economic implications i think that those are not the only considerations with respect to the bases that must be brought into account it is also political considerations especially since our military considerations are a little uh overblown already since because the end of the cold war uh the the this need this tremendous need to keep a security umbrella over the pacific has lost a lot of its importance 'no  now we 're talking about the economic implications and whenever you talk about the economic implications kailangan ilalagay natin lahat ng benifisyo lahat rin ng mga costs 'no  and uh congressman guerrero listed down the supposed economic cough benefits including by the way development assistance and food aid and loans from multilateral organizations and these indeed must be must be said immediately to the public that uh just because we want or the bases go out does not mean that we are saying that we do not want to be friends with the united states let us make that distinction very clear now these economic benefits are overblown simply because whether or not the bases are there these be part of these benefits a great part of these benefits are going to be forthcoming anyway why do i say that simply because sangkatutak na country naman sa buong mundo na walang bases agreement with the united states e merong silang food aid meron silang development assistance meron silang uh uh uh garment quotas etcetera etcetera 'no  so that has nothing to do with the withdrawal or the retention of the bases what is directly attributable to the bases as far as economic benefit is concerned is the economic support fund base-related because there is non-base-related economic support fund alright base-related economic support fund and your foreign military financing that is two hundred three million dollars a year and that presumably will be lost alright now okay uh what will be gained at uh ano pa ang sinasabi nila ang sinasabi ni congressman guerrero eh itong katakut-takot na dami ng ng em employees sa bases that will be dislocated plus the plus the indirect benefits of the purchases the local purchases of those bases uh that 's all very well and good now we will say it 's going to be lost if the moment those bases go vacuum na 'yan  that thing is going to be wasteland now subic has one of the unique qualities in this world it 's got a natural deep port which makes the potential of this resource tremendous especially uh at the brink of what we call the asia pacific age alright in other words uh the uh world has agreed it is universally agreed that come the twenty-first century and even now that the hub of economic activity is going to be in the asia pacific region right and we have to be prepared for that and subic is one of the biggest natural resources that we have and that 's why the americans want it so badly natural deep port etcetera  so if we now take into consideration that there is going to be an alternative use to these bases and that has been the subject of tremendous studies by the legislative executive bases council then we must take into account that there is going to be investment pouring in to that area which will create employment which will create income etcetera  so anong pinag-uusapan natin ang bottomline natin  certainly there is going to be dislocation at the beginning when there is withdrawal these people are going to lose their jobs right however we must also understand that the infrastructure expenditures and the investments that are going into subic is going to make up for that as a matter of fact according to the to the bases conversion study uh uh by nineteen ninety-five there will be even more people employed in the subic area if uh the uh investments uh take place alright private sector as well as public sector investments so in the final analysis therefore there is certainly going to be pain no change is made without pain but if we do not uh accept some pain for the greater good later on then there are so many things that we will not do i mean you know if a pregnant mother decides she does not want to have a baby because it 's going to be painful isn't that rather stupid  hindi ba because we forget that the benefits of the alternative use of those bases what what you 're trying to say here uh secretary monsod is that the world the world market forces will overwhelm the american withdrawal the temporariness of the vacuum to be created by the withdrawal of the americans in other words uh there there is a theory here that if the americans withdraw there is gonna be a a a rather significant diminution in the economic situation of the country because the dollars that are also coming in now are now removed  what you 're saying here now that  wait wait wait  what do you mean significant diminution two hundred million dollars is not a significant diminution   that 's not the point  you were you were saying on the other hand that uh in the totality of this whether or not the bases are there darating din naman 'yan mga 'yang mga  uh no no no uh if the bases are there then the alternative use of subic cannot be made in other words we will have to wait ten years before we start trying to get to develop the potential of subic as a uh uh maritime industrial complex ship repair complex shipbuilding complex the tourism complex etcetera  you know as a as a hub for container uh trade yeah uh ho how does how does it compete with the inter-ports of singapore and hong kong and uh japan   well i will tell you something uh you know subic has something that singapore and and hong kong does not have and that is that deep water bay and the the point is that if you are going to wait ten years before you start developing it eh baka mahuli ka na sa sa labanan hindi ba  that is as far as the economic side is and i you know i it it distresses me that uh you know in this entire debate everybody is talking about the economic benefits of the bases right and have rather exaggerated these economic benefits and have even included such things as my goodness if the bases go wala na tayong sugar quota wala na tayong garment quota wala na tayong ex lintsak naman ano hin hindi naman puwede 'yon  i mean i mean if if you know magkakaroon tayo ng coup magkakaroon you know we will be uh unprepared militarily you know rod the bases have been here well since uh since early the beginning of this century and uh since nineteen forty-seven since uh our independence the base the the americans have supposedly been equipping the ameri the philippine army and yet we have the most ill-equipped please tell me why we think that in the next ten years with this one hundred million we are now going to be tremendously equipped well uh secretary you mentioned the investments 'no that are expected to flow into the the subic area when the bases uh is withdrawn but uh well according to some businessmen the precisely uh foreign investments come into the philippines because of the presence of these uh military bases   i have heard absolutely i have seen absolutely no basis for that assertion as a matter of fact when investors before were asked whether the bases had anything at all to do with their decision they said you know they don't care i mean do you do you think that the i mean why are the investors going to thailand eh wala namang bases ang thailand yeah that 's right  e saksakan pa ng dami mas mas marami pang investments sa thailand kesa sa pilipinas   o kung sa indonesia man lang walang bases doon  i mean you know just because these things may happen after the bases are withdrawn does not mean that it should it happens because the bases are withdrawn 'no  number one uh because if we use that kind of logic rod that means that teka muna we 've had seven coup attempts we 've had political instability we 've had an ill-equipped army and the bases were here does that mean that all these things happened because the bases are here that 's the same kind of stupid logic that leads us to the to the to the conclusion that if the bases are gone all these things are going to happen all these bad things are going to happen okay uh laughter we 'll uh we 'll continue to discuss this with secretary monsod uh after a few reminders okay commercial break  we are back on talakayan and uh this is where we bring to you the chairman of the confederation of sugar producers association of the philippines and he is of course uh mr jomari montinola now uh mr montinola as we discuss the economic dimensions of the uh bases treaty i 'm sure that the sugar industry which is one of the major industries of this country would would have to be affected one way or the other how do you assess this situation well rod uh we in the industry is worried about possible effects of the removal of the bases here if we consider that twenty percent of our production sugar production go to the u s okay twenty percent of our sugar production go to the u s for our sugar quota okay there are approximately six million filipinos six million filipinos dependent on the industry nationwide from up north in cagayan down to davao 'no  if we lose twenty percent of our quota twenty percent of our production which is the u s quota this would translate to approximately one million filipinos that will be retrenched that will have to be laid off okay so you can can you imagine the the economic uh dislocation that will happen in the countryside if these people will lose their jobs we 're worried about the peace and order situation that will result as because of this economic dislocation well you have also to consider that uh the industry contributes approximately uh twenty billion pesos to the gross national product the total investment in the sugar mills and the sugar facilities as is approximately sixty billion pesos can you imagine and the taxes that we pay uh mr montinola i have a follow-up question to that in reaction to that 'no  assuming we lose a portion of the u s sugar quota can we not look for alternative markets to make up for the loss in the u s market well the u s market is a premium market at this time it pays triple the the world market price there is no way that we can sell our excess sugar to the world market now uh how is the behavior of the the sugar uh uh industry today considering that there has been a play of the world prices of uh sugar these days is it in the up trend or low low low trend or is it uh on an even keel at the moment you know in thailand in thailand uh the local sugar price is being protected by government policy which is approximately three times as much as philippine sugar that 's why that 's the reason why the thailand sugar can afford to sell this sugar at the world market even at a loss because they have already recovered their cost in the domestic market in in our case we are not subsidized by government we don't get any subsidy from government so we cannot afford to dump our sugar into the world market simply because the world market is is a market wherein all surplus and excess sugar are dumped by the producing countries uh how how 's the how 's the price now are you still a beleaguered industry as it was in the uh time of the previous uh regime well the industry has started to recover the the plunder of the past regime and uh we would i i in five years we would be able to fully recover uh from that rod let me ask uh one more question in relation to the bases uh from from the point of view of the business sector 'no uh in all the welter of opinions that have come out regarding the retention of the bases is the business sector really for or against uh the retention of the bases well uh we came out the other day in an open letter to our good senators that we 're supporting the bases we in the sugar industry uh came out already with our own resolution supporting the the stay the ratification of the treaty now uh congressman guerrero uh yeah he is planning to say more about uh the advantages and the disadvantages one last question rod uh probably uh one point is uh if uh they don't want the bases here in in luzon we can invite them into negros we have a deep water port in negros southern negros which can develop the economy further in negros that reminds me of uh you 're in competition with ali dimaporo because he wants them in mindanao as well laughter  now let 's let 's listen to congressman guerrero
Philippines	while you and your wife are in a business one day you come home you 've lipstick in your collar she gets mad chuckle  you say it 's your grandmother your grandmother passed away so she won't talk to you and she 's the only one who knows everything about one half of the business and there 's a problem there what do you do she won't talk to you confess these are some of the problems of having a family business and then what if she doesn't ever want to be a part of the business is that what you 're saying right that 's right  words the capital goes all right joining us in this segment is joey cuerdo he 's the owner of power up center for climbing and fitness and says friendship and family relationship should be given priority instead of business uhm also joining us is genevieve lim she 's the owner of zagu and says it 's better to avoid friends and relatives as business partners uh and then we have william leung owner of word restaurant it 's very good restaurant by the way thank you and says the business should be kept within intermediate uh immediate family members only and then also joining us is robert francisco owner of figaro good evening okay uhm your your business is it because of the nature of your business it 's a restaurant right yeah you try to keep the recipes within the family  secret   yes   oh okay  it 's secret so that 's that 's like tan long in in in san francisco it 's only the grandmother who knows yes aside from that is it is that is that the only advantage of keeping uh aside from that uh we do keep uh yeah the secret is uh it 's within the family you also underpay your relatives laughter  i hope not laughter  they would rebel uh what do you think uhm we we all know that after zagu a lot of other different kinds of pearl shakes have you know gone all over the place it 's really become a phenomenon but that 's because uh you broke up with your business partners right and then they set up their own yeah but besides them opening up there are a lot of people who got into it because of the fact that i guess investment is pretty small returns are good and it 's pretty easy to set up  right  uh uhm so a lot of people got into it you know having that thought in mind but is it is it uhm you don't recommend it to uh start a business with friends or relatives   well from my experience from your experience yeah then i 'm gonna say no  uh uhm but it can work out for other people but i think in general i mean i 've been hearing it even before i got into business not to get into business with friends but i never believed it uh uhm and in some ways someone has to go through it in order to believe it what what exactly happened uh with with uh your situation and your business   i guess it 's just differences uhm uh it 's just difficult if people don't wanna you gotta have an open mind hear people out uhm willing to uh hear like constructive criticisms and and move on  uh uhm  uh uhm yeah and joey you you you uhm actually have a business with yo with your wife right yeah you started out five years ago right uh yeah but prior to that uh we were already in business uhm after college when we went to uh what kind of business is this modules hand-outs oh okay uh we we went into that right after college and prior to that we were together for a while so when we went into business it wasn't really so difficult words   yeah to get to know yeah uhm of course you started with with your wife because well you know you both would have the same risks you don't have to pay each other anything laughter until the thing finally takes off words  no salaries yeah yes when you start a business it 's like that but what about when you when you i mean like every couple has their you know ups and downs right and when you have your downs isn't that difficult having a business together or is it because is is it more like a like your baby together that you have to really just put your differences aside and and be business partners  no  uhm well in our case because both of us are kind of strong uh strong headed uh uhm the when one believes in the other and e e sometimes we really end up uh arguing and it 's hard because like what um teddy said uh when she knows this half of the business and i know this half and we don't agree and we go uh you know we decide to to go separate directions   separate directions   words advantages that you can really shout at each other argue like hell but you know that neither of you is gonna break up the business oh yeah because it 's your future is there yeah oo  so probably with a with a stranger you can't be as open that 's true i think that 's true i believe also that uh constant a arguments or debates really opens up books and you can see all sides of the the the coin and maybe just not two sides but even the circular side of it you can really screen out and you know dig up all the flaws and if you 're relatives right and you you know it 's okay to really open up so like like s m robinsons rustans like these are big the the these are family-owned businesses as well   right correct  uh well that does it mean it 's better to start your business with with family so that you end up being a big corporation like that i mean really successful like that it 's easy to keep the secret inside actually   yeah uh okay because you become very protective and you only share probably what what uh my uh seatmate over here would say they keep the secrets to what they really want uh uhm and let out only what has to be let out uh uhm and therefore if it 's a family corporation you sometimes really can control there are some bad sides here that you become extra-emotional when you make decisions uh uhm but then again like you said i think earlier when you 're more of a powerful corporation you can easily buy or hire a professional manager  but don't uh but don't you find that that uhm there 's also a limited range of of ideas and and and you know when you feel the idea needs to evolve  actually  when it 's with the family there is always a clash of ideas it 's all the same people 'cause like like us we are brothers and sisters uh so we have the same ideas but different application so that 's why we always clash but you know it 's good in the end that you find you find comfort that you you still have a brother and a sister with you to run the business you didn't start the business with uh with family right you started with friends i started with friends yeah and uhm did you think it was uhm necessary to start first with friends even if you had bad experiences later on you couldn't have done it without friends well i think i could have but ideally i wanted to work with my friends you know work together be all in one place and put in the long hours in the beginning right yeah but uhm it just didn't work out the way i wanted it to be and instead of prolonging it when we realized that we couldn't work together we just had to part ways rather than going on and then you know i believe you have to whatever you feel say it don't keep it in your like don't keep it and let it build up inside you have to express how you feel but but when you had when you had this business with friends you owned the entire company then  open communication  no i didn't you did not no uh  you had to buy them out   you had to buy   i had to buy them out later on it was offered to me just because i was the one who brought back the idea and they feel they have to offer it to me first uh uhm before like it 's offered to someone else right  words yeah did you have that in an in an agreement you know uh pre-emptive right uhm not really   words  it was just an understanding we had a meeting we called a meeting and they all agreed that i think it 's best that it was offered to me 'cause i owned like majority of the the corporation yeah uh uhm fifty percent so what about like uh drawing the line when does that like family businesses how do you do that with you have a restaurant and it 's all your brothers and sisters they 're running it i mean is it easy to fight with them because they 're your brothers and sisters yes when we were young our our parents instilled in them that i should be the  the kuya laughter   i 'm the eldest right so when arguments arise you know they would in the end they would respect my opinion and it it it works out that way i guess most of the quarrel is whether to expand or it 's a good thing let 's not lose let 's not put in any more money to expand it and then lose it all   actually the fight normally starts either when you 're losing money or when you 're earning too much money that 's where the differences come in yeah okay well we 're gonna take a break here on points of view stay tuned we 'll be right back commercial break  okay welcome back to points of view  the question that we 're gonna ask in this segment is why is it that pinoys love to get into business first with family and friends why why why do they need to have these people around them what do you think it is you have a business with your friend right family family also   right  i thought it was your it 's not with friends only family  no  family okay well our reason is probably because of security comfort and you know you don't wanna make your mistakes uh uhm and it 's so much easier to correct your mistakes among family uh you know now how many how many people in your family is part of the business are all your brothers do you have brothers and sisters we have seven partners are all related uh uhm uh so they 're not all immediate no  pinsan  direct direct direct uh first cousin like two first cousins and uh three direct my brother and my sister and the rest are and are there any brothers and sisters you have there that are not a part of it yes why why didn't you uh words you know by the time we incorporated the the the caf&eacute; or the store figaro two of them were not in the country then uh uhm it was just us you know we had a very very bonded family barbecue every sunday so but did you ask them to join in this thing you know uhm they 're most welcome when we have some expansion program we invite them first and foremost right okay  they get first option of course  well that 's good  that 's good uhm how about with your wife are are there any other people in your business now involved   well actually we hired a lot of friends friends okay   uh from school and uhm i think we got them because uh well our business it requires a lot of uh skills uh skill and the people we needed their skill actually who were we used to climb with uh uhm when we were in college uh uhm but what happens if you if uh you know you get into have a falling out and something like that and uhm you need to fire someone that 's in your business actually uh we 've gotten close to that already uh yeah   a very good friend uh uh actually the first option that we had was uh not fire but uh lie low uh uhm uhm save the friendship  it was actually uh it was actually a move to to save what we used to cherish in the day you know  uh uhm  uh uhm or if it 's an employee he 's out when you words  yeah because someone you just someone who hired espes uh someone who applied actually for a job so what happened so what happened after i mean after he lied low  it was  uh it was painful  mga matagal na  we had a big debate so are you saying like pare you should resign or something like that no no laughter  no but but it 's normally the way it happens 'pag among kaibigan  you normally ask the closest friend to talk to him yeah as a warning  oo  then you know eventually if it still persists then you know you tell him the board is already recognizing your flaws for example then you know as a warning you know already but should it happen do you give do you give more chances is it hard to but do you give more chances oh yeah yeah you give more considerations you give third fourth fifth chance  super lenient  yeah  but i wanna ask you this is it hard to uhm okay fine you have the these uh warnings or whatever right uhm you give memos out also you do that i mean no no no not among directors i suppose you don't do that but normally in directors' meeting uh uhm what i would probably anticipate is you know you open up and put out your mistakes or you lay out this happened in this outlet this is what 's happening right now in the in the business and uh uhm we see that there 's a a weak point here and of course who 's responsible for this
Philippines	 words two hours from manila two hours from cebu two hours by travel from davao and zamboanga so now we are able to prioritize and uh sort of uh veer off from the traditional shotgun type of development okay we 're developed everywhere but not really anywhere i i just wanted to find out when you uh have identified each development area uh have you already come up with uh specific activities towards the development of each of these areas we agreed and this was uh upon the recommendation of the planners that we should focus and come up with models so in the case of davao of the mindanao cluster we have id identified an area in samal island as the ideal place to set up an example and this is the the samal island resort estate company that is what we would like to see in the next couple of months 'no  and this is also true in the case of uh of word music  air resort or tourism estate similar to the industrial estate being promoted by government involves the purchase and infrastructure development and incentive programs development by the government for sale to private investors of large tracts of land for resort building the advantage of the resort estate concept is that it removes stumbling blocks for prospective tourism investors the idea is for us to buy it first uh uhm and then put the initial land development like roads 'no  with the help of course of d p w h and then set up the communication system with the help of d o t c and in the case again of samal we 're working with the regional development council we have tracked down what are the programmed infrastructure activities that are scheduled there and so we 're trying to push that faster 'no  so i have gone over the details of the cluster development i think it 's just uh it 's okay it 's a very good uh grouping actually because especially in the long term with the objective of each cluster like they have luzon for the multifaceted uh aspects of tourism and visayas as a resort center and mindanao for the culture uh uhm and so on i think it 's a very good word  but what i would really like to see i wonder if it 's at all possible to prioritize certain aspects of the development or to expedite all of the airports that we 've targeted for improvement which is the san fernando la union airport uh a few months ago we uh approached uh secretary estanislao for funding support uh and uh he gave us his uh whole-hearted approval and he intends to secure funds from the philippine aid plan the upon completion of the uh widening and lengthening of the san fernando la union airport uh we would now have the opportunity to bring in uh two inclusive air charters from uh our target markets in east asia like korea japan hong kong uh and singapore uh especially those markets who would like to have the uh the uh beaches of uh ilocos and the uh the mountain air of the cordilleras well uh in addition to the san fernando la union airport uh we have uh through the p t a uh set aside uh uh about two hundred fifty million pesos for the improvement of the mactan international airport uh it 's an integrated project that uh will require also funding from o e c f uh where we come in is in uh phase one of the project that calls for the uh uh building of a new uh international terminal and uh based on uh current plans the uh the terminal will be open for business uh within uh a few months and the idea here is to ensure that uh uh we can accommodate uh uh more air traffic into mactan international airport and decongest in the process uh ninoy aquino international airport where ninety-eight percent of the tourist traffic flows through at the present time that 's true uh i 'll bring up the importance of gateway simply because i can immediately see two advantages of the master plan for the tour operators 'no because the the these development areas immediately solve two problems of the operators here in the philippines right now first of all the marketing thing we now can go into product enhancement product diversification and a whole lot of other product activities then another one is operationally it solves our problem with the clogging and the crowding of manila uhm so it 's it becomes easy for us to work 'no and operate our programs with different gateways 'no  how many hotel rooms mr secretary are slated to to be in the next uh let 's say six years ten years uh any figures any facts we are calling for an additional uh thirty-three thousand rooms on top of the existing twenty-two thousand hotel and resort rooms throughout the country however of the thirty-three thousand uh roughly about sixteen thousand are now presently being uh built yes that 's right <$f so uh we will probably we will still need an additional uh uh seventeen thousand rooms now we believe that uh with uh increasing traffic flows into the country investments for additional accommodations will naturally follow a lot of them will be built outside of course there 's still room for uh for more hotels in metro manila okay but uh a a big percentage will be dispersed throughout the country therefore uh we have now gateways we have hotel rooms trained people yes we will have regional training centers we will have the uh the theoretical institutions as well as the on-the-job training institutions to support the uh the uh mother school right uh uhm i would like to find out if there 's room in it for education when i say education it 's not the human resources development but education on the public and education of the other sectors of government about tourism because the master plan to succeed needs the cooperation of other government sector and also the support of the people and like you said uh earlier the everybody has the wrong concept that tourism is the frills thing industry they overlook that it 's a very important economic activity would the tourism master plan have a budget or allotment for the education of our congressmen our senators or other cabinet members the public in general laughter  yes the tourism master plan uh calls for a uh a an increase in uh the advertising and promotions budget uh that uh will include uh in the plan a tourism awareness campaign uh you 're right uh it 's very important for the general public at large to rally behind the tourism master plan because this plan is not government mandated it 's it 's a plan that uh will ensure uh tremendous changes in the economic landscape that will benefit everybody in this country so uh because of of the national interest uh it behooves all of us uh to rally behind this plan and to to do that it is important as you said uh for us to launch a systematic and methodical uh tourism awareness campaign for example uhm it is critical to get our taxi drivers involved uh in uh in tourism development all it takes is for a particular frontliner like a policeman like uh a taxi driver uh to to commit a misdemeanor against a tourist that can destroy the the image of uh of uh the philippines in the eyes of this tourist and the worst thing that can happen to a country is a negative word by mouth advertising or disadvertising uhm it 's important also for example to get our policy makers uh uh to understand the implications of the tourism master plan because uh in the process uh if they do not correct certain infirmities uh that exist today then it would be very very difficult for example to get our uh budgets uh synchronized uh and uh and uh integrated into the uh master plan let us not forget that uh tourism is a very powerful economic tool and uh if i look and i 'm sure everybody in in the industry joins me in this view that uh uh tourism can be effectively used to alleviate poverty in the countryside of course it will yet it can also assist in urban renewal because as more jobs are created in the end in the countryside then the decongestion of uh the urban areas especially metro manila can then take place okay music  a tourism development program such as that envisioned by the master plan naturally has wide ranging implications on transportation policy primarily aviation policies this would necessarily involve the national carrier philippine airlines well uh right now we would like to seek the help of the government the d o t in seeking more liberal uh arrangements with uh countries like australia japan canada italy spain and unit united kingdom these are our main sources of tourists and present uh air agreements with these countries are so restrictive that we could not grow any further take the case of japan right now philippine airlines is already maximum using its maximum uh ra uh sea seats in japan and yet japan airlines is only utilizing sixty percent of its uh potential of its rights and to think that uh ten million japanese travel out of japan every year we are really only getting roughly about two percent of this ten million we would want to tap that market it 's so near to us but we would like the philippine government to help us get these rights and then as far as uh charters are concerned philippine airlines would be uh supportive of these provided that these groups are really genuine chartered inclusive tour groups in other words uh affinity affinity groups they are residents and citizens of the foreign countries from way from where they originate and that they do not uh supplant the present scheduled air carriers from these countries like say in the case of japan japan airlines and philippine airlines uh we would like to see them and uh we would want them to supplement the present air scheduled services not supplant them now we would like also to see the other airlines bring in more tourists to the philippines i don't know whether any of you know that philippine airlines bring say one thousand seven hundred percent more dutch than k l m we bring four hundred percent more british than unite than british airways we carry we carried uh three hundred percent more chinese than all that had been brought together by china airlines cathay pacific and c a a c and surely uh we 've carried more thais to the philippines than thai international so when we grant these charters we must make sure that these are genuine tourists who are out to visit the country not filipino workers from abroad because these workers our workers abroad are the they belong to the two carriers philippine airlines and the carrier of the country from where they originate we must guard against uh alleged uh charters who say who will say that they will bring uh tourists from the middle east and yet when you check the loads these are all returning overseas filipinos or returning balikbayans from california or from the u s music  significant changes in the existing international air transport policies are required including new civil aviation legislation and a more flexible interpretation of existing aviation policy to begin uh we are opting for the liberalization of the uh approval of inclusive tour air charter uh operations to the philippines okay uh secondly we would like to see the opening up of inclusive tour air charter operations to airports outside outside of manila and and cebu third i think it 's very important that the d o t regain its membership in the civil ave aviation board or civil aero aeronautics board what the c a b for short uh about four years ago we gave up our membership there and uh and in the process we 've realized our uh our uh mistake uh-huh uhm it 's important that uh the voice of tourism be heard in the civil aer aeronautics board uh and lastly uh we believe that uh the civil aviation code needs to be revised if i 'm not mistaken uh the existing code was drawn up in the early fifties and uh because of changes in uh the the world economy uh the way uh the way travel has developed and the importance today of tourism as uh an economic development tool it 's important that the code be revised to conform to the present uh situation and to anticipate future developments in tourism and travel uh today there is uh a house bill that uh attempts to uh revise the civil aviation code this is house bill number two two nine nine four and we 're hoping that uh congress approves this uh before uh before the end of their term music  can philippine airlines deliver the tourists that are envisioned to come in droves does philippine airlines have enough seats enough aircrafts enough flights yes
Philippines	joe about your uh your perception of the future after the elections well uh there is no doubt that uh what we must uh safeguard today is the uh canvassing of the votes to be it 's now being done at the municipal level and at the provincial level we must preserve its integrity so that these elections will truly become credible and let 's get the support of our people so that we can move our country forward dr mangahas well from my standpoint uh regarding the surveys i just hope that uh when all the results are in that the public will have a look again at so-called uh surveys such as the radio veritas survey they need to have a big big uh size and try to see really whether it 's accurate at all uh uhm the radio veritas survey was predicting that a that mr cojuangco 3 words for example it 's not happening at all uh uhm but uh insofar as the uh surveys of the s w s are concerned they 're more or less accurate yes i would say uh uhm i would say i would say well thank you very much gentlemen for uh having joined me in the panel tonight uh we have other guests uh for example secretary of foreign affairs raul manglapus will be uh called to the panel after this uh live report from cebu city come in cebu break in the recording  so you 've mentioned earlier in the coverage uh the sample that we have the that the data that we have uh is uh because of limitations in transmission uh professing a very large urban bias we broke down uh our data into uh regional sources and and we 've established that forty-nine point six percent of uh the numbers that we have are generated from the national capital region that is the largest uh segment of uh of the sample data that we have and uh the second uh largest sample that we have comes from uh uh region six uh now the sample size that we have so far posted uh amounts to only about five percent of uh the total vote or less and it is insufficient to extrapolate from this sample considering the size of that sample and considering the variance in the representation of of the regions although we do have uh samples from all the regions the sample sizes are not uh at all even yes and uh and we uh we are still trying to say that it 's too early to say that there 's any trend uh there are some uh who say that uh one candidate is leading uh by a big margin but uh again it 's too early to say that anybody is winning by that large a margin in any event we 'd like to ask uh secretary ramos here uh how he feels about the conduct of the election in general uh what is his reaction i do believe that uh the may eleventh election was uh on election day one of the most peaceful and uh violence-free i mean comparatively speaking i 've been into many of these things in the past as a deputy of the commission on elections and uh uh i am surprised uh as to how the level of violence was brought down and uh certainly the comelec uh its deputies the uh philippine national police and the armed forces of the philippines the uh other deputized agencies the comelec volunteers the uh uh pastoral parish council for responsible uh voting uh p p c r v uh as many as well as many others should be congratulated for uh a job well done however uh we 're now into phase two and uh this is the period where even greater frauds and anomalies can be perpetrated since just by the stroke of one pen you can change the cipher at the end of a report or the number in front of a number and change uh the uh the totals significantly so our people must continue to watch this the old political pros are adept at this game and uh those of us who are into politics for the first time and who are also non-traditional uh would want that uh the entire process be kept as clean as uh credible and as orderly as possible uh mr secretary during the campaign there were a lot of scare scenarios being uh peddled by uh uh parties uh uh all over uh we 've had the a an elec electoral process that uh uh defied the expectations as to peacefulness and turn-out and uh even the quickness of the count in spite of some delays uh how do you assess the uh the prospects for a continuation of this uh of this orderliness into the next few days well i uh think that if we apply the continuous uh monitoring process that has already been started uh meaning that the people themselves through the uh people 's organizations the n g os as well as uh us individuals continue to keep watch then uh i think this process can uh be maintained as uh one that is really remarkable uh in nineteen ninety-two but uh understand that uh as candidates find out that they are losing and have no more chances of catching up then they uh just fold up and they go home bringing with them the the poll watchers assigned to those precincts or to those uh uh municipal uh tally areas so uh i would then recommend uh in fact appeal to uh the citizenry to maintain the watch because there are still many more days of this media also should be commended for uh for maintaining this sort of reportage because uh the people should be informed this is part of the transparency also of the entire process sir as one of the front runners in this uh uh election uh that we just had how do you feel about the way the results are coming in uh is it still anybody 's ball game or is it yours uh-huh well uh of course there are many versions and we have a variety to choose from at any particular time uh which is good  uh in my particular case i uh knew right away that uh the very first reports would come from metro manila and this happens to be the uh bailiwick of uh miriam santiago uh these facts were established in uh various surveys in the past so we know more or less we know more or less the distribution of uh each one 's strengths in our fourteen regions in my case uh i 'm running second to miriam in the surveys in metro manila but i 'm seeing also that uh the big difference which uh appeared in the surveys insofar as metro manila was concerned is not appearing in the tallies uh in other words i 'm gaining here in metro manila uh in one of the surveys uh miriam was credited with some thirty-three percent of the possible vote in uh manila but i had only seventeen percent but in the actual tally so far uh she 's running at about twenty-eight percent and i 'm running at about twenty-one percent so that 's just seven percent difference meaning i gained here which will you which will you consider your bailiwick uh words   well uh in the in the previous surveys again and this is by s w s and crystal which is our in-house survey uh i am running either one or two in all the fourteen regions uh but those that are especially strong for me include uh region one of course which uh of which pangasinan my home province is a part uh the uh the two visayas regions region seven which is uh lito osme&ntilde;a 's home ground and also region eight uh samar leyte plus uh three out of the four regions in mindanao where i was running first but in the fourth one i 'm also running a close first or a close second there so those are my bailiwicks roughly uh six uh sure three regions we we have a very very small sample from uh region one uh point one four percent uh due to some problems in transmission which will be corrected tonight uh but in the very very small sample that we have you ranked fourth uh uh in in the region one sample that we have it 's too small of course well i 'll tell you what i got from uh some of our leaders in pangasinan who called up this uh afternoon they 're really working on a sample also because uh they don't have uh the complete returns yet but uh i am getting uh eighty percent of the vote there and i think this should be expected because uh words   words in pangasinan is your biggest province well it 's third really but it has one point one million registered voters and assuming that eighty percent voted or turned out then we have the potential of uh roughly uh eight hundred eight thousand votes so it comes after uh cebu and negros occidental since pangasinan is part of region one can your votes in pangasinan uh overwhelm the votes in the ilocos provinces oh yes because uh the combined votes of uh ilocos norte ilocos sur and la union abra is not considered to be a part of region one but even if you throw abra into region one although it 's part of the cordillera administrative region a combined vote of those four provinces will not exceed those of uh pangasinan alone uh in any case uh i am not uh i agree with bong that uh at this early stage considering the sample which is about three or four percent 'no  uh this is not enough on which to base any trend much less the claim of victory uh  medyo malayo yata 'yon  and uh i think we should await uh as you said uh a greater number of votes as well as a more even distribution within the regions we have always emphasized here at a b s c b n that uh our count is uh not producing a trend and uh and if people misread it it 's really their lookout you know i mean people like to see what they want to see and i understand some candidates are uh you know are so upset about how it 's going on but uh but it 's it 's a question of uh you see what you want to see laughter  just relax and enjoy yourselves laughter  another question that i have for you mr secretary is uh what are the lessons that you have learned in the campaign are there some insights that will help you if and when you win this election well i uh must uh consider this a very valuable learning experience going through the campaign for ninety days all over the country i think we missed uh just three provinces uh batanes and aurora although we had representatives from those provinces joining us uh there was one more province that uh oh just two because we visited uh tawi-tawi but uh to me the most uh valuable insight uh could should be uh an important uh basis for action in the future so that we could provide some remedies is the continuous dependence of our ordinary people on a political patron how even for the very small things our people in the rural areas especially seem to be uh so dependent on a recommendation from somebody that is important that they uh seem to have lost all initiative of trying to lead themselves 'no  uh precisely this is what uh we are trying to to fight in our party and that is uh the situation of the ordinary filipino continuing to be just a puppet or a pawn in the hands of uh the political uh masters in the community uh i just think that our ordinary people have the capability and the talent given some encouragement and some training and uh maybe some cre credit assistance to grow up and themselves become uh self-reliant and productive uh uh economic uh components of our society then will government will your administration give them the uh economic support to do this like credit yes uh that is what i call the second phase of the edsa revolution which is the economic empowerment of our people the political is finished and we should credit president aquino for that plus all those that helped her but uh certainly we should uh try to give supplemental income opportunities to our uh household for instance it 's being done there in negros occidental uh i 've seen it

goodness after all he 's been there three years i know all these years honestly you you girls haven't looked at another man  convince me  i have speaker a laughs   what do you mean i haven't looked at another man i always you know what i mean there 's nothing wrong with looking well uh okay looking in uh in admiration of course you look at admi with admiration  talaga  but that doesn't mean anything it 's how you translate what you uh you kn i mean you can look but just look it stops there no problem yeah and and liway you wanted to say something well you really look at other men it 's it 's uh unnatural not to laughter  who 's the seloso  who 's the selosa   wala   wala   wala  that 's how secure   well no no you see what happened is that uhm uh when we first came back from the states you know having been there for ten years our we our initial uh our married life was there and it 's a totally different it 's a totally different milieu  milieu  uh uhm you know you 're always together we came back here and it was culture shock   you 're always together in the states yes family you know etcetera   okay   may culture shock because here you have boys go out at night etcetera etcetera   uhm   and and mga pa-gambling gambling ga you you know the the whole macho thing comes comes out that 's very that 's very uh  okay   pinoy here that 's very pinoy  okay yeah and i was very unhappy with it and so uh w i think we were celebrating our seventeenth or eighteenth anniversary anyway kinda long right  uh-huh   and i said hey christian we gotta do something not naman seventeen but but but kuwan na rin  and i said christian we gotta talk about this we 'll have to talk about this because i 've seen so many couples that have just sort of drift apart so sort of thing and the you know the husband fools around  marriages  that 's what it is mostly most most of the time it 's the husband fooling around and i said christian we have been friends so long uh uhm can we just just just get this and i said until i 'm forty you have every opportunity i give you the permission to to fool around because until i 'm forty and he says why is that and i said it 's because until i 'm forty i have options speaker a laughs  i mean you know i was wondering  'no  okay fine i i i i want i i i have options you really did say that of course i mean   really  we are very we we were friends before we were lovers i i know that and uh you know i i wanted i i wanted to put it to him as like a friend you know don't betray me because i have options yeah yeah until i 'm forty i think i have options after i 'm forty i have no options so you can fool around until i 'm forty speaker a laughs  after i 'm forty you have no right to fool around because i have no more options or else deal 'no deal okay uh liway well in my case i never gave him any option laughter  from the very beginning yes  talaga  he should know anyway yes just kidding aside well i thank god that in my case really uhm it was uh not so much love at first sight but he 's really my first boyfriend and no one else  talaga  but liway what if one day you find out that he has a mistress what would you do well i don't know i 'll kill the mistress probably speaker a laughs  retain him chuckle no no no no what what if you find out that christian is seeing someone  uh  well i ha i have a different perspective what is that perspective uh i 'd blame my husband the mistress is totally irrelevant to me it 's because it 's our relationship that that is at stake whose failure is that most of the time you mentioned earlier husband fooling around  eh wala na nga siyang option because i 'm past forty e speaker a laughs   pero  okay liway  kami naman boy ako naman i 'm so secure uh let 's just say that i have uh really felt so good when we joined couples for christ  uh that helped a lot eleven years ago yes uh and uh that was the time when we were also brought into the marriage uh preparation uh program where we were conducting the uhm pre-cana uh we we took a course on uh uhm parang guidance counselors kami  uhm so we would give seminars in mary the queen preparing married couples uh i mean uh engaged couples to get married  pero liway in uh oo  in a few in a few lines liway how does couples for christ as an organization help uh married uh couples i mean couples well first of all we should believe in prayer we should believe that there is a god who would help couples who are uhm focused on him and uh because of this if it has an uh first of all an effect on on your relationship speaker a coughs i don't know what happened but we have been more open communicating with each other and uh more than being open communicating with each other it 's as if we have become uh more romantic more   i will debate that that 's you but what about couples who 've tried everything but things just wouldn't work out because they are not uh surrendered to the lord that 's what i would say and because from the very beginning they did not find the probably the love that would strengthen their relationship  uh-huh  they did not pray for passion laughter  well we talked about laughter husbands fooling around my question is this what if somebody comes to you goes to you and says and offers a proposal proposes and what if you discover one day that you have a child who is gay what would you do but before you talk about being gay and uh indecent proposals you are part of this private conversation we 're having with mareng winnie and liway chato stay with us
Philippines	 para sa akin and yet on the other hand we have to admit we do have a surfeit of people doing charity work uh uhm i don't know there are agencies of the government that make seven copies of the  corp corporate of a correspondence when they need only one to send and the second to keep ano   mga things like that uh uhm i think really uh that we have instead of cutting down on the number of the bureaucracy we have to try to retrain some of them and put them into the social services the teachers the rural workers stuff like that  'no   'yan  and you say congress is the place to do it well i think it 's where we initiate actions 'no uh and and congress to my mind has has done a lot of things for instance in the last uh session 'no people people tend to denigrate congress but in fact uh some substantial things have happened for instance the standardization of uh of uh positions in the in the in the government that was to me a very big word   civil service  yes in the standardization of positions everybody now whether you are a justice or a or a janitor or a driver you know you belong to some salary grade and you 're the same that cuts across the entire bureaucracy that was a very big step forward i think congress still has the ability to make changes like that  music  okay we 'll be right back  words the lone district of para&ntilde;aque and he 's running under the n u c d and uh he is the recently resigned chairman of the public estates authority you 're in some kind of a controversy over the proclamation of uh manila bay converting it into a satellite city of some sort yes yes uh when you when you plan ahead and you have big projects  you think of ten years from now it 's always controversial but it 's exciting  you 're five years ahead  now since you arrived late can we just ask you one question before we go to the non-runners here why are you seeking public office after your job at the p e a is there is this a power trip of some kind to you you can't let go of power you can't stop pushing people and pushing buttons no ahm in the public estates authority i 've learned a lot and i think i 've done projects that are good for not only para&ntilde;aque but uh pasay city and as far as las pi&ntilde;as but since i 'm a resident at para&ntilde;aque i 'd really like to continue the work that we 've started in the public estates authority such as and uh oh many many projects we started the coastal road it 's now expanded to six lanes we 've lighted it up uh the coastal road used to be a salvaging zone now peace and order prevails there because we 've set up a police precinct the southern police district is now also located in the coastal road we 're building two hospitals there one a ten story hospital another one a twenty-four hour emergency clinic government hospital no this is a joint venture between the government and the private sector uh uhm we 're also building the uh one of the biggest uh low cost housing areas in the government in cooperation with uh then g s i s general manager sonny belmonte  so you 're afraid you 're to let go of these beautiful projects you know [ 2> as a private citizen  but as a congressman you think you can supervise uh these projects in the future  words pangarap     that 's one that 's one  you know uh one thing you learn in government is that uh there are many things that you 'd like to do but you can't do and there are many things that have to be done to uh to make government become more efficient and one of the things that you have to do is perhaps improve some of the laws that restrict government from becoming more efficient  uhm  so when you become a congressman you will liberalize and deregulate that 's one of the things i 'd really like to do you see in government uh if you 're too slow they say uh you 're too slow why are you too slow if you 're too fast they say uh what 's wrong with you how come you 're too fast  so it 's got to be rationalized i mean you know we have to assume that government people are working in government because they want to do a good job the idea is to make it easier for them to do a good job rather than to make it difficult uh to do a good job and i think a few uh legislative pieces of legis uh legislation words   there 's something  okay so now we 've heard practically all the reasons for running now let 's go to the laughter to the customs commissioner and the uh airport general manager you know i think you two are just as good healthy energetic innovative etcetera as uh these gentlemen who are running uh but why aren't you don't you want to serve the people quote quote uh commissioner apacible well in my case jullie in nineteen eighty-four i was a uh very reluctant uh uh candidate for congress already so nakadanas na rin ako ng kampanya sa batangas buong probinsiya pa e  at that time i was still a bachelor so i had nothing to worry about but uh when the next elections came i was about to run i was already serving the development bank of the philippines uh i told myself you know i just uh have served government and doing something for our people in d b p  hindi naman pala kailangang mahalal para tumulong sa tao uhm  kaya noong eighty-seven nagpaplano na rin akong mag-asawa sabi ko pagka kung papasok ako sa pulitika baka magulo lang ang buhay ko kaya inuna ko muna 'yong aking pamilya sapagkat medyo huli na akong nag-asawa at uh dalawa lang kaming lalaki sa pamilya eh  uh uhm  kaya since nauna siya sa pulitika e di siya na muna kasi alam mo palabas ang pera diyan sa pulitika eh  uh uhm  kailangan naman ng isa para mag-alaga sa mga kapatid dahil lima ang mga kapatid kong babae  uh-huh  kaya patay na ang ama namin kaya sabi ko ako na lang siguro ang mag-aalaga sa pamilya ng naiwan kong ama at saka pamilya ko naman habang siya naman ay naroon pag sawa na siya siguro puwedeng pag-isipan ko na  uh what do you intend to do once you become a private citizen  wo won't you miss the power you know now you can uh order people to do this to do that things happen uh with a snap of the fingers yeah actually kasi jullie ang  orientation natin nagsimula tayo sa opposition  na 'yon  there was a time from nineteen seventy-eight to nineteen eighty-four i quit my business and my job because i really went full time uh in organizing the opposition against the past regime uh uhm  so nakita ko nang kaya kong mabuhay sa sarili kong ano maski na underground economy o maski buy and sell uh uhm so wala na akong takot diyan kaya lang nakita ko rin itong kapangyarihan once you 're in office pala hindi mo naiisip ito dahil sa dami ng trabahong ginagawa mo it 's only when you reflect maybe after i get out of my office that i will say to myself uy ang lakas pala ng aking uh puwesto ang lakas ang dami ko palang kapangyarihan di ko nagamit   pero on the other hand baka maipagmalaki ko 'to sapagkat no one in the family has even benefitted from that power that i am enjoying right now what about you general manager carrascoso why aren't you running you look like uh you can tackle the work of doc carrascoso basically jullie my role in government is uh first of all coterminous with the uh president aquino uh uhm and i gave myself four years to serve the government as if i was drafted in the army that 's about it i think uh you 've had enough of us or we 've had enough of you laughter  well i think uh we should we should uh lead a quieter life and probably go back to the private sector and words   what is your biggest frustration  well i think it 's it 's uh trying to please everybody uh-huh and i think uh uh you can't do it and it 's a thankless job and basically i think uh i have done my part and uh if somebody if they don't agree with some of my of my policies well i try to my best to serve uh uhm i 've always said that anyone who can straighten out the international airport deserves to be president i don't know if you gentlemen agree but you know that airport is really the heart of chaos anarchy lack of order lack of discipline lack of planning you know i 'm talking about the architectural uh requirements that are not there we 're talking about water not being there we 're talking about doors falling apart and people running in and out who should not be there uh by the way jullie i 'm the only agency with water and and power all this this time yeah   all the time ha you 're sure well how did you how did you do that well i planned it since last year that i knew that there would be a lot of problems as far as water and uh power is concerned and we addressed this problem as early as last year how did you ensure uh continuous power when the rest of metro manila suffers three to four hour brownouts every day well first of all they gave me a priority as far as this is concerned but uh there are ta times that we have real emergency powers over there and uh all of our air-conditionings are now decentralized uh uhm and so i think basically these are the uh the things that we have done over the years uh uhm and when i leave in june i 'll be leaving the the coffers of naia with one billion pesos oh that 's good now in the meantime what can you say about doc uh your brother seeking an elected office  di did your family have a meeting a council of some kind well to counsel him i found out that docky was running when i was on my way back in manila and i said well it it 's up to him if he thinks that he can serve the country on a bet on a different way and i think i wish him luck and hopefully he will win uh-huh did uh doc didn't you try to get ed to run also for some kind of an elected office uh what is that jullie didn't you try to get him to run oh no no no no  to convince him to run   uh we do not try to look into each other 's lives 'no laughter  our late father has taught us that way 'no  to leave each other in peace and maybe we just get together when we one is one has a problem or one needs help that is the only time that we get together but basically you 'll be surprised probably we don't see each other for about three four months  to each his own  uh uhm is this politics in the blood for for some of you for the apacibles this is your first time this is my first time the only other politician in the family was my great grandfather agapito zialcita whom you you never saw who was an original signatory to the declaration of philippine independence in eighteen ninety-eight and it stopped there uh-huh the rest of the family are professionals doctors engineers and uh i 'm the only one who 's trying this new thing in our case uh our late father was a congressman four-termer he died in office uh-huh so when he died uh alam mo ganyan ang kaugalian e kung mapasimulan ng ama pag mamatay gusto 'yong either asawa o anak e wala pa naman ako sa edad 'yong kapatid ko lang ang nasa edad kaya siya ang lumaban ng mayor sa aming bayan  and i think he was a uh two termer there or something like that three three three terms yeah he was one of the most outstanding uh mayors at that time but but so nakasimula siya siya na ang nauna kaya ako medyo nag- shift na ng career e  but to be frank ano isn't it nice to be just a plain simple private citizen i mean is the power that you get worth the trouble you know being unable to sleep soundly people knocking on your door at five o' clock in the morning people asking you for a job for money to bury the dead sonny you were a newspaperman tell me which part of your life did you enjoy most being a newspaperman or being the boss of the g s i s manila hotel philippine airlines you inherited all those positions i mean you got all those positions you know overnight and how did you how would you compare your happiness then and now and now you 're going into it you know again 
Philippines	and we can tell this by the amount of mud flying in all directions some are smarter than others according to the book some are also meaner than others judging from the amount of black propaganda that has surfaced in recent days tonight uh to evaluate the campaign and the election in its final stages we have representatives of three leading presidential contenders we have maribel ongpin representing the people 's reform party and miriam defensor santiago we have vic limlingan representing the laban ng demokratikong pilipino and house speaker ramon mitra and we have congressman jose de venecia representing lakas edsa and uh defense secretary fidel ramos maribel excuse me for being ungallant but we will begin with the gentlemen because okay it 's fine with me we have a hot topic with congressman de venecia who will tell us about the batasan the batasan raid last saturday joe what happened and what 's going to happen now actually i was in pangasinan just completed a rally at dawn and then i got a call from congressman amante and from raffy alunan to come to manila from pangasinan because they received a very hot tip from one of the employees of the congress printing press that uh millions of sample ballots and propaganda materials of speaker mitra were being printed there and they wanted us to go because we are members of the house and we could make a quick inspection and i said okay i 'll come along so i came to manila went with congressman amante of agusan and congressman lopez of manila to the batasan to find out if it is if it 's true that uh these things are happening there besides it is our moral obligation and our legal duty to do so because these are funds of the republic of the people and when we went there we asked permission from the two guards who were there if we could enter they reluctantly agreed after about fifteen minutes they agreed so this was not a raid uh barging into a premise that 's closed   no no we 're gentlemen congressmen we are members of the house this is our house this is our common house but what was the reason for the ten fifteen minute delay they were a little bit apprehensive so we were we began we became suspicious then they allowed us to go in and uh congressman amante saw some uh sample ballots in the waste basket carrying the mitra-fernan ticket and uh well i thought that it could be just somebody put it there but then when we opened some of the uh tons and tons of boxes of uh propaganda materials completed there but we didn't know it was propaganda materials because they were sealed with uh brown paper and then when we opened it my god we saw there uh millions of uh propaganda materials of mitra-fernan in english in tagalog in ilokano in cebuano and uh that was the time when uh congressman amante called in the newspapermen who were having breakfast because there 's something to show words   but the news reports had it that you know these uh these newsmen were gathered by raffy alunan words restaurant in quezon city circle was this raid pre-meditated as suggested by some newspapermen   it was not a raid   we were going to see and check whether it 's true that there were any anything hanky panky going on there if there was none then we 'll just call it a day and you contend that this is hanky panky i was praying that nothing would happen because we did not want to bring any impairment to the reputation of the house we 've had already so many problems in the house we did not want uh this thing to happen and when uh we found that this this uh illegal massive misuse of government funds being happening there in the batasan in the uh parliament of the people then congressman amante called in the newspapermen and when they came in they blocked the doors who blocked the doors the guards there blocked the doors and some of the employees blocked the doors how many employees were in the premises there were about seven or eight seven i thought only two no two were outside but inside the premises inside the printing establishment there were words   actually printing were they running the machine running the machines and they were printing campaign materials campaign materials campaign materials   or the uh according to the employees it was the omnibus well that that 's what i was going to say in twenty-four hours they have issued four or five versions of the story there well when this was happening by the way let let me just complete the story after we made this inspection we were satisfied that a crime was being committed there we were going home make the statement and call a press conference by god the words and the marines locking the steel gates of the batasan compound the complex  words  on whose orders on whose orders we believed it was on the instruction of the sergeant the sergeant-at-arms who was taking direct orders from speaker mitra who happened to be in pangasinan in san fabian pangasinan was the speaker or was the sergeant-at-arms in the premises no that time he was not there so they were communicating and they were communicating with him and we were detained there for about three to four hours uh uhm we were detained when i said we congressman amante congressman lopez and myself and about twenty-two other newspapermen what was the reason for the detention i don't know we were uh they said that no you cannot leave you you 're not permitted to leave uh uhm and so we argue with the marine guard and then he says he 's waiting for instructions from his senior officer by the way the marine guard the marines are administratively under the marine commandant but operationally under the control at the sergeant-at-arms who takes his orders from the speaker of the house let 's ask the let let me just say that uh we begged to to to leave the premises they did not allow us and then finally i called on on chairman monsod and on commissioner yorac and said please come and see for yourself or for himself if it was going to be chris monsod and see this major massive uh misuse of government funds by a major presidential candidate and uh finally they came at about four o'clock and when they came at four o'clock they said the key was lost for more than an hour so yorac was stopped there for another hour and finally she was allowed to come in with the major general of the police force uh at about five o'clock and i left at about five thirty and in the meantime i was saying that they have issued five versions speaker mitra issued a statement from pangasian that it was a burglary banayo the spokesman of the l d p said that uh that we planted the evidence how could you plant the evidence by god there were tons of propaganda materials there and the marines are guarding the place and then you have the security officers of the house and secondly that means that proves that we are not in cahoots with the marines as a matter of fact they detained us they would not let us go thirdly they said 'no that these uh sample ballots and these propaganda materials were misdelivered by a printing press in quezon city to the printing press of of the that 's the version of ofelia cruz this is the version of uh deputy secretary general of the house ofelia cruz the final version is of uh secretary general sabio last night who said that these are the booklets of the omnibus uh local government code so they have done four versions in less than twenty-four hours  uh uhm  uh uhm and there are no fifth version sixth version what really happened vic lim yeah as uh as i am not personally and emotionally involved in the issue i would like to look at larger perspective and i just have two comments to make the first comment i 'd like to make is to contrast the behavior of my party the l d p when we discovered that government funds were being misused we went through due process we did not consider ourselves to be the investigator the prosecutor or the judge what we did is we filed a complaint with the comelec we went to the supreme court in order to stop the payment of the nalgo and bago funds we did not arrogate unto ourselves to be everything which i suppose is the habit of the military mind and the martial law what we would like to state therefore is in this particular case what they should have done is that if they felt that there was something wrong is to have gone and filed a case with the comelec to have gone to the authorities it is very difficult in this situation to say that they are a disinterested bystander and therefore it is in the eyes of the law it 's quite important that they do not act as doing everything else the other thing i would like to make is this seeming obsession to eliminate the candidate by technical knockout again it is uh it is a strategy which is used only in dictatorships what we would like to stress is that for these things to let the people decide if you feel that speaker mitra has misused his funds let the people not vote for him that is why we will have the election on may eleven why are we going to try to eliminate speaker mitra and disenfranchise what we feel would be about the eleven million voters who will vote for him why what is the point of all those but let me just point out one thing to you uh why is it that uh i think almost all the other presidential candidates called on uh the speaker to withdraw i mean it is not just ramos it includes cojuangco salonga uh laurel uh miriam defensor-santiago well if if uh you think he is being singled out well as they say he 's he 's the front-runner so if you can get the front-runner to leave laughter all discussants are talking at the same time  if we go then through the course of action what is uh where do you go from here uh well melinda we uh we uh signed the complaint today congressman amante congressman lopez and myself we filed our uh administrative complaint with the commission on elections pursuant to the provisions of the election code that there has been a violation of the election code punishable by six years imprisonment and permanent disqualification from office whether this progresses or not it is our duty to file this uh with the commission on elections so basically your your having gone to the batasang pambansa was part of a course of action completing what might be called a process meaning you found evidence on which then you are now filing a case uh uhm but realistically joe can we expect uh speaker mitra to be disqualified from this election uh i personally do not wish uh speaker mitra to be disqualified so why file the disqualification request but it is our duty it is our duty it is our duty under the election code to report a uh a crime committed and we filed this case with the uh comelec under the and then there is a criminal aspect of this case which now the the fiscals will not handle but the comelec will handle and the comelec will itself file the case with the ombudsman as to the final action of the comelec we leave that to uh commissioner yorac uh she said yesterday that she felt that uh there is a serious case here and that she is waiting for the proper cases to be filed with the comelec and this we have done apparently uh the process will take longer than five days and uh speaker mitra will continue to uh participate in the election
Philippines	 first part not taped operating independently but in coordination with the armed forces of the philippines uh uhm  alright uh perhaps you can comment on what we have asked general abadilla about the rumors that uh word the no el = no election is already a thing of the past that is already an obsolete word because the elections are proceeding comparatively uh peaceful but the no proclamation is still hanging like a sword of damocles and uh of course we don't want that to happen we want that the voice of the people will be heard and duly registered in the uh in the uh proclamation of uh the rightful winners what can you comment on this general i share the optimism of our chief-of-staff and uh we are also convinced that the entire leadership of the armed forces of the philippines together with the rank-and-file are convinced that there will be a proclamation come twelve noon of june thirty nineteen ninety-two  and uh we are convinced that after twelve noon of nineteen ninety-two june uh june thirty nineteen ninety-two we will have a new commander-in-chief of the armed forces of the philippines to whom we shall uh give our loyalty and service and uh we don't believe that uh there will be a situation where there will be no proclamation at all as uh mentioned by general abadia this morning and uh also uh the statements of the comelec uh commissioners there will always be or there will be a winner to be proclaimed by june thirty nineteen ninety-two even if that winner will only win by a mere uh uh plurality vote there will be one who will be proclaimed as president i i i think that if the elections are clean and orderly as they are showing signs that they will definitely be we have no one to congratulate but the people ourselves 'no  yes because i think uh the people have been very vigilant especially the volunteer groups like the p p c r v the uh parish pastoral council for responsible voting there are about almost a million of them eight hundred thousand they think of sort and uh they are out in the in the fields and uh they are in tandem with the civic action group and we have never noted this such enthusiasm as we note now amongst these volunteers 'no  they 're not being paid and uh in fact uh they 're risking life and limb but uh uh they are rest assured that these elections are going to be peaceful then another volunteer group is uh the uh integrated bar of the philippines uh who will extend uh on the spot legal advice if they could uh  react  and also uh you you said something about the react uh is this another communications group yes this is the regional emergency action group 'no communication action group 'no and this is also working in tandem with the civic action group we have set up a monitoring system in camp aguinaldo and by the way uh ray i would like to to just inform our public that uh in case there are rumors about uh anything that you would like to be clarified you can call up uh the rumor alert center in camp aguinaldo and this is uh collocated with the monitoring uh center and the telephone number is seven zero five three eight eight or you can fax your message to seven zero five one eight one there is always an officer responsible to clarify any rumor that you would like to be clarified okay you got those numbers again they are seven zero five three eight eight and if uh you have a fax machine seven zero five one eight one and they can call up the trunk line of uh camp aguinaldo which is seven two one nine zero zero one and seven two one nine zero three one and ask for local six seven six three six seven five two and six seven four three and there are always people who will attend to your query or uh information general gaby uh comelec is ready now and so we have cielo villaluna there i think uh she has the very popular and the very colorful commissioner haydee yorac cielo music  thank you very much ray and gaby we are now back at the commission on elections and we 're coming in live with me is the very popular commissioner haydee yorac who is who will be off to the mindanao province at twelve noon today and uh she said that she 's quite in a rush so we will go through this interview as fast as we can okay cielo i would like to take the first crack at the question first i like to bid her godspeed in her trip to mindanao and then uh very quickly now uh ms commissioner uh how do you make an assessment of the ongoing elections up to this time from seven a m up to this time i uh voted at eight thirty this morning and i went to the pi&ntilde;ahan elementary school and then i went to the quezon city hall and the office of the election registrar and uh just uh uh went uh by different precincts in metro manila and uh my general impression up to this point is that the elections are proceeding smoothly naturally if you are managing an elections as massive as we are conducting now there will be a few hitches music  i think that 's one of the few hitches that uh commissioner yorac is uh talking about uh well it 's a technical problem beyond our control in the meantime back to the panel here uh gaby and i have uh several phoned-in complaints from our televiewers and uh just as soon as ms yorac is installed back and uh she 's able to uh go on the air we will be able to refer these questions uh to her in the meantime back to what we we 're talking about about volunteer groups and these accredited groups let 's not fail to mention the media assistance quick count uh you 're aware of this of course and uh you know how massive uh this uh agrupment is aren't you general yes yes uh we have also some linkages with them as a matter of fact we have uh several meetings with ms tita de villa and some representatives of the media citizens quick count and uh we have linkages with them and uh we are working very closely with them let me ask gaby roldan here if uh she has in one way or another any involvement in these volunteer groups because i have uh i 'm uh one of the p p c r v active member in in my parish uh do you ever or did you ever join any of these volunteer groups no not recently uhm i was supposed to join the the group for the parish pastoral for responsible voting except that uhm we 've been quite busy preparing for the elections so i think this is my uh small contribution towards ensuring a you know orderly elections by way of information to our viewers vi via channel nine 's coverage of the elections okay uh i 'm very excited about uh seeing commissioner yorac all over again i think she is uh on now and then our technical facilities are a-ok so come in comelec okay we are we on okay we are now back at the comelec we just had some difficult problems a while ago as commissioner yorac was saying there have been reports of uh unconfirmed reports of massive disenfranchisement and commissioner yorac is warning media to first confirm reports prior to reporting she has made the rounds of the different polling precincts in the quezon city area and to give a recap commissioner yorac will you give us once more your update yes uh in uh barang barangay pi&ntilde;ahan where i vote at the pi&ntilde;ahan elementary school voting was proceeding quickly and smoothly and uh there was only one precinct where there was a minor hitch the ballots did not arrive but the chairman of the board of election inspectors has gotten the registrar 's office and the office of the treasurer that by this time i am sure that the problem has already been addressed uh there were also reports about uh the uh delays in the delivery of uh paraphernalia in district two and uh this is explained by the fact that we were solving the problem of misallocation last night uh certain uh uh bags had to be uh repacked redistributed and uh but uh on the whole the elections are going very very smoothly and whatever reported incidents are really very small incidents compared to the general orderliness peacefulness and uh enthusiasm about the elections also joining us this morning is the honorable chairman christian monsod who will give us an update later on but first we shall continue with our interview with commissioner yorac because she will be soon flying off to the mindanao province ma'am you will be your first stop will be jolo and it will be followed by zamboanga and tawi-tawi do you have an initial assessment of the conduct of the voting in these areas uh well uh my my reports so far is everything is uh going smoothly the critical leaders of these provinces which we have placed under comelec control have accepted uh special procedures that we have set up in these places among which are the uh designation of the armed forces of the philippines as the lead agency in helping the elections implement uh election laws and rules uh the p n p 's only secondary in these areas second is the clustering that we have done and third the uh safekeeping of uh of uh critical election uh supplies such as the uh indelible ink the uh election returns and the certificates of canvass word the military commanders for delivering only at the time of counting at the start of canvass the election hot spots in mindanao are the so-called critical areas and the comelec has been very vigilant in ensuring orderly honest and peaceful polls and over the past weeks we have met with the political leaders who in turn have given the assurance that they will abide by the by the election laws can you give us an update on the participation and the behavior of the political groups is peace and order running in the area well uh yes while we 've had a few incidents in the last few days for example there was this bombing in cotabato city uh which uh resulted in the death of a number of persons there was also a bomb explosion in isabela which is the capital of basilan province and this is the reason among others which uh made the comelec cluster the voting in the uh province of basilan uh the uh marine commandant there uh sent us a uh a uh rush telegram saying that he could not assure the peace and order situation in the course of the voting unless the elections uh were clustered and so we uh clustered the voting i understand that there have been some reactions on the part of the of some political leaders uh i got a telephone call from governor salapudin last night uh asking me to postpone the elections but i said that it is the sense of the uh commission en banc that we should continue with the national elections and we will take it from there there is an unconfirmed report that uh voting did not push through in marawi city would you clarify this point i think the point has already been clarified we have been in touch with the regional election director for region twelve atty teresita llaban and the confirmed fact is that there is voting in marawi there was a slight problem in the municipality of masue  but there is voting in marawi and i 'm really amazed with that kind of report because i was speaking with atty omar umpar who is running for vice-governor in the province of marawi at one o'clock this morning there was no indication at all from him who should be most interested about the process in marawi city because he votes in marawi city but uh he did not give me any indication that anything was remiss about the delivery of supplies and materials in marawi city and we just have it now the final word of the matter marawi is voting and voting is going on peacefully and in an orderly fashion alright commissioner yorac may i butt in please go ahead ray how much time do you still have how much time do you still have for us another two minutes
Philippines	 start of sentence not taped four thirty-three point seventy-two five twenty twenty point sixty-eight percent six thirty-eight point seven two seven thirty-three point twenty-three the major determinant of social stratification is income because of the difficulty in obtaining these data other factors such as size of house kind and number of appliances the household has were considered now in terms of income ano ba 'yung a b well the a b are those with over one hundred thousand per year the salary c those uh who have sixty thousand to one hundred thousand pesos uh as income per year and d below sixty thousand pesos other factors mentioned were used subject subjectively intensifying the borderline classes based on the nineteen eighty-eight family income and expenditures survey the criteria mentioned earlier classifies sixty-four point seventy-one percent of households as class d e twenty point forty-four percent as class c and fourteen point eighty-five percent as class a b in metro manila alone fifty-one point twenty-four percent were classified as class d e twenty-seven point thirty-four percent as class c and twenty-one point thirty-two percent as class a b the barangays were stratified according to the dominant class of the residents a class a b barangay is dominated by a b residents a class d e barangay is dominated by d e residents a class c barangay on the other hand is not necessarily dominated by class c residents rather we see a mixture of a b c and d e residents the survey includes fifteen barangays allocated equally to the three socio-economic groups only one voting center will be enumerated in each sample barangay  from the chosen voting center thirty percent of the precincts will be taken as a representative the chosen barangays for the respective classes are as follows class a b one barangay each from makati las pi&ntilde;as quezon city san juan marikina as you can see for class c one barangay each from marikina pasig manila muntinlupa quezon city for class d e one barangay each from para&ntilde;aque quezon city muntinlupa manila and marikina we have fielded twenty-one volunteers to cover the designated areas we 're expecting that approximately thirty percent of the votes will be canvassed by nine o'clock this evening our volunteers will take uh note of the partial and unofficial returns and by nine o'clock or ten o'clock this evening we will have that report for you uh we would like to emphasize that we are not trending we are not projecting we 're just sampling on how the different uh socio-economic classes in these defined areas have voted are voting and later on as the m c q c count comes in because the m c q c count will come in tomorrow yet at around four o'clock or two o'clock in the afternoon so in between what you will have would be the reportage from our r p n network 's uh volunteers our own reporters c n n allied and so on and so forth but we will be giving you this network demographic count which is highlight of pollwatch ninety-two  we have the man on top of this uh project dr arniel barrios uh siguro that was a mouthful i said 'no  it is your project so uh are the volunteers out already in their respective areas uh they 're still here and uh after this i 'm supposed to brief them and uh their they 'll go to their respective assignments uh uhm and by three o'clock this afternoon uh we 're going to decide uh how many how many precincts they are going to consider for each uh voting center and then we have to they will uh relax there wait after the uh closing a certain yeah closing and after a certain number of uh votes have been counted uh they will uh have the partial tabulation are we having the civic action group to uh utilize  yeah  they have uhm uh installed their station there alright and uh they 're supposed to be the one who will transmit the uh partial returns and uh tomorrow for the uh final tabulation we will also assist our volunteers to uh bring the uh questionnaires here in the studio so uh we can be assured a very fast transmission of results   right  because we have the c a g the civic action group backing it up they are mobile and they are equipped with the v h f facilities gaby are we talking greek or well no it is just that it is very interesting uh how the whole concept about this demographic count is very interesting to me and i 'm at at this point i 'm wondering how the demographic count results will fare as far as the official results are going to come out well official you 'll refer to the comelec to the comelec the comelec tabulation is the official not even m c q c  yeah  but that the point you 're asking is whether our sampling will match eventually with the unofficial or even the official well uh as what mr pedroche has mentioned a while ago we are going to take samples in metro manila only uh uhm it means that uh whatever result we are going to obtain this may apply only in metro manila okay at this point uh excuse me at this point do you have any uhm propositions do you have any premises as of now as to for example how the a and b the c the d and the e are going to vote not yet that is what we 're going to look for yeah uh and then let 's say in forbes park for example uh that 's an a mostly a and upper b area uh we will know by around ten o'clock uh how an a area for example forbes park uh voted 'no voted president vice-president and the senatorial candidates 'no  and then compare it with the other uh a b groups uh in in metro manila and later on as we get results from the provinces the different city centers urban centers there and match 'no whether there is really uh later on we will find out if uh our survey have obtained a representative of how the uh voting population voted but the main objective of this of the uh survey is mainly to know how the different socio-economic classes voted here in metro manila okay i hope it 's clear it 's not to pre-empt m c q c right it 's not to establish a trend it is not uh as if it is an official count it is an unofficial count and it has to be emphasized that uh this is just a sampling taken from the entire universe of uh the electorate okay so watch that and that 's going to be one of the highlights of pollwatch ninety-two  what do we have next okay arniel is there anything more you would like to say before uh we let you go i know you have to go to your uh post to talk to your volunteers yeah uh uhm have some briefing no problems with the i d ha  no more problems okay okay again i would like to uh clarify to the televiewers that this is just a survey and we have taken uh five precincts from what we think are the class a b five precincts no sorry five voting centers five voting centers from what we think are class c and five uh voting centers from what we think are class d e in metro manila only okay and uh as we know metro manila is an urbanized area uh but this does not necessarily mean that all other urban uh centers voted same as what has happened here in metro mani as what was going to happen here in metro manila okay uh gaby isn't that interesting 'no  won't you want to know how the people in tondo let 's say an e area that 's why i asked dr barrios earlier if they have certain propositions that they merely want to validate because i suppose uh we all know that there are some candidates like in the presidentiables and vice-presidentiables who would definitely be you know a mass mass who would have mass appeal and are they i was wondering earlier whether the demographic count would seek to validate certain propositions   well maybe that that is not although that is not the main objective it might in a way incidentally validate that without meaning to but uh if it does validate then that 's alright isn't it actually based on this uh late recent uh uh days there are some uh articles in inquirer  they 're trying to uh co uh construct some theories on how uh the voting population are going to vote is that so and i i think uh there 's an article there on uh uh according to them they 're going to vote according to the socio-economic classes and but they have not mentioned uh who are the preferences of each classes uh other uh classifications aside from uh socio-economic could be the different sectors 'no  for example answer this for me dr barrios is there uh a religious vote with i 'm talking about iglesia vote catholic vote is there a youth vote is there a farmers' vote is there an a b vote and so on and so forth huh i don't really know   okay let 's confine to the youth vote and the farmers' vote 'no  i think because it 's dan dangerous to tread on the religious vote uh in my personal opinion i think there is such a thing as the iglesia vote okay but when it comes to youth i don't i 'm i 'm not really sure if there is such a thing as youth vote yeah youth means that uh they are thirty-five uh years of age and below and they comprise one half of the thirty-two point something million uh voters  right  well if there is such a thing as a youth vote whoever that uh candidate is uh he or she will be assured of about fifty-six percent of the voting population uh-huh will the youth if there 's a youth vote vote solidly for if there 's such a thing if there 's such a thing yeah there 's another uh group which uh i 'm looking for an answer to as to whether there is a farmers' vote because there are millions of them there are about uhm seventy members of a household belonging to a farmers' or an agricultural of sort group imagine that seventy did i say about that 'no  well i think there are efforts right now among the farmers' groups to consolidate themselves and come up with a some form of a farmers' vote although i think they themselves agree that uh as of now there is no definite farmers' vote but i think it is the process of constructing or making one i think which is what they find in this year 's election okay i i you 're right there uh we 'll go back to this discussion uh we have uh in readiness now a report from uh cagayan de oro d x k o come in cagayan de oro a two-minute report by art cuaresma  thank you very much atty art cuaresma d x k o cagayan de oro now back to the different sectors and their votes we asked earlier if there 's a farmers' vote the youth vote and uh dr barrios was saying it seems that there 's a youth vote but he was not very definite about it but uh would you want to repeat what you said if there 's a youth vote yeah uh if there 's such a thing as youth vote uh that whoever that candidate is favored by uh this sector uh he or she will be assured about fifty-six percent of the uh votes but then i i dare say that uh not all of that will go to one particular candidate because the youth vote i think is also further divided into yeah more than one candidate  exactly 
Philippines	and i think all 's well that ends well uh uh they are good friends uh i i sincerely hope that uh with her statement tonight uh everything will be cleared and number one that there is no evidence whatsoever to uh merit uh the accusation and number two that ms martinez heard it from someone so in effect that 's hearsay hearsay okay going back a little uh sa statement n'yo sir truth versus blackmail who 's blackmailing whom who 's blackmailing no no that 's uh no no i 'm sorry that that 's uh that 's a misstatement that 's truth versus lies meaning uh  baka nag slip of the tongue ho kayo  that 's uh maybe that 's why so who who 's blackmailing whom  no no no no   someone 's trying to blackmail dan romualdez  no no that i said i clarified that that that 's a misstatement and i 'm sorry for that uh i think it 's truth versus lies so maybe not even lies maybe i 'd like to say that it 's truth versus uh uh maybe accusations or unfounded accusations i 'm not saying it 's lies 'no  uh you know i i 'd like to give the benefit of the doubt to ms martinez  it 's possible that somebody told her that atty romualdez did indeed receive money that to me is uh and especially so that it 's coming out that the person who told ms martinez that uh somebody uh that dan romualdez did indeed receive money came from somebody from a polluted source okay okay yeah senator pimentel but is is it really all 's well that ends well because some may may opening pa doon sa statement ni chit e because she is saying that uh this is what rita canlas told me okay you know what about rita canlas now if if chit martinez 's statements are hearsay what about what rita canlas is saying well if canlas has first hand information on the transaction as it were 'no then she would make for a good witness but i don't know where she is we have had no contact whatsoever with her did you try to get in touch with her at least the opposition no not at this point because uh my understanding is she is out of the country uh uh okay mr ang do you have contact with ms canlas  no absolutely no contact with ms canlas  uh uh i i don't intend we don't intend to contact her uh our conscience is clear atty romualdez has not received any money from anybody he has not attempted even attempted to influence the president into lifting her order or lifting a veto uh uhm and so   that 's  that 's it as far as you 're concerned he is cleared already  ganon ho ba yon kahit na may rita canlas pa doon  let let me say that he was not tarnished in the first place there were innuendoes there were some talks but these are loose talks you know and and and very unfair accusations i 'd like to think that uh if a man is truly honest and truly uh not guilty of anything he should not be worried uh senator pimentel as far as you are concerned is mr romualdez cleared already probably cleared by chit martinez  but not by unless somebody comes up and accuses him again using for example ms canlas then uh the re-investigation can be started uh again okay we 're going to have to take a break for uh a while  strictly politics will be right back stay with us break  she will not uh i you know she word no ifs no buts she has to get to the bottom of things and she has decided to get to the bottom of things and precisely she has or she has asked or ordered instructed her chief presidential legal counsel to refer the matter to the ombudsman for proper investigation uh yes uh but sir you have uh years uh of experience as a publicist and in politics also uh are you are you so sure that there that money did not change hands at all i 'm not an investigator i 'm saying with respect   but from your from what you know about politics from what you know well from what i know about politics it 's sometimes you 're most of the time you 're innocent and they just throw uh uh everything at you including the proverbial kitchen sink and uh uh you take care of the rest meaning uh it 's propaganda uh uh that 's politics for you but but let 's get to to to the real core core issue is dan romualdez guilty i don't think he 's guilty uh uh okay what kind of damage control did you try to do sir damage control we just tried to encourage people to talk about it because the more people talk about it the more people realize that dan romualdez was not at all is not involved in this what what do you mean by encourage people to talk about it like who well the senators even senator pimentel talked about it i did not need any encouragement from him  laughter well but but honestly   okay  we didn't do anything to to really uh uh stop the issue from being ventilated in public   yeah  because we 're sure that as as the more it gets to the public the more clear it becomes the issue becomes and the issue uh uh what are the facts that there are no there is no evidence to uh to show that the first gentleman received money and that there is no evidence that uh he even tried to influence his wife uh uhm so those are the facts so why will you not encourage the discussion of those facts in public uh usually kasi pag publicist p r they would rather uh not talk about it you know keep it under a lid uh this is one time when i think you have to allow discussion of of the issue because uh the facts are very clear uh uhm the facts are very clear ha  yes sir uhm senator ople was saying a few days ago guns of august 'no  uh this was supposed to be part of it paano na ho kung wala na hong bala guns of august pa ba or is it guns of september october well let me just repeat uh what i have said that uh we are trying to be a responsible opposition uh that means we don't fire guns you know figuratively speaking uh in the senate without any basis  yes  and that 's the reason why uh i have tried to touch base with ms martinez through an emissary who had you mean chit  that 's right okay okay who had come back to me to say that uh she wasn't able to convince ms martinez to even see me uh see and i so i said look uh uh it 's very difficult for me to start even filing a resolution when i don't have any solid uh thing to stand on you know  i cannot rely on what i hear on tv or see on radio or or i mean see in print and uh use that as basis for the investigation because anything that is said let us say over radio or television can be recanted easily by another person so where where would that leave you mr ang sino ho kaya yung nag-arrange nitong statement ni chit martinez  was it you no no not absolutely not  just asking chuckle  absolutely not or you helped engineer it helped it uh bring along  no  no no i will dispute that uh let let 's give you know let 's give credit naman to chit  you know she is a very intelligent lady and uh she 's very sober and uh she can naman distinguish uh facts from from the truth from lies 'no or truth from imagination so let 's let 's give chit credit for that she has uh in effect retracted or clarified maybe not retracted clarified her earlier statement aired over the radio uh and she said to the effect that uh she heard that dan romualdez received money so uh she admitted that that what she said earlier during the week uh was based on hearsay so let 's let 's leave it at that let 's give her the benefit of the doubt uh is the president aware already of uh her latest ms martinez 's latest statement oh i 'm sure she is i 'm sure she is and what would she what would her reaction be oh she 's very pleased because finally the truth uh is out uh ano hong pakiramdam last question before we go to a break for the second and last break para ho bang nabunutan ho kayo ng tinik nung narinig nyo na ganon ang sinabi ni chit martinez  well we 're thankful for to chit martinez that once and for all she clarified her statement uh if not retracted her statement but nabunutan ng parang tinik no it 's part of part of politics we look at it as part of the part of the propaganda maybe of some i said some members of the opposition uh uhm you 're not referring to senator pimentel who 's sitting beside you no no no no senator pimentel is a very sober gentleman and uh i know we 've we 've gone a long way no no no when we come back we 'll continue our discussion with senate minority leader nene pimentel and president romualdez 's personal publicist mr dante ang we 'll be joined by congressman prospero pichay and people 's consultative assembly secretary general linda olaguer montayre stay with us this is strictly politics music and break  joining us now in this uh uh second half of the show are linda olaguer montayre of the people 's consultative assembly and congressman prospero pichay congressman pichay uh a little background kayo po yung nag-file ng impeachment complaint di ba kay g m r dati  in the eleventh congress yes uh and now you 're here to uh help defend the first gentleman not really defend we we we legislators we always want to find out the truth and uh that 's why uh we are here because we want to ferret out the truth uh you you heard the statements of chit martinez a while ago what is your reaction to that well uh at least uh she came out in the open and told the truth you can't hide the truth for a long time and uh i think the basis of her statement was a hearsay coming from rita canlas and uh uh you you were asking earlier you said what happens now there 's still that statement of rita canlas  but uh i feel and i believe that uh the group uh of uh the the this corporation that wanted to get the franchise will come out with the statement that there was no pay off there was no money involved and she is part of that group uh uhm okay so uh among the many in the group uh i think uh the official statement should come out as the truth uh uh mrs montayre the people 's consultative assembly came out with the statement today in the newspapers uh in today i think and ano pang dyaryo ho ang lumabas saan lumabas  uh sa pinoy times and then in malaya  uh uh and you also and abante  uh uh doesn't this the latest statement of ms martinez take the wind out of your statement ma'am uh not really because that 's just one part of our statement uh in the first place regarding chit pimentel 's statement  chit martinez   uh chit martinez  i 'm sorry chit martinez 's statement while we respect her 'no we 're not that convinced so easily 'no because there 's something not convincing about her statement  why why  what is in this that is not true to you because of course there are legalities that we have to talk about and that 's what senator pimentel has said they respect it but as far as we are concerned mukhang hindi tama e ni-raise nya yung isyu tapos biglang ga ganoonin lang na parang wala   where there is smoke there is fire   sa n g os kasi sa mga masa sa tao yung ganon hindi kasimple simple lang ng ganon  how come it was raised in the first place and then the president was explaining all about the role of chit martinez then ramon espiritu  i think there should be more uh investigation uh regarding that particular uh state uh the particular story of the president so whether the senate takes it up or does not take it up anymore that would be sad if they don't but for us that 's not enough we are not contented that 's and then as i was saying that 's only the first portion of our statement we have the statement regarding the philippine charity sweepstakes office okay so first oo ma'am bale ang ang unang uh bahagi po ng statement nyo you 're you 're extremely disturbed by the accusations of uh chit martinez against the first gentleman and then you go on to the p c s o also yeah of course uh uh yeah what has that got to do with dan romualdez  why why is dan romualdez 's name here
Philippines	good evening welcome to points of view  i 'm teddy locsin junior and i 'm cher calvin i 'm jessica zafra tonight 's episode was inspired by e-mail from one of our viewers sari monteclaro who suggested that we tackle comm uh consumer rights at some point we all have experienced bad service or bought shabbily made products but how many times have we ever asserted our consumer rights i know i do and for this i 'm you know referred to as some kind of bella flores complaining all the time and if the stories are true then i have ingested spit from every single waiter in metro manila whose service i 've complained about now do we have consumer rights in the philippines how many of us are aware of this and do we actually assert these rights and also given that mo most of the employees in stores and in restaurants aren't real employees but casual employees who expect to lose their jobs within the space of a few months have we got a right to expect good service well uhm i don't know if we have really a law uhm defining consumer rights but i do know that just on the law of contracts if you don't get what you pay for you should theoretically be able to uh uhm get back your money uh uhm or or or change it for something better something that suits more the object that you wanted to have uh-hmmmh but uhm i don't know my own experience is i never complain the people like me for that and i guess that 's the price i pay living with the satisfaction and keeping it bottled up inside   maybe complaining is more of a girl thing 'cause i   i definitely complain a lot you know   uh uhm  but i i try clears throat i try not to complain too much at the restaurants you know whatever but because of ingesting other people 's spit and so forth you know speaker c laughs  i 'll wait until you know but then then we also have a guest who was saying earlier when we were uh getting ready for the show that he was he 's found guest uh guests in his restaurant the customers in his restaurant that will complain after you know their eating so i guess i shouldn't do that either right   uh uhm  uhm but i i don't know i think that i i think that as a customer we do especially in restaurants have def definitely deserve the best kind of service that you can get i mean if like my plate is done it should be removed right away you know those kind of things whether you are in a five star restaurant or in a two star restaurant uh uhm those are like just things i i expect to happen right and they don't and it 's kind of frustrating when you 're raising your hand up and no one is even paying attention to you at all and they 're all in the back making kuwento  i know you know that 's a little frustrating as well but then another thing that kind of also irks me is that there are a lot of uhm i 've got a lot to complain about laughter  it 's really a girl thing laughter  it really is a girl thing is that when you buy products and then they 're refurbished you know what i mean you 'll go to like uhm whatever whatever place and buy like a cellphone or whatever and then you get something that you paid for uhm like it 's supposed to be made in finland right and then when you get home and and you really check it out or a couple of weeks later you you 're how come it 's broken already  and then you don't you can't do anything about it at all  uh uhm  there goes ten thousand p you know ten thousand pesos on a telephone for example right   uh uhm and october is consumer rights month uh uhm which which brings us to uhm something i learned recently that there is no such thing as no return no exchange right even in the philippines and yet have you actually tried to exchange a product the few times that i 've tried to exchange clothes that i 've bought everybody just just looks at me as if i 'm some kind of freak which i am but they have no right to look at me as if i were a freak laughter  and then they 'll they 'll try to find something wrong with the product that they can blame on you so that they don't have to re to exchange it with anything   uh uhm  but i think you know the the worry is there is that if they give in to you word will get around and people will abuse but you know uhm uhm i mean i hate to make comparisons again but i think americans are known to abuse but they 've lived with that the system has accommodated it and the result is better service they just gotta charge it to experience or raise their costs but uhm taking it back and substituting it for something better uhm has ma made shopping a joy there yeah oh that 's what i mean even when you buy gifts you know they 've got in in the states or whatever i was i just received the gift that i got like a receipt a gif a gift receipt if in case i didn't like the present i could go and it doesn't matter what the price or anything because i won't know  you can exchange it for something you like  but but there is one one area where we have this exchange policy that 's wedding gifts uh uhm almost everywhere the gift is assumed it 'll go back to uh the department store and exchanged for something else  uh uhm  will they give you cash i think they do  i think they give you gift certificates   i think  well more of our complaints questions and suggestions about con consumer rights when we come back commercial break  now you can move goods faster electronically you can buy stuff on the computer i guess 'no  and uhm you think that the digital revolution the computer revolution has well made buying and selling so much better so much more convenient but has it really made the customer king that 's the adage of department stores restaurants throughout the ages is the customer king now uh uhm okay well let 's find out from our guests what they think if the customer is king or not and joining us is andrew masigan and he 's the owner of struan and tang 's and he thinks that filipinos are very vocal in their complaints and difficult to please also joining us is deedee sytangco she 's a spokesperson of former president coraz corazon aquino and writes for the manila bulletin  and as a consumer she believes that uh the consumer is king and thus always right until proven wrong uhm also joining us is maurice orosa and he used you used to own a restaurant right and he thinks that the consumer is oftentimes right but not always uh and then allan coronel director studio twenty-three creative sales doesn't think that customers are always right you guys kind of agree huh uhm but he doesn't want to be shortchanged for what he paid for okay welcome to the show okay i i heard that one of you had stutter one of your wives uh wife of one of you laughter had this experience with a caterpillar on the salad which goes to show just how fresh it was laughter  yikes that was my wife we were eating and she ordered uh caesar 's salad caesar 's salad came in and my son goes mom there 's something crawling uh it was green it 's caesar it was a caterpillar i guess it wasn't part of the sauce did you complain right away we did and then they changed it  referring to speaker e but but you found out that in some of your customers have inserted things into their food right  well yeah  yeah like glass  do they really do it   well it does happen  it does happen and uhm the thing is uh there is some malicious intent to extort money uh-huh uh if they do it intentionally but uh going back to your case referring to speaker d if if it does happen uh like let 's say in struan and tang 's tea salon if uh not to say that it did happen but if it does happen uh the the first thing that the first thing to do is immediately to replace the product and in our case we give the we give the item uh complimentary you know what though i 'd be kind of grossed out like already having eaten that uh caesar 's salad and there was a caterpillar in it  yeah   true   yeah  i mean what 's to say there isn't more caterpillars in that   yeah   no but you see true caesar 's salad but you see cher for a for a you know for for the client uh uhm for the customer you know i may be i may be proven you know right that oh there 's something in my salad and all that but as long as the owner of the restaurant is pleasant and agreeable you know  2 words   3 words like you know   and says don't worry laughter we only have just one caterpillar you won't get more caterpillars laughter  i mean if he 's not if he doesn't become disagreeable and say you 've eaten half your salad and how do i know if you 've brought in the caterpillar etcetera etcetera  uh uhm  3 words laughter  you know i would not really you know as a customer i will not but there are other instances when you 're returning a product to the department store and it 's clearly you know a lemon defective yeah defective and then they 'll say no etcetera etcetera  now that i which is what to my point i say that if you are a if you want to be a good uh if you want to have uh value for your money you must first know what are your rights uh uhm okay   because that 's consumer we 're all consumers we must know what what is our responsibility and what is our right you know does that mean that that the no exchange the no exchange no return is that is that really are they allowed to do that i don't think so i think the we have a consumer act but i don't think like i know some a very well known wine store that has a big big uh sign you know wines purchased in this deli you cannot return   sign  but you know what that 's wrong that 's wrong because i mean you can get a whole case of wine  that 's not right that 's not right  yeah that 's you know bad and sour   because you have to return at least i mean the bottle yeah the bottle yeah and then give your opinion and then don't come   then just think of  teddy boy don't come back in six months at least i mean uh of course i mean at least six months laughter  you know don't i mean it 's really you drink it you know at night you open the red wine and it 's really patis  then return it the next day laughter  but i agree i agree with the but i think you 'll find that people will complain will not complain about small things that don't cost much like like me i never complain but when it 's something really bigger oh yeah like an air conditioner oh well that 's really when i 'm gonna say i 'm gonna burn down your store laughter   sure i mean  teddy  you get my point is you you get what you pay for let 's say you go to a two star restaurant or you go to a place just right beside of at the side of the road  you do   you get what you   you get two star food  oh well of course of course yeah  you know  so you can't demand the best service or the best products in in such a place no but andrew it 's relative to if if you went to uh a fast food chain of course you won't expect five you know five star service and all that  correct  yeah but you expect that the food is edible
Philippines	therefore the new leadership that would uh uh be formally installed come uh july one uh uhm uh we do realize that uh the president-elect uh will have to unite a divided nation nation divided because of the political exercise that we 've just had uh then they would have the new leader would have to invoke a new moratorium on dissension particularly if we expect a congress that may not be uh that may not come from the party of whoever the president will be so the the new president-elect would be hard-pressed trying to forge unity but we believe that during the first hundred days all sectors would unite and and extend uh its cooperation to the president-elect and uh while we do realize that this will not be an easy task it will be a difficult uh task admittedly the private sector uh will be there uh particularly the p c c i providing its uh support and cooperation and in this regard we have uh taken the initiative of putting together a paper which we have uh entitled the first one hundred days a blue print for setting the stage for an economic takeoff  uh uhm which we are to present to uh the president-elect here we detail uh specific areas of concern the fact to be addressed during the first one hundred days uh among which if i could just uh share the the broad uh framework of of our proposal one you have the need to address the power issue uh uhm the energy crisis that continues to confront us uh second uh the need to mobilize investments for domestic and foreign third the need to promote exports uh giving it the highest priority uh fourth uh fiscal and uh monetary reforms that have already been negotiated by the aquino government and which should be sustained uh and and fifth and very important is the need to maintain peace and order so these five areas we have uh identified as uh deserving which has been the subject of a consensus incidentally by the business community and here we detail very specific strategies and uh doable uh measures that that can be put to place so that uh the economy could be uh brought to a 2 words  and here we see uh i guess i think a three or two percent growth in g n p okay now may we have some parting words from the secretary uh of course i know that you are at the helm of the p n p operations anything that you need to say to our televiewers uh mr secretary oh i think the first thing i would like to uh uh say is to the local officials who have just been through the exercise of campaigning uh i think that it 's high time that they take a rest and let the process of counting go on as uh this 1 word  the campaign uh period although the people have uh chosen who they thought of they think ought to be the leaders  sana huwag nilang pakialaman ang bilangan  and uh just wait for the results of uh what the people feel ought to be the mandate  ikalawa siguro gusto ko ring i uh uh to remind our p n p officers and men nationwide na tayo ay uh binigyan ng responsibilidad ng comelec na ating bantayan ang uh counting uh transportation of documents from precinct to municipality from municipality to capitol and capitol to manila  sana 'yan ay inyong gawin uh the assigned tasks that we should physically protect the the documents  huwag niyong pabayaan 'yan kasi uh as i said before the first phase has been successful we now go to the second phase of uh protecting the uh the canvass uh sheets keep on doing your work and uh uh i guess the people will be grateful to us uh once they realize that we have done uh a job which they expect us to do in the first place  at uh ako'y naniniwala na tayo ay nagkakaisa sa direktiba ng ating pangulong corazon aquino na ating pangalagaan ang halalan upang sa ganoong paraan ay masabi natin na ah the filipinos have passed a major test in terms of uh political maturity and uh this could be the precedent of uh the next elections that will be held in nineteen ninety-five and nineteen ninety-eight yes sir thank you very much sir and to you mr. pardo we would like to commend you for the uh p c c i for remaining apolitical and non-partisan your briefly your final words well i repeat that uh uh confidence in the political and economic stability of the country must be built uh and more importantly unity must be forged now the elections of may eleven is now slowly lea uh leaving us behind we must move forward get our act together it would be very important to to uh think and act as one both government and private sectors should now forge ahead thank you to the two gentlemen for joining us this afternoon ina yeah thank you very much too cathy for joining me this afternoon and in behalf of all the hosts of pollwatch ninety-two we will be back at six thirty to bring you regular programming thank you very much for watching and please stand by to find out the initial results of the counting of the ballots break in the recording  i would like to venture precisely that the winner will win by a comfortable margin because and this is my very private assessment that uh the majority of those who are undecided and even those who have decided but know that they are for the loser follow the principle everyone loves a winner  the people i 've heard it said sayang ang boto ko sayang ang boto ko  you think that prevailed yeah i think so you don't think people voted according to their real choices but rather according to the configuration of who was who was leading the pack precisely because the choices were very you know were very poor  none of the above was uh the constant and so i think the main psychological basis for choice will be my vote should count and therefore i will be with the winner larry uh uh another rare occasion wherein i agree laughter  i would like to add that in a lot of in a lot of uh voters the main the main uh motivation is not to let one candidate win you see one guy said yeah he says i my my heart is for salonga uh my guts is against danding therefore my head says vote ramos  it 's it 's preventive  many people are like that and uh that 's probably the way it 's going to happen uh uhm you agree with that winnie i uh uh i agree that perhaps that is the rationale that they they follow i don't agree with that rationale at all because uh if you think that somebody should should be president then you should vote for him yeah no matter what i this concept of winnability makes it all very very makes the whole system all very uh uh prone to being to being influenced by these surveys etcetera  one survey another survey will know 'no   well let let  and therefore you are you are substituting uh-huh your own thinking for the thinking of what you think everybody else is thinking i i don't like that herd mentality at all and i think to the extent that we follow that herd mentality that is to the extent to which we may not be able to vote for the best man or woman okay well let me ask you did did you yourself follow that principle which principle are we talking about voting according to your conscience or voting according to everybody else 's   oh absolutely absolutely i always practice what i preach laughter  okay that 's nice to hear and i think many people out there probably do practice what they preach or they could have been doing it according to how they were reading the race we 'll be back with more on this right after this music  okay nagbabalik po tayo dito napaka- heated nitong discussion natin about whether you voted for your conscience or not and winnie you 're laughing again what 's up your sleeve this time because you know after larry went through all that spiel i asked him i said what did you do and he said well i actually voted my conscience so i said to him well if you did that and i did that what makes us think that the other filipinos will not do that uh good di ba  yeah i mean you know in the final analysis i think they are an intelligent electorate  words is that i 'm not ready i know he votes that way you know who votes that way the filipino voter   filipino voters  as ernie said they just want to have a candidate that would be the least of all evils as against another one who is more evil in their perception  my golly naman  my god they have to go out of their way to see to it that he doesn't get to be president just let me be the devil 's advocate i mean how can you make that statement i am not arguing the morality of it no no no i 'm not i am talking about the historical experience uh-huh i 'm not talking about the morals uh if if you remember in nineteen eighty-four everybody thought that uh marcos' candidates would win in manila  hindi ba  and yet they voted against marcos' candidates and marcos marcos' candidates did not win only five i think out of the twenty  hindi ba  and in nineteen eighty-six everybody all the surveys showed that marcos would win because the question was who do you think is going to win so they say well we think marcos is going to win however nobody bothered to ask who are you going to vote for and even if they thought marcos was going to win here is the case where they said well even if he is going to win i 'm not going to vote for him yeah so i 'm not sure i think the big difference is that in the case of marcos it was clearly good versus evil in the present case all the candidates really have many pretensions that people just could not act on principle laughter that 's just what i think oh i 'm not sure about that two speakers speak simultaneously  i believe that among the seven candidates there was no clear choice there was no clear choice i cannot believe that oh you can't believe that i cannot believe that secretary de villa without putting you in any uh precarious position here do you think that the filipino electorate voted according to this winnability concept or do you think people voted according to their conscience there are two types of filipino voters out there laughter  there are those that are influenced by uh by the machine and uh by their amo  especially in the rural areas the old traditional practice of uh of uh some people out there they still ask their uh their their master who they 'll vote for  sinong iboboto natin   sinong iboboto natin   oho  then there are also a lot of uh of uh very educated voters in the in the population centers the third factor is there are a lot of young young voters uh who dominate uh uh the the voting power of the country uh uhm uh uhm   so when you put all of these together i think that the the the rules uh may somehow not be the same anymore do you think this election the bottom line there is that it 's anybody 's guess laughter  yes do you think this election is word  well i think the bottom line is what is going to happen a few days from now when they actually tote up the votes then we 'll know whether you 're right or i 'm right laughter   ganon  are you trying to tell me are you trying to tell me that the voters are going to vote for fidel ramos because they think that he is the least of the evils i think there are voters who will vote for him because they think   no i didn't say that  uh but you 're saying   i didn't say that no no no no you 're saying you 're right meaning to say that they they 're going to vote their head rather than their heart or their guts di ba  so what you are what you are saying is that the conclusion is that if if fidel ramos wins  i didn't say that  i did say that most voters that people are are protesting merely against say cojuangco or whatever name they 're pitting against
Philippines	i can't imagine them together laughter  it 's very odd it 's very odd it 's like it 's like mary poppins and i don't know gene simmons of kiss getting together uh mary poppins and marilyn

hosting letterman  did she host letterman  i think when he was uh in a hospital i didn't see it i never saw it either i don't know i think she 'd be good yeah my favorite talk show host is john stuart uhm the daily show and uhm during the american presidential campaign the daily show really had some of the best political commentary you can go to their website uhm comedy central slash daily show i think or just look for the daily show and uhm they also have snippets about various strange world events and of course they had the philippines in there oh always because uh you know whenever you say strange the philippines comes to mind our middle name uh jordan is wondering if it 's true that julia roberts was in a sequence in interview with the vampire i don't i don't think so was she like an extra or something i doubt it i don't remember i 've seen the movie but i can't remember i 'm usually good at spotting these things yeah of course she she did go on to work with the director neil jordan they did michael collins right yeah no i can't remember if that 's true or not and what is the movie of julia and brad pitt uh being shot in mexico oh i 've heard about that i don't know who 's directing it though i heard about it but uhm i don't remember uh vicky 's asking us to recommend a film from mike nichols  the graduate  of course uh uh mike nichols i want to see that annette bening gary shandling movie the one about uhm gary shandling being an earth uh uh an alien coming down to earth what planet are you from is that it  oh yeah i think that 's the title uh that 's a mike nichols' movie i haven't seen it i haven't seen that yeah  heartburn you watched heartburn  that 's a mike nichols' movie excellent i was watching again american beauty just last night and you know i have to add i didn't pay attention to the role of annette bening but she really is good in that yeah uhm 'cause initially para bang god this is an annoying character yeah and she 's so shrill and on second viewing you realize hey okay uh more directors any news about roman polanski uhm oh i just saw the e news uh was it it wasn't mysteries and scandals  it was e news true hollywood stories which raked up his uhm statutory rape conviction in the states and so he fled to france right yeah i don't know if he has already set foot in the states if they have cut some kind of deal but he can't go back to the states 'cause they 'll imprison him yeah 'cause he has a standing conviction for statutory rape isn't there a statute of limitations on this i don't know but i think that since uhm in the years after that conviction he has behaved pretty well uhm they could probably cut a deal some kind of deal but uh let 's see i saw his last movie the ninth gate  boy was it bad but it was kind of a fun bad movie because there are bad movies that are just uh bad you know a complete waste of time but some movies are so bad they actually border on good 'cause they get to be fun and uhm i saw the ninth gate that was okay and i think the last really good movie roman polanski did was tess and that was shortly after he fled to europe nastassia kinski yeah   yes  and you know uhm so he was he was found guilty of having sex with a minor and immediately almost immediately after that he takes up with the teenage nastassia kinski laughter  who 's now married to quincy jones are they still are they still i 'm not sure i don't know   uhm quincy jones uh always marrying them white women  uh uh before nastassia kinski was peggy lipton i think from the mod squad uh uh  yeah from the mod squad   the mod squad that 's that 's a show i i yeah and and that 's a movie that flopped big time laughter  yeah uh the black guy there uh that played link  what 's his name clarence williams the third yeah i didn't make any connection i saw the general 's daughter and i didn't realize it was him yeah it 's him uh playing the aide of uh james cromwell  oh my god   uh uh  you know what i 'm told it 's a brilliant brilliant movie that you can catch on cable babe pig in the city  everybody tells me it 's a brilliant movie but i saw two minutes and it was just so intense and traumatic i said i think i

watching this afternoon just just around twelve uh a movie with let me see aidan quinn uh ben kingsley donald sutherland   oh the assignment  that 's the assignment   yes i didn't get the title   that 's where uhm what 's his name aidan quinn looks exactly like carlos the jackal and so they hatch a plot to catch the jackal uh okay i 've never seen it before that caught my attention you know how they caught the real life jackal no  si carlos who is venezuelan they got him when he was sedated and awaiting liposuction laughter  uh huh vanity they got him at at the doctor 's office he was waiting for his liposuction operation boom  laughter okay uh recommendations for movies of david cronenberg uh existenz   existenz  was was dead ringers his yes dead ringers my favorite david

naked lunch was  naked lunch yes although well he also made m butterfly which was just embarrassing 'cause there was no way in hell that anyone would be convinced that john lone was a woman he 'd stubble speaker a laughs  okay uhm oh hold on what do you mean by an indie film an a film and a b film an indie is an independently financed movie it 's usually low budget because uhm you raise the funds yourself you don't go to a major hollywood studio a studio being some uh a production uh uh a studio like warner brothers or dreamworks or you know those things and then an a movie would be uhm i guess uh a mainstream quality type movie although jean claude van damme movies are considered a films right i don't know laughter  not necessarily and then b movies are just those think michael dudikoff yeah that 's it mr b movie uhm yeah what else i don't know and and then and there 's also these slight distinctions like david haselhoff no matter what he does will always look like a b movie actor laughter  no matter how much success he gets on t v he would always come off as b uh uh  okay yeah poor guy  uh uh at least you know at least he can laugh at his own image okay uhm uhm okay

Philippines	 music hello out there on this overcast and rather cloudy day oh i hope the the traffic situation is not as uh hazy it was not it was not that bad in front of the office right absolutely so you came in you zipped in in a breeze in a breeze laughter  folks uh welcome to kalikasan vigilante again as we keep telling you we come right after broadcasters bureau  this is vic milan and here is emily mercado marcelo laughter  thank you vic i 'm emily marcelo and thank you for the plug of bobby amor laughter  bobby i just want to tell you i married levy marcelo not orly mercado okay laughter  thanks bobby and uh thank you uh friends for listening true it 's not it 's very overcast this morning but you know vic vic i love this weather you like this weather i like this weather it 's not hot and but i wish there were there were something in the morning i could take so my my muscles would not ache so much that 's old age of course 'no  and what about i was listening to the closing remarks of a d a at broadcasters bureau  and she said happy weekend it 's it 's only thursday a d a for for some people it 's already weekend uh vic yes it 's laughter  is it laughter  anyway folks uh environment-wise emily what attracted my attention this morning was still uh these friends of ours across the wall the d e n r people the d e n r people yes uh there is still the story about the nurses and the dentists uh appointed to take care of of the pasig river   there 's only one explanation for that vic  uh it looks like uh the there are some people who have been feeding uh news bits this is media frenzy now hey to the reporters that not only are they are these supposedly uh these these appointees are supposedly not qualified i mean you know they 're dentists what what are they doing for in a pasig river movement hey dentists pull out something you know and they 're gonna pull out the debris he he he =sarcastic laughter  you know uh and uh the issue now is that all of these appointees have been uh uh given uh ov not i mean residences or they 've converted official cottages into residences right at the parks and wildlife bureau really area area just near where we are and what is that supposed to be i mean what are what is the purpose of those the cottages   there there are cottages there that are used for official functions just official and not for uh lodging not for residence oh okay uh it 's supposed to be sometimes and how many of those a halfway house supposed to be for provincial officials uh okay staying in manila well it 's been it 's been functioning as a hotel also uh apparently uh occasionally as overnight accommodations for for official purposes   so how many people are staying there now uh no exact count but uh this batch appointed by the d e n r secretary uh is over twenty so that 's about two dozen people and uh what is what i find significant is that for two days now this has been appearing in media in print in broadcast and there has been no reaction from the office of the secretary for one we know that secretary cerilles is in the netherlands oh signing signing a document uh on behalf of the philippine government  no wonder no wonder  oh well that explains it but the public affairs people have no reaction either because it was the secretary apparently who uh appointed these people so what can they say and so they have to they have to wait for the secretary of course to come back although some other officials are are issuing justifications that uh these these appointments are uh there 's nothing illegal about the appointments they are contractual and so on and so forth but i i sense that uh there is a group within the bureaucracy within the old-timers possibly who are who might be jealous because maybe the salaries are bigger or whatever there 's only one explanation as i said these people probably need jobs we need uh a reaction from the secretary we 'll try to get that when he comes back in the interest of you know good journalism we get the other side when we can of course music  of course we 'd like to remind you you are tuned in to d w b r one o four point three the program is kalikasan vigilante  this is vic milan with emily marcelo friends as usual please uh beep us your suggestion comments my beeper number is one five two five zero zero six eight eight our vic 's office is nine two zero nine nine one five nine nine one five or the office   our studio phone is nine two zero eight nine two eight  we still haven't heard from fe hidalgo she 's probably very busy now with her new responsibilities at the department of education culture and sports if my recollection is correct about an item i read in the newspapers about fe hidalgo being appointed to some important position in the department which i 'm sure she deserves a great lady like like fe hidalgo emily i was telling you while we were playing that musical bee is a bug  uh i 've been thinking a lot about howie severino 's piece that i saw in the probe team  this feature on muro ami in uh palawan uh uhm we can discuss muro ami uh on another uh plane but right now i 'm i 'm thinking more of uh this uh in terms of from from the journalistic point of view as a backgrounder howie severino was interviewed by us yesterday yesterday morning   yesterday morning uh regarding his uh the segment that he produced for the probe uh team  and uh the way how he put it he went to northern palawan in search of muro ami because there were they got tips that muro ami a banned fishing method was still being used by certain influential businessmen in in that area and uh it turns out as how he himself said they went there pretending to be scuba diving tourists and uh the question that came to my mind is is a journalist obligated to tell uh someone he is interviewing that he may be using this for a television broadcast that 's the american way   what what do you think that 's the american way i don't think that is uh uh practiced in the philippines because otherwise they will they will clam up you know these interviewees will uh clam up and so and so you have to use pretences or you have to pretend that you are somebody else when you 're not   hindi ba  well uh and i 'm sure as you said you are you are sure of that in the u s of course you have of course even if even while you are talking on the phone and you want to tape the conversation you have to tell the person the other person you 're talking with that you you 're taping the conversation  but how about   you have to tell him  hold it i don't think that happened here but hold it i have seen television documentaries where uh the commentator himself said this was taken by hidden camera and if it was a hidden camera it means the the subjects did not know they were being filmed they were not allowed to but and uh of course they the subjects did not allow it i i mean the subjects did not know it at all uh uhm probably and possibly they were not allowed in uh to be interviewed in the first place and so they the footage was taken anyway and it was aired anyway  and they have to squeeze  and they have to squeeze uh something from and uh uhm the television station was not taken into court uh uhm yeah that 's true oh anyway   but i don't think that 's the the problem is i don't think that that will be used uh in a court of law you must get a lawyer for this you know  laughter okay anyone out there with uh  comments   with an ope with an opinion   who 's a lawyer  and with uh relevant uh to what we are discussing here uhm i am interested because sometimes we go out to the field and we do interviews and   so what what you 're saying is uh howie should have identified himself  should should  is the journalist is the reporter uh required to tell the interviewee that it is going it may be used  siguro come to think of it siguro in this case a hidden camera is uh is is good enough kasi walang ano e walang uh i don't think the the this uh word this uh how do you call it these companies would want their executives to be uh interviewed on camera kaya howie had to resort to that no but uh howie did not use a hidden camera the the camera was not hidden at all   because he was supposed to be a scuba-diver   he just  he just used uh what you might call false pretenses chuckle  another musical break please boy music  actually howie severino his topic was on muro ami  uh i what about muro ami specifically this fishing part i had i had uh two two people asked me what really is muro ami  and i think emilia is also asking what what really is muro ami all about yes what really is muro ami vic uh this is the way i i i got it from way way back we were fighting the muro ami uh thing in in media and in all fronts until it was finally banned  muro ami is actually a japanese term meaning you know you know dalagang bukid the the species of fish anyway it 's it 's coral coral reef dwellers uhm they come in large numbers and you 've you 've seen television footages underwater oh yes you you imagine a coral reef plenty of fish and at the edge of the reef you drop a long long huge net but how do you get the fish to go into the net so that they get entangled in the net you drive them into the net bodily but in muro ami they use children to drive so they submerge children no you see the children are actually fly uh swimming on on the surface of the water uh uhm but they are holding what they call scare lines  scare lines goads uh huh but at the end of the scare line are heavy things like steel or rocks or lead and they pull this up and down  and down to scare the so that it hits it hits the corals  uh huh  and sound is magnified many times when it 's under water uh uhm it reverberates so you can imagine how scared this this fish are they they scamper in all directions but there there is no escape  dalagang bukid  because the net is there already because this is this is a long line of children abreast huh moving towards the net am i giving you a good enough a good enough picture  oh sure yeah clear as mud but in the process the corals are broken and uh but the end result is what they want the dalagang bukid   the end result is they get a lot of fish okay  they get the dalagang bukid yeah uh fast track a little bit sometime in the mid eighties we succeeded in having uh the the this method banned in the philippines but the operators of muro ami and one of the names very closely associated with muro ami was a congressman-politican from cebu whose name is whose name is amante  and what made this controversial was that uh most of the muro ami ships were employing children as young as ten eleven twelve thirteen fourteen years old uh uhm and uh if a kid suddenly got entangled in a net because sometimes the net gets entangled and kids had to dive to untangle the net and if they that that gets entangled in the coral yes and if and if the current suddenly changes in the direction of the diving kid he can get he himself can get entangled in the net and there have been instances like this  ay there were plenty of deaths and uh in that segment and in that segment of uh howie severino there were graves the graves of the kids were shown
Philippines	 break in the recording not in favor and five remain with reservations after tomorrow they will be given twelve working days to come up with a decision which some of them have already assessed as impossible in the meantime nature seems to be pushing towards an undetermined decision  joining us tonight in our special edition of options on the u s bases are three veteran multi-awarded journalists respected for objective analysis and opinion music  the u s military bases issue is like a sputtering fuse with the senate as a powder keg we don't know if it 's going to explode or not explode at all on the u s bases the pro side is basically economic while the anti side is basically political now both sides are valid one has to weigh which side has more weight music  the current discussion of probable senate action on a new military bases agreement presents a picture of a possible collision course between the senate and most of the rest of the country i find it inconceivable that the will of the country should give way to the will of the senate  tonight on options' special edition the bases what now   with teddy benigno tony abaya and rudy romero music  the new bases treaty now under public debate is officially called the treaty of friendship cooperation and security between the philippines and the united states  it is a wide-ranging pact on a number of fields such as military economic and cultural relations the m b a was agreed upon by the philippines and the u s in nineteen forty-seven shortly after world war two it provided for the use of clark air base subic naval base and smaller military facilities by the americans for free the treaty was originally to be in effect for ninety-nine years in the middle sixties however the duration of the treaty was cut to twenty-five years later the datelines were also reduced and during the martial law years a compensation package was added  by virtue of the redemption of the life of the m b a it will expire next september sixteen and according to the new constitution no foreign troops and facilities will be allowed in the philippine territory after that date without a new treaty  pursuant to the m b a and the constitutional provisions president aquino notified the u s government about this time of last year that the philippine government was terminating the m b a this signified to the americans that if they wanted to retain their bases here they will have to seek another treaty as stipulated by the philippine constitution  the americans agreed to a renegotiation of the m b a and formed a panel headed by richard armitage on the part of the philippines the president appointed foreign secretary raul manglapus to head its panel the first meeting of the two panels produced no results  the philippines presented demands for a bigger compensation package than that provided in the revised m b a armitage responded by insulting stating that he was not prepared to enter into a cash register negotiation and went home however he left behind a technical staff that continued exploring points of agreement with its philippine counterpart  the bases talks were resumed middle of this year this time an agreement was reached but there were still many issues that were unresolved last month the philippine and u s panels announced the negotiations were over and that except for a few minor changes in the draft the treaty would be initialed soon the terms announced however met with objections from the senate which by law must ratify the treaty before it can go into effect  even as the negotiations were going on mount pinatubo erupted rendering clark air base useless to the americans who announced they were leaving the base next year the treaty that would be sent to the senate for ratification calls only for the retention of the subic naval base for its use the u s promises two hundred fifty-three million dollars a year as military assistance but no specific amount for economic aid the treaty only provides economic assistance by the u s in the form of help in getting more loans at concessional terms greater access to american markets of philippine exports and the like no money involved malaca&ntilde;ang and the u s embassy have mounted a lobby for its ratification some senators have softened their stand but under the latest version that has been released to the public it might be rejected unless of course the u s would offer other benefits for the use of subic for options i 'm doris bigornia music   this special edition of options shall focus on comments and opinions solely attributable to the speakers  these are merely options to consider music  good evening  tonight tony abaya rudy romero and myself will go slam bang on the issue of u s military bases let me start by saying that until very recently i had been pro-bases i figured that five to seven years more of the bases would not inflict too deep a wound on philippine sovereignty my reason was that the philippines needed aid and financial assistance very badly we were bleeding profusely and certainly we could use substantial american payment for the u s bases now substantial rental for me and many filipinos then was something in the amount of six hundred million to one billion u s dollars this amount over five years could tide us over but mount pinatubo erupted last june and suddenly i saw the face of an america that shocked me that saddened me the american negotiators led by uh robert armitage scaled down our rental demand to two hundred three million dollars instead of sympathizing with a country that was badly battered by the mount pinatubo eruption they seemingly took advantage of our misery and said two hundred three million dollars take it or leave it  as far as i am concerned i leave it for reasons of national pride self-respect and dignity i don't want us to remain on our knees with a begging bowl in hand resigned to the thought that we cannot exist for the next ten years without the bases without uncle sam and without the almighty dollar well uh from my point of view i have always been for the bases uh for a maximum of five to seven years and only if the arrangement will be economically beneficial to the country uh i don't believe that the bases were put here to protect the philippines they obviously were put here to protect american and perhaps japanese interests and uh as far as compensation is concerned i start with the original philippine demand of eight hundred uh twenty-five million dollars a year which was broken down into a hard component of four hundred million dollars and a soft component of four hundred twenty-five million dollars a year now this compensation demand was based on negotiations for two bases now with the explosion of mount pinatubo clark air base has been rendered inoperative so the negotiations were reduced to only one base so the original philippine demand of four hundred million dollar hard compensation has been halved and the working figure is two hundred three million dollars a year which is slightly more than the original philippine demand now the soft compensation unfortunately was not inputted into this bases uh agreement but uh according to the far eastern economic review this soft compensation amounts to eight hundred and thirty million dollars which added to the two hundred three cash component comes out to slightly more than one billion dollars a year i think it is a fair business deal and we should go ahead with it outside of the question of the legitimacy of the uh marcos government and his hold on power during the fourteen period fourteen years period of martial law i can think of no issue in this country that has taken us that has been more characterized with characterized by greater passion and emotion during the last forty-five years of our independence than the bases issue this issue has divided uh has resulted in divisions on five fronts it has divided one branch of the government from another it has divided the military from the civilians and it certainly tends to it is certainly threatening to it has divided one half of the legislature from the rest of the citizenry it has divided the philippines from its principal ally which is now the only superpower in the world and it has of late been shown to have divided the business community from a part of the legislature certainly this has been a very distracting issue since the uh start of the uh aquino administration the president 's enunciation of a i 'll-keep-my-options-open stance and the start of the uh discussions what the so-called discussions at the start on the business front investments have been on hold and major business decisions have been postponed  there has been a tendency there has been a perception that from the very start the focus of the discussions of the bases has been diplomatic and legal and that that of late it has only shifted to the economic i this is a mistaken perception from my point of view   given the weakness of our economy the focus of the discussions has always been on the economic ratification or rejection by the senate in the next few weeks would not mean the end of the treaty issue uh in the forth there 's the forthcoming elections to reckon with nine months from now and the people will perform their own ratification rite when these candidates who vote against both for or against the treaty will come up for re-election okay now that the three of us have jumped into the bases debate i think we should start our slam bang by an inquiry into how these uh military bases in the philippine really started and i say that it started because of the cold war that emerged after world war number two  well really ted uh words  wait wait i 'm just talking about the general treaty on american-philippine relations i can go back to that also in nineteen forty-six july four because there was provision for the existence of philippine bases but let me finish my point  i 'm sorry i 'm saying you see that bases as part of the international network of the united states due to the cold war between communism and democracy started you see very early and john foster dulles was the architect of bases all over the world that could as a matter of fact help the mission of rolling back the communist danger as a result of which bases in the philippines became very important for american strategy by putting up the united states as the policeman of the globe that is what how it started  the policy of containment yes the policy of containment the world over let me just add some historical notes the subic bay the subic naval base was an originally a spanish naval base which the americans took over when they took over the philippines and clark air base used to be port stotsenberg which was set up i believe in the thirties before the second world war now the bases agreement then started after philippine independence nineteen forty-six that 's true uhm while the cold war obviously had something to do with it it had everything to do with it everything speakers all talk at the same time  and the opinion now is the uh the cold war is over that may be so but temp i would say temporarily lamang we don't know what 's going to happen within the next five years so the the uh the intrusion of the cold war politics into the philippine situation i think is still valid up to now whether or not the cold war is in fact started is uh still extant or not come on tony you know the cold war is over it 's over temporarily it may be temporary you know what happened in we don't know who would have won in the the speakers talk at the same time  communism is crumbling it is it is like humpty dumpty that has split into a million pieces it has no way of returning back to power and you know that and we know that uh another historical footnote i was reading the other day as a matter of fact something that uh mr vicente pacis wrote it has something it was his reminiscence osme&ntilde;a 's reminiscence of something that quezon said during the last days of the war when he was in exile in the u s and at that time my under my understanding from what i read is that the president the late president indicated that the americans who were still uh our outgoing masters then that he was amenable to the grant of the continued stay of the bases even after the grant of independence promised in nineteen forty-six
Philippines	 the president 's hour continues and our topic for this half of the program is the continuing struggle for human rights ladies and gentlemen the uh aquino administration has made human rights uh one of the uh cornerstones of its program and uh we are pleased to have with us uh some of the top human rights officials uh in this uh government well we start with uh secretary of justice uh franklin drilon we have uh commissioner paulynn sicam of the commission on human rights and uh commissioner jesito mallilin of the commission on human rights we also have a reporter from probe team mr david celdran uh who 's also a television personality and sometime uh sociology teacher okay anyway uh secretary drilon the uhm human rights record of the uhm administration has been a topic of some controversy uhm of course it was an anchor of the opposition uhm platform against marcos in nineteen eighty-six but since then uhm internationally the philippines has taken a beating uhm in uh in its uh human rights record uh perhaps uh fairly enough and uh that 's what i want to ask you uh where do we stand now because uh the the big issue about a year ago when i was covering human rights was that the human rights record of the aquino government was worse than the uh marcos government and that 's what the uh the uh various elements abroad were trying to uh spread around i take exception to that that the human rights record of this administration is worse than marcos there you know it 's basically the fact that you have freedom of speech now freedom of the press and all these things are reported in the press who do not know really what happened in the marcos regime and more impor but most importantly apa on in in matters of substance this administration as a matter of policy has never tolerated human rights violations i must emphasize that we 're in an insurgency with an insurgency problem such as ours human rights violations happen that you know we do not deny what is important the difference between president aquino 's administration and that of the previous regime is that when we take action we do not tolerate we hale purport violators of human rights whereas before uh although they were saying one thing they were doing another they were saying that we do not tolerate this but in point of fact it is happening and nothing was being done about it and we can be proud of the fact that indeed this administration has uh has uh put substance to the policy on protecting human rights we have shortcomings i must admit uh uh in this area but uh it 's not because we we do not want to do it but because of circumstances which uh prevent us from from uh doing everything that we want to do okay now let 's focus on the particular issue of uh military offenses i think it might be uh uh perhaps the central issue in uh in human rights here uh dave uh you just did a story uh which i caught on on  probe  what was your experience uh up there in isabela well we 're talking about the uh tape of uh marag valley marag valley in apayao area and uhm true enough no uhm it was an investigative piece and we went there uhm we did interviews and we talked to the the uh local government officials the military and the finding around there is that yes there have been uhm extreme cases of human rights abuses now apparently the context we find these abuses 'no  within is that in counter-insurgency operations or military operations the biggest losers are the civilians who are caught in the crossfire now i would like to throw back the question to our commissioners and the uh secretary here what guarantee do civilians have in a situation of counter-insurgency operations yeah and uh uh how can you prevent human rights abuses uh perhaps exactly words victims all the time well you know uhm a group of us went to marag valley in april  and uh one of the things that we uh that we found out was that exactly that the people are the helpless uh victims 'no  they 're caught in the crossfire and one of our recommendations which we submitted to the president through uh secretary drilon is that there should not be uhm aerial not clear if aerial or area bombardments such such a thing should be banned from the uh tactics of the military uh especially when you know there 's even uh the the danger of being one of one civilian being there uh now we 've planned this recommendation among others to uh cluster e to the president so well yes uh that 's correct we i i i 've received in my capacity as uh chairman of the cluster e uh the report of the mission which incidentally uh was the was part of the mission who words centered to marag valley and uh these uh recommendations were discussed this afternoon in cluster e among which was the suspension of the offensive military operations in order to allow government services to come in indeed the finding of the mission was that might be that the last time uh the people of marag valley felt government 's presence was probably in nineteen eighty-five and uh the suggestion of the mission that was sent there was that we uh bring back the credibility of government through government services in marag valley but frank uhm this this recommendation to stop military operations does this apply only to marag or is this going to apply to all other areas where military operations are displacing civilians well uh i find difficulty answering that uh you know i am not from the defense establishment we must also consider what kind of operations they 're having in other areas they have also their own mandate their own uh interest to and and duties to perform we we we uh i i don't think that we tolerate this policy of bombing a a anywhere but uh uh i in this particular case it was only focused on the marag valley well uhm the uhm problem i see with that is that the military is probably going to react uh rather uh uh negatively to that suggestion because uhm aerial bombardment while it it poses a very real danger this is a cornerstone of military strategy it uh cuts down on their own uh casualties like by let 's say  socking an area before they go there and if they 're asked to cut it out that 's you know in in effect asking them to to uh to go in there uhm sort of uh it 's a more dangerous situation and uh if they 're not going to be happy about this uh how can you convince the military that uh such uh tactics or or or even even calling off military word in populated areas are necessary you know apa some military strategists would tell you that aerial bombardment goes against the uhm the uhm the total approach ba  that they call it yeah it goes against that because you alienate the population right away while what you 're supposed to do is come in there and be their friend sure but the s o p is a long term strategy here we 're talking of a a short term conflict let 's say you 've isolated a group of of uh as the military calls them uh uh communist terrorists they really have their own terminology c ts  uhm you know uh let 's say uhm you 've isolated a group of them there and and uh you 're gonna go in after them you know that 's that 's not an s o p case i mean you know when i go in there and talk to the villagers and sort of get their sympathies you wanna go in there and start shooting right uh and that 's what i 'm talking about i think that uh necessary aerial support uh and aerial bombardment is is uh very key to uh a to modern warfare and it seems to me that the military might not agree that uh they should call it off  as regards that in an interview that i did with the uhm with general templo he said that operations will resume soon what 're just needed are for the fact finding missions to come in and once the reports are returned they intend to push through with the uh military operations and second uhm it is very difficult no uhm lots of human rights abuses take place because of what 's called you 're guilty by association now here 's a populated area of tribal people and i 'm not i 'm not just talking about marag in fact with every other hot spot in the country insurgents by the by the uh fact that they engage in guerilla warfare do operate within densely populated areas and because of that uhm it 's very difficult for military operations to take place now is there any way that the military can of course isolate or pinpoint who uh the enemies are and who the civilians are that 's exactly it but the moment you do that then uh human rights advocates would charge the military with hamletting they try to remove the civilians and uh you know precisely to protect the civilian population and again uh human rights advocates uh charge them with uh hamletting again a human rights violation which is which is why i 'd like to bring up the idea that perhaps pure military operations or the military approach to solving the problem of insurgency is already defunct or debunked, not clear which  as has been proven by vietnam and by so many other third world experiences yes and i agree with you that the only way to uhm solve the problem is to bring government services sincerely and not just as propaganda but sincerely bring government services to the people i i said uhm that uh that is part of the s o p formula we 're talking here about about military uh conflict 'no  i mean i i think that there there 's agreement around this table that that is in fact the the only uh viable long term approach to the problem but let 's talk about military engagement let 's talk about shooting war because that 's where we 're really concerned with with human rights violations uh i think uhm i remember very clearly the case of those uhm young marines who uh who uh were one morning in bulacan uh around this house and and they shot up the house they claimed they were shot at from the house they were on patrol across uh some fishponds and ricefields and they were firing out like this and there was this this house right next to a a fishpond and they claimed they were shot at from the house and they shot up the whole house and uhm there there was a claim that there were civilians there and that these people had died and uhm you know in these cases you know what what are you going to do what are you going to say i mean that 's uhm that 's uh what i 'd like to know uh perhaps uh you can tell us how the commission on human rights reacted in that case i remember we we conducted that inquiry right in the department of justice i think that the   mr mallilin < you were involved words i believe the early solution of this case what we call the  word massacre and uh isn't the massacre sort of uh words  it 's the words massacre but uh the commission came up with a resolution absolving uh the uh marines in that uh incident though i would say that i had the lone dissenting view there i didn't agree with the resolution i thought there should be more a thorough investigation of this uhm how was the case investigated i mean this is all after the fact uh was it a very tedious process not really we were able to call uh the marines immediately those involved words and even uh general biazon testified and then we called in the doctor who autopsied the bodies aha and after that we had our own evaluation words  even the owner of that fishpond we were able to have him testify and give his side but there are still questions being asked why did you dissent well uh any particular reason i believe that there was really a massacre and uh you know where the bloodstains were they were just in one position aha there were no bodies found in the upper floor of the house they were all in one place so i said these people were not  words 
Philippines	 words now the vice-president gloria macapagal-arroyo welcome back on-line madame vice-president and thank you for your time thank you also madame vice-president the question we would like to ask among others is that was your decision to break away from the estrada cabinet as uh social welfare and development secretary a personal one or a party decision a combination uh uhm gene because for a long time now certain party leaders and leaders of other parties and other groups uh uhm have been pressuring me to resign but it is my practice it has been my practice throughout my political career uh uhm to always to be consulting with the people on the ground and in the earlier months when i would be having this pressure from certain party uh uhm colleagues and others to resign when i would check it on the ground that was not it was not jibing with my feedback from from the common people what the common people then wanted was that because the government was in trouble the country was in trouble then i should help uh uhm i should help by the by from from the inside but in the last two weeks that feedback changed uh uhm uh uhm and the people that i consulted asked said that it is time for me to leave the administration because my being inside does not help uh uhm bring about stability at all and in fact uh therefore it is time for me to take my role which my colleagues had been asking me to take we always love to ask the question whenever a decision is made or whenever a decision is about to be made is this is it always hard or did you did you have a hard time deciding to leave the estrada cabinet you know gene what is always hard is to disc to discern what is the will of god because that 's always been my my tradition and part of the will of god is expressed through the people uh uhm because of course they voted for me and they can dictate to me words the confluence of events  yes  uh uhm so it 's really you know this is a lot like sin where you can discern the will of god i mean you choose will you will you commit adultery or will you not will you steal or will you not those are very black and white decisions yes, the choice between right and wrong is very clear yes uh uhm yes, but when you talk about do i resign or do i stay uh uhm then then you really have to go through a process of prayerful discernment which which i went through because you don't know you don't know whether what is going through your mind is really what is the right thing to do so you pray and you wait for the confluence of events to guide you and that 's what i had to do  uh uhm  if i got your statement correctly the statement in which you declared your resignation from the estrada cabinet yes you said something like it is now untenable for you to be with the estrada cabinet or it is untenable for you no i did not to stay in the cabinet i did not use the word untenable  uh uhm i can no longer continue to serve in the cabinet  okay  uh uhm so by staying in the cabinet before you want to help the government   yes yes that 's right now it 's a different story things have turned from the ma from the point of view of the people who voted for me as vice-president because you see gene i also have this attitude  uh uhm  okay that as cabinet member i was accountable to the president and i and i like to believe when i was cabinet member i was accountable to him and and i was a good team player but as elected vice-president of the people i am accountable to the people as well  uh uhm  directly to them and the time came when there was a conflict between my accountability to him uh uhm and my accountability to them uh uhm and so therefore i had to choose the higher accountability which was what i was elected for before you were pressured as you have pointed out by your political party mates  yes   yes   yes  many colleagues yes   the people  some people in the government   some people some people no outside government outside of government yes some but but not you know in my process of consultation not with the vast majority you were called names and yet   when you were in that position and yet i stuck to my posi my point uh uhm because i was confident uh uhm that i was i i i i had been listening to the people uh uhm and they agreed with me in fact i i get i got my signals from them yes that 's why as long as i know that i 'm doing right uh uhm and as long as i know that what i 'm doing is what is dictated by the people they can call me names but that 's the way it is is your decision in any way linked to the controversy as exposed by ilocos sur governor luis singson in a se  the jueteng issue in a sense gene yes because prior to the prior to the controversy that was raised by governor singson uh uhm uh uhm the people said continue to serve  but when singson came up with his expos&eacute; the people were so enraged that they didn't want me to serve anymore okay by saying that would it be fair to conclude that you believe governor singson you believe the charges or you still doubt it well i wa i want to try to be sober and to say that it 's not what i believe that matters uh uhm there are investigations going on uh uhm the more independent they are the the more we will know the truth but the thing is it is between the peo the people and and what i should do my proper role in government uh uhm so it is not what the president should do  it 's what i should do   yes   yes  and the people wanted me to get out and join the opposition rather than stay in the cabinet where i was not contributing anymore to stability how do you describe the pulse of the nation now because if you look at surveys and there were two surveys  oo  which came out just recently pulse asia incorporated and then we have the social weather station and both surveys show that there is still support for the president well yeah   they still believe in the president but well you have decided because you heard the people  yeah  because it was i mean i 'm not saying that you see they 're two different things  they they maybe the majority may not want him to resign  uh uhm uh uhm  uh uhm but they wanted me to resign from his cabinet okay uh uhm so there is no conflict between between those findings no those findings by survey groups the scientific uh methods determining what the people think and what you heard from the people  yes  yes that brought you to decide and leave the estrada cabinet  that 's right  yes okay perhaps what they want now from me uh uhm is to invigorate the opposition because in the past that was what that 's what they were saying the opposition was in doldrums because they had no leader  uh uhm  uh uhm and perhaps though the people might still as the surveys show want him there perhaps they want somebody who will take the lead in being more in bringing vigor to the opposition madame vice-president allow me to mouth yes the uh well the words of malaca&ntilde;ang that your resignation from the cabinet the situation we are in now the expos&eacute; of governor singson is part of a grand conspiracy to destabilize the estrada administration i i 'm not aware of any such con  that you are playing into that conspiracy by resigning well if it stutter if it was a question of playing into some conspiracy or other then i should have done it before done it before okay uh-huh but this is coming from the people and not from any particular at this point in time uh uhm party member who whom i could not say no to uh uhm but are you surprised to hear those kind of response from malaca&ntilde;ang to the uh situation now no i 'm not   is that uh an effort in futility in desperation because they can't find anything else to   well i don't want to judge uh uhm because they have their answer and and all i can say is from my knowledge uh uhm i 'm not aware of uh any from personal knowledge i 'm not aware of any move to destabilize former president ramos former president aquino manila archbishop jaime cardinal sin have demanded the resignation of president estrada but you haven't issued a statement on that explaining that you cannot make a statement on the resignation because you would be the benef you would benefit from such act  yes  but have you thought about this whether you would really make one or not a statement yeah as long as i 'm in support or as long as i 'm the beneficiary i don't think it 's proper it 's it 's delicadeza  i don't think it 's proper to make a comment except to say that i will follow the constitution uh uhm speaking of propriety or or or or courtesy some people hit back at you for for resigning abroad you should have considered courtesy on the part of the president to say it in front of him or when you 're in the country well i was i talked to him on the phone uh uhm so so i did uh resign personally uh uhm okay the thesis of this discussion is is there a caesar 's wife in this government that could take over in the wake of the questions on the morality the leadership and the kind of governance governance of this uh incumbent administration and well i don't know where it 's coming from but there are rumors and i 'll be more bordering on rumors speculations or even libel or even black propaganda exactly how it is  words  yeah but it is public interest and people want to know they 've always said that if it 's the vice-president who will replace president estrada then it would be worse because no not they 've been pointing out the jueteng connection not the not they have always said gene uh president aquino does not say that cardinal sin does not say that reforma = political party does not say uh uhm  promdi = political party   promdi  does not say that so it 's not they have always said uh uhm well i 'm referring to the detractors your detractors   well okay the detractors yes because what can they find about me except that i am a town mate of bong pineda and his wife who is the mayor of my home town and many years ago i was ninang in in the wedding of her son one of four that i attended that day uh uhm which i couldn't even stay for the ceremony because i had to go to the next one uh uhm and i also asked cardinal sin about that what what is the what is a christian 's role if you are asked to be the ninang  uh uhm of the son of somebody with a dubious dubious reputation and he said it is your christian duty to accept because the sin of the father is not the sin of the son uh uhm but your your uh but your being there yeah brought on or gave this kind of of talks but uh i was doing my christian duty and if i must suffer black propaganda because speaker a starts laughing i did my christian duty it will be the lord who will protect me  uh uhm  uh uhm but this appears to be a uh i don't know the word i 'm lost i 'm lost for words  recurrent  uh recurrent it 's a recurrent it 's i would i wouldn't say it 's a stigma on your political career because this has been going on ever since you were senator and then when you ran for vice-president yes you won and still there were allegations that you got jueteng money
Philippines	mr secretary good evening and welcome on your your appearance tonight on options is very timely because as we all know uh the uh welga ng bayan is being planned for this week and uh the iglesia ni kristo has announced that it planned a big demonstration for saturday so the streets of metro manila will smoke and smolder again and it seems that the most volatile of issues is the oil issue and whether you like it or not you are on the spot mr secretary and uh you are on record as saying that you are against any immediate rollback or decrease in the oil prices  and so we would like to ask you what really are the positions of the philippine government on this very very volatile issue will you really announce uh price decreases in the middle of august and if so what will be the amount of the price decreases teddy the president has been very clear from the very beginning exactly where we stand and that is there can be no oil price reduction until the o p s f deficit is wiped out and she has also said before that it will be more prudent if we 'll allow a little bit of a buffer to be built into the o p s f after that uh her options have always been open but uh the problem now is uh we have a number of uh spending priorities that will have to be met especially in the light of mount pinatubo uh the eruptions of that volcano which are continuing we do not know how long those eruptions are going to continue so the damage is going to be there and we have to face up to those spending priorities mr secretary august fifteen or thereabouts you will announce some price reductions what would be the magnitude of those price reductions in your mind right now mr secretary in my mind if i talk in terms of uh preferences i would like to have uh an average of a fifty uh centavo per liter uh reduction uh there is an arithmetic to that uh teddy it is that we are committed to making this economy grow and in order to be able to do that there is one thing that we will have to do and that is cut that import levy which is beginning to hurt because that was the only source of revenue and i would like to see a fairly respectable cut to that maybe four percentage points now for every percent that we cut of the import levy that costs the national government two and a half billion pesos a lot of money huh so if you 're going to make a words cut that 's going to cost ten million pesos in addition we have a problem of words which is going to cost us about seven billion pesos a year that brings up the cost to the national government of something like seventeen billion plus the immediate repair and uh reconstruction that that we really have to do in central luzon because of mount pinatubo that comes to about eighteen million pesos and that 's the reason why i 've been suggesting we 'll have to be very prudent we will have to uh calculate our moves very very well because a complete rollback would simply throw away some of the gains which good luck is providing to the philippine economy right now and if i give away fifty centavos on average per liter that will be only six billion pesos out while i can keep the eighteen billion pesos through a words  assuming assuming uh mr secretary assuming since you give away fifty uh fifty centavos per liter on the average assuming no new taxes no further eruptions anywhere what kind of deficit are we talking about by nineteen ninety-one tony we are still talking about a twenty-six billion peso deficit which is what is in the program oh we 're on target  ice-phi:s1b-042#28> very very much within target as a matter of fact we are ahead of target because during the first uh semester we what we decided to do was really to manage the system very conservatively and so we 'd have a little bit of words uh for us to be able to catch up during the second semester don't forget that during the first uh six months the economy was growing very uh by a very small percentage uh just about zero and now this is the time uh to pick up and we can let government take the lead through precisely the public infrastructure program that we should finance and we still stick to the twenty-six billion peso deficit that we have targeted mr secretary you said that the government is prepared to give an average rollback of fifty centavos per liter how does that translate for example in diesel in fuel oil premium gasoline how much would uh each one be pushed back tony that depends very much on how the distribution is going to be made uh this is going to be a very difficult decision because almost every group that we talked with would have a different set of suggestions but the basic problem we have since we have intervened into the pricing of various oil products we have an anomaly right now where our relative price for diesel is low and our relative price for gasoline is high and as a result we 're importing a lot of diesel into the country while we have gasoline which is in surplus  a surplus of gasoline uh uhm and which we do not know what to do about so obviously if you go by the base on the basis of uh word market economics we should be uh cutting more on gasoline and so much less on diesel as a matter of fact in other countries they have what they call as a mono price for both diesel and gasoline because it 's fairly easy to shift from one use to the other so if the differential is very big then there 's a tendency for people to use more of the cheaper priced diesel and that 's why we 're running short of that we 're importing and uh they would use less of the dearer priced gasoline but the fifty centavos uh average that you 're proposing to roll back assuming for example that diesel will be lowered by average forty centavos that is really very minimal it has no effect on the prices uh situation so that i think those who are proposing a rollback will not be happy with such a a an infinitesimal reduction in prices well of course i i agree with your point of view that these measures are necessary but uh there seems to be a lack of uh uh enthusiasm on the part of the government to explain its policies in terms that people at the lower socio-economic levels can understand and appreciate well i hope that we can do a better job of explaining the realities of our economy to our people because after all this is our common affair but uh cough we do not have to theorize very much about it we have had three experiences of an oil price rollback since nineteen eighty-seven and in every case it did not lead to a reduction in exactly yes jeepney fares uh uhm it did not lead to a word of transport fares and the cost of living certainly did not uh decrease and what is even worse is that within three months because the government built up a huge deficit then the interest rates started going up the economy slowed down and prices increased uh uhm so people who are saying that uh uh if you cut oil prices now you will cut the prices of other commodities it doesn't happen do not seem to remember that we 've gone through those experiences already and in every instance since nineteen eighty-seven prices after three months instead of going down actually went up mr secretary if i may temporarily shift tone of this interview because i don't want to forget uh you and ex executive secretary oscar orbos were supposed to have engaged in a shouting match laughter in a cabinet meeting the shouting match that uh eventually led to his uh resignation from the cabinet mr secretary was there really a shouting match and would you kindly tell us uh if it was this and other things that led to the secre to secretary orbos' resignation in other words who shouted louder than who laughter  i think it 's a very unfair uh question to secretary orbos uh for the simple reason that uh the secretary of finance does not have that power uh just because even if it were true that uh there was a shouting match i don't think a cabinet secretary uh resigns simply because the secretary of finance shouts at him or her it just isn't so the fact of the matter is that there was never any shouting match uh in that cabinet meeting uh we had a very friendly discussion and to my mind that was one of the driest cabinet meetings that i 've ever attended so it required a wild leap of imagination for anyone to say that there was a shouting match you have been identified mr secretary as a key member of an anti-orbos cabal that was uh supposedly whispering anti-orbos propaganda into the president 's ear would you kindly react to statements like that mr secretary chuckle  i think the president makes her own determination of uh the cabinet members and their performance she does not need anybody to tell her how a cabinet member is performing and it is not in uh the habit of various cabinet members and myself included uh to be speaking badly about uh anyone in the cabinet as a matter of fact the president sometimes uh pulls my leg and jokes me uh as to the praises that i heap on uh the various cabinet members whenever they have something very good to present i always manage to uh say a kind word and so i don't ever remember having shouted at any time in the cabinet and much less uh at secretary orbos with whom i 've been very friendly thank you mr secretary we 'll pause for a brief break music  mr secretary the resignation the forced resignation of oscar orbos obviously did not happen in a vacuum or in an isolated condition there must have been a build-up of ill-will somewhere along the line would you uh give us some information on what this minor or major incidents prior to the resignation may have been well tony the relationship of a cabinet member with the president is a very privileged uh relationship and i cannot pretend to know all of the details of that relationship it is a matter that is personal between the president and the cabinet member concerned what i can say however is that uh when secretary orbos was appointed executive secretary uh he certainly had the uh best uh uh kindest uh thoughts from the president what happened since then i really do not know but uh as a member of the cabinet i can say that we have had very many discussions many suggestions for improving this and that and uh i personally did not have uh too many uh disagreements with secretary orbos i did give him a lot of suggestions as i suppose all the other other members of the cabinet have given the same set of suggestions but in the end it is not we uh that determine uh whether another cabinet member will resign or would tender his or her resignation that is a matter purely between him and the president   and the president  obviously the president decides but uh uh the perception is that uh at the time that mr orbos was uh uh invited to the cabinet mrs aquino was thinking of uh uh preparing him for the presidency i mean he she had very good uh uh perceptions of his abilities but somehow there has been a complete change in in this uh uh image of mr orbos uh i 'm not sure tony whether there has been any real complete change i can tell you that uh secretary orbos is a young man uh with a very good fresh kind of image and i 'm sure that it is an image that has attracted the president that has attracted me and has attracted a whole lot of people and he certainly raised uh the hopes and expectations of a whole lot of people uh what happened since again there uh it can be a matter of speculation but probably this is a matter that will be best left to secretary orbos and the president okay i 'll not press you anymore laughter  let 's go back to this famous meeting at which he was supposed to have shouted louder than secretary orbos or vice versa this meeting at which the levy and the rollback of prices were discussed presumably were not the only meetings at which these subjects were discussed  what was the participation of the other members of the cabinet in this and did you get the sense that that majority of the cabinet is behind taking a firm stand on this movement and this agitation for uh a substantial cut in the levy and a rollback of oil prices rudy as you know we have uh a small group within the cabinet that uh takes lunch with the president on mondays and it was on that monday for the week that uh secretary orbos tendered his resignation when uh there was some discussion about uh gasoline prices oil prices import levy and i remember very distinctly that uh there was no disagreement over principle uh secretary orbos has been in favor of the cut-down of the import levy and i 'm on record as being in favor of the phasing down of the import levy

a cozy studio and uh marita first of all welcome to our show  thank you for inviting me it 's a pleasure to be here in your show and well you know that stationery is a very major ingredient in any store around the world any store it is one of the items one of the top ten items that stores around the world stock up  and uh i 'm very very happy that you are in this field and uh of course from the work that you 're doing we can see that there 's a lot of influences from the area where you come from from bicol yes uh probably you can tell our viewers what exactly inspired you to use a lot of these materials actually since we own a printing publishing firm ever since i worked for them in college i 've been uh printing greeting cards and stationeries which i market locally so at the moment i 'm supplying fifty bookstores but uh since my mom is a regular lecturer in export and i see a lot of her clients coming here consulting her about export and you know she has this export fever actually it 's her it 's her ambition for all her children to go into export so she was the one who encouraged me to venture into this business and uh i know that our province my dad being governor of camarines sur i saw a lot of uh raw materials that has a lot of potentials because the province of camarines sur is well endowed with a lot of resources like especially the abaca and uh bark and uh the the materials which i use for the handy paper which is cogon grass and uh so many things so many exotic indigenous materials  so i decided to venture into making handcrafted greeting cards with uh something filipino in it using filipino materials you actually don't have a fine arts uh i don't have any background  background  no background at all  so how does these designs you know get to to be developed actually i feel like a pseudo-artist because i 'm a designer because of force of circumstance uh uhm but uh i just imagine i have a very imaginative mind so i didn't really believe that i could do it but my mom was the one who encouraged me she said i could do it so anything anything under the sun is a stimulus already to me stimuli really uh-huh so i think i have this card mentality anything i see i try to adjust it in a what i can make out of it uh-huh so a card or a wrapper or a stationery i see and now uh one of the things that i think was very interesting in what you 're doing is that you have started to put uh music yes music  this is locally available uh the electronic components are made here in the philippines uh uhm and uh you don't have any problem at all uh incorporating them in all of your designs uh the very first time i did because i didn't know how to install it and you know i didn't know the technical aspect uh-huh but when i consulted the one installing the music i had to adjust some of my designs i see so i can fit the music i i see so the those things you have already uh somehow gone over the hump of those problems  yes  uh i notice also marita that you not only do greeting cards and uh you 've also ventured into stationery items uh uhm like the all-purpose uh cards and uh slowly you 're getting into wrapping gift wrapping   cards   uh-huh wrapping paper  uh-huh so can you tell us more about that well actually since i 've been uh actually these designs that i have which i recently uh shipped to australia these designs i i actually sell locally but uh the australian buyer asked me what else do i do so i just showed the wrappers and all the stationeries that i do and she told she asked me to design for her so i made some new designs for her and i made some wrappers for her because it 's the in thing actually uh-huh uh-huh there 's a big demand for cards wrappers and stationeries yes well many of the materials that you have here now are really indigenous to uh the philippines yes uh you 're also using handmade paper and uh the other one is pine 'no  yes pine corrugated board it 's recycled paper actually uh really ha and uh is this recycled paper already readily available also or someone else is doing it yes oh that 's nice so uh when you are actually thinking uh uhm of some of the designs somehow how how do you get this to to finally get into uh production actually i start with a concept  i think of the occasion and then i start uh i start thinking of ideas and then i let it incubate in my mind 'cause sometimes there are there are designs which took days or weeks some months but there are some designs that i already have the concept i just sit down i play with the materials and all of a sudden there 's the design already so it really depends but all the while i just keep my eyes open and look for stimulus uh uhm from anything anything actually from fabric or anything actually anything under the sun laughter  so how about your the people helping you you know the workers well uh since this is a family business the printing i mean some of the workers knew me since i was still a kid  actually they never realized that one of these days i 'll be the one i 'll be the one managing the press but ever since i took over the company two years ago i started recu recruiting young people uh-huh because uh i have uh easier easier time dealing with them because i 'm also young uh-huh but the old people i retain them because they 've been loyal to our company they 've been here for about fourteen years already there 's nothing that is wasted in this place you know marita actually uses all the tiny little bits of pieces and you know and uh swatches and uh whatever she can get hold of to make into things and uh you can almost see a whole line of wreath done in three dimensional this is one of my collections it 's called the wreath collection  it 's actually one of the favorite and most saleable and marketable probably because of the season because christmas is the most favorite season i suppose  so uhm the wreaths are made of different materials the paper again i use uh some for some are made of handmade paper and some are corrugated corrugated boards because i 'm marketing or selling this to different kinds of countries and uh these countries have different tastes usually the europeans and the australians they prefer the natural which is the fine corrugated board and the asians they love the pastel colors of the handmade paper some some wreaths wreaths are made of garlands some are made of abaca twine some have stockings some are made of uh beads so i consider this collection as east meets west because they look native but i injected some uh western styles and i put also some high-tech elements like the electronic music with lights like this one  this is one of the designs that i uh shipped to oman that 's in middle east  this one is also one of the favorites the pearls it 's something different it 's uh not the traditional green and red christmas  it 's a wreath made of white lavender and pink lavender is actually my favorite color and i 'm i 'm happy that when i participated in citem this is one of the favorites in fact all the eight countries that i shipped to they ordered this i know there are several women who regularly watches the show and always look for something that they could do and probably in their spare time they could also do this as a hobby marita how long has this been going on the export business   yes  i started actually just last year last year and my d&eacute;but was when i joined the citem the thirteenth market week  uh uhm and uh since then you 've received buyers from yes from other countries uh uhm i 've had uh the most important thing for me even though i 'm starting very modestly is that i 've had the opportunity to enter the market in eight countries eight countries right away eight countries oh that 's good and at the moment i 'm already corresponding and answering some inquiries from other prospective buyers uh uhm and what is the most saleable uh item that you have right now the most saleable i have is the wreath collection and also the twine collection this uh weaving uh-huh  so we do some weaving   and now which countries uh particularly like this usually the asians and the australians may maybe because it 's very simple they find beauty in it uh uhm so they like it but of course marita is not only in stationery uh marita is also in puppetry laughter  uhm that 's true so we have asked her to to give us a sample she 's a member of what what 's the puppetry uh i 'm a member of puppeteers association of the philippines it 's a two-year old non-stock non-profit organization uh uhm and you have members all over the country yes we 're composed of different active puppet groups and uh the members are classified from professional to hobbyists to students educators i 'm one of the hobbyists actually  anyone interested in puppetry can call us at eight three three zero seven seven eight they can look for me  if they 're interested to learn the art of puppetry we conduct regular puppet workshop uh uhm so we teach children we teach teachers educators and professionals when does this happen monthly actually we schedule it and it 's also upon invitation so we also go on provincial tour  hello how are you hi mom it 's my first time on t v yey i 'd like to greet all my puppet friends from puppeteers association of the philippines how are you i hope you can see me on t v right now  and i 'd like to thank tita violy for my clothes and sam for my make-up  ay nagkabaliktad 'ata 'yon ah  one of the items i uh that caught my fancy was that packaging item that you were doing okay so marita can you tell me something about what your plans are in this area i have about three kinds of packaging  the first is the traditional this is the envelope and then uh i have another kind of envelope which is expandable because some of my products are two-dimensional or three-dimensional so it 's protruding so i use expandable envelopes and another thing is this one  this is the new kind of pack packaging that i make  it 's almost like a gift because i believe especially in europe and in australia the u s and canada they uh they value the cards that they receive they keep it and they display it during christmas and other special occasions commercial break music  what is in a name the first time we heard about the company called abstraction you know we were saying what is it about this company that made them use the word abstraction  and now that we are here we understand why they chose this name
Philippines	 music oscar orbos the wonder boy of philippine politics is now out of office from a congressman of pangasinan to secretary of the department of transportation and communications to the position of executive secretary or little president his rise to the top has been phenomenal but today he is out of office an ordinary citizen a practicing lawyer  his resignation came on the heels of widespread reports that he had a shouting match with finance secretary jesus estanislao on the issues of oil price reduction and a cut in the import levy and his ambitions to run for president in nineteen ninety-two  but he dispelled the rumor that he had presidential ambitions or be a senatorial candidate but reports have it that he is being approached by several presidential timbers like governor lito osme&ntilde;a of cebu former secretary fidel ramos and miriam defensor-santiago to be their running mate in nineteen ninety-two the sudden resignation of oscar orbos from the position of executive secretary underscored a word characteristic of the aquino administration in its fold political life tends to be nasty brute and temporary his resignation is probably the political equivalent of the mount pinatubo eruption the break was unexpected and it came at a time when the presidency was vulnerable and still is struggling from a natural calamity the stock market plunged and the political outlook bleak after hibernating from public view for almost two weeks oscar orbos comes out into the open and says his piece on the controversy tonight attyric puno looks into the plans and agenda of the wunderkind of philippine politics in his exclusive one on one interview for viewpoint this is rico hizon reporting music  good evening friends and uh welcome once again to viewpoint  well uh as you know by now our only guest for this evening 's presentation is now atty former executive secretary oscar m orbos now as you also know uh sometime last week uh on my colleague louie beltran 's show our guest appeared and a lot of people were saying that maybe he was a little bit too secretive too mild and maybe did not really address some of the issues that were presented there but if you will notice in the last couple of days an article has appeared in a number of newspapers where our guest today made some rather strong and very interesting criticisms against the handling of the economic policy of this country let me start with his conclusion which is going to start uh which is going to form the basis of our discussion this evening what he said what we need is a new stabilization program based not on ad hoc and ill-conceived measures but on sound economic principles that is consistent with our people 's modest needs and not simply those of our financial creditors and that builds on a social consensus for reforms rather than tearing apart the fabric the fabric of democratic society  we need such a program today  tonight we are going to ask our guest about the details of this particular article and his views which may give us a clue as to what really happened in terms of that very very fabled and uh talked about resignation recently we will be right back after this music  okay welcome back to uh viewpoint  well uh how shall i call you uh atty pa&ntilde;ero oscar orbos uh former executive secretary oca laughter  yeah dong just plain oca i guess uh okay well oca you know uh i know there has been a lot of commentary on your previous appearance on uh my good friend louie beltran 's straight from the shoulder  and uh you made it a point not to be drawn into a war of personalities or of trying to uh make certain characterizations on personal motives now i 'd like to respect that but at the same time i think as we 've discussed earlier we 'd like to talk more about the process and the matter of policy consideration because that 's what 's important about this particular issue we leave to another day the question of uh even the matter of presidential ambitions and all that but on the other hand what i find somewhat interesting is the conclusion that you made in this series of articles that you 've written recently and i 'd like to talk about that because it has everything to do with economic policy and how it affects the people particularly those that are less uh less privileged in life 'no  but uh before that oca let me ask you about this dichotomy this difference that people are making between what is popular and allegedly what is right i mean even the president made a big uh made a lot of reference to this in her state of the nation address it appears now that there is a contrast between at least insofar as people in government are concerned between what has to be popular or what what is popular and what has to be done which just seems to be right so how do you view this is something that 's popular not necessarily right or vice versa well uh dong uh in this case i can say that uh accidentally what is popular is right uh uhm and it is not necessarily the case that uh what is not uh u unpopular uh is right uh uhm uh i think uh the fundamental issue is here is uh the interest of the country uh uhm it 's not who is right and who is wrong uh academically speaking but uh we have to be sensitive as to the needs of the people and what the economy would need at uh at a given moment you know the economy dong as far as i can see it is a living thing you know you you have to respond immediately uh uhm i mean there are things that uh you cannot delay now uh in this particular case well the issue on the oil price and on the levy is uh very symptomatic of uh on certain differences uh on the overall policy uh uhm uh in this case in our economic stabilization program okay now the uh what has happened thus far as we talked the uh i n c demonstration yesterday the date of the state of the nation address has been aborted 'no  it was preempted in a way so really what happened yesterday was it was not with some exceptions not a very very uh you know difficult day in terms of the uh in terms of the demonstrations that could have would could have occurred but this represented in the minds of many people a reversal of government policy in the beginning people thought that government was dead set against and you were still there okay people thought that government was dead set against any kind of reduction in the in the oil price in oil oil prices then because of the threat government came back and said we 're going to reduce after all and then later on when you come back in your article you say that the price reduction should have been more it should have been one peso and eighty-two centavos rather than the average of one peso   and   and dong it should have been earlier it should have been earlier what i 'm saying is that our economic managers shouldn't have should have not brought uh this country to the brink uh uhm i remember as early as uh four months ago when you know in our monitoring uh of some of the indicators in the economy we were suggesting already a cutback uh on the oil prices and a cutback on the levy uh uhm this is uh a necessary measure we thought uh in order to calibrate the easing up already after a constrictive uh period uh uhm and it was very important dong because uh by then we thought that the economy has been squeech squeezed uh too much already uh uhm and that uh this was unnecessary  le let 's take it step by step in the beginning is it true that there was a real conflict of opinion between those that were saying precisely what you 're saying that the time had come when perhaps a rollback a reduction in price was appropriate and those that said that under no circumstances would there be a reduction until the o p s f uh deficit was completely wiped out and a surplus and a buffer so-called was achieved was there such a conflict yes uh as to the timing uh dong uh our sense then as early as uh four months ago is that the economy could uh actually tolerate uh a little easing up after a constrictive uh period uh uhm and that uh well one of the measures would be to cut back on the levy so that uh cost would go down and already maybe addressing uh the oil price uh uhm because even then we were anticipating that by august uh the deficit would zero out and that uh we could afford already a cutback uh a reduction uh in the price uh uhm and that we did not have to wait for august to do this uh well in effect uh what we wanted to advocate was instead of asking the people to be patient we would be asking the oil companies to be a little patient because they would be paid anyway in other words rather than having the o p s f subsidy zero out in august they would have to wait until a few more months later yes in september this was uh a proposal of course we went through a number of proposals because we are a team uh uhm and we work uh within uh certain uh parameters but uh the more fundamental issue here if i may say so dong is that uh the targets uh we have committed ourselves to the i m f at two point five percent uh deficit uh to g n p ratio uh uhm was too constrictive uh uhm and that in fact under the krugman report we could be a little more liberal maybe bring it up to five percent uh uhm and that all of this uh what mindset about meeting targets uh to me i uh is really uh well a serious crime because uh we would be killing the economy while it 's true we could talk about long term you don't have to kill the short term for the long term so what you 're saying is that the concern about maintaining certain targets uh maintaining deficits within certain guidelines number one was also resulting in a lot of other difficulties for the economy itself oh yes uh dong uh in fact uh many of my colleagues in the cabinet uh have been heard uh to complain about uh lack of money lack of funds for schools for bridges uh uh uhm to deliver services we had to lay off people up to a certain point uh there was a need to belt-tighten uh uhm but beyond that if we have to constrict some more uh my position was that well it 's going to kill the economy what about the argument that these uh restrictions these guidelines had to be met because otherwise we would not uh comply with the stabilization program which we had agreed to under a letter of intent in which in turn would lead to problems regarding new money for the philippines but you know dong uh that 's precisely the debate you could rework the program uh with these creditors and justify it uh uhm there 's nothing sacrosanct about numbers committed to the im f uh uhm we have to be sensitive we have to attend to the welfare of our people and it 's for us to explain to them that in fact the economy could uh afford a little more uh liberal uh movement towards spending more  le let 's let 's analyze a little bit of that when you say you could spend a little more that it was too constrictive give us some details to that  for instance   to what extent was it constrictive for instance dong uh if we maintain the same targets now we would be foregoing the use of about twenty-eight billion pesos uh uhm in foreign-assisted projects uh uhm uh because uh we would not release the counterpart funds because by releasing these counterpart funds we would be going over the deficit targets you mean twenty-eight billion pesos could have been devoted to more projects in this economy right now yes uh-huh and that means uh lesser opportunities lesser employment lesser activities etcetera  twenty-eight billion could take the form of what for example infrastructure projects infrastructure uh there could be some other livelihood programs uh environmental uh uh promotion etcetera  so so in other words you were not convinced or at least when you were arguing for this position uh you were not convinced that these deficit maintenance targets uh were necessary in order to convince the creditors and maybe even the i m f that we were still still well within our ability to be able to pay back all of those obligations later on exactly dong uh-huh okay uh those are the premises and besides at that point uh it has to be a calibrated measure uh uhm you know i was saying all along that uh if we keep on with these targets uh and we insist on the nine percent levy and we insist on the on the word percent uh uh price structure of of oil and gasoline products what will happen is that in in fact we will have inflation we will have unemployment and uh the reasons for all of these uh why they were put in place revenues is not happening
Philippines	thank you very much  magandang umaga din mga kaibigan and welcome back to breakfast  guys uh michael jackson pretty good referring to music just played uh i liked michael jackson before but not so much now laughter but anyway okay it 's christmas here on the set but we still have a lot of things to tell you in fact today we 're premiering our health portion on the show so every friday from now on you can count on us to give you the latest developments and information in health news that affect not only your health but also your families as well and uh your health update is supported by generation e from mead johnson help make your kids part of generation e exceptional and extra-smart and of course somebody who 's exceptional and extra-smart is alex she 's gonna give us a health update alex not recorded  okay thank you very much uh alex and uh we will be going to this serious health issue in detail as we speak with the pediatrist uh from the intensive care unit of the makati medical center dr michael wassmer good morning good morning okay uh so uh this is not a good thing to say that business has been pretty bu uh i mean it has been pretty busy for you nowadays how many patients do you get on the average per day per week let 's say dengue related uh there 's a lot of uh admissions and a lot of uh kids who are getting admitted in the hospital on a suspected case of dengue okay and uh some of those uh recover quite fast and the others uh require more intensive uh monitoring where uh in an i c u setting do you have a number ten a day twenty a day i would say at least ten a day ten a day yeah has it grown through the years like last year it 's less and before that or is it still the same uh the number of admissions basically is uh the same but uh what differs is that uh as before that it was occurring on certain months now we 're seeing dengue uh earlier like it 's a uh whole year illness as compared to before that we used to see them only in the rainy season why is that is that a weather thing is that uh uh i 'm not so sure on what the actual cause is there 's classic dengue d h f and then there is the dengue shock syndrome can you define please okay when you say uh dengue fever this is basically a child who has had fever for three to five days and has basically all the symptoms of a viral infection like a cold a cough and everything and basically uh because of the persistence of the fever they consult their doctor uhm and uh when they do some blood test uh it shows that uh there is a reduction in their platelets and everything which could be classified as dengue fever dengue hemorrhagic fever is basically uh more like the child has actual bleeding like nosebleed gum bleed uh g i or gastrointestinal bleed dengue shock syndrome is basically uh there 's no bleeding you don 't see any bleeding but there 's massive loss of fluids in the body and therefore uh the blood pressure could go down word the hypotensive and this would affect the other organs in the body what causes this the dengue shock syndrome uhm well it 's basically a uhm immune-related uh it you the virus creates a reaction in the body which causes uh inflammation and it releases a lot of uhm what we call chemical mediators which uh basically uh uh drops your blood pressure and uh affects your other organs in the body doc bam bam bam was saying a while ago that uh he he was a victim of dengue twice as a kid and he said he thinks it 's because he was a plump fat kid  yeah  does does that have a connection the chubbier kids get hit get infected more or something no uhm when uh actually uh it affects everybody regardless whether they 're fat or they 're uh-uhm skinny young uh kid or adult kid or there 's this notion na kids lang 'eh  no no even adults in fact a lot of adults uh have dengue uhm the only reason is that they don't normally uh adults don't normally go to the doctor right away they try to self-medicate and uh uh uhm and before they know it yun pala they already have uh dengue uh-uhm but basically it affects al all types of children i see doc uhm how do we detect dengue uhm the only way to detect dengue is to basically have a uh blood test done e  uh basically uh it 's it 's called uh uh c b c or complete blood count with platelets and uh if you monitor that and uh if your platelets are dropping then you are a dengue suspect although this can happen in other illnesses as well there are certain tests like a dengue blood test or an elyssa test which can be done but basically this can only be done uhm after the fifth day of the fever so kunyari uhm i noticed uh that kunyari my my uh little girl or boy has fever do i bring him right away to the doctor since i know that this is the month na yung maraming nagkakadengue 'no  the rainy season is it okay to bring him right away yeah well early consultation with a physician is always important uh they uh have the skills to basically identify uh which children uh have uh a high risk or a high prospect for for dengue especially like uh when we examine the child and basically the child has very very high fever and yet uh on physical examination you do not see any locus or any area in which uh the child may have where the fever is coming from then uh this child basically is a dengue suspect until proven otherwise why why are pediatricians uh the best people to go to aside from i mean as compared to other doctors even even if you 're an adult you still go to the pediatrician for the dengue because they are supposedly the specialists in dengue well it 's because basically uh we handle so many cases a year of uh of dengue so we are basically uh more attuned in uh identifying uh patients with dengue although uh when it comes to adult i think an internist will be in the same realm as a pediatrician in uh diagnosing dengue okay can i just call my doctor and say my my son or my daughter has this high fever and these are the symptoms can i treat uh that at home can i treat that kind of sickness at home uh i think it would be best for the child to be brought to the pediatrician because uh the pediatrician will have to make a decision whether the child has to be admitted and observed in a hospital setting or can be managed at home is there a vaccine being uh made for this 'cause i know there 's a flu vaccine and there 's hepa =hepatitis so is there a vaccine being i think they are doing initial studies or initial trials on a vaccine for dengue although i think uh it 's be it 's a little bit difficult because we are not dealing only with one strain there are several strains of dengue so therefore in order to create an effective vaccine it has to be effective for all the different strains of dengue anyway uh before we wrap this discussion up uh dr mike maybe give it to us in black and white maybe in just uh tips for the viewers at home uh you know before they leave the house they have to work na important things they should remember maybe just some several things that uh they should do or should not do uh with relation to dengue well uh uh i would recommend to all mothers and uh to all mothers or uh adults who have uh children or themselves persistent fever of more than three days uh or who have have episodes of nosebleed or gumbleed or feeling very very weak uh to please consult your doctor at the earliest possible time so that the necessary uh tests could be done in order to identify whether you have dengue fever or not okay alright thank you and uh well thank you very much dr wassmer thank you  welcome back to points of view   we 're talking about whether using one 's native uh tongue in the educational system  joining us is ed lapis he 's the head pastor but of day by day christian ministry president of kaloob cultural foundation  we also have bart guingona he 's a theater actor and a director and mrs ledinila santos director of bureau of elementary education decs and i think  okay so you were saying na mrs santos na mali daw ang ano mali ang sinabi naming uh policy in terms of the decs now what is the real policy of the decs uh the real policy is that we 're just using the lingua franca   oo  as a pilot for a pilot study in sixteen grade one classes in sixteen schools in the region as a pilot project it 's just a pilot project wherein we are going to use uh tagalog yeah in the in the areas where tagalog is widely spoken cebuano in the regions where cebuano is widely spoken and in ilocano ilocano where ilocano is widely spoken yeah uh from our roster of schools uh there will be eight which will be using tagalog alright five which will be using uh cebuano and three which will be using ilocano as a medium of instruction for all uh grade one subjects  but is this right right  but in the second quarter we will just we will be starting them with oral word 'no and probably oral english if they are ready but this is does this indicate a direction na eventually you really want to widen the scope of uh of filipino as a medium of instruction in all elementary schools well if uh the results of the study would show that the children will be learning better in the lingua franca then probably we could well not just immediately a policy but we could widen the scope of the experiment  pero ngayon hindi ba they are already using filipino in terms of certain subjects like uh sibika mga ganon hindi ba   they are using filipino  yeah they are using filipino for uh sibika at kultura  yeah uh good manners and right conduct but uh and of course filipino as a subject and reading in filipino uh huh and they use english for mathematics and for science and english as a language but in the ling lingua franca experiment we will be using we are not abandoning the bilingual program right right but we are just using the lingua franca as a bridge from the home setting to the school setting from the known language to an unknown language uh uh we are using the lingua franca as sort of a bridge so that the children can be led step by step to the new language to a new setting in the school rather than plunging them directly to something that is not   alright whether gradual or uh whe whether gradual and then do you know uh modulated and all that pero ang katotohanan nito we 're really going towards a policy where english will be de-emphasized and more filipino will be implemented oh no i don't think so uh we are still uh as i said we are not abandoning the bilingual uh policy we are just finding out a way by which we could teach english better probably if we start the children in a lingua franca meaning in a language that is not new to them  yeah   so does  uh we are looking forward to the time when when they learn because i think studies show that if the child learns the concept in his own native language there is better transfer to the new language  in his own native oo   so this is also trying to like uh students learn english better if we do that  i hope we hope that we can that that they will learn english better because i believe there are so many studies that have already been conducted   oo so for example  pag naintindihan na nila pag naintindihan na nila saka na mas madali  yeah pero excuse me lang i 'm sorry how do we evaluate success uh because if correct me if i 'm wrong but uh it 's it 's been done i remember when i was a kid uh an experiment like this was done where uhm the medium of instruction was uh was in filipino uh uhm and that was abandoned a few years later  uh obviously there there there 's a whole generation of kids who are running around very confused out there uh so there 's a unless you can evaluate it and quantify its its success then uhm it 's just going to be an experiment
Philippines	a very warm welcome to you sharon thank you very much may i call you dong of course of course to make it more informal okay okay you 're here now to uh you 're here now to promote uh a

marunong na kasi naman you have everybody doing it for you here i mean all families all filipino families have that  kumusta naman si kiko how is he doing with his studies he 's doing very well thank you for asking but uhm of course harvard is a very demanding school and yes uh-huh and his course is very demanding uh-huh and uhm they have to squeeze in all this uhm all this uhm education in one year yeah so his knowledge bank is kind of getting stretched now  na na nakakasama ka na ba kasi normally uh lalo na when students there are are married 'no there are a lot of activities with the other students oh yeah it 's wonderful are you ano are you already getting involved in the harvard life uhm well yeah they have this program for spouses always yeah and we try to get together although because i don't live right in cambridge yeah uhm as the others do i don't get together with them as often as i i would want to besides i 'm busy doing my own things back home  yeah  i don't know if you 've felt this already kasi baka mana maraming mga filipino doon sa cambridge na kilala ka but are you enjoying the relative anonymity na naranasan mo   you know what i 'll tell you one of the biggest one of the major reasons na na- in love ako sa boston is that is it 's is that uh it is so different from california uh-huh in the west you have more filipinos yeah in boston boston is not even as uh well new york of course is fast but it it also has a lot of filipinos boston is more quiet  uh uhm there are less filipinos so for a celebrity like me who who appreciates some peace and quiet every once in a while it 's the perfect place to be   yeah   is this a welcome change welcome change laughter  yes absolutely absolutely has this change already produced ano may baby na ba  we 're trying i 'm actually hoping it 's right now but really uh yeah i i 'm actually hoping but i we do believe it 's all going to be in god 's perfect time uh-huh so but but but it 's it 's really there you have all the time oh yeah to relax and to when he 's not reading two hundred pages a day laughter you know when but right now he 's having he 's going through his mid-terms so   yeah he 's in the the kennedy school of government yeah exactly as opposed to the law school exactly no not the law school   hindi siya pumasok sa  no not the law school a lot of people think it 's the law school no it 's the kennedy school of government uh-huh alright well you know we we 're talking about el ni&ntilde;o earlier ano  uh uhm  at saka ewan ko kung naranasan mo 'to   oh it 's so bad in boston now it 's a yeah  it 's affecting us too  i understand it 's medyo malamig in the in the area now  masyadong malamig ngayon   right  we 're now in our thirties sometimes we go down to the twenties yeah but i tell you from experience uh uhm uh the boston winter is worst than new york i hear okay so handa ka na ba para sa winter  uuwi ka aalisan mo na naman ang boston laughter   oo aalis ako  no no but we 'll spend siguro christmas here but there will actually be no work  pero to us kasi it 's still a novelty e  because it 's going to be our first winter so okay it 's a welcome thing 'no but i don't think i would be able to put up with it if i had to live there uh uhm for years and years 'no  i don't think so well you 'll be able to skate on the charles river i mean uh no my daughter will do that she 's a skater that 's why because i heard na si k c is actually into skating she is and she competes and she has won something already yes and she even had a competition in marlboro in massachusetts uh-huh with as part of the philippine team that went  and i understand the philippine team uh was skating well   a lot of filipinos placed  yes they were very good i 'm so proud yes   uh-huh  and so si k c si k c is also among the among these uh skaters yes she is uh-huh okay let me ask you na na na mae-enganyo ka ba na baka are you are you somehow thinking that you might want to live there for good i can't say it has not crossed my mind uh uhm no actually it has crossed my mind about a million times laughter  but my husband is very nationalistic laughter  well he 's probably you know he tells me that the reason that he 's there is to try to learn as much as he can to bring back to the philippines  uh-huh  and also in a couple of years k c herself baka maging eligible na 'yan for radcliffe oh she 's uh she 's kind of really prep we sa we actually sat down with her it 's funny that you brought that up   radcliffe laughter  yeah we we really sat down with her and we said because i think it 's rubbing off on her this harvard thing because she sees how important education is to her to her dad and to me  yeah  and uhm she sees the kids in her school 'no  yeah i said she 's in grade seven now that 's middle school and uh she goes to private school near our house which is a lovely school that really brings out the best in every student yeah so i tell her you better start this early if you wanna go to a good school a good college someday because yeah how long are you gonna be there how long is kiko 's uh oh we have like about six seven months remaining  the program is for one year   that fast that fast uh the program is for one year  it 's the same one that uh secretary alunan took like i had a chance to meet him by the way and i have to tell you the newspapers and television does not do the man justice he 's darn handsome in person speaker a laughs   yeah   okay also after having rested siguro for several months also yeah he looks more more relaxed  alam n'yo in spite of your distance medyo naabutan pa rin ng konting tsismis o konting contro controversy  hindi ba   meron oo  uh i understand that for example lumabas dito daw si gabby daw your ex uh has been trying to to contact uh your daughter 'no  well  nag-uusap na ba sila  if you mean that he 's been trying to call right that 's absolutely not true in the first place he does not know our number  laughter okay and there 's not too many people know our number uh-huh uh if you 're saying if you 're asking if he has tried to have k c call him that is true uh uhm uhm he 's told some mutual friends uh uhm uhm and these mutual friends of ours have written k c saying you know your papa wants to speak to you  yeah  but it 's my daughter she 's twelve years old and she has she called words   no  she 's really not comfortable that 's what sh she said it on showbiz lingo i think   uh-huh uh-huh and i 'm not i 'm certainly not going to be the first person to stop her from getting in touch with her father   uh-hmmmh  but i 'm also certainly not going to be the first person to force her to get in touch with him laughter   yeah  and then interestingly in one of those strange coincidences in life   uh uhm  i understand jenny syquia and her new husband are also in the same area yes actually we speaker a laughs i might get in touch with i just got her number yeah uh-huh   she left her number with a friend of ours  uh-huh  and that 's not so bad because you know the one thing that 's nice is that when jenny and i got to talk which was just really once yeah and about a long time ago on my birth after my birthday show   yeah  we agreed that our daughters should grow up knowing that they 're sisters   yeah  and that they should be loving each other i remember i appreciate that yeah i i i i had the honor also of being on that particular show where she came out and you had that encounter have you kept up actually no  magkaibigan pa ba kayo or we have not kept in touch as in calling each other or visiting no no no  uh  it was never like that because it was still i think for her it was still too fresh uh uhm and i had also just started a new life with my new husband  yeah  but as far as you know she 's happy now jenny well i really have no idea okay actually i only heard that she got married when i got back and i was so happy to hear that okay let 's take a break   she deserves to be happy i think  alright we 'll be right back music comments by sharon 's friends - matthew mendoza and albert martinez - speaking in tagalog  okay mga co-stars mo sa  my leading men yes   yeah yeah  how was the film i mean uh you did this before you left  you know  yes i managed to do this movie before i left in june  okay   oo  but you know i have to tell you i always had in the back of my head of course that since it was a joey reyes project  uh uhm  yeah he wrote it he directed it i said well joey reyes always makes good movies so this is gonna be a good movie but very very frankly i really really think it is so much better than i expected it to turn out  yeah  uh uhm and it 's uhm i 'm i 'm so thankful to to joey   pang-award pang-award ba ito sa tingin mo like the last time   that 's not for me to say speaker a laughs but uh i always give my best anyway and joey i think brought out the best in each of us  yeah  so it 's it 's a great movie  yeah   it 's solely for women in particular   uh-huh  but the whole family will enjoy it okay it 's a great movie going back to boston usually at this time of the year fall uh uh uhm  nakapunta na ba

know the next day was supposed supposed to be uh officially winter the beginning of winter  yeah yeah oh that 's  that 's really nice fall foliage   it is so it was beautiful  if we had you know  okay  and you know nowadays my husband and i we of course right now we can't anymore it 's too cold yeah but in the summer we would go to this park and barbecue and  yeah  so what 's what is your day like in in in boston now i mean well people have this misconception that i 'm always just idle and that i 'm a couch potato uh-huh  which is not true
Philippines	 music we hope we did not scare you when i said ipapatawas namin kayo  but today uh we will show you the many other uses of tawas and uh from the market it is now available in every major department stores and supermarkets all over the country and of course today dr sonny acha will talk to us about the many uses of tawas  well to start with uh tawas as it i as we call it in the local medium filipino is in english uh alum  now the chemical name we have several varie vari variations like alum uh potassium aluminum sulfate uh which is this crystal group now as far as the uses we can trace as far as history from the old folks that they 've been using it for simple treatment like uh for ailments like mouth sores or singaw  so from there you can see that it has the medicinal sort of medicinal uses which we have adopted into these cosmetic lines music  i see and uh what is the ingredient in tawas  for example i know that you have gone into the deodorant line yes which is actually a more sophisticated way of just pukpuk pukpuk you know yes you pulverize it and people use it and it gets messy you know and now you 're using tawas with calamansi and tawas pure alum yes now uhm what 's the difference of uh the tawas with calamansi and pure alum now with regards the differences in the deodorants we ha we came out with two varieties now one with the pure tawas uh alum and one with the calamansi  now we added the calamansi extract this is uh intended for people who perspire heavily especially the overweight so we thought of just not using plain tawas but plus another additive which could help prevent heavy perspiration especially the odor emitted after perspiring uh-huh and uh i understand that these uh two uh products are now available in roll-on and uh   and spray  and uh spray yes alright now uh how about the other uh lines that you are doing one popular line right now that we have is the astringent group now it comes in four different types we have one for normal skin one for oily skin this is the tawas with uh pineapple extract and then one for skin discolorations like an-an  we added the radish extract and then lastly we have the tawas with avocado cucumber and aloe vera extract this is uh intended for dry skin now what makes our astringent different from the usual astringents that you see in the market is that we have instead of the usual boric acid uh content we added the tawas crystals so this is pure and natural crystals without any chemical uh additives okay i 'd like to go back you know one by one because sometimes uh we we see all these labels of products and you really don't know why this is so and why you should buy for example uh an astringent with pineapple now tell us one by one exactly what is the importance of choosing one from from the other yeah so let 's start with the tawas facial lotion with pineapple extract that says here this is uh intended for oily skin uh uhm because you have the pineapple which is uh which whose basic ingredient is vitamin c now that helps dissolve the oils from the skin especially in the face uh uhm so and then the next one is the tawas facial lotion with the radish extract uh uhm this is the first actually the first of its kind if not here in the country  but in the world yes   world yes  yes because we we were the first to put the radish extract uh uhm now radish has the ingredient of sulfur and potassium which helps uh stabilize skin discolorations  i see   in short if you have whitish spots it helps bring back the normal color of the skin uh you were mentioning uh a while ago about an-an you know yes and that 's something that normally you always hear people saying oh i have an-an 'no  in effect uh that 's not a skin disease that external skin disease it 's really uh it 's a vitamin deficiency   deficiency  of the skin i see and then the supplement you can get from the radish extract but but don't we hear people say na nakakahawa 'yang an-an  yes it 's a very common skin disease and it 's very readily communicable   you get in contact with people with this uh skin disease and you get it  but  you get the same skin problem even if the other person is not uh who gets it and somebody else who has uh uh  an-an  a low of potassium uh thing or just anybody gets it you can have many causes one as i mentioned is vitamin deficiency plus it 's a communicable skin disease so it 's a skin disease really now if you have a potentially you you are already deficient in vitamins involved with that problem you get it readily i see okay and radish when you eat radish it increases your potassium and your sulfur yes uh-huh okay now you just mentioned about sulfur and uh and uh potassium like for example we 're having mount pinatubo now erupting and people are talking about skin diseases and what can happen you know i mean is this uh uhm astringent uh going to be very helpful to people that suffer from this type of uh problem yes one potential danger if you have fall-outs from the volcanic eruption is you get a very irritating skin disease wherein you have li a freckle-like uh spots now this is timely the radish extract uh facial lotion could help cure this this said disease this said disease yes okay let 's go to the next one now the next is the triple combination of uh avocado cucumber and aloe vera extract uh uhm which we added with the tawas facial lotion now this we intended for dry skin because uh especially aloe vera it 's a very popular herbal extract which is popularly known for moisturizing the skin uh uhm together with avocado and cucumber that helps uh even out even small freckles or wrinkles in skin in the skin yes even freckles can be taken out yes wow i 'm sure that will be uh very much uh appreciated by chuckle especially the over forty chuckle people chuckle  and then lastly we have the uh tawas facial lotion which is uh for general use we recommended this for all types of skin uh-huh so for daily use maintenance in just cleaning the face the tawas facial lotion clear which has no color i see now you i know we 're discussing about tawas and you 're talking about astringents 'no  uh there is this uh uh notion that uh any kind of tea can also be very good you know for skin is that is that something that uh is true yes as a matter of fact it 's an accepted practice in in china and japan and even korea you notice the skin of these people they 're very fair and very smooth and clear yes because it 's an ancient tradition in these countries to to take a bath using herbal teas uh uhm now the extract from these uh the plants where we get the tea from they have i think most of the vitamins needed for smoothing smoothening the wrinkles plus the moisturizing effect i know we 're talking about tawas but supposing we have you know for example in my yard i have tanglad you know the lemon tea grass or or this uh tsaang gubat you know is that something that i can use too for for washing and bathing and uh using for shampoo it can be good yes it could be a daily routine and it would be very good for the skin and hair and the hair too yes i see what what is it for the hair that makes it good well the tea because it 's a plant uh uhm 'cause one very common el uh ingredient in plants is that you have well you have chlorophyll uh uhm that is a ve a normal plant protein and that is very good for the hair and then most of these some of them contains saponin like what we find in gugu  uh-huh some other plants also contain saponin with uh another variety i see you mentioned a while ago about uh you know this grass wild grass 'yong uh   kugon   cogon  yes and you were saying that cogon also has uh is very good for shampoo yes especially the part of the kugon where you have uh before the roots yes that part that 's very good for the hair it helps the but just uh about how many inches from the roots about two or three inches from the roots from the roots two or three inches yes you cut it and you boil it you get the extract from that and then that 's very good for washing the hair it helps moisturize also the hair follicles i see how do you get the extract you boil it just boil it or you pound it and then you can pound you can make a decoction or extraction music break in the recording  sonny you have such a vast knowledge about uh you know natural things you know natural uses of uhm trees plants uh barks and all of that if there 's some people or groups of people who are interested in getting themselves involved in this type of uh endeavor would you be able to help them yes uh i will be more than willing to help them if they just come to me and i could give them advice on how to go on and how to start with the some little things which could go grow big later on yes like for example you were saying cogon  yes kugon   you know somebody else can do it you know and tawas is only one of the vast mate resources we have so now uh tell me about the soap now the soap our tawas line we have three basically three different varieties  now the first one is the plain tawas uh herbal soap which we we with the hypo-allergenic property which means it could be used even for babies now this is highly recommended for pimples now it takes about a week 's time and you have pimples drying up after using this and then the second variety is the tawas clear soap with aloe vera extract now this as i 've mentioned before aloe vera is a moisturizing ingredient so this is recommended for dry skin now the third type is our plain uh tawas bleaching soap this is not the transparent soap but opaque now if you want the bleaching properties of tawas we recommend this one how long before do you get uh to see the results by using this soap well our studies show from about a month to about an average of three to one to three months' time uhm and uh of course with the astringent goes with it also some body lotions 'no  yes uh we came out with two varieties of the hand and body lotion one would be tawas with aloe vera ex extract again as i 've mentioned this has an a moisturizing effect the aloe vera extract and then the second kind is the hand and body lotion with uh carrot and papaya extract carrot and papaya yes now this is highly recommended also for dry skin especially those people with the in the upper age group we recommend the carrot and papaya extract now our latest product is the nature 's touch tawas gentle feminine wash  now we came out with this uh basically for for the women group now this is uh designed especially for during the heavy days menstrual period and then especially for pregnant women now it it it has the antiseptic property of tawas of course the deodorant property and the bleaching property which you don't find in the usual uh feminine hygiene preparations in the market music  sonny i understand this is the beginning of a whole pharmaceutical line well uh actually cosmetic line when we have completed the whole line probably later on we will expand in the pharmaceutical aspects of tawas because tawas itself has both cosmetic and pharmaceutical uses
Philippines	the political capital he used to have also had eroded uh-huh and the problem here is that uh uh the rate of erosion may start slow but then it could accelerate if nothing is done to uh to uh well uh attend to the basic concerns of the public and these concerns i identified earlier as being largely economic yeah and on the part of the president himself it serves as a wake-up call for him and his government well i 'd like to think not on the part of the gov of uh the president alone but on the part of the peo people immediately around him immediately around him the cabinet members and to a great extent even those who would comprise his administration beyond his cabinet senators who have been working with him congressmen also may be said to co comprise his official family and to some extent in a very basic sense the general public will have to be interested too in how the president responds to the feelings of the people as for instance expressed in a survey like this on top of the list of complaints by the people against the president is he 's insistent  some describe it as his stubbornness to amend the constitution  now in your survey forty-two percent is against amending the constitution at any time yeah and we believe that it is one of the factors that brought him down well uh we checked for that uh uhm but it seems not to swim we looked into uh whether the people who uh who feel that the constitution must not be amended at any time your forty-two percent or even a higher proportion fifty-seven percent who feel that constitutional amendments at this point in time right now uh are not quite right  uh uhm  now among these people we checked how many of them would still be uh approving of the president and how many of them would express disapproval, we were quite surprised to find out that a majority even within this group who are of yes of the forty-two percent or of the fifty-seven percent are still expressing approval for the way he has run the presidency the administration the government  uh uhm   the forty-two percent  despite his opposition to words  what this means is that the constitutional issue the issue of amending the constitution is not really all that salient yet not all that important yet and we tested for that  out of sixteen issues socioeconomic and political and public safety issues uh people rated the issue of constitutional amendments as number uh fourteen of the concerns  oo with number one being the most important therefore this is something that to them is not all that salient  that is why even when they disagree with the president on this matter since it is not all that salient yet from their point of view then this president 's capital is not eroded all that much uh-huh uh-huh the most the most urgent personal concern as listed on table eight of the survey uh is to avoid being sick and to stay healthy the september two to sixteen survey indicated fifty-four percent considers this the number one priority now yes what does this say this is a very this is a very understandable thing  when you are speaking of a people who are largely poor and people who are threatened by by unemployment and when they are employed they have low wages then to them the bet basic concern the most basic concern is that one should not get sick but uh that is for most of the public or poor what is interesting is also that among those who are better off this is also a major concern  and when we looked into that we realized that uh even among those who are better off uhm when they do get sick they require medical attention that uh could cost them quite a bit and therefore there   words  that 's right  okay therefore there is really a universal concern about uh about one getting getting sick uh-huh uh-huh if we look at table nine the most urgent national concerns on top of the list is the low pay of workers which represents fifty-eight percent on the september two to sixteen survey in the last survey of may twenty-one and june seven it was sixty-one percent why did it go down it did not actually those proportions the fifty-eight percent and the sixty-one percent would be roughly the same uh oh yeah roughly the same  extrapolation  yes oo  the second is high prices of people 's basic necessities and then the povert the poor people the the recovery of the economy well the constitutional change is way down below with only eight percent for this particular survey yeah yeah so it 's not the issue of the day laughter  yes i think that is why when people put uh quite a bit of uh importance on the constitution this is something that we personally may believe in that the constitution is always important  but uh given you know the priorities of what may be considered more urgent than just urgent among a series of concerns that are all urgent then the constitutional issue is less urgent the low pay is the highest concern uh uhm the rising prices of commodities the low pay uh the peace and order situation are tops on our concerns in that order yes in that order  now professor let me first take on this comment on line from malabon mr archie santiago  dapat huwag unahin ni presidente sina lucio tan danding cojuangco at imelda marcos ginagamit niya ang mahirap para sa kaibigan niyang mayaman  did the cronyism issue came out uh come out on this survey  uh meron tayong issue riyan ng uh ng ano yung coddling yeah coddling at seventy-eight percent coddling of well known people who dominated and gained much during the marcos era we even have also graft and corruption  graft and corruption would be fairly well addressed about half of the public would say that this is a major concern it is an urgent concern for the public to address for the government to address the flip-flopping on the politics of government did that have a a toll on on the popularity of the president for example his change of of the death penalty decisions from life to death uh the commutation of sentences and all in this survey uhm these specific very specific issues had not been tested for but uh i i think i can say with some degree of uhm confidence that uh when all of these issues are put together then in the public mind they register some idea of uh perhaps indecisiveness  also the idea that uh there is not quite that needed constancy or consistency in decision-making and therefore you do find some some people basically those who are better off who would still be supportive of the president let 's say last june by a majority of uh what sixty-two sixty-four percent this level would still be majority but it is now at fifty-two  now these are the people who would demand much more consistency and much more clarity much more transparency of the administration the bulk of our people however are not all that ano are not all that driven as it were to worry about constitutional issues about transparency about uh freedom of the press  they are really overwhelmed by the day to day demands of uh continuing to live to the point where you speak of urgent personal concerns not national not national oo  personal concerns then you 'll find out that the third best uh the third uh best rated that is to say the greatest number of people would say that their urgent personal concern has to do with simply being able to eat enough   self-preservation  yeah being able to eat enough every day and nothing else can be more basic than that  when you are confronted by that problem then all the other problems become really secondary professor i don't know if we can call malaca&ntilde;ang 's reaction to this survey as expected or pro forma because it has issued a statement saying that the survey rating of thirteen percent decline in the popularity of the president was attributed to the decisions the president made to keep the republic afloat let 's say the decisions on the oil prices the decisions on on labor the the call for higher wages these are hard decisions as malaca&ntilde;ang would put it but it has to be made by the president and those are the decisions that pulled him down uh yes i think is that a correct interpretation or reaction to the survey i think some of the uh some of the depreciation the decreases in uh the approval rating of the president may be also attributed to decisions that he made which would not be popular decisions  for instance last year you might remember that uh that uh the president uh uh had a statement to the effect that uh there was not going to be salary increases  and then uh the president also had some statements to make regarding constitutional amendments or provisions of the constitution that would have to be changed there were also quite a few other statements with did not sit which did not sit well at least with some sectors of our of our uh public  now every time part of the public gets to be disaffected with some statements that the president makes then that costs him but his uh his core his support is holding and so it is not as if he had become unpopular on account of those decisions which had hit some sectors i think uh the danger that uh may be uh may be discerned in the combination of figures and analysis that could be brought to bear on these figures is that uh what the president has now is a core that might erode so much faster and when that happens that will really be a terrible thing teresita reyes on-line from laguna what are the bases of the survey to make it accurate and credible reliable  and somebody here is asking about the the percentage of sampling errors and the response errors uh okay so  well actually we supplied that 'no   uh to guard against to guard against uh inaccurate surveys the testing that is uh uh done and which might be the easiest thing to do is to construct a technically uh legitimate variable or acceptable from the point of view of academic methodology sample  to ensure that you have a representative sample so that when you gather the responses you can actually tick off the entire you know adult population eighteen years old and over so that those inferences could be made   at there is another thing and that is even more important that is questionnaire design how you design the questions  now what we do is we put together questions that uh we pretest for clarity and also which we make certain would flow logically in a face-to-face interview these things are taken care of it 's not the kind of survey where uh you know you uh you put up a question which has not been pre-tested for clarity or for lo or for logic and then you ask people to register themselves either via a questionnaire or uh via a telephone and you don't check really on how the selection of these people is uh is uh uh done now historically surveys in the last uh fifty years have uh have become more and more reliable in terms of reading public opinion as well as uh electoral preferences  this is not to say that uh that uh the surveys cannot be wrong  there had been some cases when they have been terribly terribly wrong but when they had been wrong it was possible to find out why they had gone wrong and where they had gone wrong if if i may professor i 'd like   now may may i just add as regards that last thing 'no the sampling errors   given this particular uh uh uh size of uh the sample about twelve hundred and also given this specific design of the sample then you can read uh most of the uh most of the figures here uh close to fifty percent and down to forty thirty percent as within a margin of error so-called of plus or minus three   one thousand two hundred   minus three uh-huh uh-huh  that means to say that the figures within the frame ha you come across a forty percent figure then you can read it as forty-three or as thirty-seven or fifty-three as uh if it is fifty it can it could be forty-seven
Philippines	hello again i 'm gene orejana you are on-line for another issue in the day with the chief financial officer of meralco the treasurer rafael andrada welcome on on-line mr treasurer good evening gene uh let 's put a historical perspective into this discussion about power and the power sector in the country looking back ten years ago in the nineteen nineties we had this crippling power crisis  now what do you think caused that that problem well uh we as we all know right now uh the the power crisis was was primarily caused by by two major factors  uh uhm   one is a is is is uh misforecasting the inability to be able to plan properly for the requirements of a a an economy that 's taking off  okay  uh uhm and second is the inability to attract the right kind of investments uh to ensure that uh you would have players coming in to to provide uh generating uh projects uh uhm uh uhm now the inability to attract investors what brought this when in when in the nineteen nineties the philippines was one of those highly regarded by the foreign investment uh portfolios as one of the best in asia to put your money but at that time why were we not able to attract the foreign investors in the power sector well i i i think it 's uh primarily because of uh the the structural reforms needed to uh to provide uh a a a transparent playing field for all investors uh in the country has not really seen it its its fruition yet  uh uhm  uh uhm it was started early in the aquino administration but uh it has to take some time to be able to to get uh investors uh confident uh with uh with the environment in the philippines uh uhm we all know that the economy suffered in that in that period but how do you assess the performance of the economy then was it way below because of the power crisis or did this power crisis uh uh stunt our growth to the present uh well definitely at that time as you you you could remember most of our asean peers were already uh uh have already taken off uh uhm and uh we were still be uh being saddled with a very basic infrastructure problem which is uh supply of electricity uh uhm uh uhm   and that is very keen critical as far as ensuring uh investments to come in and businesses to flourish uh uhm uh uhm uh it it uh and and and in in in that context that 's why i guess uh we were pretty much late in in in seeing some economic development uh vis-&agrave;-vis our asian peers  uh uhm  would you say that the condition of the oil prices the the the rate of of uh crude in the world market at that time in the nineteen nineties contributed to this power crisis uh the the spiraling cost of electricity at that time well actually i i i i don't think we saw significant amounts of uh rate uh increases uh in the early nineties   uh uhm uh uhm uh uhm  it was really more a basic problem of supply infrastructure that 's correct   uh-huh uh-huh and maybe policies also of the government yeah well you have to allow uh uh some gestation period and maturity for certain certain initiatives by the government to be able to sink in to the uh investing public  uh-huh   uh-huh  uh uhm now comes this warning of the washington sycip policy center saying that in the year two thousand four we may or we might again suffer another debilitating power crisis similar to that of the nineteen nineties why is this so because they they added that uh power demand will exceed by the year two thousand four because of population increase in in industry in industries and all those things but is it forthcoming well the likelihood is is uh is is uh very clear if we do not get additional investments or investors to come in to build up new power plants  uh uhm uh uhm   okay  uh uhm uh the current situation in the industry is such that uh there is uh currently some some level of overcapacity in terms of power supply okay uh uhm  uh uhm uh uhm and that overcapacity was brought about by uh uh our our our want or need to be able to ensure that that uh supply would be in place hopefully to address uh agri-growing economy uh uhm uh uhm uh uhm but uh we had seen the finan uh uh the asian crisis uh couple of years ago and that stunted our growth  uh uhm   okay  uh uhm now we 're not seeing the demand uh coming in to take in the supply  uh uhm  uh uhm uh uhm uh you would have to be able to ensure that there would be certain structural reforms in the industry uh to allow a more transparent level playing field under which uh investors could put at risk their capital and hopefully gain some uh gain some profits uh and returns uh from those investments  uh uhm   uh uhm  the government and the proponents of this proposed uh power bill restructuring the country 's power sector pin so much hope on this proposal that could revolutionize or well liberalize our power sector but juan de la cruz the man on the street doesn't see along that line because they feel that whatever you do in the power sector power rates will always remain high as it is we are known to be the second highest in asia next only to japan in terms of power rates when when in fact japan is a such a highly industrialized country and the philippines is not but we have the second highest rate in the entire of asia why is that so well uh as far as uh cost of uh power 'no it it primarily the biggest component of uh the consumers' bill is uh practically made up of the uh the generation charge 'no   uh uhm   uh uhm uh uhm  and uh at this point in time the the major supplier of elec of of power is is is national power corporation uh uhm now because of certain uh policies uh that uh that used to be implemented with respect to cost subsidies as well as uh uh providing certain services in unviable areas and then together with the need to be able to fast-track uh the addition of new capacities to solve the the uh power crisis in the early nineteen nineties   uh uhm uh uhm   uh uhm uh uhm  napo the napocor cost structure uh had had ballooned to a certain extent wherein now you have the cost of uh power in the philippines generation at the generation level much higher than the retail rates of five or six asian countries uh uhm uh uhm   uh uhm   uh uhm   uh uhm   uh uhm  so that makes uh the philippines uncompetitive as far as uh electricity rates are concerned uh uhm uh there is a lot of hope that 's being pinned on on the omnibus power bill because it hopes to be able to institute certain reforms and restructuring in that industry  yes  uh uhm so that you could enable a more transparent uh and market driven pricing for your cost of electricity  uh uhm  as i 've mentioned uh napocor currently is the major supplier  with with with the uh deregulation bill which seeks to privatize break up and privatize uh napocor 's generating assets into several competing companies  uh uhm  uh uhm together with the possible uh other uh independent power producers that would compete with those uh with those uh generating companies of napocor uh should allow market forces to bring down the rates  uh uhm  uh uhm allow me mr andrada to say again or take the point of view of juan de la cruz in the in the aspect of in the matter of the oil deregulation law uh which the proponents sold or the selling point they used to to pursue this oil deregulation law was that market forces will determine prices of fuel and fuel price could be more accessible to the public because of market forces now again in this proposed power bill restructuring the country 's power sector the selling point is again being used is that prices would be more reasonable because of the play of market forces but for juan de la cruz it isn't so why can't we not have that kind of philosophy or or perspective from juan de la cruz who feels he is already a victim of that strategy used in the deliberations of the oil price dereg uh oil in industry deregulation law uh uhm well uh one is that uh there would be as contained in the omnibus bill uh draft of the lower house there would be a mandated five percent reduction in uh in uh cost of generation which will get back on to the consumers  uh uhm   uh uhm  uh uhm uh uhm uh this is a definite this is a definite five percent reduction it 's it 's not cosmetics uh uhm uh uhm the consumers will see a five percent reduction in their bill uh uhm now the second aspect is that you have a more global open uh situation under which uh under which uh power generation companies compete  uh uhm  uh uhm uh no longer is it uh relegated to a regional basis but it 's on a global basis you have u s utilities or even uh european utilities uh having very strong presence in asia because they believe there is significant amount of potential  yeah  uh uhm but they compete amongst each other and uh i think the beauty of this is that anyone and everyone who has the the ability to to uh to to think of of investing and providing the capital could actually compete in the power sector  uh uhm  uh uhm but why is it so hard for the power sector to convince the public that a deregulated a restructured power industry sector could lower power rates in the end well maybe i think it 's uh because the public has never seen uh such occur in the philippines yet 'no and even in asia 'no uh but  uh uhm   uh uhm  uh uhm but if you look at uh global trends countries that have deregulated there are countries that have deregulated uh as early as about nine or ten years ago and some only as recent as about two or three years ago uh the end result has always been uh substantial real savings for the consumers uh uhm uh uhm   uh uhm uh uhm  uh uhm uh uhm in fact uh some countries now uh their consumers are saying i have so much electricity at a cheap price i don't know what to do with it uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh so we hope that kind of a trend would actually translate and transpose itself in the philippines when when uh the industry gets deregulated on the generating side currently meralco has almost one and a half million subscribers in its franchise areas in the in the cities and provinces that we have mentioned laguna quezon batangas nineteen towns in pampanga metro manila bulacan rizal and cavite well uh three and a half  three and a half   three and a half million consumers three and a half uh-huh yeah three and a half million consumers right now in the next five years the economy is expected to grow to grow by an average of five point eight percent how much would this kind of factors affect the viability of meralco in the next five years uh what kind of pressure would this put on meralco operations in terms of rates in terms of its expansion projects its distribution and maintenance  uh uhm  well uh meralco would have even without looking at an expanded market uh uhm uh uhm uh meralco normally has to spend approximately three billion pesos a year in capital expenditure programs just to maintain the system  uh uhm   uh-huh  okay because uh well the normal wear and tear it 's an outside uh plant it 's an outside system exposed to the elements there is normal wear and tear  yeah  uh-huh uh-huh and that means constant replacements and upgrades uh uhm uh uhm uh besides uh most of our a significant component of our transformers and circuit breakers are already over thirty-one years old thirty-one years old
Philippines	and welcome back to the philippine times  joining us on the floor this morning acting defense secretary eduardo ermita secretary good morning thanks for joining us today uh good morning karmina good morning dan good morning sir   okay government has already sent uh two envoys to the netherlands that 's uh agrarian reform secretary hernani braganza and former justice secretary silvestre bello to talk with founding c p p a chairman jose maria sison do we have any news from the two envoys well uh you know actually the trip of uh chairman uh of the panel atty silvestre bello uh was done uh after a uh i understand a conversation over the phone with joma sison immediately after joma sison in the netherlands found out that the uh atty silvestre bello had been designated officially  uh uhm  uh uhm he was asked that maybe you can come over so that we can talk of how to get started 1 word  so you see that as an indication that uh things might just go well because uh jose maria sison liked the appointment of secretary bello as the head of the panel indeed karmina as a matter of fact yesterday we got a copy of the uh official press statement made by joma sison in the netherlands among others reiterating his congratulations uh to president gloria macapagal-arroyo for having adopted this 2 words policy of uh constructive peace process against the war policy of the past administration and he he specifically mentioned in his press statement that he welcomed the designation of atty silvestre bello and for that matter including secretary nani braganza because uh they uh he knows that these people have correct credentials and uh correct competence to be able to deal with the issues at hand  right   uh-huh   uh uhm  okay so with these positive developments that are happening now as far as uh moving back to the uh negotiating table uh when are we going to see uh these gentlemen sit down again and talk peace there are uh reports coming out that joe maria sison is actually waiting first for the number of political prisoners that would be released is this going to be an all or nothing thing or maybe say half and then we 'll talk what is the situation in this area let 's just say uh dan that uh the matter of uh the issue of the release of the so-called political prisoners uh are activities that will 3 words of the panel in the effort to restart or resume the uh talks  uh uhm  uh uhm in the next few days hopefully within a day or two we hope to be able to get news from uh secretary former secretary bello because i understand he 's coming back he 's not staying very long uh uhm the important thing is he should be able to set the tone of the uh agenda and set the uh timetable and find out from the n d f when the group of fr jalandoni who was designated chair of the n d f negotiators will be coming to the philippines to be able to start the talks here in the philippines so we will really be uh looking forward to this uh report when he comes back  uh uhm   yes uh we are confident that uh we 'll be getting a positive uh report from uh bebot bello  uhm  okay so secretary we are not looking at a quota here as far as the the political prisoners to be released are concerned not necessarily uh they claim that there are more than two hundred but since the time of former president ramos there have been uh so-called or alleged political offenders who have been released now uh as i said the administration of president gloria macapagal-arroyo did what it 's doing not because it is the demand of the other side but because uh we feel that by doing so we 'll be able to uh prepare the ground uh conducive to the resumption of talks early into her administration the president uh stressed that she would like for jose maria sison to come home is this part of the exploratory talks now going on between former secretary bello and secretary braganza uh yes it 's very possible as a matter of fact even about a week or so ago i already mentioned that uh should the chairman uh choose to come home he is welcome as a matter of fact we are going to do our part by uh implementing the so-called joint agreement on safety and uh immunity guarantees jasig which had been agreed upon before  so with the current atmosphere i am very confident that uh the leadership of the n d f will consider coming home so that we could talk about the problems besetting our people here in our country uh uhm sir in another uh front as far as negotiations are concerned it seems that now with the c p p n p a there 's uh again the the light at the end of the tunnel is getting bigger and bigger for all of us uh what is now happening on the other side of the fence here in the philippines with the m i l f well uh we also have very positive signs uh dan  uh uhm  uh about a week ago we received a letter coming from uh atty jilalan ali one of the uh negotiators of the m i l f who mentioned that uh chairman hashim salamat of the moro islamic liberation front also welcomed the uh uh new policy adopted by president gloria macapagal-arroyo  uh uhm  uh uhm and the m i l f leadership also welcomed the moves such as the suspension of defensive military operations against the m i l f the move right now of the president of having created an inter-agency committee for mindanao that will attend to the relief and rehabilitation of work especially on the return of evacuees to their uh places of uh original uh residence  uh uhm  right and at the same time welcomed the move that uh you read in the papers that the uh government had already withdrawn even the warrant of arrest that was issued before by uh by the former chief p n p on uh chairman salamat muhrad jafar and other members or leadership of the m i l f in connection with the uh coming chief p n p  uh uhm  that 's right so uh these are all uh very nice uh confidence-building measures  uh uhm   that we hope would be responded to by the m i l f by announcing the membership of their panel that will talk to the government panel  uh uhm  now uhm in a recent interview that we had with atty ed kabalu the spokesperson of uh the m i l f they he was saying that uh to that date when we were talking to him there was still no uh black and white uh information coming from the g r p or the government regarding these uh conditions to set uh the meeting once again uh have we already forwarded uh something in black and white yes we did uh uh uhm you recall about a week ago i mentioned the letter of uh from atty jilalan ali uh that was in response to the letter in black and white sent by uh chairman jess dureza chair of our panel dated february fifteen apparently uh their so-called spokesman ed kabalu didn't know this but there was already an invitation sent by uh jess dureza so we are uh we know that uh they already know the official position taken by government to be able to resume the talks  uh uhm   i see   okay  okay i think it was in the same conversation that we had with spokesperson kabalu that he said that he was kind of disappointed because of what the president said about that particular issue of the return of territory to the m i l f he said that uhm once we go uh and meet again on the negotiating table that there should be no pre-conditions set and then uh the president came out on national t v and said that uh she is sad to say uh she is saddened by the fact that there will be no return of territory to the m i l f has that particular stand been compromised already well it 's possible that that was the decision or statement taken by uh mr ed kabalu at that time uh uhm uh uhm but as i said the last letter uh the much later uh communication we got from the other camp was that they welcomed the words of president macapagal-arroyo especially when the suspension of the military operations was announced and that uh hand in hand with the negotiation is the rehabilitation and development effort  so uh we are saying that we hope that uh while government is doing everything to prepare the ground conducive to a good resumption of peace peace talks we hope that uh the m i l f will already uh compose their panel and our panel and their panel could talk of those things including the agenda items as well as the timetable that they should follow to be able to move forward in this process  uh uhm   uh uhm  okay mentio you mentioned uh the word timetable there uhm do you do are we following anything as far as break breakthroughs uhm are concerned because we very well know that the may elections is coming up and this might just be one of the campaign issues uhm in the on the campaign trail well you know karmina uh our chairman jess dureza is in mindanao and uh as a matter of fact is in constant contact with the other side and that 's why i said that uh if the other side m i l f had to form or could form their panel then uh on the ground that they 'll be able to discuss exactly when they should start but the timetable for words has started because of all these initiatives taken unilaterally by the government and i hope that the other side will respond accordingly okay sir i just want to clarify if in the letter of atty jilalan ali did they still uh mention the fact that they would want the negotiations to happen outside the country uh there was no such mention  uh uhm   but you know dan uh i think that was what they were saying before uh uhm but the question i 'm gonna ask is supposing uh that is under consideration what country do you think or has there been any country uh member of the o i c that has volunteered to say yes we are welcome to uh such a suggestion uh unlike in our negotiations with the talks with the m n l f in the nineteen ninety-four to nineteen ninety-six you will recall that the m n l f being a word observer status in the o i c uh was handled in such a way that uh a committee of six headed by uh indonesia became the uh chair of the negotiations the talks of which were held in jakarta  uh uhm   uh uhm   that 's right   uh uhm  uh uhm and that was a voluntary act on the part of indonesia to uh allow themselves be the venue and play the host not clear, could also be pay the cost  uh uhm that 's right   so the question we have to ask will be number one i think the m i l f is not uh officially recognized by the o i c like the recognition of islamic m n l f   m n l f they are looked upon as one entity number two there is no volunteer uh on the part of the other members of the o i c member countries composed of seven this time which includes brunei uh uhm to present themselves as the venue to present themselves as the venue uh uhm so i think it 's just something that the m n m i l f at that time was hoping would happen uh uhm but uh we must still understand that our neighboring countries have their own problems uh uhm that 's right and we are not sure whether they are just about ready to extend an invitation it 's just like you and i 're talking and suddenly we would we would like to uh uh thresh out our problems and we say let 's go to the house of karmina when she has not extended us an invitation  uh uhm  yeah and she may not even serve us breakfast huh chuckle  okay secretary yes or no on this particular question are you going to allow the talks between uh the g r p and the n d f this time to be held at another country well again actually that 's something that uh we hope uh atty bello will be able to thresh out during his personal conversation probably that thing would have happened already yesterday uh uhm and uh i 'm sure when atty bello returns he will tell us what will be how the disposition of the n d f might be on this particular matter okay and when are the two envoys expected to come home well uh i was told that uh they 're supposed to be there only about three days okay
Philippines	mr speaker mr speaker can i uh ask for a one-minute suspension to allow the technical staff of the committee to uh occupy their places at the sponsor 's table  uh what  permission of the house is sought uh to allow the members of the technical staff of the committee to uh enter the floor and uh take uh their their seats uh behind the uh lectern if there is no objection uh permission is granted and session is suspended  the parliamentary status of the measure is the period of sponsorship particularly interpellation may i ask that uh the chairman of the ways and means uh the honorable hernando perez be recognized to continue sponsorship of the measure the chair recognizes the honorable hernando perez chairman of the committee on ways and means who will continue sponsorship of the measure mr speaker may i ask that the gentleman from antique the honorable exequiel javier be recognized to interpellate the sponsor  the chair recognizes the gentleman from antique what 's the pleasure of the gentleman from antique uh mr speaker uh may i be allowed to field some uh  clarificato clarificatory questions to the sponsor   the sponsor may yield if he so desires uh yes mr speaker thank you mr speaker uh mr speaker uh i 'm in support of this bill but uh on uh a qualified basis mr speaker  i 'm also a member of the uh ways and means committee now my question is uh your honor uh will this uh increased rate be a permanent fixture in our national internal revenue code does the gentleman refer to the the proposed increase in the excise tax on all the items enumerated in the bill uh yes your honor yes, your honor there is no proviso here that states otherwise   uh in other words your honor uh this uh increased rate will forever be in the internal revenue code  mr speaker uh this bill uh represents what i think is uh a uh measure imposing uh the so-called sin taxes  this is true because sloth mr speaker is one of the cardinal sins  sloth in ordinary parlance is laziness this bill represents the lazy government that we have mr speaker because uh these taxes on sin products mr speaker are the easiest source of revenue for government every time the government suffers a deficit every time it needs money it looks at these products petroleum products beer liquor and cigarettes as the source of revenue since the taxes are collected at the place of production  so when government needs immediate cash they resort to these so-called taxes on sin products  we cannot forever allow this government to keep on imposing taxes at the same time the government does not do anything about inefficiency in the collection of taxes in looking for ways and means of finding other sources of revenue to defray the cost of government mr speaker so your honor we plead you to be agreeable to put a sunset clause on this bill that it only be imposed for two years  uh your honor uh this is not yet the appropriate time to consider uh the amendments and therefore during the period of amendments the subject could very well be discussed but i would want to point out uh your honor that uh there had been occasions also in the past when taxes on these items were reduced by the government and in fact it was reduced pursuant to uh executive order number nine four seven and further reduced later pursuant to p d nineteen sixty-nine so the point your honor is while the law that is being amended seems to be permanent in nature your honor because there is no sunset clause it is however a fact that from time to time the government amends  whenever there is no further need for this and in fact the government has indeed amended by reducing the taxes in the past  uh mr speaker uh this uh probably in the history of the national internal revenue code the taxes on so-called sin products have been the most dynamic  year in and year out they have been increased simply because the government is lazy to improve its rec collection system and to look for ways of uh looking for alternative sources of revenue and to cut the burgeoning uh bureaucracy  my point uh your honor is let 's deliver a message to the government that at least it must put its house in order at least in terms of raising revenues they cannot forever come to us in this chamber and impose taxes which heat which hit both the both the poor and the rich  these are the taxes which cut across all sectors of society because these are the taxes which are shifted to the consumers  when you buy beer the company does not pay the tax it 's the beer drinker who pays the tax  when uh you smoke a cigarette it is not the government which pay the tax because it is not the company which pays the tax it is the small  word who pay the tax and usually it is the poor people who want to drink for example uh rum or smoke uhm locally manufactured cigarettes cheap local cigarettes who are hit by this kind of taxes  so let 's teach at least this government a lesson to improve its taxes collection system and as the speaker said let 's cut or trim down the budget of the government by uh removing uh the excess fat  that 's one way of uh keeping the government within its means  instead of raising taxes which impose a heavy burden on our people  so mr speaker if the uh the uh sponsor of uh or uhm uh our honorable chairman would agree just to deliver a message to the government why don't we just put a limit a timeframe for these increased taxes by nineteen ninety-two these increased taxes should be  should have a sunset clause after nineteen ninety-two then we go back to the reduced the existing rates uh mr speaker the committee on ways and means of which the gentleman is a member has been doing its best to compel the government to improve its collection  and the fact remains mr speaker that during the deliberation of this bill the gentleman never spoke against it  so it came as a surprise for a vice-chairman of the committee on ways and means would now be talking about all those things when he kept quiet all this time during the deliberation by the committee mr speaker i want to point out that under the rule a member who voted in favor of a measure has no business talking about or against that certain measure mr speaker what i 'm trying to deliver was is to deliver a message to the government that we cannot keep on uhm imposing taxes what i 'm suggesting is let 's deliver a message by putting a timeframe to the effectivity of these increased taxes no your honor i will not accept that  this is uh   this is not the period of amendment mr speaker  just giving the  with the permission of the gentlemen on the floor the session is suspended break in recording  session is resumed  mr speaker uh pursuant to section twenty-nine of uh the house rules i have filed my written objection to this bill with the secretary so it cannot be said that uh as a member of this of the committee on ways and means i did not uh stand up and interpellate and mr speaker it 's not true that i 'm here to grandstand  what i 'm here is to deliver to the government that we cannot go on relying on taxes  uh the government should also impose uh put its house in order that 's all mr speaker  uh mr speaker as chairman of the committee i 'm not aware of the written objection cited by the gentleman but the fact remains that he participated actively in drafting these provisions and in fact i do remember that he was the one who called me in the office of commissioner ong to do the finishing touches on all of these provisions  so your honor as vice chairman of the committee he has to fulfill his duty  and as i 've said i 'm not aware of such written objection  and this committee report does not state such reservation  mr speaker words  yes yes the uh gentleman from the first district of the province of cebu the honorable antonio bacaltos be recognized to interpellate the sponsor may i be allowed to   any member any member can stand up and seek recognition of the chair without having to clear with the majority leader should the any member wish to interpellate the chair recognizes the gentleman from cebu and the sponsor may yield if he so desires  thank you mr speaker  the gentleman from cebu has sought uh permission of the sponsor to interpellate and the sponsor may yield if he so desires  yes your honor go ahead mr speaker your honor may i be allowed to ask whether there is any difference or distinction between the word  ad valorem tax and excise tax ad valorem  tax and excise tax is there any distinction between the two  excise tax your honor is a term that is used on specific items uh it is a kind of tax your honor the ad valorem your honor is based on value value now may i please refer your honor mr speaker to the provision of  one one eight four six two letter d found on the fourth page of the bill now what really is the intent of the committee insofar as the word  ad valorem tax of of sixty-five percent open parenthesis sixty-five percent close parenthesis of the  importers' wholesale price and fifty-five percent open parenthesis figure fifty-five percent close parenthesis beginning july one nineteen ninety  is this not to be understood that there is a reduction of the  ad valorem tax july one nineteen ninety in other words from sixty-five it has to be reduced to fifty-five percent that is correct your honor and this is pursuant to a commitment made by the government uh pursuant to the general agreement on tariffs and trade uh with a syncronym uh acronym rather gatt this is one of the gatt provisions uh there is uh does it have to be understood therefore that uh instead of increasing it has to be reduced because what i understand in the caption of this bill is that  and it reads as follows an act increasing the ad valorem  tax on fermented liquors uh an act increasing the excise tax on distilled spirits wines fermented liquor and cigarettes amending for the purpose section one thirty-eight one thirty-nine one hundred forty and one hundred forty-two open parenthesis c close parenthesis and open parenthesis d close parenthesis of the national internal revenue code as amended am i therefore wrong in my por perception that this would amount to a reduction instead of an increase so that the government will profit by way of increasing tax on imported cigarettes the gentleman is correct your honor and perhaps at the appropriate time the title of the bill may be amended but the point here mr speaker is that uh the government does not collect anything on imported cigarettes because nobody pays taxes on imported cigarettes and the reduction your honor is to make the imported cigarettes at par with locally manufactured cigarettes bearing a foreign brand which will be also fifty-five percent and this as i have said your honor is one of the commitments made by the government uh pursuant to the uh general agreement on tariffs and trade so the subsequent question will be in this manner uh do you think it would be proper to incorporate this provision relating to letter d of uh section one hundred forty-two considering that what is within the contemplation as explained by your honor mr speaker is that it has to be reduced or was it because is it because of the reduction contemplated in letter d that there was sort of a conformity on the part of the distinguished author that at the time of amendment such an amendment might uh come in for introduction  your honor perhaps what could be done is to amend the title of the bill because your honor what we are doing really is shooting two birds our government made a commitment to uh other countries and uh according to other countries pursuant to the discussion made by our government our government cannot use should not use internal taxes to protect domestically proda uh produced products which are of the same kind as the one being exported to us 
Philippines	on behalf of the committee on rules and considering house bill number three one four four eight has been certified as urgent by the president i move uh that we now consider on second reading house bill number three one four four eight as reported out by the committee on appropriations copies of which has been previously distributed to the members  there 's no objection the sec secretary will read the title of the bill and uh the sponsor of the measure can uh take the floor house bill number three one four four eight entitled an act appropriating the sum of ten billion pesos for aid relief and rehabilitation services for certain areas and for the repair and construction of permanent structures affected by the earthquake of july sixteen nineteen ninety  the chair uh recognizes the distinguished chairman of the committee on appropriations the honorable uh rolando andaya honorable andaya chairman of the committee on appropriations  thank you mr speaker  mr speaker my distinguished colleagues ladies and gentlemen i will speak very briefly mr speaker and my dear colleagues because uh this measure uh is uh of utmost urgency this bill house bill number three one four four eight which was certified as urgent by the president of the philippines in her communication to the speaker dated july twenty-one nineteen ninety seeks to appropriate ten billion pesos for aid relief and rehabilitation services to people and areas and for the repair and reconstruction of government infrastructures affected by the strong temblor that struck the philippines very recently  the temblor that shook luzon island in the afternoon of july sixteen nineteen ninety recorded recorded at seven point seven on the richter 's scale is one of the strongest and most destructive in our history mr speaker only two days after the quake five hundred twenty-eight were reported dead one thousand one hundred twenty-three injured and over one thousand persons still trapped in buildings while fifteen thousand six hundred forty-six families were reported to have been left homeless with the destruction of one thousand seven hundred eighty-five houses the damage to highways and bridges water systems power lines hospitals and school buildings and other public infrastructures run into billions of pesos because of the massive devastation mr speaker president corazon c aquino issued proclamation number six thirteen declaring several cities and provinces under state of calamity while significant government efforts have been done to alleviate the suffering of the people affected by this calamity a supplemental budget is necessary to speed up the process of rehabilitation for the families of the victims and the reconstruction of the affected areas hence mr speaker this urgent bill for our favorable consideration and immediate approval thank you mr speaker mr speaker please mr speaker what 's the pleasure of the gentleman from agusan del sur agusan del norte mr speaker agusan del norte uh may the distinguished sponsor yield to some clarificatory questions the gentleman may yield if he if he so desires very willingly mr speaker number one mr speaker i do not wish to be misunderstood that i am against this bill but this must be asked necessarily in order that this bill may really respond to the desired aims so mr speaker the first question i would like to ask is in the light of my experience every bill of this kind is always subjected to the objection anchored on our cons the constitutional provision that special appropriations must always be accompanied by a certificate from the national treasurer on the availability of funds or in the absence thereof that it must have a revenue measure accompanying such bill to support the funds desired now in this particular bill uh i i do not see these things despite the urgency mr uh speaker the point is well taken mr speaker indeed the constitution provides that a supplemental appropriation of this nature should be accompanied by a revenue measure out of which funds can be generated or certificate of availability of funds issued by the national treasurer we have your honor the corresponding certificate of availability of funds for this purpose in fact we have here inside this hall uh the national treasurer herself ms uh rose cajucom who issued the certificate of availability of funds to support this house bill three one four four eight well uh i asked this mr speaker because i do not like that our rhetorics will not be accompanied by the necessary heroics because i was so told and it was printed in the papers that we are running a deficit of approximately eleven or seventeen billion if we are running a deficit that much then there is a problem about availability of funds but anyway i 'll not dispute this anyway if mr cajucom uh ms cajucom is already here and you know in visayan =language cajucom is judgment and if she wears that family name as a judgment uh that there is i have no right to dispute mr speaker that was only for clarification thank you mr speaker  ms cajucom  thank you  mr speaker mr speaker the gentleman from uh bukidnon will the gentleman the honorable sponsor yield to a few questions mr speaker  the gentleman may yield if he so desires willingly mr speaker your honor this is only a follow-up uh question of the honorable gentleman from agusan mr speaker we have no objections if there is availability of funds but we would like only to know mr speaker where will this availability of funds be coming from because we have also commitments to our constituents where we are willing to sacrifice for as long as we are advised so that our own constituents will not be hoping for this to come while we are transferring it to the affected areas we just want to know this mr speaker because uh it will be very difficult if my constituents in my district mr speaker are expecting all the fundings already appropriated for and approved under this appropriations act of nineteen ninety and then the money will come from there it is alright with us but i will make the announcement that we will have to sacrifice we will not expect anything this year because we 're giving it to our brothers in the north who have been affected we would like to know this mr speaker rather than having our constituents hoping for this and never come again mr speaker and we will be blamed for it uhm that 's a good point mr speaker but uh i would like to call the attention of the distinguished gentleman from bukidnon that precisely section one of the bill provides that it shall be from funds in the national treasury not otherwise appropriated  because if we do not put that phraseology of funds not otherwise appropriated i share the concern of the distinguished gentleman from bukidnon that it 's very possible that this amount to support the ten billion would be taken from the funds already appropriated including those for the projects in bukidnon  so  so we are made to understand that mr speaker that the ten billion already certified by the national treasury will not affect any approved appropriated funds for nineteen ninety to my thinking your honor this should not affect adversely so this money will come from other sources that may be from savings or other incomes of the government   yes your honor yes  thank you your honor thank you mr speaker mr speaker the gentleman from bohol thank you mr speaker will the sponsor yield to a few questions the sponsor may yield mr speaker there are two gentlemen from bohol now on the floor may i please know which uh gentleman is being recognized the gentleman from the opposition uh may i have the reservation that after the gentleman from the opposition from bohol will be through with the interpellation that this representation be accorded the same privilege the other gentleman from bohol may seek recognition after uh the gen uh the gentleman from the opposition in bohol shall have uh finished with his interpellation  thank you  thank you mr speaker may we know from the sponsor as to whether there is such a thing as funds in the national treasury not already appropriated well actually we have funds in the treasury we have funds in the different government owned or controlled banks we even have funds in the uhm central bank  but you see i would like to explain this your honor that uh this ten billion will not be spent in one sweep  we are just giving the authority to the executive to incur obligations and disburse later on because even if we have the money in the world even if we have money in the bodegas without this appropriation measure that centavo or that money cannot be spent so this is some kind of a standby appropriation what we need is the authority from congress in order to enable the executive branch to attend to the victims of the earthquake and to reconstruct or rehabilitate the affected affected infrastructures of government does it mean mr speaker that we do not know as of the present whether we have this ten billion pesos available from the funds in the national treasury well uh according to the treasurer of the philippines the funds will be made avo available  and then uh if you ask me the possible sources well we have just passed the sin taxes  it should generate three point four billion remember the sin taxes were supposed to be for the veterans but the amount for veterans would amount only to mga about one point seven and then per report of the finance secretary we had increased collection at least for the first quarter of two hundred fif forty million pesos but uh it is very possible that bonds will be circulated reconstruction bonds would be sold to institutional investors reconstruction bonds because we have money for example in insurance companies they have plenty of money they would like to have investments we have retirement funds we have commercial funds these can be invested in bonds and uh we have we can float bonds for the overseas workers because we have do dollar deposits of overseas workers in the f c d u foreign currency deposit units of the different banks here in the philippines these dollar deposits may be used to purchase these uh dollar bonds and uh it is very possible if we are short of funds it is very possible we have friends countries we have reconstruction bonds a d b world bank at very very concessional rates to reconstruct but in the meantime because it takes time to do all those things these banks would uh want to be presented feasibility studies what are these projects to be undertaken the costing it will take time but congress should give the authority to the executive branch to implement all these things to alleviate the sufferings of the victims and to reconstruct the damage thank you mr speaker   and uh if it is possible if our creditors would be too sympathetic i just filed a a resolution that perhaps we should be given suspension of payments for a period of two years because mr speaker it is not only the increased expenditure of ten billion this is a double kill it is very possible there is going to be reduced income there will be increased expenditure and at the same time reduced income there are mining companies that have been devastated by this earthquake real estate taxes will suffer the taxes that were paid before by commercial establishments would not be paid perhaps even income taxes would suffer but in the meantime that we have the money after all as certified we now should give this authority so that congress shows its concern that in the midst of this devastation congress is in a position to act immediately
Philippines	the chairman of the committee is recognized to continue to sponsor the bill uh mr speaker uh the the uh third uh sponsorship speech uh having been delivered by the lady from pasay the joint committee uh manifests that uh uh there are no more sponsorship speeches and that we move to uh uh the committee is ready for interpellations  there being no interpellator the majority floor leader   mr speaker there being words   mr speaker   the gentleman from the first district of sorsogon is recognized thank you mr speaker will the distinguished uh sponsor yield to a few questions mr speaker uh most certainly uh mr speaker and with great pleasure knowing that the expi experience of the gentleman from sorsogon will uh enhance uh the bill being discussed thank you your honor  your honor this representation is in accord with the committee and the sponsors of this uh piece of legislation but at the same time this representation entertains a lot of doubt whether the creation of a council will really serve the purposes or the interest of the small and medium-scale entrepreneurs the reason being it is a standard impression that is getting to be a joke in the bureaucracy that if you want something to fail you refer it either to a committee or to a council in fact the number one or what i would say an exhibit a of a council that is not effective at all is the national security council that has never been convened for the past four to five years and so your honor my first question is that rather than creating a council did the committee study the possibility of just simply strengthening giving all of these functions to the still existing bureau of small and medium-scale office uh that was actually uh considered by uh the joint committee uh mr speaker but in reply to the query of uh the gentleman from sorsogon the matter of coordinating the various efforts of the various agencies was also brought to fore  uh the joint committees uh determined that the mere fortification of the functions of one body would not be sufficient because the solution lies in a uh complete approach which would involve several agencies of the government that have uh uh something to do with the promotion of small and medium enterprises and uh a full coordination of these uh functions uh belonging to these bodies was uh considered as uh essential together with of course the specification of definite directions which are laid down in the proposed bill thank you your honor does it mean therefore your honor that for us to expect the various departments to have coordinated policies to have coordinated actions there is always a need to include the various departments in a particular cluster and therefore compose a council meaning it is not feasible your honor for these various departments to make coordination an inherent character considering that anyway these cabinet members are coordinated by the office of the president uh mr speaker it is not only uh the uh department or cabinet secretaries who are presently involved in the uh uh development of uh small and medium industries there are sub-cabinet uh offices and agencies which are involved as a matter of fact there are something like thirty agencies uh which have something to do with small and medium enterprises now to the question of the gentleman from sorsogon uh it is not essential to include all thirty but only the more relevant and more important agencies with the important functions thank you your honor  your honor a commendable feature of this particular council is the fact that the chairman will be selected appointed by the president from amongst the representatives of the private sector may the distinguished sponsor give us if any examples of present government councils headed by a private sector representative as a chairman so that we could have an impression as to whether such an arrangement indeed is workable i can think of only one uh uh although there might be others but at the moment i can come up with only one example which is the uh uh p a p or the philippine assistance program  thank you your honor at least uh before the chairman resigned that particular agency was performing i would say above uh average and if i if i may add uh mr chairman it is still performing above average which only goes to show that uh this particular uh council i e the p a p uh is uh functioning not because of a particular personality but because of the structure and the members included therein i wish indeed that uh such uh was the case mr chairman mr speaker your honor i don't see any budgetary appropriation for this council uh we we have this uh   do we expect this council to be effective without any budgetary uh appropriation well there is uh mr uh speaker a uh section namely section seven which designates the bureau of small and medium enterprise development as the council secretariat since that particular agency has its own budget then uh the joint committee felt that uh the budget for the operate operating uh ope operations of this particular council could be drawn from uh said uh uh agency  may we know your honor what uh is the present budget of this particular office in our uh appropriations act for nineteen ninety-nine nineteen ninety i i do not have the exact figure but uh i 'm sure the uh general appropriations act for nineteen ninety would uh easily give that information i hope your honor it is significant enough to be able to finance the additional functions to be given to that uh office  another   actually actually mr speaker while uh the bureau of small and medium enterprise development will be the council secretariat the uh coordination which will be done among the various agencies which i mentioned before would also involve said agencies and therefore uh in a way would also involve part of their part of their uh budgets thank you your honor your honor for the information of the members of the chamber may we know how this particular bill would jibe with an earlier piece of legislation the house already approved this representation is referring to the plaza bill from agusan on uh the overall economic umbrella on organization a bill which has been pending in the senate for almost two to three months  uh mr speaker uh in order for this representation to uh uh fully uh answer the query of the gentleman from sorso from sorsogon may i request for a one-minute suspension session suspended break in the recording  session resumed mr speaker the bill of uh honorable d o plaza makes or provides for a business information center meaning uh the thrust uh is uh focused on the dissemination of business information however the bill in question or uh the bill under consideration is not confined to the dissemination of business information because uh the bill encompasses uh the development of technology the uh facilitation of credit and the development of markets so uh if this representation will be allowed to capsulize the difference while the bill of honorable d o plaza is specialized focusing on one particular activity the bill under consideration uh has for its uh objective uh the performance of several functions thank you uh your honor my final uh question uh your honor or maybe an observation is that insofar as councils wherein various secretaries or heads of departments are represented are involved the common experience of this representation is that invariably these various heads of departments would send their representatives good enough if they would send their immediate deputy or undersecretary but considering that the secretary of trade and industry most especially i understand he sits in as many as nineteen or twenty board offices i doubt very much really mr speaker your honor whether the good secretary of trade and industry the secretary of agriculture secretary of labor and employment would have the time to sit in this council so i hope the sponsors would consider the possibility of having as members of the council sub-cabinet personalities who will indeed represent their various departments in practically full-time capab uh capacity we uh concur with the observation of the gentleman from sorsogon that uh in most uh councils and or committees where department secretaries are ex-officio members or are members by reason of their position most of the uh members send subalterns who are invariably well or almost invariably unfamiliar with the uh uh task involved and worse uh no continuity uh is uh observed in other words uh a particular department secretary would send for one week uh subaltern a and then for the second week subaltern b and for the third week subaltern c uh there is no continuity of effort and uh as a result the work of the council and or the committee is uh jeopardized we are amenable to uh an amendment as a matter of fact the committee uh is even offering to present that as one of the committee amendments to uh stipulate in the bill that uh a specific undersecretary for example uh shall be uh uh the only acceptable uh substitute or representative of the member who might be in uh who might be unable to attend thank you your honor thank you mr speaker mr speaker yes what is the pleasure of the gentleman from quezon uhm will the uh honorable sponsor the chairman on the committee on trade and industry yield to some questions your honor uh with uh pleasure mr speaker to the gentleman from quezon who has uh uh incorporated in his uh political philosophy the assistance to small uh uh to small uh business uh concerns in our country thank you your honor uh i suppose uh that in uh the drafting of this proposed measure the committee was uh also guided by the experience of uh south korea and taiwan am i correct your honor uh to a certain uh and substantial extent yes mr speaker and uh i understand that these economies before they uh engaged in full industrialization uh took off from small and medium-scale enterprises your honor uh that is correct mr speaker and uh we uh we would like to uh learn from the lessons uh from successful lessons uh of our neighbors and and these economies were able to do that by uh imposing more commitment and better coordination among uh the government agencies in small and uh medium-scale uh enterprises in their countries am i correct your honor uh that is uh very accurate mr speaker i am asking these questions your honor uh uh because i would like to know what government agencies are presently involved in the promotion of small and medium-scale enterprises in this country well uh mr speaker uh definitely the department of trade and industry is involved in a big way the uh the department of agriculture is likewise uh very concerned with uh small and medium enterprises especially uh those uh in the agricultural or agro-industrial field the secretary of labor and employment uh since uh its vision is to provide employment and it looks at small and medium enterprises as a rich source of uh uh generating employment the uh secretary of finance because it is the fund generator of the government uh the uh national economic and development authority because uh insofar as uh high policy or top policy matters are concerned it can be deemed as the coordinator uh among others uh mr speaker i understand your honor that presently the the efforts of the departments of trade agriculture labor finance neda uhm towards uh promoting small and uh medium scale enterprises are not uh adequately coordinated at present that 's why there is need uh for us to come up with a measure such as the measure under consideration am i correct your honor that is correct mr speaker because aside from uh the small and medium enterprises uh matters uh these agencies and the others who are involved in small and medium enterprises also have to attend to a myriad of uh other activities and the reason for uh the creation of the council is to ensure that within that milieu the concentration of their coordination will be towards small and medium enterprises and i suppose that uh the council proposes to effect uh better coordination and integration uh through its authority in the promulgation of guidelines programs and operating principles which i take it will uh be implemented by the other government agencies tasked with uh the promotion of small-scale and uh medium-scale enter enterprises your honor uh that is correct mr speaker uh because aside from the fact that the proposed bill provides for the composition of the council it also provides certain legislative standards that the uh council must follow and uh uh it is the these legislative standards can be compared to an outline or to a framework and it will it will be the uh duty of the council to supply the details so that uh by means of uh guidelines programs operating principles uh common to all government agencies implementing the promotion the government policy on the implementation of uh small and medium scale industries we would be able to avoid uh overlapping of functions duplication and even confusion am i correct your honor uh that is uh correct more uh more more uh importantly the last mainly confusion and i think that we should adopt this measure thank you your honor and thank you also uh to the gentleman from uh quezon
Philippines	mr speaker  what is the pleasure of the gentleman from isabela   will the gentleman yield to a few questions he still has the floor if he wishes to yield willingly mr speaker uh thank you mr speaker this uh insurgency problem has been the problem that has been confronting us for the past uh two decades  and uh i believe that uh the present uh insurgents uh the so called n p a c p c p a no n p a c p c p p uh are the offshoots of uh the hukbalahap movement uh which uh rose after the second world war and uh since then up to the present this has been the problem of uh our government uh do you think your honor that uh the bills that you have mentioned and uh which are still pending in the house would help in the solution of uh this problem i believe so mr speaker your honor because uh the three bills i filed deals with the uh the surrenderees which will encourage them to surrender to the fold of the law because they are given incentives and they are uh they are given amnesty aside from the amnesty they will be given livelihood projects that will uh propel them towards economic uh stability economic uh development so that there will be no more reason for them to be staying in the hills which is a life of hardship uh being uh hunted forever by uh our military uh thank you your honor and uh i am one who had uh some uh lengthy talks with uh surrenderees n p a surrenderees in my province in isabela and the the reasons why they joined the movement or the insurgencts are uh varied  some uh say that uh they were uh just invited to attend a seminar or a so-called meeting and uh after that they were uh not allowed to get back to their homes anymore some are uh there because they are uh lazy to work on their farms  instead of uh working in the farms they prefer to join the movement because it is an easier life for them although they would uh reside or stay in the forests  and uh some are uh are what we call uh ideologues or the those who are uh in the movement because uh of a desire to fight this democratic form of government your honor would these uh three bills which you filed uh covers these uh matters which i have uh presented yes uh mr speaker your honor these three bills will really cover the the varied reasons why there are so many uh being attracted to the n p a c p p side  but i think uh although you have mentioned some of the reasons why they are uh joining the n p a the c p p i believe however that the main reason is really uh economic uh difficulties being encountered by these people you know it is uh it is uh better for them to join the n p a because at least they are provided with food they are provided with what they need uh for their daily livelihood and they don't have uh the problem of uh trying to find this uh daily living uh uh things that they need in their uh daily life so that by joining the c p p n p a they are uh provided with their uh livelihood so if the government will try to to give them amnesty and uh at the same time after they have surrendered they are given the proper uh incentives like uh livelihood programs which we can very well afford i think uh there will be no more reason no more overriding reason for these people to still continue fighting the government i don't believe that uh these people are imbued with the ideologies of communism that uh they cannot uh part with it there are i wou i would say there are a very few number that are uh really dyed to the wool in their skin uh because of the ideology of communism but uh it is an exception rather than the rule so that i would say that generally speaking the n p a people now uh who have uh turned away from the government can easily be uh urged to come back to the fold of the law by giving them the proper incentives uh giving them livelihood i fully agree with the gentleman and uh i would say that uh principally there are two kinds of uh n p as or c p p the ideologues and those who have joined the movement or the insurgency because of uh economic uh necessity for those who have joined word economic necessity your honor i believe that they are more in number than the ideologues or those who believe in communism that 's true would you uh agree with me your honor i fully agree uh mr speaker your honor because i mentioned that already that uh there are uh i think the biggest number of them are due to economic hardships economic difficulties that they are encountering in uh our present uh economy in the country there are so many people who have no jobs at all so that uh they find it difficult uh to support their family that is why that is the very compelling reason why they have joined the c p p n p a because at least by joining this uh rebel unit at least they are uh assured of their daily livelihood whereas if they will continue to earn their living they cannot find jobs they will find really serious difficulties trying to support their families uh i must confess to the honorable gentleman that uh i did not have uh time to read very well the bills filed would the bill three bills uh cover incentive that would uh give uh proper uh invitation to the members who to these people who are shall we say we call uh misguided for them to come back to the folds of the law i am uh more or less certain about that mr speaker your honor because uh aside from giving them full amnesty if uh the rebels are sincere this will be of course uh through a screening committee they will be determined whether their uh surrendering is really genuine or sincere in their effort and then uh aside from giving them full amnesty uh as i mentioned already they give uh they are given economic support in the form of livelihood projects which uh is being called under house bill number two three two eight zero which is entitled an act providing full amnesty to surrenderees and economic support in the form of livelihood projects  so that coupling these all these things which are all in favor of the surrenderees i believe that there is no reason why they will not uh come back to the fold of the law there is no reason for them to stay in the hills because it 's very hard for them to be staying in the hills away from their families and uh to be roaming around being hunted by the military wherever they are uh situated uh your honor uh usually the reasons they give in rising against uh the government is because this government is a capitalist uh economy because this government is full of uh corruption and graft and the this government is not uh uh serving the people as they should be served uh do we have uh enough reasons to combat or to say answer these uh allegations or contention of these insurgents  well at least on the aspect of uh graft and corruption i would say that uh as a matter of fact i was the principal author of the bill which we passed which was uh entitled the anti-red tape bill which has already passed by which has already been passed by this house on third reading and it is uh with the conference committee with the senate as they have also passed uh a similar measure in the senate uh uh ano aside from that we have already passed also the code of ethical standards uh prescribed for government officials and employees which is a guideline for uh the government officials and employees to follow so that they will not be tempted to commit any graft and corruption so these two measures alone are uh enough if they are being uh implemented by our government to stop the graft and corruption which is uh which is rampant now in our government i nobody can deny that the rampancy of graft and corruption in our government is really real not only imaginary but real uh yes your honor i made mention of this because this has been the issue raised by the insurgents ever since uh this movement was uh there as a problem and so i was thinking there that there must be something wrong with this uh system don't you think so your honor i cannot pinpoint uh mr speaker your honor the exact cause why there are so many people being tempted to commit graft and corruption uh whereas before uh during the time of the late president marcos the corruption was only observable and uh seen in the higher echelons now it is creeping to the very lowest limit or level of our uh government offices and agencies so i would say i cannot pinpoint really what is the cause but maybe it is also due to uh economic difficulties being uh uh experienced by our government employees uh having uh only very meager salaries which are which are even below poverty line and probably this must be the reason why uh they are uh indulging in this uh graft and corruption business uh do we get it from your honor that uh graft and corruption is more rampant uh under this administration than in the previous uh one well if you consider that as more rampant when we speak that uh during the time of president marcos graft and corruption was limited to the higher echelons of government and now it is seeping to the very lowest level of uh uh government then i would say that it is even more now uh uh this graft and corruption as i said is one of the reasons why the n p a c p p insurgents are uh fighting the government do you think uh your honor that uh this graft and corruption is a necessary evil or part of this system of democratic form of government no mr speaker your honor i don't believe that this is a necessary part of our system of government as a matter of fact president aquino has been instituting uh measures uh implementing measures to fight graft and corruption i think she is uh sincere in her efforts uh against graft and corruption but it 's only that uh that i think it has already seeped into the mentality of the filipino working man especially the government employees that uh for example a certain uh individual goes to a certain office and asks for a certain document he will uh purposely delay the production or uh completion of that document in order to have some uh grease money to be ba given by the one seeking the document so that uh probably that is the reason why uh he is tempted to commit graft because of the inkling to have the money before he can accomplish anything what he thinks in his uh service is no longer a he does not consider anymore that uh a public office is a public trust but rather that a public office is a means wherein he can enrich himself that is the very reason why some of our government employees are uh indulging in this to help them economically solve their uh problems
Philippines	mr president distinguished colleagues in june students go back to school today enrolment is going on we are again faced with the challenge of tuition fees how much what amount of increases what other charges how many students may not enroll because they can no longer afford we have already mandated mr president allowable increase in republic act sixty-seven twenty-eight under certain conditions because we recognize that schools must pay increased salaries must meet rising costs must upgrade needed facilities like laboratories the issue therefore is not just increases but whether or not the conditions for increases have been observed by the proper officials as prescribed by law we submit mr president that the secretary of education has violated the law that he has disregarded the conditions for the increases of tuition fees that he has relegated unto himself certain powers vested by law in other entities relegated them unto himself previously mr president before the enactment of republic act sixty-seven twenty-eight the secretary of education had the power to prescribe school tuition fees under the education act of nineteen eighty-two as interpreted by the supreme court in the case of philippine consumers foundation versus the secretary of education one hundred and fifty three scra sixty-two in that case mr president the philippine consumers foundation sought to prohibit the secretary of decs from fixing tuition increases because the power to regulate according to them did not include the power to authorize increases and secondly they said because the parents and students concerned whose tuition fees were increases were increased were never given notice never given an opportunity to be heard and therefore they said they were denied the constitutional right of due process supreme court mr president in that case held that the power to regulate school fees at that time included the power to authorize increases citing specific provisions of the education act it 's also said that there existed no denial of due process because the authorization was for general application as when the authorization was for increases to apply to all private schools throughout the country but mr president that was yesterday today we have republic act sixty-seven twenty-eight and section ten of said law categorically states that in any proposed increases any in the private schools there must be appropriate consultations conducted by the school administration with the duly organized parent and teachers' associations and faculty associations with respect to secondary schools and for colleges with student governments with student councils alumni and factory faculty associations and in all cases audited financial statements are required the law mr president classifies schools into two categories first those charging less than one thousand five hundred pesos a year for high schools and eighty pesos per unit for colleges during the school years nineteen eighty-eight to nineteen ninety uh to nineteen eighty-nine the second category mr president refers to schools and colleges charging said amounts or more the first group of schools are still regulated but they are ye regulated no longer by the decs no longer by the secretary of the department of education insofar as tuition fees are concerned but by the state assistance council as provided by law the second group comprises schools and colleges that are deregulated they charge tuition fees higher than one thousand five hundred pesos for high school and eighty pesos or more per unit for college any increase in tuition fees should be made by the schools but always in consultation with the designated parties not by the decs or with the decs there appears mr president several violations  the first is that the state assistance council does not have a student representative does not have a teacher representative as required by law the state assistance council as organized today was established precisely to render assistance to students and teachers in that regulated category because the law mr president that we forged here seeks to help deserving students and the law therefore created the state assistance council composed of the decs secretary the department of budget and management representatives the department of science and technology the students designate a teacher representative and a representative of the school this collegial body mr president gives free tuition and subsidies to deserving students like valedictorians and salutatorians and therefore they e they are the ones who determine how many will be given subsidies how many will be free from any tuition and therefore determine how much would be the tuition fee increases if any they must also decide as already pointed out mr president the rules and regulations pertaining to increase tuition fees and other fees this refers to schools charging less than one thousand five hundred pesos a year for high schools and for college not more than eighty pesos per unit in other words the still regulated category of schools but whether the increases are regulated by the state assistance council or not mr president the fact remains that consultations are required audited financial statements are needed the division of the increase seventy percent to go to salaries and wages for teachers and non-teaching personnel must be observed twenty percent for upgrading of facilities must be implemented and in the light of the law there appears several violations mr president one there are no teachers no student representatives in the state assistance council how can they function adequately if there exists no voice from the students and the teachers no vote from these affected parties second violation mr president secretary cari&ntilde;o issued decs order number thirty dated march eleven nineteen ninety-one prescribing tuition fees when he no longer has the power to do so this power is now lodged for schools in the first category with the state assistance council and the schools themselves and the second category with the schools mr president provided that consultations and the other conditions like audited financial statements are complied with third violation as a result there exists faulty implementation sometimes there are consultation many times there are none many times the schools merely inform as of may twenty-second nineteen ninety-one mr president santa scholastica college raised their tuition fees by twenty-five percent with consultations on the other hand the national college of business and arts increased tuition fees by ten percent no consultations ateneo raised by twenty-five percent with consultations rizal tech colleges in mandaluyong raised by five to ten percent no consultations central college of the philippines increased by thirty percent no consultations all of these mr president are accredited institutions all are subject to the same law but preliminary survey shows that there exists violations rather than adherence last year alone fourteen schools supposedly violated the law in nineteen eighty-nine the decs national capital region alone mr president reported seventy-five cases of tuition increases increased violation in spite of the existence of the mandate the question is why what good is the law what good are the penalties provided for if the proper authorities cannot enforce the law  number four violation mr president the decs secretary in his decs order number thirty fixed tuitions fees for upper students and said these schools are exempted from consultation provided the increases were within the limits that he prescribed he has no business mr president to fix rates no business to say no consultations no business to disregard financial audits mr president let us help there is unrest already amongst the students there are anxieties amongst parents there is deep concern by the teachers and it seems that growing confusion is compounded by lack of adequate implementation let the committee on education headed by senator angara look into this let the students come let the teachers come let the state assistance council members come and tell us so that we will really know the problems and perhaps adopt proper solutions so that we rectify the wrong and help those aggrieved we owe it to the nation mr president we owe it to ourselves we owe it to the students and the teachers and the parties concerned thank you senator lina and then senator angara  thank you mr president will the majority floor leader yield for some questions certainly mr president  firstly mr president i 'd like to congratulate uh the indefatigable uh majority floor leader for taking up uh the cudgels for our uh youth who are still of uh school age uh we in the committee on youth and sports development uh join him in uh in this uh privilege uh speech entitled the challenge to tuition fees  we are one with you mr uh president in your uh criticisms against the way republic act six seven two eight has been and is being implemented by the department of education culture and sports especially on the aspect of uh consultation as specified in section ten of the republic act uh mentioned uh this representation and together with the senate president were the one who authored section ten of republic act six seven two eight on the need for consultation in all tuition increases however mr president uh the justification being used by the decs in issuing for example decs order number thirty and other previous orders is the is a certain opinion issued by the department of justice that uh if the increase in uh tuition is within the level of uh say one hun one thousand below one thousand five hundred pesos a year uh for high schools so schools charging less than one thousand five hundred pesos a year for high schools and eighty thousand error = should be just eighty pesos per unit for colleges during school year nineteen eighty-eight eighty-nine they are no longered covered they are no longer covered by uh the provision on consultation it 's only those schools that are charging above this level are the ones being uh uh mandated by the decs to uh undertake this uh procedure on consultation now uh therefore there is a stalemate uh at this point mr president decs is using the d o j opinion as the justification the d o j being the legal arm of the uh legal arm of the uh executive uh branch uh has uh issued its uh opinion and then the decs relies on that opinion but i 'd like to know from uh our majority floor leader what is his uh uh proposal how will the students can uh effectively challenge the decs order number thirty considering that the decs is relying on a d o j opinion will the students have to go to the supreme court and resolve the issue there or should the students and the parents go to the to congress and ask for a clarification through another piece of uh legislation may we know the insights of the majority floor leader on this uh issue mr president thank you mr president i think that the law is very clear it has made no distinction it refers to all increases not to the increases of those catego uh schools under category one where the tuition is one thousand five hundred pesos and eighty pesos per unit respectively but to all and where the law does not distinguish i don't think even the secretary of justice can distinguish secondly mr president it is the lower levels because they are the poorest students who really deserve more consultations it is there where uh the audited financial statements are required it is there where the seventy percent twenty percent allocation is needed because many of these schools and i do not want to disparage them but that is the reality in the provinces especially have rickety structures and very poor laboratories etcetera  and yet these are the ones who are supposed to be regulated but no consultations  wa what kind of uh uh protection do we give them if we remove the process of consultation mr president and so therefore i submit that the best way is for uh us to clarify the intent of the senate through perhaps a resolution after the investigation shall have been made well your honor the matter is uh the matter is pending before the uh our committee on uh education headed by senator angara and time and again we have referred to this to this law particularly section ten on consultation because uh to my mind it is the unanimous position already of the senate from the senate president uh down to this uh representation we have already uh come out with uh a position on this matter i 've read the statement coming from the senate president that in all tuition increases the there should be a consultation and in fact uh as i said earlier this was so clarified during the uh proceeding here proceedings conducted on this on this bill when we were deliberating on this and we came up with a section ten uh precisely uh and also because all the sectors will be affected by the tuition increase will have to be consulted the teachers for example who are supposed to benefit because seventy percent of the tuition increase should go to the salaries and wages of the of the teachers and a certain percentage will go to improvement of facilities and uh whether the increase is favorable or not fav favorable to the teachers the teachers should be consulted and the students should be consulted so it was very clear to our mind mr president that uh there should be consultation in all in all increases and i think that 's also the view already expressed by the chairman of the committee on education  yes but the problem precisely is uh uh even if we pass a resolution here uh despite the preponderance of statements coming from this upper uh chamber uh on this issue of consultation the decs continue to be uh belligerent uh i wi i withdraw the word but uh it ha it has stood pat on its uh position uh that the d o j uh position is that uh uh only those that are above the one thousand five hundred peso uh tuition in high school and those uh uh more than eighty pesos per unit in the tertiary level they are the only ones that uh require consultation the the schools charging those uh fees  yes   i mean so 'yon po ang uh 'yun po ang sitwasyon eh uh ang implementation ang decs it relies on the d o j opinion despite the already statements coming from us here so that is the situation do you think a resolution uh passed by by this chamber will uh will be sufficient mr president supposing the the decs again says no we are relying on the d o j opinion uh if this the has to be tested let this let it be tested to the to the court by the by the uh or you know let the parties go to the courts for final uh arbitration of the issue  'yun ayun ho yata ang gustong mangyari ng decs well the decs itself mr president through secretary cari&ntilde;o issued uh decs order number thirty of nineteen ninety-one series and in that executive order they fixed tuition fee increases for tertiary level for upper students also in high school mr president yes and then they uh said no consultations for those who follow this prescription that is not the law that is contrary to the law and not touched upon by the secretary of justice yes i agree with you on on that point uh mr president that that the decs uh the secretary uh overstepped uh his uh prerogative uh under under the law because uh he exempted again he fixed the rate uh and established a certain ceiling ceiling
Philippines	mrs president in nineteen eighty-six eighty-seven you yourself gave away these two pier contracts for a song we don't blame you for that because at that time you probably did not know what and how much they meant you probably did not even understand the meaning of the word arrastre contract or stevedoring contract today however after five years i hope you will pick up the phone and order the p p a board to explain to you what they are doing and why  bayan naman mrs president at any rate mr senate president i move that the blue ribbon committee open investigations on this matter at the very least this senate should be able to put on record the strange occurrences that this administration has allowed to pass in its dying moments so that should it go along the routes of inaction on this as in previous expos&eacute;s then we hope that you or senator enrile or senator estrada or senator pimentel or any other incoming president will order an investigation of these matters at a proper time thank you mr president senator osme&ntilde;a  mr president will the uh gentleman yield for a few questions uh willingly mr president to the distinguished chairman of the committee on public services who i know is also very knowledgeable with the case under scrutiny on the floor today uh mr president i would like to congratulate our colleague senator maceda for having brought this matter up today because this representation mr president has been uh shall we say bombarded with information regarding the rich octopus that uh has taken over with all its tentacles the uh p p a your honor in your uh study of this matter have you limited yourself to the port of manila alone for purposes of brevity your honor we have limited although just like you i will admit that there have been information submitted to us on anomalies in the bidding of p p a contracts in different ports all over the country uh your honor are you uh familiar or have you heard of the situation in the port of zamboanga for example uh not uh so familiar your honor maybe you could uh favor us with telling us what happened in zamboanga well your honor one of the shipping companies that calls on zamboanga who operates out of cebu because out of the eight domestic shipping companies seven are headquarters in cebu uh told me your honor that a uh nephew of the octopus uh is the one that is controlling the port of zamboanga and that this shipping company has to pay forty-five percent of its gross revenues as a kickback and uh therefore your honor com uh piling this up with what we heard about what 's going on in the port of butuan and in the port of cebu in the port of dumaguete in the port of iloilo and even in small ports your honor like the small port of hagnaya in northern cebu uh is your honor uh have you has your honor come to the conclusion that this practice is going on on a nationwide basis in every port in this country in one form or another yes your honor because i have also heard of complaints about the port of batangas and the port of cagayan de oro and therefore uh all of this now being of record uh would should be part of the investigations that are going to be conducted by the distinguished chairman of the blue ribbon committee uh without wanting to overwork the distinguished chairman of the blue ribbon committee who is now also on top of a very very big uh uh anomaly like the philphos land deal may i amend your honor 's uh may i offer an amendment to your honor 's resolution referring this matter to the blue ribbon committee with the request that the blue ribbon look at the entire uh operation of p p a to cover all ports in the philippines because my information your honor is that this is not limited to the port of manila i accept the amendment your honor thank you mr president thank you senator romulo  well mr chai uh mr president would the distinguished uh gentleman uh yield to a few questions willingly uh mr president to the distinguished chairman of the committee on banks well mr president uh uh as senator osme&ntilde;a said that was uh precisely the point that i wanted to bring up too  that whereas you had stated uh the monopoly and other practices uh being uh uh done or undertaken by marina seven r i think i heard about metro and then as senator osme&ntilde;a stated in several other ports all over the philippines both big and small uh what is the agency that is in-charge of all of this uh mr president it is the philippine ports authority your honor uh which happens to have uh a board headed by the uh secretary of transportation  so right now it is supposed to be headed by secretary ben castro and the vice-chairman of course is general manager former or retired commodore jaime dancel   who who  uh is uh commodore dancel still the general manager at present uh yes your honor as far as i know uh has he not been the general manager since uh at least nineteen eighty-eight uh yes your honor uh there have been uh i think uh three changes uh i think one time it was ceferino aguas then i think there was a calixto santos and if i 'm not mistaken after that commodore dancel came in so commodore dancel because i think uh capt santos was during the previous administration so commodore dancel has been at the head not only in nineteen eighty-eight as i posed in my question but perhaps earlier if not eighty-six perhaps eighty-seven is that correct well your honor uh based on the uh lease agreement signed in nineteen eighty-seven in nineteen eighty-six it was signed by ceferino aguas i really don't know who wa i is it is in nineteen eighty-seven because the lease agreement was signed by the chairman then secreta minister of transportation hernando v perez  i see  i see well at any rate mr president uh the records of the case will show when in fact commodore dancel started as general manager now mr president uh you mentioned that the chairman is uh is uh the uh secretary of transportation but what i have heard because uh several groups have also approached me lately about this uh is that it is in fact a certain jose bustamante i don't know if he 's undersecretary who is the chairman now again it 's uh it 's a matter of record but can you uh uh try to remember whether it 's in fact uh uh undersecretary or whoever jose bustamante who is in fact the chairman or whether if you say that it is the secretary of transportation perhaps then bustamante sits or stands for him can you tell us uh if you can remember what is the status of this chairmanship  yes  yes your honor uh the chairman is secretary ben castro  i see uh however most of the time undersecretary bustamante uh uh sits for him but based on my information and again this has got to be uh confirmed or denied during the investigations uh probably part of the reason why secretary castro precisely has not sat on these meetings is that he as well as uh mr philip tuazon of marina there are two of them seem not to be in agreement with this particular uh extension  but it seems that there are some people who are exerting representations let us not say pressure at this time for them to grant not only the ten years but the twenty-five-year extension  uhm   i see  okay uh but in fact uh mr president whether as chairman or sitting for the chairman who is the secretary of transportation in fact isn't it true that uh mr jose bustamante has been the one sitting not only now that secretary castro has been appointed interim or acting but even before and so that uh the fact that undersecretary bustamante is there is only uh uh continuing what was the practice before uh ben castro took over as acting secretary  is that not correct that 's probably the case your honor and at least in the last meeting last thursday it was undersecretary jose bustamante who presided now mr president uh in the case of the p p a uh under what department is the p p a connected mr president it is attached to the department of transportation and communications and being attached to the department of transportation and communication as in fact the chairman is the secretary 1 word or the undersecretary of transportation what is the scope of supervision monitoring authority etcetera of the department of transportation and communication with said p p a and the actuations of p p a with these various uh entities that you had mentioned well technically your honor it is not under the complete control of the secretary of transportation as secretary but it is under the control of the uh p p a board of which he happens to be chairman so uh it is more lo uh more or less uh if you may use the word semi-autonomous  but still the chairman being the secretary of transportation uh he should uh exercise uh almost uhm uh what we say absolute uh supervision over this particular matter now the only problem here is and that 's why maybe uh it should be clarified in fairness to him why we brought in uh the name of executive secretary mario carlos is as you know ben castro is still an o i c  ben castro uh has not been submitted to the commission on appointments and the impression in the whole d o t c is that anything that happens in the d o t c still must have to be cleared with executive secretary mario carlos  well mr president not only that but in point of fact uh the the items the juicy items that you have been mentioning did not only happen when uh acting secretary ben castro took over i   is that not correct or are you saying that all of this that you have enumerated and detailed happened only starting from the time that uh mr ben castro took over as acting secretary can you clarify now you are correct your honor ma the uh after uh secretary rainiero reyes uh uh was able to successfully insist on awarding the uh contract for the m i c t to razon after that secretary as carlos came in as you know and uh at least i think in the otsi case the ocean terminal services incorporated uh secretary carlos was uh already the secretary now in the case of marina i 'm not quite sure whether it was still in the matter of the acquisition of marina lately whether it was still carlos or it was acting secretary arturo corona who as you know also was a proteg&eacute; of executive secretary mario carlos  uh so that what you are saying mr president is that all of this did not only occur starting from the take over as o i c of uh acting secretary uh break in the recording is that most of this if not all of this occurred after the incumbency of secretary rainiero reyes uh yes your honor except the original uh change of contract in eighty-seven which reflected more favorable terms to seven r that occurred during the incumbency of minister hernando perez before secretary reyes well so e with those uh uh uh few exceptions all of this has occurred between the period after secretary reyes and the assumption of acting secretary ben castro  yes your honor with one little uh uh modification  the questioned attempt today to grant a twenty-five-year extension uh which started maybe two or three months ago is now under the administration of ben castro  uh but it has not been consummated yet not yet your honor and as you 've stated uh ben castro does not even attend and in fact there is a continuity in the person of uh undersecretary or assistant secretary or whatever his title is jose bustamante whose continuity starts from the time after uh uh minister or secretary rainiero reyes and the present acting incumbent  is that not correct  that that would be correct your honor well mr president this is very important because mr president the unholy alliance that i don't know if you used that phrase did you use that phrase i 'm not sure now whether i did well at any rate mr president this is what the groups that have approached me lately uh have told me this unholy alliance between the p p a and several of this uh well probably the word is not several but this monopoly of arrastre and stevedoring uh is a general perception in the pier mr president and so this is nothing that is uh new mr president uh are you aware of this that uh you know this is the general perception in the in the south and the north harbor that there is an unholy alliance between the p p a and these monopolies of arrastre and stevedoring  is that correct mr president and uh that is correct mr president and if i may add with uh uh there is a perception that there is a spin-off into certain smuggling operations and there is an unholy alliance at that point which includes officials of the bureau of customs yes mr president and have you also been informed mr president now of course uh uh this is up to us to invite but uh the lighterage association and the other users of the uh ports importers exporters shipping lines have in fact brought this to the attention of secretary carlos when he was still secretary of transportation and communication  ha are you aware of that or have you had that information from this group that they have in fact brought this to the information of secretary carlos not now but before yet in nineteen ninety and perhaps even before are you aware of that i 'm not aware of that your honor and i 'm thankful that you have brought that up because uh uh this only uh strengthens uh the uh representations that we have made in our speech now mr president if this is so that it has been brought to the attention both of the p p a and the secretary of transportation by the importers the exporters the shipping lines the port owners uh the lighterage association and all of this uh do you believe therefore that since this was brought to their attention they could have done something about it not now but in nineteen ninety nineteen eighty-nine or nineteen eighty-eight uh that 's correct your honor and since they did not then it strengthens our uh assertion that it was because uh there are very powerful backers supporting this octopus at the piers well the only reason why i have brought that up is because you have raised that question what role is the executive secretary formerly of the d o t c playing in the spinning of this monopolistic web why is d o t c o i c ben castro who is p p a chairman so strangely silent on all these things so that is the reason why i am bringing to your attention matters that have been brought to my attention by these groups thank you your honor so uh but you you have not been informed about this mr president that this has been brought directly to the attention of the higher ups specifically those that we have mentioned no your honor  no your honor uh what has been brought to my attention is that uh messrs dizon atayde rocha and company have been name-dropping uh the name of secretary carlos and uh i understand there was one confrontation where uh mr ben castro uh blew up and said uh uh you should not pressure me on this by name-dropping the the name of secretary carlos  well at any rate uh in the hearing of the blue ribbon committee uh these various groups will be summoned should be summoned and i hope that under oath they will make the same statement that they have given to me mr president at least as to the facts i am not saying that there is anybody in cahoots i 'm just saying that this has been brought to the attention of the higher ups and that up to now obviously because of this privilege speech nothing has yet been done or has something been done mr president not that i know of uh your honor as i said uh the other uh development lately is they have started to try to take over the ninoy aquino international airport cargo handling services and senator osme&ntilde;a 's brought out the fact that they are operating nationwide uh which i did not really mention in my speech  i see  well mr president i have mentioned unholy alliance between the p p a and several of this group  i think what you have mentioned is the tentacles of the octopus which is trying to extend uh not only within the north and south harbor but even beyond but one other point mr president uh in the case of the p p a are you aware of the twenty-seven million ghost drainage project uh no your honor i am not aware of that particular project well uh i thought i would bring that up mr president because this has also been the subject of uh a lot of complaint and representation by the lighterage association of the philippines to the p p a and to the chairman and the secretary but again mr president nothing has been done about this twenty-seven million uh ghost uh uh drainage project and mr president uh we only have to establish that there is a twenty-seven million contract and the fact that the pasig river that portion which has is supposed to be drained is still not drained and is still a hazard or an obstacle to shipping and nothing has been done about that in s fact in spite of the fact that this has been brought up in so many fora by the uh associations involved in this nothing has been done by the p p a well i 'm glad that you brought that up your honor and uh therefore it should also be included within the scope of the investigation well finally mr president i think the tell-tale and the significant portion of all of this is as you said the chairman or secretary of transportation exercises absolute supervision and authority and therefore therein hangs the tale mr president thank you mr president thank you uh your honor and i 'm certainly relieved that senator osme&ntilde;a gentleman from cebu and you have added to my privilege speech because there is always a tendency on the part of these people to immediately deny it and charge that uh either i 'm lying or i have no basis at least in this speech today uh two members of this uh chamber have immediately come forward to uh validate uh uh at least uh a substantial portion of our privilege speech
Philippines	uh senator gonzales  uh before we vote on the motion may i just uh interject one statement your honor   yes  well i think the making representations with the japanese government on a parliamentary level uh as suggested by senator lina is indeed uh worthwhile but i 'm also thinking that the biggest uh investors in our country are japanese there 's so many huge uh japanese uh companies doing business in the philippines and i think uh uh appeal also uh to these uh japanese uh uh businesses uh which are actually branch offices of industrial and manufacturing giants in the united states and who have actually uh have uh great influence upon order upon their government can also be uh made and uh without necessarily without saying that we 're uh uh applying undue pressures upon them but certainly their cooperation in this respect can be uh can be obtained don't you think so sir  yes   that 's correct yes  yeah  yes uh certainly mr president all extra-legal uh approaches should be done and uh this should include as uh senator gonzales suggested approaches to uh existing japanese uh investments e in the country would uh i think produce a significant uh dent upon the bureaucracy in japan uh thank you your honor  yes  mr president there is a pending motion any objection to the motion senator laurel  this is not an objection mr president but before uh uh voting uh on the motion i would like to ask uh some questions also with uh pleasure mr president uh specifically on the point of carageenan  yes mr president may we be advised on uh carageenan as an industry export industry of our country wasn't there a time that uh somehow the philippines was the principal source of carageenan uh in the world mr president uh not exactly of carageenan but of seaweeds correct yes uh in other words there was a time that the philippines practically had a monopoly of seaweed for the purpose of making carageenan   carageenan  that 's correct mr president yes and how is it that now uh we care uh uh carageenan or seaweed uh is ne being uh barred by other countries does that mean those importing countries like the e e c e e c c uh have other sources of uh of seaweed yes uh mr president there are now uh seaweeds from indonesia from thailand from uh ireland among other nations  pa'nong nang  pa'no hong nangyari 'yon   uh   wala sila nung una tayo lang ang meron ngayon eh pati eh ireland as you said indonesia e meron na rin naku kalaban na natin ka-kompetensya  uh tulad siguro ng sikreto ng atom bomb 'yan mr president  nung una amerika lang ang may alam ngayon marami na recording ended and continuation is in side b of the tape  a country oh which produced uh bangus you know in a large scale and uh with uh with finesse but now our bangus has uh been stolen by other countries to put it very bluntly and now several countries are growing bangus  so i suppose that uh the situation is much similar to what happened to carageenan  mr president i had the privilege of visiting uh the principal or major uh uh producer of uh carageenan in the philippines that is in cebu yes and uh i learned uh in the course of my visit uh in the plant that uh there were exports of the philippine variety the very good variety exclusive to the philippines and uh exported by our countrymen mr president some of our countrymen uh which to my mind is a very unpatriotic uh act now is that uh do you know mr uh president if uh this exporting practice of uh choice philippine seaweed is still going on i i uh i would suppose so mr president because there is no ban against such exportation and uh as i earlier mentioned uh mr president even the export of bangus fry which is prohibited is being circumvented uh as you know very well mr president so i will not be surprised if uh this is also being done insofar as uh philippine uh seaweeds are concerned uh would you say that there is need to not only to enact legislation if there is no legislation to that effect uh prohibiting the export of uh choice philippine seaweed that is the main source of carageenan   meron ho bang uh batas ngayon  uh that can be considered mr president and uh for it is for this reason that probably it is best that this particular issue is really referred to the appropriate committees so that uh all these repercussions uh which which might uhm arise from our act on this issue can be studied thoroughly i understand i 'm just was just informed mr president that our colleague in this chamber senator shahani has a bill prohibiting filed with this chamber prohibiting the exportation of uh fresh seaweeds i think uh we should have that calendared if possible and uh acted upon as one of the measures that this uh uh chamber should take with a view to alleviating the sad situation of uh confronting the carageenan uh industry of our country and then of course to be followed as suggested by the uh distinguished senator from mindanao of enforcing strictly whatever law we pass in this chamber now uh coming now to to prawns yes uh mr president  uh apart from uh this uh uh move to or suggestion that we try to send a a parliamentary delegation to take up in th behalf of our countrymen engaged in the prawn industry uh do you think it would be a good idea to open the door now to foreign interest investors so that they may go ahe get into the prawn industry in our country  move  uhm mr president i am not aware that uh it is prohibited of uh foreigners to do so even as of now uh particularly in joint ventures  uh   i my understanding is that it can be done it can be done and would you go to the e because that is now it would seem allowed by the foreign uh investment incentives act 'no  by uh by existing law yes and that 's my understanding mr president  chuckle would you go to the extent of uh welcoming now foreign investment into this field where filipinos are now engaged in uh that 's what i was trying to say mr president there i there seems to be no law that uh prohibits this kind of uh participation by foreigners in in other words mr president my point is this here uh the good senator from mindanao says that well we are behind in technology we cannot produce uh we don't have the equipment to produce uh copra that has very low content of uh what is that  afp  aflatoxin well whatever that is mr president so uh-huh we can uh the foreign incentives act of our country that is now in the process of uh of uh fi being firmed up between the two houses of congress will now allow uh or en even encourage uh foreign investors to come in here engage in the same business so that well at least the filipinos our countrymen who are employed in this uh industry may not be deprived of their means of livelihood uh would you consider that  ha  mr president i am supportive of the amendments that have been introduced to the foreign investments act uh it does not mean however that simply because we are opening the doors a little bit wider to foreign investments in this country that necessarily this will result in the prejudice of our own people uh uh i 'm not quite sure whether i got the thrust of his honor 's question but i would like to just establish that premise and therefore whatever uh foreign investments may be allowed as a result of our action here in the senate i will support in order to maintain our exports uh e export income in these particular industries like uh carageenan uh copra and prawns and shrimps uh frankly mr president i don't uh quite see the point uh you will allow foreigners to come in so so that we will maintain our well mr president uh very simple if you bring in foreigners they will try to protect this industry that they are now involved in or probably control yeah and so being in uh foreigners maybe japanese they will me be the ones to negotiate and make arrangements with their country to allow uh uh the exports continue exports of uh the the philippines uh to yes of foreign markets yeah now i see the point that that might be a good tactic to employ mr president as long as we do so within the context of our laws and our constitution certainly yes because uh these are industries uh uh which the filipinos are involved uh in and as a matter of fact are adequately supplying uh for export purposes particularly the and we say that that should be a reserved territory for uh our countrymen but yet we have i understand forthcoming a transition period that would allow foreigners and probably this is if we must uh take the position that we will allow a transition period to for the foreigners to come in then this should be directed towards that end although i 'm not convinced about the wisdom of that uh move mr president because that would be to the great prejudice of our people uh at least those who have invested uh uh a great deal of money in these uh uh ventures  yes  uh ma mr president before his honor will continue speaker e clears his throat let me just uh emphasize that insofar as japan is concerned in this particular uh moment we are discussing the uh decision of the japanese authorities to prohibit the entry of uh prawns and shrimps which have uh more than uh zero point one percent antibiotic content and uh we want to emphasize that very clearly because trading with japan in prawns and shrimps last year amounted to one hundred twenty-five billion uh mil million million i 'm sorry one hundred twenty-five million pesos whi uh dollar dollars mr president which uh really is a lot of money and uh one last point mr president i 'm particularly intrigued by the statement of the uh good senator uh that uh the move of japan to uh bar actually to bar philippine exports break in the recording  uh how would you draw that uh deduct make that deduction mr president uh actually mr president uh we can perhaps uhm uh just speculate that uhm ja the japanese will do everything uh within their powers to induce to induce if not to pressure our country to uhm accept the presence of the u s military bases within uh the next uh few years after the expiration of the military bases treaty in uh nineteen ninety-one and uh primarily we can tie this up with the with the statements of the japanese prime minister himself when he was here uh who did not uh find it uh you know out of uh protocol to say publicly that japan is in favor of the maintenance of the u s bases in this country so what i 'm saying mr president that is this that it will not be above the japanese to do everything to bring uh pressure to bear upon our decision-making process on the issue of the bases and that is what we would uh characterize mr president as realpolitik meaning uh the harsh uh ha hard realities of international politics do you think we we should be able to anticipate those uh realities do you think we sh are in a position to resist such pressures i uh i really wonder mr president because i am told that even taiwan has been making unofficial uh shall we say sending unofficial uh messages uh to the effect that they would also wish to see the bases extended in this country and once the bases are extended in this country then probably we will be able to secure uh favorable uh loans and uh mr president from uh   and probably even the e other countries e e c pressure is tied up also with this uh u s military bases uh uh question  yeah  thank you very much   thank you mr president uttered by majority floor leader teofisto guingona  we really cannot discount that mr president
Philippines	thank you mr president uh mr president uh i 'd like to congratulate the distinguished gentleman uh from uh batangas uh no less than the president pro-tempore of the senate for delivering this timely uh speech and reminder to us cur regarding uh what are going on in our uh current uh relationship with the united states of america on security which are being uh re-examined and re-negotiated this is uh indeed a well thought-out speech and i 'd like to commend uh the distinguished uh senator for his uh erudition and incisive uh uh articulation of uh this major uh issue in our uh country and time and so mr president i would like to find out if he would care to answer a few questions willingly with great pleasure mr president mr president uh after uh hearing your speech and given the depth of uh preparation that went into uh the formulation of this uh uh material i 'm sure that you must have studied the uh military security relationship of the philippines and the united states of america which is the uh reason for the existence of military uh bases in the philippines now being utilized by the americans and uh in view of this perception uh mr president i would like to posit this question  in your honest uh opinion and uh belief your uh honor do you believe do you feel do you recommend that uh the present uh arrangement with the united states of america having their troops in the philippines occupying some uh portions of our territory to station deploy their uh military capability uh is indeed to subserve the interest the security interest of the philippines okay very obviously mr president uh uh considering the terms even of the the mutual defense agreement bet between the united states and the philippines and uh now the and the present conditions i do not think that these uh agreements including the military bases agreement is for the benefit of the philippines not for the defense of the philippines not for its protection and uh it is i think largely in the interest of the other party and so much so that you find that you can derive this uh draw this conclusion from the wording that whenever there is an attack on these uh military bases we 're supposed to come forward to defend them but when it 's just the philippines minus the military bases they just uh they are not required obligated to come fo to the fore and help us that 's unjust unfair now your honor thank you for that answer uh and i agree with you that uh indeed uh these uh military bases uh shorn of its uh mysticism and myth is nothing but a naked uh uh effort uh to project the uh imperial military power of uh the united states of america uh in this part of uh the world and so uh given this situation your honor my next question is this right now there is a burden continuing obligatory burden imposed on the philippines flowing from the uhm so-called military bases agreement between the philippines and the united states of america  on the other hand your honor we are receiving quote compensation unquote from the united states of am america i uh placed it in quotation because uh oh we 're all aware of the fact that uh this is not really the kind of a compensation that we would want uh to categorize as such in uh the law of contracts because uh whereas the burden on us is immediate direct and operating the so-called uh consideration or compensation which was from the united states to the philippines is only based on best efforts do you think your honor that given the risk on us of getting involved in the quarrels of the united states with other countries given the risk of possible uh uh use of our territories as a launching area for uh nuclear attack against other countries and uh i have here a statement from a well-known writer which says that uh u s forces are capable to know of nuclear strikes or soviet homeland uh based or home ported in the regions in south korea japan the philippines included it includes the philippines given this your honor and given the possibility that we would be the object of attack because of this thing do you think that the present compensation package or even the compensation package that the group of secretary manglapus uh is now uh asking the americans to pay to us for the continuation of military the american military presence in the philippines is commensurate to all the burdens and risks that we are assuming given also the fact that america could be a threat directly to our country and people well uh that question had long been answered uh by one of our great filipino nationalists uh don claro eme spanish pronunciation of m recto his answer to that question is you were actually putting these installing these military bases wi which will be obviously loaded with nuclear weapons which will serve as magnet to attract destructive weapons the same nuclear weapons the same type that will destroy not just that military base but even the entire country and the surrounding nations so the question is simply this do you think it is enough to receive money to count it by the billions in exchange for the danger of to the danger of existence survival of the filipinos simply the answer mr president is a definite no it is not sufficient as a matter of fact it cannot even be considered   hindi pwede 'yon ano naman buhay na ang pinag-uusapan rito  'cause even if even if the soviet union or shall we say north korea were not an enemy of ours the mere fact that we have nuclear weapons here and the united states is involved and involvement of the united states that is not in our hands we cannot stop it prevent it and yet the minute that such a situation should arise we are in great mortal danger  so word   samakatuwid po samakatuwid po sa inyong mahalagang ah kaisipan ay 'yang tinatawag natin na mga kasunduan pang-militar sa amerika kasunduan ng ating bansa at ng amerika tungkol sa ah seguridad kagaya nung tinatawag natin na mutual defense treaty at ganoon din ang base kasunduan tungkol sa base militar ay mas mabigat na pinapasan ng ating bansa kaysa nakagagaan sa ating kalagayan bisang bilang isang bansa  that is true mr president uh i realize that so many of our people depend uh uh for their livelihood their source of income on the military bases near clark field uh subic but i think the larger interest is the entire nation  and our own countrymen who might be uh uh prejudiced by any removal by the removal by this this uh dismantling of military of u s military bases here should be able to understand that the larger interest the general welfare is the supreme factor to be considered in the resolution of such an issue posed by the minority leader now  kayo po ba ay naniniwala na sa ngayon ay may binubuo na koalisyon ang tatlong malalaking ah bayan dito sa ah asya ah ah dalawang bayan dito sa asya at ah kasama ang amerika at 'yan ay ang baka bayan ng tsina people 's republic of china at ganoon din ang hapon eh 'yang koalisyon po na iyon ay anti-soviet coalition  kayo po ba ay naniniwala diyan   chuckle i understand mr president that in the politics particularly in international politics uh anything is possible and that your enemies now may be your enemies tomorrow your friends before could you be your enemies now and so i think uh that uh coalition spoken of by the minority leader is center is certainly a possibility as proved by history totoo ho 'yan eh  the soviet union uh allied with the united states attended yalta the yalta meeting against the axis powers including japan and uh italy and germany and now aba iba na  why because as stated by george washington mr president and before him lord chamberlain or no lo lord palmerston there are no permanent friends only permanent interests national interests  and so if it is in the interest of a particular country such as china u s and japan to group together in a coalition for the purpose of presenting a solid front against a particular enemy rising enemy probable enemy there 's nothing to stop them and so your honor uh if there 's uh that 's it if there is such uh an anti-soviet coalition emerging between amongst the united states of america japan and the people 's republic of china do you agree with the perception your honor that the americans would like the continuation break in the recording   missing words the other uh objective or purpose because i cannot conceive of a military base mr president nowadays in this age of uh advanced technology without military unconventional military weapons particularly nuclear weapons which are becoming more uh sophisticated so if there is if there are military bases foreign military bases anywhere in the world there must be a reason for it and that is in order for purposes of defense to serve as the first line of defense and second as the forefront the vanguard for purposes of attack against a possible enemy in the event of war and so therefore if there be such a a coalition and uh the the uh our philippine military bases uh our support for that coalition your honor uh given the fact that about thirty-five to forty percent of uh the i i c d m force and ballistic missile firing submarines of the soviets are actually deployed in our re region of the world  and given the fact that uh there is uh a large strategic bomber capability stationed by the soviets uh in that area in siberia and wi we are within range of these uh strategic bombers don't you think your honor that the danger is very clear that if we continue the uh presence of american troops in these uh facilities that uh we could be involved in a confrontation that we may not want to be involved simply because uh we want uh uh some uh dollars and cents to shore up our bankrupt economy uh obviously mr president although i can understand the uh uh the need of the country for uh dollars for money i think there should be if there 's a wall there that should stop us already we cannot cross because that would mean mortgaging our future our posterity our nationhood mr president uh uh i would like to continue the interpellation but i have uh a scheduled meeting with a distinguished visitor the uh czechoslovakian ambassador uh and i would like to uh ask permission to cala stop my interpellation if there will be time i 'll continue your honor so that oth i think there are others who would want to interpellate the distinguished uh gentleman thank you very much senator pimentel is recognized  actually mr president just a a ve very few points uh if his honor will permit  uh is it uh correct to say that the soviet union is still considered an enemy of the united states because it 's   not that uh it is not considered by the united states as an enemy but as a potential enemy and a continuing danger to its world leadership in spite of the fact that uh in eastern europe uh there is already a uh a total overhaul of governments which used to be communists and have now become uh shall we say more democratically-oriented mr president and even in the soviet union itself uh have we ever seen uh the phenomenon that we are now witnessing in the soviet union where yeltsin is openly challenging gorbachev and there are demonstrations of miners calling for the resignation of uh gorbachev himself mr president   i would agree mr president with the thinking and statement of the uh senator from mindanao that this threat from behind the garden is not as serious as it used to be definitely  i think that uh with that uh glas glasnost and perestroika and the agitation and open rebellion of the various component republics in the soviet union which show that it 's certainly lacking in strength to challenge the supremacy of other world powers such as the united states but i would also call attention to the fact that it is not simply a question of of power armed strength there is a conflict of ideology there is seems to be a conflict of ideology that cannot be reconciled even as they the two countries they have uh already uh shall we say ended practically their cold war confrontation that is exactly what i would like to stress mr president that uh the ideological division between the soviet union and the united states is disappearing if it has not already disappeared uh you see your honor for example uh latvia estonia and uh lithuania which is part of the whole soviet union empire these three countries have openly said they are now uh independent countries now georgia which is another state in the soviet union is able to assert uh at least by announcements that they would also wish to be considered an independent soviet uh republic now all these things would seem to me to indicate that the soviet ideology which uh used to be the basis of the uhm uh confrontation cold war confrontation and sometimes breaking out in actual shooting war uh in the subaltern states of the u s and the and and the soviet union this ideological division does not seem to be there anymore mr president
Philippines	your honor uh i i i believe that uh uh we we can uh we can uh address uh the problems that that will be brought about i know that you do not share uh my my position on this matter uh and i i i can also tell you that uh i i cannot also share uh your position on this point so uh i guess uh as we have been saying for the past few days uh uh history will uh will judge us uh and uh we just have uh to be prepared to meet the the consequences of uh our decision on this matter and which i as i had said uh was uh a very agon uh a very agon agonizing one well your honor i don't think that the people who are not going to eat are going to accept your statements and your honor you were making here uh references to s s s which actually only provides one month uh benefits you make reference here to mita pardo de tavera who is running out of money and who has to feed six hundred and fifty thousand displaced persons as a result of pinatubo you were asking questions like wala ba silang magagawa  you are alluding to opportunities that are non-existent i uh honestly your honor i 'm disappointed because listening to you now you really sound like a trapo =traditional politician making promises that do not mean anything clapping   chuckle well uh if you can call me a trapo i don't uh uh i do not know what you can uh what you can call yourself  well your honor that is that is what you are saying you are making false promises  well your honor i am a senator of the philippines clapping speaker a chuckles  but let us go back your honor to specifics because these people have to eat your honor people in olongapo   let 's uh let 's take out the proposed treaty  no not   can you point to any provision there any provision in the proposed treaty which will show that these people whom you are now so concerned about suddenly concerned about no your honor i have been i stood on the floor of this senate from day one clapping  i was the first one your honor who stood here point point to any provision in the treaty which provides an amount that would be given to these workers no your honor precisely what i am saying your honor  your honor in fact in fact if i remember right you had spoken strongly against this proposed treaty which we are now considering i never spoke against it your honor i was putting up a word stand your honor   you were saying you were saying that if we would approve this treaty we would be making mendicants of ourselves year every year for ten years your honor we were the compensation that is being mentioned there is not even in the body of the treaty itself your honor i have stood on the floor of the senate from day one favoring the retention of u s military bases your honor i recall you were asking for two billion dollars  this treaty this treaty your honor guarantees employment for twenty eighty thousand filipinos your honor  just a mo  may i ask the gentlemen on the floor please speak one after the other well your honor it is the other gentleman who 's interrupting me i cannot finish my statements and he breaks in  both gentlemen are being referred to   no no no words to me with respect to that your honor your honor you were the one that were breaking in in fact i have given you all the time i ask short questions and you give out kilometric answers trying to divert the issues your honor i take it that you do not like what i have been uh saying   no it 's not that i like or i do not like your honor but i wish your honor would be more concise we are running out of time the majority leader is asking us to hurry up it is the sponsor that is eating up time we are not even your honor you haven't answered my question   may i ask for a short suspension mr president i suspend the session for one minute break in the recording  but uh i i believe that uh i said uh if uh our leaders in government uh could only be more uh creative and resourceful uh the they would be able to uh shorten that uh period or if not find other uh uh solutions uh to this uh temporary uh problem now i would like to bring out the fact uh mr president uh that uh under the proposed treaty uh there is nothing uh stated in the an in any of the provisions of this proposed treaty uh which uh mentions uh any specific or uh definite amount that uh would be given or that would be used to address this uh problem now uh i would also like to point out your honor that uh if you are looking for uh for solutions uh that could be uh used to address this uh problem we have uh what uh we are paying to our uh foreign debt uh for this year your honor uh i think you will admit that we will be paying the amount of two billion eight hundred fifty million dollars for our foreign debt just for one year now under this proposed treaty that uh you are now uh voting for over a period of ten years over a period of ten years and assuming that uh what was stated in the bush letter will uh materialize without any deduction what uh we will be receiving will be much less than what uh we will be paying for our foreign debt in one year because if we would add uh this together over a period of ten years the appropriated uh amount would come out to a total only of two billion one hundred seventy-eight million dollars can i now continue your honor uh because you digress the issue to foreign debt we are not dealing here on foreign debt  well uh   your honor i am not finished  no no no  i 've been very courteous in allowing you to speak lengthily on even irrelevant matters but must your honor please we are not debating foreign debt here i think there 's unanimity in this session on foreign debt we are delibe then what we 're talking about here is breakfast lunch and dinner for eighty thousand displaced workers and this treaty your honor if we were to ratify it would provide two point seven billion pesos of wages which these workers are now currently earning for them to buy their food so we are not talking of the compensation for displacement we are talking of continued employment your honor and that is what i 'm asking what replacement are you since you are the chief advocate here in the floor now on the rejection of the treaty what alternatives for the livelihood of eighty million beginning with day one ha  not plans you know yung panaginip ni ano'ng pangalan niyan abueva the likelihood of hair growing on his head is bigger than the likelihood of that plan being successful so your honor let us not talk about those dreams of abueva uh let us talk basic facts your honor breakfast lunch and dinner where are these people going to get their food the day they are laid off well uh your honor uh i note that you are only looking at uh eighty thousand workers those uh in subic and those who are working in clark and uh i don't know how many of these workers are uh or were directly hired and how many are contractual uh i i believe it 's uh much less than uh eighty thousand well your honor i 'm not yet finished uh your honor oh yes than sorry your honor your apology is accepted uh so i said you are uh just looking at these uh workers in these u s installations now uh what uh we are uh looking at and what we are seeing is the greater number of our workers who are now unemployed as uh senator uh herrera had said that there are at least four million workers now who are unemployed and he said that underemployed uh could reach even the number of nine million now how can we limit our concern to just the workers that uh you have mentioned of course we are as concerned as you are maybe you will not believe this but we are but uh we have to look at the total picture and uh if we will allow the americans another period of ten years to make use of of subic then we are uh uh setting aside and not uh making use of the opportunities the the wonderful opportunities that are now present to us to convert this valuable piece of land as i said in the studies that have been submitted if uh subic uh uh wi will be uh returned to us uh and uh we can start implementing the conversion plans for subic where uh among the plans are to establish a maritime industrial complex a ship building ship maintenance ship repair facility uh transshipment center a container port uh we know that uh uh in subic uh there are uh large areas for uh building spaces for storage spaces we know that there is a runway the there uh nine hu nine thousand uh uh foot long so your honor i i believe that uh if these uh conversion plans would already be implemented uh there can be no doubt that uh there will be more employment generated for our filipino workers not just the eighty thousand now let 's say who may be affected but much more than that now uh of course there is that gestation period that we have to pass through uh we cannot avoid uh that uh stage even if we were to start after uh ten years we still have to pass through that uh gestation period uh but i i as i have said uh the government uh can uh if only it has the political will can uh come out with the necessary measures to cushion the impact of this on on the workers uh tai uh taiwan i heard is uh uh interested in uh uh our uh uh workers uh i i recall uh secretary torres mentioning that uh uh that so many thousands of them uh uh would have an opportunity to to work at taiwan  the there 's still the middle east uh opportunities and uh i also would not want to think that the workers who would be affected would just stay uh at their uh homes and the and the and not do anything so your honor as i said uh you may you may not have as much faith as i have in uh in uh the filipino but i i believe that uh uh this is a problem that uh uh can be solved by us well your honor i have faith in our people i would not have come back seven weeks after ninoy was killed i would not be here i have faith your honor but i do not want the martyrdom of eighty thousand workers so that four million hopefully if abueva 's plans materialize may be able to find jobs your honor besides i dispute the concept that you can employ four million unemployed people in olongapo if that is converted because to begin with i doubt if you can put enterprises there that would employ four million that 's to start with number two i doubt whether we have the resources four million people it costs three hundred thousand pesos of capital to employ one laborer so four million people if somebody has a calculator multiply it by three hundred thousand i think it would be about a trillion pesos of resources which we do not have your honor and your honor again i say i 'm focusing on the immediate problem now if we were to uh ratify this treaty and allow for a phase down a gradual transition no disruption would occur your honor the people in olongapo and i 'm only talking of olongapo your honor i 'm not talking of unemployment in the rest of the country because i will get to that your honor i 'm not talking of the six hundred sixty thousand garment workers who stand you and i do not believe that the united states will be so unkind as to take away our garment quota and cause the hardship of six hundred sixty thousand but the risk is there your honor now your honor you also speak of taiwan and let me point out that the chairman of our committee on labor senator herrera who is right here beside me has told me your honor that he has talked to the authorities in taiwan three times and they have told him that our access to labor in taiwan is conditional upon our recognition of taiwan a repudiation of our one-china policy which of course is in the realm of foreign affairs and i would not want to bring that issue in because i promised the majority leader and the leadership that we have no intention of prolonging this discussion and that is why we want to limit ourselves to short answers and short questions now your honor going back to the need to provide for employment of our eighty thousand base workers why is it your honor that you and your colleagues are so insistent on bringing upon difficulties even hardships hunger upon eighty thousand filipinos in the interest you claim of employing four million although your honor i don't see the logic because when you repudiate this treaty on monday as you are intent to because you have twelve votes and we only have eleven then we will trigger a an environment of apprehension among the foreign investors again you will say we are being threatened i think it is a reality because the truth of the matter your honor is that investors will not come here there are other places where they can invest and we have while other countries are creating environments for favorable foreign investments we seem to be intent on isolation in this country and repelling foreign investors
Philippines	 missing words the uh capability of the u s to recognize the document as a treaty must be in accordance with its procedures review of uh as of fr bernas that the only way for the united states to recognize the treaty is to have it ratified by their senate i understand is subject to question because uh as i said there may be those around this very table who who might uh wish to say that there are other ways by which the president of the united states or the executive department may consider a document a treaty i have just two other questions on this point so that the others can also ask questions uh mis madame chairperson uh i would like to call the attention of the se secretary to the preamble of the treaty of friendship cooperation and security so-called and in particular to the paragraph which states that the treaty is valid the treaty is valid under international law that does this refer to the fact that the treaty is valid despite the fact that let 's say it is not going to be concurred in by the u s senate  and the second question is if the philippine senate does get to concur with this bases treaty under this kind of a preamble mr secretary uh would that mean that the senate the philippine senate in effect uh is made to accept the interpretation that the constitution does not require u s senate concurrence  uh i 'm i 'm looking at the preamble now uh senator i 'm looking for that uh portion which you were referring to uh it is at the uh last uh paragraph uh the first page   shall provide a framework  it says recognizing that this agreement which constitutes a treaty under international law shall provide a framework for their continuing relationship and cooperation  now uh uh would uh concurrence by the philippine senate mean acceptance of the interpretation that uh this would not have to be submitted to the u s senate uh i think that uh whi whi while acceptance of that interpretation is an important step the uh the fact uh stands by itself and whether we accept it or not there is in the american jurisdiction a si situation where there are more than one ways of getting a document to be recognized as a treaty whether we recognize it or not i think uh uh does not change the situation what i mean uh mr secretary is that if this senate of ours concurs with this treaty does it not in effect adopt the interpretation that uh uh it would not this same treaty that it has concurred in need not be concurred in by the u s senate what uh this uh the language of this uh preamble says that this agreement constitutes a treaty under international law it is a requirement of uh of our own constitution that this must be a treaty and therefore we 're no doing nothing but confirming the language of our constitution that we the republic of the philippines must look to this document as a treaty and so in effect uh we are adopting the interpretation that uh you have given that uh this treaty need not be submitted to the u s senate for its concurrence   uh senator the act of ratification or recognition as a treaty uh does not antecede this treaty it comes after this sa the signing and ratification by the senate therefore i do not see that it has any effect at all on that matter thank you madame chairperson uh i see that some of our guests uh have arrived and the chair proposes that the senators uh address their questions to secretary manglapus uh after which we shall hear our uh panelists uh i understand vice-president laurel is arriving at uh eleven o'clock and after we have heard the panelists uh i believe the senators can address uh questions to them uh mr secretary i 'd like to ask uh the question which i think has been of uh primary concern uh for the senate this concerns the nuclear provision and uh this appears in uhm supplement uh the supplementary agreement number two uh article four uh section twelve the uh philippine constitution is quite clear about uh the uh prohibition of uh nuclear weapons on philippine soil uh in your opinion uh uh is this treaty uh inconsistent in consistency in accordance with that provision in our constitution yes uh madame chairperson uh indeed uh this uh provision is contained in the current agreement and is merely reproduced in the new treaty uh we believe that uh it uh uh conforms squarely with the letter and intent of the constitutional provision uh on uhm nuclear weapons the constitutional provision madame chairperson uh senator laurel i don't mean to intervene at this early stage but uh i would like to raise a question of procedure in this uh committee hearing do we understand it that uh our resource persons including of course the secretary of foreign affairs who just uh made uh a statement uh of his position and the position of the government that he submitted to us the treaty for ratification for concurrence do i take it that we will allow them to each and everyone of them to state their position to deliver their uh statements and then afterwards do we ask questions uh yes this is what i uh just said uhm senator laurel since uh secretary manglapus was the first uh there were just a few guests when we began and uh as head of the negotiating panel i thought he was a valuable person to uh open our discussions now we are addressing uh questions to him but in the uh interests of time and we are pressed uh for time i believe it was uh decided in our caucus that uh we invite uh we have uh today uh nine guests who have uh confirmed their attendance and uh as i said after we have uhm addressed our questions to uh secretary manglapus it is the suggestion of the chair that uh we hear our panelists and after which uh we can address our individual questions uh to them   precisely  do we understand it madame chairperson that uh we will allow every resource person to precisely finish with their statement to deliver their statement and we will at the end ask questions or after every each one of them has finished do we have the prerogative and are we at liberty to ask questions immediately after they have finished each one of them well i think we have the right uh to ask our panelists some questions but time is of the essence i hope that uh this is appreciated we have uh uh lined up a uh a a list of uh guests not only for today but uh until friday and it is the intention of the chair in accordance with the uh agreement which was reached at our caucus that uh we should uh listen to as many uh members uh invited as possible now the uh the panelists are uhm uh submitting also their comments in writing so there 's that chance to do so but if there are other suggestions uh uh which uh you would like to propose uh of course i would like to entertain them but as i said it is uhm uhm important that uhm we hear the panelists then of course to address questions to them well uh madame chairperson i see it here in this notice of hearing well that today september second will be devoted to the discussion of an overview of the overview uh of the treaty that is been has been submitted to us uh foreign policy and legal issues  i for one would like to focus simply uh specifically today on the legal issues now uh we also agreed if i remember right madame chairperson in our last uh meeting caucus that we would proceed in this manner  the panel of the executive department will uh deliver their piece this sort of broad position on all these issues i take it in other words we are submitting like this they are submitting this treaty for rati concurrence of the senate because we believe it 's constitutional and legal then we have then i suppose they should focus on certain provisions or items that will involve the issue of constitutionality and justify constitutionality in the course of their uh exposition then it would be known as now this panel in the senate to ask specific questions sort of after the words  that would expedite and i would like to state i was informed uh i suggested that procedure of raising first and discussing the constitutional and legal questions because i did not see any logic in discussing other items like compensation criminal jurisdiction etcetera interruption by television commentator  uh thank you well thank you for your suggestions but i think the uh this was discussed in the uh caucus and i believe the uh chair uhm is interpreting the uh suggestions of uh my colleagues i think the i would like to allow secretary manglapus to uh finish this question on uh the nuclear provision that is a constitutional uh question and uh then i suggest that uh we hear all of our guests uh who are here this uh uh afternoon and i don't see how you can just say pro and anti i mean i think we might be uh we might be uh prejudging and i would like to appeal to my colleagues that in the interests of time uh we proceed as the chairman has decided secretary manglapus   well uh uh in that case madame chairperson uh uh just for the information of the body here uh  is there any word uh one particular person or official in government panel uh that will deliver his paper or his statement on the issue of constitutionality because if there is none then what will happen probably is that uh after various statements made uh by the members of the executive panel the executive department we 'll ask probably some questions or similar questions which will take more time i would like to assure my dear colleague uh senator laurel that i have anticipated this as you can see the members of the negotiating panel the technical staff are sitting behind secretary manglapus uh there is assistant secretary de castro who uh will uh address uh herself uh to the uh uh constitutional issues uh as well as the uh status of the forces uh agreement uh there is uh undersecretary gaces uh who will be answering questions on the interruption by commentators whose voices override the voice of and  well i would like to say that senator uh tamano did uh give me a uhm a written statement and i think that uh this should be taken also as an indication of a desire to speak   words members of the senate including this uh to write their uh uh request to be recognized by the chair i thought that this is an open public deliberation mr president i think that this is uh common practice the committee meetings that uh we send an indication that uh you would wish to speak either in writing or uh by uhm taking uh the floor mr president and uh i did uh indicate to senator word   words and i preceded the gentleman from mindanao and i 'm just going to ask one question the chair has the power to recognize uh the members of uh the speakers and uh i would like to exercise this prerogative of the chair uh secretary manglapus if you could please finish uh answering the uh questions interruption by commentators   words that the united states may absorb or resolve uh nuclear weapons in philippine territory without agreement of the philippines we believe confirms it conforms to this policy and there is the the guiding principle that the application of this ban on nuclear weapons must conform with the national interest i think the words are consistent with the national interest  and we believe it is sufficiently consistent with the national interest that we should say no nuclear weapons unless agreed upon by the philippines  furthermore uh there is a the second part of the provision uh madame chairperson regarding the uh exemption of visits and uh passage of ships uh is supported also by the statement made by commissioner ascuna uh where he says as practiced both in latin america as well as by the south pacific countries that endorsed the treaty of ara tonga passage of ships whether nuclear powered or nuclear arms-bearing is left to the determination of every state on a case to case basis  uh i suppose the u s uh government will insist on a policy of neither to confirm or deny the presence of uh nuclear weapons what then is our reply the policy that neither confirms or denies is a universal policy practiced by the united states uh we 're told that they are they have they 're forced to practice it so does not to so as not to reveal uh the uh location of their weaponry to a potential uh enemy uhm it is not uh something that is applied only uh to their relations with the philippines but uh we uh we have the option if we are asked for permission that uh we refuse that permission for storage or installation but we don't have the capability uh to verify the existence of uh nuclear weapons so what   we are developing that capability  our department of national defense tells us that the capability full capability has not been reached but that in the modernization program of the armed forces of the philippines we shall achieve that capability thank you

itself is indicative that the president committed violations of the anti-graft law he has ill-gotten unexplained wealth and that is covered by article two of the complaint   atty flaminiano   mr chief justice the charge in article two of the articles of impeachment reads as follows president joseph e estrada violated the constitution and stands guilty of graft and corruption when he directly or indirectly requested or received for his personal benefit one hundred thirty million pesos out of the two hundred million released by secretary benjamin diokno of the department of budget and management allocated under republic act seventy-one seventy-one in violation of section three c of r a three zero one nine as may be seen from the affidavit of luis c singson provincial governor of ilocos sur dated twenty-five september two thousand annex b hereof  now the next paragraph reads president joseph e estrada violated the constitution and stands guilty of graft and corruption when he participated directly in the real estate business through a family-controlled corporation which constructed thirty-six town houses in vermont park executive village antipolo city as shown in the p c i j in the article on president estrada 's family and financial interest  he also violated the anti-graft law he is sworn to uphold he filed his statement of assets and liabilities for the year nineteen ninety-nine stating therein that he and his wife and children have business interests in only the three corporations the president by that sworn statement also committed perjury and the offense of unexplained wealth because records show that he and his his wife and mistresses and their children have other interests in other companies outside of the three firms listed in the statement of assets and liabilities annex e hereof  there is nothing in this charge under article two of the articles of impeachment which mentions this so-called five hundred million peso transaction your honor   and for the just for the guidance of atty bautista   yes your honor   under the preliminary conference order on uh the issues agreed upon by the parties the parties agreed that insofar as article two of the articles of impeachment is concerned the only issue is this whether on the basis of the facts alleged therein the president could be guilty of graft and corruption how would you be able to relate that kind of testimony to the agreement as to the issue involved   as i said your honor the complaint already alleges the ultimate facts constituting the offense the statement here he also violated the anti-graft law he is sworn to uphold  the fact that five hundred million pesos will be presented in evidence today as belonging to the president among other large sums as i earlier mentioned   the the the question of the uh presiding officer is uh whether or not uh that kind of evidence that you seek to introduce now would really relate to what the parties had agreed as the issue under article two and i repeat whether on the basis of the facts alleged therein the president could be guilty of graft and corruption   most definitely your honor   mr chief justice   atty flaminiano   there is an allegation that uh there was a transaction involving five hundred million pesos now there is no allegation of an ultifat ultimate fact regarding this five hundred million pesos your honor even if we read the articles of impeachment several times as we have done before we cannot find any specific allegation that will support the conclusion that uh this five hundred million pesos is part of what has been alleged in the articles of impeachment   we submit     it speaks of five hundred million pesos in cash whereas in these articles of impeachment your honor the allegation is that the president his wife and mistresses have other assets in other companies outside of the three firms listed in the uh statement of assets and liabilities  that definitely your honor is outside the scope of these allegations in these articles of impeachment   your honor please it is settled that allegations which are evidentiary in nature need not be alleged as ultimate facts in the complaint   in the   in the matter of   i 'm sorry uhm   five hundred million pesos being owned by the president is not an ultimate fact it is an evidentiary fact which will tend to prove that the president violated the anti-graft law the ultimate fact that is material is the one i just read he also violated the anti-graft law  how did he violate the anti-graft law mrs ocampo will tell us   if your honor please the allegation that the president violated the anti-graft and corrupt practices act is a conclusion of law it is not a statement of an ultimate fact   i disagree your honor   uh uh the chair would rule that uh while it may be a conclusion of law it is precisely a conclusion which could be developed only out of proof by facts but the only issue really is how could you relate that to the ultimate facts alleged under article two unless you can satisfy the mind of the presiding officer on a particular relation between that ultimate fact and what you claim to be evidentiary on the basis of what the parties had agreed as the sole issue under article two then i don't think uh the presiding officer may be able to clearly clarify its own position on the matter  in short show to the court the relationship by by stating by by showing exactly facts which we may be able to elicit from the witness  if at all it has some kind of materiality to the issue agreed upon after the preliminary conference and during as a matter of fact that conference     thank you your honor   yes     mr chief justice may i kindly point out that apparently the private prosecutor was not aware of what has been agreed upon previously he might be completely unaware of the parameters of what has been agreed upon in order to expedite the trial of these cases where the issues have been specifically delimited in the pre-trial conferences mr chief justice   one one simple question in relation to that uh is the examining was the examining prosecutor present during the preliminary conference   your honor please before yesterday i was a passive spectator to this i haven't had sleep for twenty-four hours i definitely have no information or knowledge of what was agreed upon   of what has been agreed upon during preliminary conference    yes your honor  yes and uh   would would you need time to to confer with uh the panel of prosecutors because indeed uh indeed parties should be bound by what they have agreed upon unless you could really justify how you would proceed on this witness to establish by evidence its relationship to the issue agreed upon   we will try to prove your honor through the witness that the president had accumulated unexplained wealth and this is indicated with the amounts in the accounts your honor   but uh there had been uh the the defense had read into the record the allegations precisely under article two so if uh were you aware of uh the allegations under article two   are you referring to the allegations on page five   yes the allegations of ultimate facts under article two so you could be properly guided    yes your honor  yes your honor

with the copies since during the markings the defense was represented these are all documentary exhibits i beg your indulgence mr presiding officer uh many of these documents came only during lunch

versola uh this is exactly the same copy except uhm i have marked the exhibits because i have a separate folder yes sir your honor we were furnished a copy of exhibit l l l but what atty uh daza noticed is that while the witness was making the answers she was reading from a document which is not this one which is not a copy of this one she was reading from another document which is quite confusing to us because we were following her statements so may we request that the witness be cautioned to use only the copy of our own exhibit l l l that should be addressed to counsel for the prosecution to be fair to the defense  but better yet for the defense especially for the assisting counsel to be there near the witness so the time that the document is presented you can see the document  thank you   thank you your honor let let me explain because all these bunches of documents could be confusing your honor the markings are meant to identify the relevant pages of these bunches so every time that you present a document to the witness indicate the exhibit number yes your honor so the defense can also be on guard against any surprise mr chief justice the majority

please that uh the witness had earlier prepared these documents and arranged them uh in in the order that uh she had deemed fit as i went over these documents i realized that perhaps a better approach would be to indicate the deposits and then the withdrawals and in so doing uh your honor uh there would be a uh we would be jumping from one annex to another uh but we can go we can approach that on a per document basis if the court wishes

on uh his uh knowledge about the stock market and uh any matter related thereto  we submit  we submit sir the witness may answer  ito hong capital marketing development center incorporated the capital market development center inc is a research institution your honor that was set up in the later part of i think nineteen ninety-nine uh as a policy uh study group uh your honor and the members thereof is the financial executives of the philippines the bankers association of the philippines and the investment houses association of the philippines in effect all the participants in the financial

stock exchange is privately organized but it has quasi-public interest your honor uh and this is the situation for all stock exchanges worldwide it is a quasi-public entity although they are mostly private your honor why do you say that it has a quasi quasi-public interest   well because because uh the equity stock that is invested therein is open to the investing public so anybody or the

now go direct to the point your honor in fact that question was uh going to that point uh uh do you know what this c s g is what is this c s g   already answered  the witness says it is the surveillance group of the p s e  compliance and surveillance group   compliance and surveillance group of the p s e  can you tell us what is what are the functions of the compliance and the surveillance group there were three departments under that group your honor uh the first department is called the market surveillance department the second is called the special investigation

Philippines	you may now proceed uh atty daza uh mr chief justice uh may i know if the uh investigative report uh that that was going to be retrieved from the vault is now available it is now available your honor i understand uh they brought in the documents already  you can have the documents now chairman cough excuse me i 'd like to show you uh exhibit uh seven m 's uh which uh is described as the philippine stock exchange incorporated compliance and surveillance group investigation report on b w resources corporation february eleven two thousand  are you sure that you never saw a copy of this report already answered your honor just for the record what was the answer of the witness  am i   the witness said before your honor that he has not uh actually seen this uh document because it was followed by an injunction from the court in pasig now the documents are brought before him it is up for him to answer  well i wish counsel wouldn't   so the objection is overruled  i wish i counsel wouldn't answer for the witness just go ahead please i am not answering for the witness i 'm just saying that he has answered it earlier your honor  no but that was before not now   there was a ruling already  there is no need for you to debate on that issue your honor this is the report that was submitted by the compliance and surveillance group to the s e c which was handed to my office through my secretary and when i was informed about it this is the report that i referred immediately to the prosecution and enforcement department but i never had a chance to go over and read this report your honor but you saw the report i i saw the well this page your honor i i see i remember very distinctly all right  now this page as i read to you has a date february eleven two thousand now my question is that previously i recalled to you that the securities and exchange commission was brought back to the supervision of the department of finance per executive order one nine two on january seven two thousand my question is that isn't it a fact that when this report exhibit seven m 's was brought to your office on february on or about february eleven two thousand that exec that order was already in effect in the sense that the s e c had already been brought back to the supervision of the department of finance no longer under the office of the president is that is that correct uh that is correct your honor now i recall uh i remember that just before uh i was suspended uh the securities and exchange commission was then also under and and i 'm referring to the first preventive suspension was then under the department of finance but uh this was uh brought back to the office of the president and then in january of the year two thousand this was brought back to the uh department of finance that is your that is correct your honor so in january of two thousand for your question we were already under the department of finance and at the time the report was brought to your office you were already back under the department of finance because this was on february eleven two thousand couple of weeks after the executive order while this report was is dated february eleven two thousand it was actually received by my office in the afternoon about five o 'clock of february twelve two thousand your honor and at that time the securities and exchange commission had already been brought back to the supervision of the department of finance that is correct your honor if you say that the executive order and i have no doubt to i have no reason to doubt you it was issued on january of the year two thousand to whom did you refer the report exhibit seven m 's after it was brought to your office on february twelve two thousand i referred this to the head of the prosecution and enforcement department which at that time was in the person of atty ruben ladia from the time that ref you referred exhibit seven m 's to atty ladia until your resignation took effect on march twenty-six of that year did you have any occasion to discuss the report with him no your honor i never had the occasion to discuss this report with atty ladia  did you not take the initiative to inquire from atty ladia on what he did with the report considering that during at least about six weeks after you got the report the report was with him no your honor because at that time the commission en banc uh had required atty ladia to regularly make a report on its investigation of this b w transaction on a weekly basis every time that we met in our regular meetings of the commission en banc  so i i i had not even uh discussed this report or followed it up or taken the initiative as you mentioned with respect to this matter as regards atty ladia your honor did you not previously testify that cough his department the p e d as you called it was one and the only one department that worked under your supervision and that you directly had authority and supervision over the p e d did you testify to that effect i testified uh your honor to the effect that at that time i was the supervising commissioner of the prosecution and enforcement department but because under the law the commission en banc also has supervision over uh uh the the departments of the s e c on the basis of the exercise of its supervision every department not only the p e d were required to submit weekly reports to the s e c commission en banc every time that the commission en banc met with respect to their area of responsibilities your honor as supervising commissioner did you not think it did you not consider it fit to have a copy of that report or copy of the weekly reports furnished you by atty ladia no your honor on the contrary i felt that i should not really be dictating upon what the uh uh p e d should be doing with respect to uh this report because they know uh what they are supposed to do the rules and regulations and procedure of the s e c is very explicit on the matter no i was not asking you as to whether you dictated or influenced the p e d my only question chairman is whether as supervising commissioner you asked a copy of the weekly reports that p e d was supposed to make to the commission en banc  did you ask for a copy oh yes your honor we were furnished copies of the weekly reports of the s e of the p e d with respect to their investigation on b w shares but it was not uh uh a copy of reports based on this it was a copy of reports of the progress on the status of their investigation on their own on the b w matter your honor during during your direct testimony if i recall correctly cough you said that the philippine stock exchange as all exchanges under p d nine oh two a falls under the jurisdiction of the sec did i recall correctly yes your honor under the uh revised securities act which was the law then enforced the s e c regulated the entire securities market including the players in that market which also included all of the exchanges your honor and the p s e has had jurisdiction over the member brokers of the exchange is that correct the uh i i it 's not quite correct to end that way your honor what i am saying is that uh the philippine stock exchange was given the authority by the s e c to have a first crack at investigating and policing and disciplining their own membership uh before the s e c takes over in the light of the new regulatory method that we put in place which is evolving that exchange into a self-regulatory organization your honor now when you said first crack what you mean is that uh before s e c would investigate p s e must first investigate only with respect to irregularities in the securities market involving stock brokers and dealers under their membership organization your honor because uh p s e has no jurisdiction or authority over individual investors that is correct your honor but they have also limited jurisdiction over companies whose shares are listed in that exchange and they also have jurisdiction over them as well companies companies whose shares are listed yes but not individual investors no no during your tenure as uh securities and exchange commission uh associate commissioner and later and especially when you were chairman of the commission the reputation you had was that uh you were open and transparent was that uh reputation uh justified in your estimate i i 'm not aware of the reputation your honor but uh what i 'm aware of is is that it was under my term as chairman of the securities and exchange commission that i enforced another set of regulatory method which is precisely to make the securities market efficient transparent and fair and on that basis we made it the policy of the commission to always require full disclosure with respect to matters that would be important to investors your honor so that they could make an intelligent decision on whether or not to invest in a particular stock related to that policy of uh transparency was your availability to media to being interviewed to being invited to uh press interviews wasn't that isn't that correct that is correct although i recall your honor that at some instances the media had also criticized me for for clamping on certain information do you recall that on january nineteen two thousand you were in the premises of the philippine stock exchange yes your honor why i was there in the premises of the philippine stock exchange on january of ni of the year two thousand uh because at that time in the afternoon about two o 'clock the senate committee on banks and financial institutions held one of their hearings in that premises uh in connection with its investigation of the b w transactions your honor the committee on banks financial institutions and currencies uh at that time was chaired by senator raul roco wasn't isn't it that is correct your honor as far as you can remember besides senator roco was there any other senator belonging to that committee who was present at that hearing as you called it there was no other senator at that time except senator roco your honor mr chief justice conformably to precedent uh in this court and i believe i 've mentioned this earlier i would like to invoke judicial notice of the fact that a hearing was conducted by the committee on banks or a number of hearings was conducted by the committee on banks financial institutions and currencies in regard to the b w shares and one of the hearings was as said by the witness on january nineteen two thousand at the uh p s e offices uh in pasig city i would also ask that judicial notice be taken of the transcript or transcripts transcript or transcripts of the hearings before that committee specifically that of january nineteen two thousand in relation to that uh mr chief justice we have pre-marked as uh as cough as exhibit sixty-two for the defense a copy of that transcript and would request the distinguished prosecutors to consider stipulating as to this transcript marked exhibit sixty-two sixty-two a sixty-two b sixty-two c and sixty-two d i 'm informed that copies have been provided the members of the court as well as the prosecutor sixty-two would the prosecutor agree to this particular exhibit in regard to existence execution and due authenticity oh yes your honor thank you  these uh copies for the prosecution were attached to exhibits sixty and sixty-one these being uh the next exhibit in series  what i have here your honor   may the prosecutor confirm  yeah excuse me yeah your honor what i have here is actually exhibits sixty sixty dash e sixty dash b in series and then exhibit sixty-one series and of course uh exhibit sixty-two your honor
Philippines	the witness please rise raise your right hand  you rufo colayco do swear that the evidence you shall give in the case now pending between the philippines and joseph ejercito estrada president of the philippines shall be the truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth so help you god  yes please sit down take your seat prosecutor libarios your witness mr mr chief justice your honors uh we are offering uh in evidence the testimony of this witness to establish and prove the following number one that some time in february nineteen ninety-nine the witness was called by the president to malaca&ntilde;ang to discuss about the plan to set up a gambling casino in clark number two that it was the president who introduced governor chavit singson to jesus pineda for them to establish a casino in fontana resort known as the fontainebleau number three that jesus pineda became involved with governor chavit singson in the fontainebleau gambling casino project at the instance of the president and number four that the president is the beneficial owner of the fontainebleau a corporation organized and operated and funded from the proceeds of the jueteng collections number five that fontainebleau entered into a lease agreement with fontana resort through its owner r n development corporation for the use of its convention center as the site of the proposed gambling casino number six that fontainebleau transferred its assets which were actually acquired from jueteng collections and waived its right to operate a casino in favor of fontana through the owner r n development corporation number seven that charlie atong ang a known presidential crony brokered the deal between fontainebleau and fontana through its owner r n development corporation and number eight that fontana resort including the casino was eventually acquired by the president through lucio co a known presidential crony and we are further offering the testimony of this witness your honor to corroborate the previous testimony of governor chavit singson and uh carmencita itchon that jueteng collections were used to fund the fontainebleau project casino project and that the assets of fontainebleau were later on transferred to fontana and that fontana was later on acquired by the president through lucio co the witness is now yours  uh atty mendoza mr chief justice may i inquire whether this evidence is being offered uh in connection with uh article one first charge yes your honor it is in connection with article one particularly the involvement of the president in the jueteng collections under charge number one there are overtones in the offer that this evidence uh may have implications on article two i would like therefore to make it clear that this evidence uh is being offered uh solely and exclusively in connection with article one of the charges may i have the   do you agree to that uh prosecutor libarios that is the testimony of this witness would be solely and exclusively for the article one of the articles of impeachment  your honor please this  your honor please i think uh it should be without prejudice to the possible adoption by the prosecution   later on when you will call the witness just like in the case of governor singson then so for the moment it would be exclusively and solely to prove article one because uh we have this problem uh uh whether we could object to questions for example ownership of a certain asset uh not necessarily in connection with jueteng then later on the prosecution may say this is one of the assets which was not declared in the statement of assets and liabilities which would be a charge under article two then you can object to the question  so we we 'll have to object   and i think that the counsel counsel for the prosecution should see to it that as promised by him the evidence to be elicited must only be for article one we agree uh your honor you may now proceed uh thank you mr chief justice mr uh witness can you please uh state uh your name i am rufo colayco how about your civil status are you married married your address fourteenth floor sixty-seven sixty ayala avenue can you also state your uh educational attainment i have a bachelor 's degree in history and government from ateneo and a master of business administration from harvard for the record uh can you also uh tell us your professional background i was a partner in s g v and company for thirteen years after which i was a partner in the arthur andersen regional office in hong kong for two years and thereafter for the next eight years i was the chief executive of the kuok group of companies in the philippines which are best known as the owners and operators of the shangri-la hotels and finally in nineteen ninety-eight i became the the president of clark what do you mean by clark  the clark development corporation can you tell us what is this clark development corporation uh clark development corporation is the uhm entity by which the government uh implemented its uh program to convert the former united states air force base into a special economic zone and it continues to be the entity that administers that zone now how did you become uh the president of clark development corporation i was appointed the president of clark development corporation in nineteen ninety-eight shortly after president estrada took office now as president of clark development corporation can you tell us what was your primary duty or responsibility uhm as president of c d c or clark development corporation my basic task was is to was to oversee the administration of the entire zone uh i i wish to note that an important aspect to that task was to deal with prospective investors to uh evaluate their suitability and ultimately to enter into agreements with them so that they could operate in the zone uh mr colayco do you know uh governor luis chavit singson yes i do how did you come to know governor uh chavit singson in mid-february nineteen ninety-nine i was summoned by the president to malaca&ntilde;ang for a meeting and uh when i arrived there at his office in the presi presidential residence uh he was uh with uh governor chavit singson he introduced me to governor chavit singson and uh what happened in that meeting in malaca&ntilde;ang the president started out by saying that uhm the governor had been extremely helpful during the past election and that he therefore felt it was appropriate to reciprocate and uh can you recall uh what did you take up during that meeting in malaca&ntilde;ang yes the president wanted to discuss the uh proposed gambling casino project of uh that that was to be started in the fontana resort in clark and it was for that purpose that he wished to provide governor singson with a gambling casino license and what else uh did the president tell you if any yeah he also told me that he had introduced governor singson to mr jesus pineda or susing pineda as he 's known to uh well who was connected with the uh fontana leisure park he said that he it was his desire that governor singson and mr pineda be partners in the gambling casino venture in clark you you mentioned about uh fontana can you please describe to us what is this fontana and where it is located fontana you might say is the other major resort in clark the the more famous and larger one being mimosa but fontana is a two-hundred hectare uh resort which features uh sports and recreation facilities as well as residential villas now at that time can you tell us the owner or operator of uh the fontana resort at that time the owner of the resort was robin tan and his family through a holding company called r n development corporation you earlier said that uh in a meeting in malaca&ntilde;ang the president mentioned to you the name of jesus pineda who was supposed to be the partner of uh chavit singson in that casino project do you know this uh person jesus pineda yes i had known susing pineda for many years before that meeting and uhm i was aware that he was a classmate of the president a good friend of the president why do you know that he is a good friend this uh pineda is a good friend of the president well i i i had knowledge of that directly and in fact i recall that about the same time that i was appointed as president of clark uh susing pineda was appointed as a director of the national power corporation and more recently i think in july of this year he was also appointed as a director of clark development corporation and now serves as well as a member of the executive committee of the company now after that meeting uh in malaca&ntilde;ang can you recall if you have uh a discussion with susing pineda or jesus pineda regarding the casino project well of course he he we had to have meetings uh in order to implement the project uh your honor please at this point all of these testimonies appear to be immaterial may i inquire whether at some point uh uh this testimony will be linked to jueteng collections i think counsel is just trying to lay the basis uh and uh the objection might be premature at this stage this is only a preliminary your honor and uh the uh testimony of this witness now will be very very significant in the course of the proceedings your honor particularly in relation to the establishment of the uh fontainebleau casino project which according to the previous testimonies was being funded through the use of jueteng collections so the questions should lead toward that that objective to avoid any objection so you uh you said you had a discussion with uh jesus pineda after the meeting in malaca&ntilde;ang  yes   can you please recall that well we had certainly had more than one meeting we met frequently in clark susing pineda was more or less resident in in fontana and so in the course of those many meetings uh well first of all he had he had told me that they were forming a corporation called uh fontainebleau which was to implement the gambling casino project and that in fact the casino itself would bear the same name fontainebleau  and uh what else did you discuss if any uh yes i mentioned that we had frequent conversations and uh uh at a couple of those uh he disclosed to me that he had a serious misgiving and extreme discomfort about becoming the business partner of governor chavit singson uh to the extent that i suggested to him that he ask his friend and classmate the president if it indeed was a requirement that for him to have a casino that he would be in partnership with the governor  your honor   atty mendoza  may i request that the witness answer only the questions directed and he does not make a narration because that would not enable us to make objections for example many of the test much of the testimony of the witness is hearsay and we are unable to make an objection because the witness simply made a narration the witness is advised to answer the question and not to make a narration of facts because that could anyway be elicited by succeeding questions yes your honor   so so what else happened after that uhm well he went to ask the president because he came back to me and said uh mukhang ano talagang kailangan kong maging partner si chavit e yun ang gusto ng presidente mag-partner kami  i move to strike out the answer is hearsay your honor please what must be the ground what 's the ground of the objection hearsay your honor please with all due respect uh the the testimony of the witness is   the objection is overruled it cannot be hearsay insofar as the witness 's testimony is concerned because he was there uh this is in connection with what mr pineda told him as to what the president stated to that part probably but not insofar as that portion in connection with which he was himself a participant yes your honor as far as matters of his personal knowledge but not as far as to matters which he states were narrated to him by mr pineda as in regard conversations with the president can i now proceed your honor you must proceed now aside from that meeting in malaca&ntilde;ang with the president uhm where you discussed about the casino project did you have on any other occasion discuss also with the president the same casino project i can recall at least one other occasion when was that when uhm it was in june nineteen ninety-nine where in tokyo and uh why were you in tokyo why were you in tokyo at that time i was there because the president was there he he was on a presidential visit to tokyo and i took advantage as as it were of the occasion to promote clark to japanese investors by scheduling meetings with them in tokyo during the time when the president was there i flew there separately but i was there at the same time
Philippines	you may take your seat and you are reminded that you 'll be testifying under the same oath prosecutor moreno thank you uh mr chief justice your honors good afternoon uh to everyone uh mr chief justice your honors uh my assisting counsel is uh atty gu augusto san pedro are you changing uh no mr chief justice uh there you mean there is a mistake in the in the announcement of the majority leader i suppose mr chief justice that it was my senior colleague uh congressman apostol who announced the name joey tenefrancia i suppose that he has gotten used to atty tenefrancia assisting me in my earlier uh uh examinations and uh he thought that atty tenefrancia would also be my assisting counsel today mr chief justice make the proper uh correction then of the assisting counsel augusto san pedro mr chief justice junior or senior junior uh mr chief justice proceed thank you very much uh mr chief justice now mr lim uh in your testimony yesterday uh you mentioned that you 're you are the branch head of citibank uh n a now what branches which branches uh in the philippines if any do you supervise uh i cover all the branches of citibank philippines and these are to be makati branch greenhills the alabang branch binondo branch cebu branch and the libis branch and uh yesterday we were on exhibit septuple septuple f seven f 's and septuple f dash one now mr witness you were reading uh before the before your testimony was uh termina stopped yesterday suspended yesterday you were reading the machine valid uh machine print out appearing on exhibit septuple f uh can you please read the first line uh the machine print starting with the number one six six for the record please uh of a check deposit to casa metro check and then the second line uh monday october four uh sixteen forty nineteen ninety-nine the third line uh mr witness cannot cannot the counsel read the lines there had been stipulation on the contents your honor please we have hesitated to make objections but do not hesitate if you find somebody   we we feel we we feel your honor that the these matters that are being asked have already been the subject of stipulation as a matter of fact the question as to what branches uh has the witness jurisdiction over was testified to yesterday already that 's correct mr chief justice  do not forget what had been taken up yesterday so to avoid repetition of questions  mr chief justice yesterday i was not able to ask the specific branches of citibank under the supervision of the witness and mr chief justice may we also raise the point that uh up to now there is no basis to ask these questions of the witness considering there that there is as yet no evidence that he participated in the preparation of all these exhibits that is our point mr chief justice uh there has been no basis laid the direct testimony is still incomplete mr chief justice uh mr witness uh there is a there are machine prints after the word the name ejercito luisa p which is not clear in all the copies uh all the photocopies of the original and only you have possession of the original would you like to read for the record uh what these uh machine prints are okay uhm it 's uhm with s h i g h customer list  it stands for with standing hold instruction greenhills customer list   s h i means standing hold instruction your honor what do you mean by standing hold instruction  uh this is our own internal computer tagging system wherein uh an important client is tagged so that uh wherever he or she transacts in any branch would be given uh you know the proper recognition accommodation and uh the next line is uh if i may read philip p h p eight million four hundred thousand  the next line uh reads uh book equal eleven million eight hundred ninety-five thousand one hundred thirty-two and seventeen centavos  avail the word avail is equals to three million four hundred ninety-five thousand one hundred thirty-eight and seventeen centavos is that correct uhm yes your honor i also want to qualify that this is uh internal uh copy of the deposit slip the customer copy does not contain the book or the available  what do you mean by book and available  uh the book balance is the one that is reflected wherein after a check deposit is made the customer cannot withdraw the money yet because the check has not cleared the available balance is the one that the customer can withdraw at any point in time so does it mean then that at the time the two metro bank checks were deposited the account had a had an available balance of three million four hundred ninety-five thousand one hundred thirty-eight and seventeen centavos yes your honor now the account number in this exhibit septuple f is one six six eight two zero is that correct uh yes your honor and then in the box the name is uh account name is luisa p ejercito is this correct yes your honor who filled up uh this information uh mr witness as far as we know uh it is the uh authorized representative of the first lady and then uh in the box at the bottom right side of the deposit slip exhibit septuple f it reads for internal use only and then there are markings here uh would you like to read these markings for the information of this honorable court we have to object to these questions your honor if the only purpose is to read the entries there the objection is sustained there had been stipulation on the existence of the documents and the entries thereon what had been allowed by the chair uh insofar as some of the questions are concerned would only be some kind of explanation yes mr chief justice uh let me re-form then uh mr witness uh these handwritten uh words seem to read like with preclearance from the words the name is no longer legible would you like to explain to this honorable court we have the same objection mr chief justice it asked for an explanation witness may answer okay uhm i will read first the what 's written there is a signature of the uh branch manager with a note with pre-clearance from our uh compliance officer ian fenton and there was a time indicated that around almost five o 'clock four fifty who wrote this uh the branch manager your honor and his or her name is uh what uh geraldine nakpil so these are the handwriting this is the handwriting of geraldine nakpil this this is her handwriting your honor okay now uh who is ian fenton uh immaterial mr chief justice mr chief justice these are the subject of stipulations no mr chief justice he is only asking for who is the person answer uh ian fenton was the compliance officer at the time of the deposit your honor uhm and by compliance officer you 're referring to an officer of the bank that makes sure that the laws applicable and pertaining to that bank are followed leading mr chief justice is that correct sustained what do you mean by a compliance officer  immaterial this this sustained they have no materiality mr chief justice could you tell this court uh what the duties are of ian fenton as compliance officer the same objection mr chief justice witness may answer uhm ian fenton was acting as the compliance officer the compliance officer makes sure that all the guidelines are followed all control processes are followed and uh the the transaction itself uh was done with the right procedures and by when you mentioned about guidelines you you refer to guidelines including those uh that apply with respect to accounts of substantial amount uh and or accounts maintained by politicians or and public officials and their spouses  leading leading mr chief justice sustained what are these guidelines uh mr witness we believe these questions are immaterial mr chief justice to the purpose of the offer let 's see let 's see uh what would be the materiality later okay uhm the guidelines your honor you see uh in the bank we establish thresholds for each customer 'no  depending on the customer certain threshold amount that they deposit creates a trigger that we have to probe the nature of the deposit and the underlined transaction like for example an ordinary individual we may set a trigger of let 's say five hundred thousand or one million while probably a businessman who is a big-time businessman we may even set limits of higher ten million or up so depends on each individual we set triggers for uh monitoring do you have thresholds for public officials immaterial mr chief justice sustained what thresholds if any do you have with respect to deposits maintained by public officials the same objection mr chief justice sustained for lack of basis  you said  now mr witness you said s h i refers to special hold instruction is that correct when you say that an account is tagged as s h i and then the letters after that are g h list does this mean greenhills list yes your honor when an account is tagged does that mean that an account officer or an officer of the bank takes care focuses on that particular account leading mr chief justice sustained what does that mean when an account is tagged as ace s h i the question is immaterial mr chief justice overruled witness may answer uh s h i means uh there could be special instructions there could be hold instructions so it could be any series of instructions that we put on the customer memo so that when a customer comes to any branch it will be followed in this particular case the deposit of mrs luisa p ejercito the first lady who is that officer that handles this account of citibank  i don't think that would be material  i don't think that would be material mr chief justice the uh since it is not a an unqualified objection it it is overruled we have to object we have to object your honor on the ground that the question is immaterial overruled the uh account officer is marivic pantaleon thank you mr witness  is mar marivic pantaleon still the account officer if she is  immaterial immaterial mr chief justice i i withdraw that question mr chief justice anyway we will find that out in due time let me bring you now to exhibit avoid avoid immaterial uh avoid some uh objections based on immateriality so you can go and move faster i want to i know you can do that yes mr chief justice but it seems to me that uh-uh my esteemed colleague in the profession atty flami flaminiano is so sensitive to these instruments no it is not sensitivity i guess we try to save time  if your honor please  yes mr chief justice go direct to the point exhibit septuple f dash four uh and exhibit i 'm sorry uh and the submarked uh items marked exhibit septuple f dash two and septuple f dash three this is a microfilm copy of the check drawn by issued by governor luis chavit singson dated august twenty september twenty-nine nineteen ninety-nine for eight million payable to cash and uh signed by him now on exhibit septuple f dash three at the right side of this check numbers appear one six six eight two zero can you please explain to this honorable court what these numbers mean mr chief justice these are the subject of our stipulations not covered by the stipulation the witness may answer it is trying to explain an entry there okay uh it is bank practice that we always ensure that the account number is written at the back of the check to make sure that it is uh you know if there is uh audit trail that shows that where the check is being credited to just in case there are returns or are there are problems with the check we know where the account uh where the check belongs to your honor and whose account is this one six six eight two zero that has been admitted your honor admitted already in the stipulation stipulations yes mr chief justice uh the next question then is since the check was deposited to this account were the proceeds of this check credited to this account  the answer is very obvious   what is the objection  objection your honor what is the basis for being immaterial and for lack of basis overruled because of the grounds invoked uh yes your honor in the amount of how much uh just to qualify there were two checks that they but this one was an eight-million check your honor it was credited your honor and so since the deposit slip uh covered a total deposit of eight point four million the amount deposited or the amount credited total amount credited to the account of the first lady c a s a account number one six six eight two zero was how much

thank you mr chief justice uh mr chief justice and the honorable senator-judges we are offering the testimony of this witness to prove that number one in nineteen ninety-nine there were unusual movements in the price and trading volume of b w resources corporation which is now known as fairmont holdings incorporated one of the listed companies in the philippine stock exchange and that while b w resources was incurring losses in its operation its stocks went up second the compliance and surveillance group of the philippine stock exchange investigated these unusual price and volume movements third that the c s g or the compliance and surveillance group found that the unusual price and volume movements of b w was the result of price manipulation and insider trading by dante tan and his associates fourth the witness will explain specific acts of manipulation done by dante tan and show examples thereof fifth the results of the c s gs investigation are contained in an investigation report on b w resources corporation prepared by the witness principally sixth a copy of the report was given to president joseph ejercito estrada in malaca&ntilde;ang by mr jose luis nonoy yulo jr then president of the philippine stock exchange and the witness himself seventh the president defended dante tan eighth the president pressured then s e c chairman yasay and then philippine stock exchange president jose luis nonoy yulo jr to clear dante tan ninth in connection with the investigation of b w resources president estrada intimated to mr yulo and the witness during their audience with the president that dante tan paid then chairman yasay to have dante tan cleared in the b w scandal and tenth the witness resigned as vice-president and head of the c s g of the philippine stock exchange because he felt that the business conduct and ethics committee of the philippine stock exchange was about to whitewash the results of the c s g investigation particularly the participation of the brokers in the manipulative schemes of mr dante tan mr witness you stated that you were former vice-president and head of the compliance and surveillance group of the philippine exch stock exchange when did you occupy these positions since june nineteen ninety-seven until march seven two thousand your honor   and as head of the c s g or the compliance and surveillance group what were your principal duties and responsibilities the compliance and surveillance group of the p s e serves as in a way the police the policeman of the exchange we make sure that trading in the stock market is fair efficient and transparent that is my principal duty and in these duties i was assisted by three departments under my supervision your honor what were these three departments that you mentioned the compliance audit department which audits the books and records of all the brokers to make sure that clients are protected the special investigation department which handles investor complaints and conducts investigations when warranted and the market surveillance department which looks at the market monitors the market on a day-to-day basis to make sure that there are no price manipulation or insider trading activities and other trading-related anomalies going on your honor are you familiar with b w resources corporation yes your honor why are you familiar with that corporation because b w resources corporation is one of the listed companies of the philippine stock exchange moreover in nineteen ninety-nine when i was still head of the compliance and surveillance group we conducted an investigation of transactions involving b w resources corporation and why did you conduct such an investigation in nineteen ninety-nine b w was one of the most popular if not the most popular issue in the stock exchange its trading pattern was quite unusual there was unusual price and volume movements in fact it rose meteorically in nine in october nine in nineteen ninety-nine and plunged shortly thereafter we we conducted the investigation to determine if these unusual price and volume movements was simply the result of free market forces or whether it was due to insider trading activities or price manipulation your honor uh what power or authority did you have to conduct such investigation the philippine stock exchange is a self-regulatory organization which means to say that it has the power to police its own ranks and this power was vested by the securities and exchange commission in the exercise of this power it is the c s g that handles investigations whenever there are anomalies in the market aside from that your honor we received specific orders and instructions from the s e c to conduct an investigation your honor from what time to what time did you conduct this investigation we started the investigation in late may nineteen ninety-nine we completed the investigation in february two thousand at this point your honor i will be needing the exhibits but uh apparently the exhibits not yet ready not yet ready your honor we can probably suspend how much time would be needed  uh try to find out about fifteen minutes your honor about fifteen minutes so you are requesting for a suspension yes your honor  we are due for a recess   fifteen minutes  atty flaminiano we have no objection mr chief justice there being none uh the trial is suspended for fifteen minutes we will resume at uh five fifteen break  atty perez with the permission of the honorable chief justice and the honorable senator-judges we have caused to be distributed your honors copies of our exhibits with the exception of exhibit septuple seven which is currently being copied that uh exhibit your honor will be presented later and it is estimated that by the time i reach to septuple seven we would have uh m rather we would have finished with the other exhibits so, may i proceed your honor you may and uh for purposes your honor of pardon me mr chief justice yes uh what is the pleasure of atty daza yes uh in the meantime can we be furnished uh with copies of the you mean you were not given copies of the exhibits no not yet the defense should have been given first we 've just received a copy thank you mr chief justice uh your honor may we be allowed to set up the overhead project projector so that uh we will be able to show transparencies no objection there being none uh the request is granted mr witness you stated that you started the investigation of b w resources in may nineteen ninety-nine what were the circumstances that led to the investigation of the said b w resources in may nineteen ninety-nine the price of b w jumped from from a price of three ninety-five at uh the start of the month to eleven pesos by the end of may nineteen ninety-nine your honor this was quite unusual and this was coupled by the fact that the value turnover the volume and the value turnover of b w for that month was almost twice the volume during the previous four months starting from january february march up to april your honor do you have a table showing the price and volume movement of b w resources from january to june of nineteen ninety-nine yes your honor i 'm showing to you this document which for purposes of identification had previously been marked as exhibit septuple seven what is the relation of uh l rather l what is the relation of exhibit septuple l with the document that you mentioned  may i approach the witness your honor this is the table which i prepared your honor may i ask that the transparency of exhibit septuple l be shown in the overhead projector provide uh a seat to the young lady so we can also see from her from uh this distance will you please explain to us the movement of the price and also volume of b w stocks as shown in septuple l as i mentioned earlier your honor in may nineteen ninety-nine the price of b w which started at three ninety-five at the beginning of the month rose to eleven pesos per share at the end of the month and this is shown in the table marked as exhibit septuple l as you can also see from the table the volume turnover for that month was four hundred three million four hundred two thousand two hundred sixty-five which if compared with the volume turnover for the previous four months is more or less double the volume for the previous months your honor considering that there were no corporate disclosures during that month of any developments in the company that would create investor interest your honor the market surveillance department of the c s g thought that this price movement and volume movement in may nineteen ninety-nine was unusual and indicative of possible price manipulation or insider trading your honor and that is why we started conducting an investigation and reviewing transactions of b w and closely monitoring its price your honor considering that there were no disclosures made regarding the possible change in the prices of uh b w shares what was the effect of the changes in the price on the volume value and market capitalization of b w resources mr chief justice yes we have to object unless the proper qualification of the witness to answer this particular question is first laid may we inquire whether the witness is being presented as an expert witness on stock trading on stocks or is he being presented merely as an ordinary witness otherwise we will have to object to all these questions  the the witness was qualified earlier as to his position in the philippine stock exchange and uh the the functions uh of his office were you not satisfied with the definition of his functions i i am not really quite satisfied with uh his qualifications   then you can subject that on cross-examination later  thank you mr chief justice uh in case the witness has forgotten the question let me rephrase uh the question uh because of the volume of the transaction in b w shares what was the effect of that volume in the market capitalization of b w your honor the market capitalization of b w because of that increase in volume and value turnover also increased your honor and this is shown in another table which i prepared your honor and which has been marked as exhibit septuple l dash one your honor in septuple l dash one under the column volume there are figures indicated opposite the words january february march april may and june will you explain to us the meaning of those figures the the figures appearing in that column your honor is the volume of the transactions or the shares transacted during that month your honor in millions your honor and opposite the month and under the column value open parenthesis billions close parenthesis there are figures indicated could you explain to us the meaning of that that is the value of the transactions on b w during that month your honor and below the column rank there are figures appearing after each month from january to june could you explain to us the meaning of that the rank that appears here is the rank of b w among the top twenty listed companies in terms of trading value your honor uh with that as an expla explanation could you tell could you tell us the rank of b w resources as of january as reflected in exhibit quar septuple l dash one as shown in the exhibit your honor in january nineteen ninety-nine it was ranked sixteenth your honor how about in the month of june nineteen ninety-nine what was the ranking of b w resources in june it suddenly became rank number one your honor did you examine if there was a reason for this unusual movement of shares that was precisely your honor the subject of our investigation we wanted to find out if this unusual movement in the volume and price of b w was the result of simply free market forces or whether it was due to possible insider trading or price manipulation your honor in the course of your investigation did you come across the financial statements of b w resources corporation for the first quarter of nineteen ninety-nine yes your honor i 'm showing to you exhibit septuple l dash two which has been which is consisting of eight pages will you please tell us if what is the relation of this document

the profit and loss statement contained in the financial statements for the first quarter of nineteen ninety-nine of b w resources did you prepare the corresponding table showing the profit and loss statements of b w resources yes your honor we prepared the table showing the profit and loss statement of b w for the first quarter which we obtained from the exhibit marked as exhibit quintuple l dash two i 'm showing to you this document which has been previously marked as uh exhibit septuple l dash seventeen  what is the relation of this document with the profit and loss statement of b w for

Philippines	yes uh what is the pleasure of the honorable judge uh drilon yes uh this is in relation to the letter read by the senate president uh mr chief justice if i may while we are waiting for the before we start with the next witness your honor  uh the senate president read into the record the documents uh which uh witness carissa ocampo mentioned in the course of   clarissa  clarissa ocampo mentioned in the course of her testimony and indeed she said that she was going to produce these documents before this court uh first uh can the members of the court have copies of this uh uh second set of documents testified to by mrs ocampo and uh second uh your honor may we know if this is considered now as part of the testimony of mrs ocampo the chair would rule as to the first copies thereof will be given to the members of uh the court as to the second uh i think uh it might not be proper to consider it as part of the testimony of the witness taking into account that uh if you recall your honor there was a reservation earlier made by the honorable uh senator-judge roco for the production of the document the following day and uh the witness was supposed to come or to return to the witness stand the following day for that purpose but i understand that senator roco uh withdrew the reservation later on after conferring with your honor that is why we raised that question your honor precisely because i recall the manifestation of uh senator roco and uh i was the one who initially asked for these documents and atty roco precisely uh mentioned it also in the course of his intervention that is why i raised the issue as a matter of guidance for the members of this court your honor  yes  thank you your honor mr chief justice the honorable uh prosecutor apostol may we pray for substituting substitution of the assisting counsel instead of yours truly may we request that the assisting counsel be dean amado valdez and uh private counsels for the witnesses may i turn over now the microphone   prosecutor libarios may now proceed the the witness uh is warned that uh she would be testifying under the same oath may i now proceed uh mr chief justice you may now proceed uh ms witness yesterday you testified uh before this honorable uh impeachment court that sometime in october of nineteen ninety-nine you were asked to sign two uh articles of incorporation namely pio holding corporation and alexie holding corporation when these uh articles were presented for your signature did you have any participation in the preparation and drafting of these articles of incorporation and the other documents no the documents were all prepared uh in fact uh incorporation papers already contained the signatures of the other lawyers you also mentioned that it was upon the request of uh atty serapio coursed through the uh secretary and the assistant uh atty michael de los reyes that you acted on the uh articles of incorporation of these two corporations now at the time you signed these articles of incorporation was atty serapio already connected in malaca&ntilde;ang uh your honor i believe he was already uh appointed presidential adviser now after signing the articles of incorporation of the pio holdings and the alexie holdings what did you do if any after signing after signing well i uhm i remember uh atty de los reyes went back to me so i gave uh i gave the documents back to him as uh completely signed based on the uh articles of incorporation you appear to be one of the incorporators one of the five incorporators and one of the five members of the board aside from these uh two positions uh what other positions did you hold in these two corporations if any well uh in the incorporation papers it was also stated there that i was uh corporate secretary okay now uh when these incorporation papers were presented to you and one of the papers mentioned that you are a corporate secretary were you previously consulted that you will be listed as one as the corporate secretary of these two corporations uh no your honor may i call your attention uh ms witness to these uh two exhibits uh exhibits quadruple e and quadruple f referring to uh two certificates two secretary 's certificates  i would like you to examine carefully uh these two uh you cannot be heard uh mr counsel i 'd like you to examine carefully these two uh secretary 's certificates dated uh october nineteen ninety-nine uh bearing identical entries would you uh confirm that you signed these two uh secretary 's certificates yes i signed these uh certificates the same day i signed the incorporation papers in this uh secretary 's certificate uh duly marked exhibit quadruple e louder please speaker d blows into the microphone  in this secretary 's certificate secretary certificate uh duly marked as exhibit quadruple e there appears an entry which states that the corporation is authorized to negotiate for the purchase of the shares of stocks of r n development corporation at the time you signed this uh certificate secretary 's certificate did you know that r n development corporation was actually the owner operator of the fontana leisure parks no no basis whatsoever your honor the objection is sustained no basis okay uh did you have any prior knowledge about this r n development corporation when you signed this secretary 's certificate none your honor and uh let me call your attention also to the next paragraph after that it states here that uh resolved that the acting executive vice-president uh mr leonardo b dayao is authorized to negotiate sign execute and deliver for and in behalf of the corporation all the documents necessary to effect the foregoing resolution particularly the purchase of the r n development corporation when you signed this secretary 's certificate did you know this assist acting executive vice-president mr leonardo b dayao who was authorized to negotiate for the purchase of uh the r n development corporation your honor please the question is irrelevant uh precisely the resolution authorizes uh the axec executive vice-president to to negotiate to sign and execute in behalf of the corporation relating to the purchase of the shares the objection uh is sustained but not for the reason given but uh for the reason that the best evidence is the document itself your honor please uh what we are trying to this is a motion for reconsideration your honor what the prosecution is trying to establish now is that these corporations are nothing but dummy corporations set up to acquire the r n development corporation   then go direct to the point  and your honor please while it is true that the document is the best evidence but whether or not the corporate secretary knows the identity of this cert leonardo b dayao is an independently relevant statement your honor that transcends beyond the existence of this particular document so you are offering the same as an independently relevant statement yes your honor it has a significance uh then with more reason that the objection should be sustained go direct to the point your honor please uh we would uh i would like to uh make a particular tender of proof in this particular case your honor make the tender of proof that if the witness is asked about this atty leonardo b dayao the witness does not actually know this person who was authorized in this document as the uh person to negotiate for the purchase of the r n development corporation and she does not know anything about this particular purchase your honor let the proffer of proof stay on record now aside from these two documents the uh alexie holdings incorporated which were already identified yesterday and uh stipulations were already made as to the existence of these two documents and of course including the authenticity of the signatures i presume of these uh two documents both for the alexie holdings incorporated and the uh pio holdings uh corporation now aside from these documents uh ms witness can you uh tell us if you executed any other document in relation to these two corporations yes i also signed uh blank deed of assignment what do you mean by blank deed of assignment  the the name of the assignee and the date of the document were uh both left in blanks and uh what did you assign in in those blank deed of assignments the best evidence is the document there is an objection the best evidence is the document sustained your honor please uh we do not have the documents right now then lay the basis for the for uh evidence tending toward that direction you said that uh you signed a blank deed of assignments where is that document indicating uh your signature in that blank deed of assignments same objection your honor chuckle  where is the signature obviously it 's in the document where is the document now uhm the chair should first make a ruling sustained make another question uh ms uh witness you testified earlier that you signed a blank deed of assignment now my question is uh where is that document now that blank deed of assignment i do not know your honor after you signed that blank deed of assignment to whom did you turn over that blank deed of assignment also to atty michael de los reyes and what did you assign in those uh blank deed of assignments the best evidence is the document chuckle  sustained your honor please uh considering the the chair will not recommend to you what to do but you know how to establish secondary evidence whenever the document cannot be produced that is correct your honor we have already laid down the basis that the documents are in the possession of atty michael de los reyes and this atty michael de los reyes is actually working as an asses assistant of atty edward serapio so we cannot produce these documents right now your honor and we are still in the process of   you were the one saying it let it come from the witness so you could ask for the next question that is why your honor our next our last question was what did you assign in in the blank deed of assignments even if it is well objectionable i will not object anymore so that since this is supposed to be the last question   the objection is withdrawn  the witness may now answer the question what did you assign i assigned my shares uh in the two companies how about the other incorporators did you know if they also executed similar deed of assignments over the shares in the uh corporation i would assume that they uh also signed those uh documents what do you mean i would assume  the normal practice in that law firm was for the in case the lawyers were to act as incorporators they would sign the incorporation documents simultaneously with the deeds of trust so i would assume that that was what happened in this case now after the corporations were registered and you mentioned also that uh you were the incorporator and a member of the board in these two corporations now uh can you recall if you were notified of any meeting or activity of these two corporations well after i signed those documents i was not notified of any further activity or event and you also mentioned that you were assign also designated as a corporate secretary of these two corporations and uh do you remember if you executed a document in relation to your being corporate secretary of these two corporations uhm when i resigned from the law firm of uh de borja medialdea i also tendered my resignation as corporate secretary for the two corporations and to whom did you submit your letter of resignation as corporate secretary i submitted them to atty de los reyes thank that is all for the witness your honor cross-examination uh with the permission of the court uh atty banal uh for how long did you work uh with the law office of de borja medialdea i worked there for one year and eight months and uh you were assigned to the corporate department yes your honor and uh in that corporate department uh it is uh usual practice to prepare articles of incorporation in which members of the firm are named as incorporators and as members of the board is it not yes your honor and uh so what you did in this particular case is uh usual practice in that firm yes your honor and that uh when a client comes and then uh needs a corporation uh uh corporations which had been previously organized are made available is it not yes your honor and that when the client uh decides to utilize that corporation all of the members of the firm who were designated incorporators and members of the board uh execute deeds of assignment in favor of the nominees of the client is it not yes and that is usual and standard practice yes nothing wrong with that is it not none you would not engage in anything that is illegal is it not no and that is that is perfectly legal is it not the incorporation yes yes thank you very much no more no further questions any questions from the members of the impeachment court two re-direct questions your honor no no not yet  the agreement uh among the members of the impeachment court is immediately after the cross-examination the majority leader speaks  you will allow re-direct okay re-direct first so attor so prosecutor libarios is recognized for some re-direct questions in this particular thank you your honor in this particular case uh ms witness regarding the incorporation of uh the pio holding and the alexie holding corporation there was no client who appeared before you and it was only atty serapio who requested for these two corporations am i correct improper for re-direct your honor  i did not cover that at all   improper for re-direct  the objection is sustained your honor please uh there was a statement in the cross-examination which tried to create the impression that uh everything was regular in this particular case that was the answer given by the witness   but uh in this particular case your honor what we are trying to elicit that no principal actually revealed himself to the witness except atty serapio who at that time was already working in malaca&ntilde;ang so we believe your honor this particular line of question would somehow clarify that particular point that was raised during the cross-examination your honor if your honor please uh probably it should be noted that the witness is uh was but an associate or an assistant in that firm and clients do not deal with the assos associates or assistants and that was that is why that was not covered by the cross-examination all that uh was covered by the cross-examination was whether this having uh uh members of the firm sign as incorporators and directors is usual practice  then let the witness 
Philippines	mrs witness who was atty fernando chua as introduced to you by mr go atty fernando chua according to mr go represents a certain uh principal or client of the bank who wants to lend to a corporation using his personal funds mr chief justice yes we will have to move to strike out the answer of the witness on what ground on the ground in the first place that it is hearsay and that the answers sure to be elicited are not covered by any of the paragraphs of the second article of impeachment if your honor please uh the private prosecutor adverted to the fact that uh he wants to prove that the president accumulated unexplained wealth that is what i gathered from uh his statement just a while ago but the allegation is this your honor the president by that sworn statement also committed perjury and the offense of unexplained wealth because this is the this is the point your honor because records show that he and his wife and mistresses and their children have other assets in other companies outside of the three firms listed in his statement of assets and liabilities  those are the only assets that that had been read into the records already yes your honor that is why the tendency of the question now is to elicit the answers that will not be evidentiary of what has been alleged in the articles of impeachment so it there could be some kind of evidentiary value but the it is the manner of presenting it yes your honor the counsel should uh do it in such a way that he 'll be able to link it if he wants to unless you 'll be able to establish that linkage the chair will have to sustain the objection your honor please if we will be allowed to proceed we will establish the linkage you may nobody 's preventing you from uh proceeding but uh do it in such a way that you would be avoid you you 'll be able to avoid objections your honor the objection was hearsay i think it is baseless well uh you want the the chair now to make a ruling on that the fact that the witness heard  it is uh the the the chair will have to sustain it is hearsay but you can do something about it your your honor it is independently relevant because the witness is merely test testifying to what was told to her if it is only offered therefore as an uh independently relevant statement the answer may remain but that should not be taken as evidence on proof   yes we agree your honor thank you  and mrs ocampo did mr go identify the borrower of the amount of five hundred million pesos we 'll have to maintain the same objection for being immaterial and irrelevant your honor objection overruled thank you your honor uhm mr go mentioned that the borrower is wellex group incorporated mr chua then followed through by saying that it is wellex group because the principal is very close to mr gatchalian and uhm wants to uh help him we 'll have to move to strike out mr chief justice the answer of the witness what is the basis on the ground that it uh it calls for hearsay evidence your honor as it is on it calls for hearsay evidence not that it was hearsay it is hearsay your honor actually overruled thank you your honor part of the narration of the witness thank you your honor and did mr did atty fernando chua mrs ocampo advise you on when this loan transaction was supposed to be completed uhm that uh we met on february third two thousand he mentioned that the loan five hundred million should be released on or before twelve noon the next day february fourth two thousand what instructions if any did mr go give you with respect to the proposed loan transaction of the principal of atty chua mr chief justice we have to object again on the ground that uh it does not have a tendency to connect the testimony of the witness to any of the paragraphs of article two was the object  the articles of impeachment  wha what 's the comment of the presenting counsel it 's independent it 's independently relevant your honor based on the same ruling of the chair  ho how ju just to avoid further objection later on ho would you try to give us an idea how it is how it would become relevant or material because the documents that will uh for this purpose uh can we require the parties to approach the bench  atty mendoza and who else for the defense pause of several minutes gavel  the session is now resumed  is there a pending question atty bautista or a pending objection may we proceed your honor on another point you may proceed go direct to the point yes your honor mrs ocampo as trust officer of the p c i of the equitable p c i bank are you aware of an account a trust account in the name of jose velarde yes mr chief justice we have to object to the question for lack of basis and for being immaterial and irrelevant it is not alleged uh it has no tendency to prove any of the allegations in article two of the articles of impeachment yesterday the court uh opened uh the sealed envelope uh containing that particular account so as to the first basis uh overruled as to the second basis may be preliminary thank you mr chief justice thank you your honor yes i 'm aware of an account in the name of jose velarde can you explain to us in brief the circumstances on how you came to know about the account of jose velarde mr chief justice i 'm sorry i have to object again unle  unless they present the proper basis lay the basis because there is no

page one set of the all one set of the uh documents because i could not uh affix my signature in all of the xerox copies your honor the defense would have would be entitled to uh receive the copies of

the initialed document yes uh your honors  1 word of the defense uh of the prosecution that it will be submitted as uh uh it would be subjected to the condition that if once there is a a connection or once it would establish an allegation then it would stand if it will not then it has to be expunged from the record and that should be very made uh it should be clear to all parties concerned if you if the prosecution cannot make any connection direct or indirect the testimony would be stricken off the record and expunged therefrom yes your honor but that connection may not necessarily be established through this witness that connection could be done through other witnesses through other evidence we would like to present the statement of assets of liabilities of the president which is a public record which says that he only has thirty-five million pesos your honor and if it is proven as the witness has already proven that the president owns the jose velarde account which on this one sole transaction alone involved five hundred million pesos well you can go forward with your evidence later on to remove uh the effect of uh a a conditional uh evidence thank you your honor  on each of these investment management agreements the senator uh judge uh drilon there was a pending question which was not answered your honor how far was the witness was from the president the records  words  uh well i understand there was a pending question but uh the counsel uh abandoned it and made another question there there was no manifestation to that effect well the it was uh we leave it to the prosecution what uh the prosecution should do thank you may i reiterate my former question mrs ocampo how far away were you from the president when he affixed the signature of jose velarde on each

million loan from the bank and the president of the bank is their partner i but you see our agreement is he is supposed to give me thirty million equity they start uh developing the property and getting everything in the property but they don't give me the money  so as far as i 'm concerned i do not have any agreement with them they are spending hundreds of thousands of pesos already but they had not given me yet the money therefore our transaction is not yet finish they should have given me the first agreement of thirty million pesos uh equity that is uh last week but the pa they continue developing the property making some ground planning and operation but yet ha they had not paid us yet uh i had been informed that this buyer is interested of the property because they want to give give uh get that as golf yes now i had been telling you that mr chanco and mr  greg see of the philippine bank owner and president is going to make that as a golf yes speaker c speaks to somebody over

million pesos you tell him that you part  yes i know that i had been informed he informed me that he has two hundred million now approved okay now uh will you please tell him because you are now in access with him that atty musclares is waiting for that ten million he promised me yesterday okay mr manzano  uh so it is really phone rings a very small world  ano  this is i see mr gozon is very very happy here that you uh that the transaction is closed laughter  yes yes i will take good care of it okay follow this up for me okay thank you very much mr uh bye  talking to people in office first concern niya  we are the one who make the project study and feasibility study of mr chanco who submitted it already in bank and there is an approval of the two hundred million already for this property  so that is the situation at present sir what will happen to the letter of authority now uh look never mind mr chanco want to develop the property into golf if he will not pay me i 'll sell it to manzano  the same plan okay because i do not care for mr chanco as long as he doesn't pay me yeah first come first served yes yes if uh you you tell mr manzano if he will mr  chanco will not pay me until tomorrow morning the the deal is off so mr manzano can buy my property okay he pay me twenty million thirty million pesos tomorrow i 'll i 'll sign the agreement it 's not manzano who is the buyer yes whoever is the ano uh  according to him it is a uh ano uh siguro uh sa nangyayari dito ngayon mr chanco is lalabas dito mr manzano is the developer now they had made an arrangement with the bank and according to mr  manzano there is an approval of the two hundred million that is to confirm also chanco told me two days ago now with chanco now entertaining the japanese that might be with our plan with chanco because we become here a partner with mr chanco as long as he give me the thirty million pesos requirement equity now if the japanese will pay him this twenty million dollar of the finished golf then the obligation we got with the bank will be paid automatically and manzano might be there inside now if mr chanco will not make good on his commitment to me i can deal directly to manzano with this authority through you mr gozon okay so i am not afraid with anybody i 'll give you the authority first come first serve five percent uh over price  there must be this phone rings and is only for one week  talks to secretary you give mr gozon only one week time to transact we cannot wait that much ano uh kwan only one week uh nette ilagay mo this authority is only good for one week uh because if it is true na manzano is inside and he they are going to buy me out because of the loan approval uh okay lang yan sa akin   words okay lang 'yan sa akin  because uh the way i look at it they they make me as a the pawn of the transaction hindi ba  the most important to me i can use my money for another purpose okay  ngayon only five days  commission  five days uh five days only five days i mean mr gozon that will also drive everybody to close the transaction remember na i gave you this authority because of  pakiusap ni mrs galido yeah i do not give that authority anymore now kapag nagkaipitan tayo ng panahon at nakita kong maganda ang lakad ng inyong transaction i can extend it to you okay just for the meantime place there only five days so today is twenty-two it will terminate on the twenty-seventh  okay to twenty nine twenty nine no five days uh wala namang kwenta 'yon tingnan no binigyan ako ng special authority dito mabasa man ni chanco 'yon hindi ako mapapahiya  because sabihin ko sa kaniya eh hinantay kita na bigyan mo ako ng kuwarta kahapon hindi di i opened it to the market again no okay that will be the situation okay five six only five days  hindi pa tapos laughter   hindi pa tapos tatapusin natin  sir nagmamadali rin naman si mr manzano  so five days is okay yes you see the advantages of this five days conse   kuwan authority is uh upon presentation of that authority to your buyer the that will be in black and white that you are only given five days as a concession of mrs galido now without them to execute uh we lost the transaction now kung halimbawa naman nasa in na kayo  we are we are there are just a little thing to be ironed out and the five days had run out i will be kind enough to extend you another uh so many days  iniisip ko sir baka si mr chanco baka isa siya sa group kasi mr manzano is only a trustee uh i the way i look at it he told me nga   he is one of my partner and besides we had been to lunch today and uh we are the one making his project study   kasi ho gusto ho naming gusto ho naming pasyalan 'yung lugar kasama namin si   mr chanco  mr manzano  mr manzano no mr chanco just come in  mga fifteen days ago with his wife and children  because he is associated i think he is the balae  of of uh george see of the philippine bank the owner of the ano and then he has an arrangement also with the philippine national bank through lopez  so there might be some sort of arrangement so what is important to me is to finish the transaction uh chanco will call for me because mr manzano  will contact chanco  i told him let chanco know that i am only giving him until tomorrow for the ten million if not i will accept anybody uh  ano  if they will see your authority then i he can i can tell him  na well i gave that authority first come first serve uh because i need the money very badly   fifteen days ago ha 
Philippines	good afternoon doctor good afternoon mr gonzales uh is there anything i can do for you today yes doctor i have this bad cough i see uh okay why don't we start up with how old are you right at this moment i 'm eighteen years old okay eighteen and are you married no not yet are you uh what religion do you belong to i 'm a catholic okay and uh where do you reside uh i reside at b f homes para&ntilde;aque is this your first time you ever sought consult with me yes doctor okay so what 's your chief complaint what 's wrong what do you feel right now i have been coughing for a week now and i am having a hard time talking 'cause there 's this phlegm in my throat okay so your chief complaint is cough and okay let 's move on to your uhm the history of your present illness and according to you it 's been for a week now could you could you go through this uh uh on detail what happened first did you have cough at first or did you have any fever back then i first had this cold okay yeah and then a slight fever so you had a low-grade fever a week ago let 's start okay seven days ago you had colds yes uhm did you have any cough with this at that time uhm no not that time it was around two days after okay did you have a sore throat with it yeah okay you had difficulty swallowing uh-huh i had a hard time eating okay and uh any fever not then no no fever okay now six days ago uh the same symptoms persisted right yes doctor did you have any uh cough then no no so you just had cough five days ago yeah okay let 's say five days ago was the cough dry or was it productive of phlegm yeah it was i had phlegm did the fever persist until this day no not much just the cough so you didn't have any fever anymore did your fever so your fever word but you had cough and phlegm yeah what was the color of the phlegm would you say at first it was white okay whitish then after two days it turned into green okay so uhm three days ago you noticed your phlegm to have changed to green and uh i suppose you had fever at this time uh-huh yeah okay it was how would you say it was high-grade or moderate-grade low-grade it was a high grade okay was it persistent did it persist the whole day or uh did it go down it went down did you take any uh medications with this yes doctor for fever i suppose yes okay so that 's the reason why it went down okay uhm so you 're presenting here with cough of a week 's duration enunciated by colds fever uh moderate to high grade and you 'd say that the cough is productive of greenish phlegm uh uhm okay based on this alone i could tell you that you 've had a bacterial bacterial infection which most probably would be causing your fever and that will be persistent and the only reason why your fever had gone down first time was because of the analgesic you took and uh anti-pyretic  so let 's move on to your past history uh would you have any hypertension no diabetes no asthma no were you ever hospitalized before no how about operated on no okay uhm do you have any smoking history yes uh how much do you smoke i smoke around five sticks a day for how long now uhm three years three years okay and do you have any alcoholic beverage intake no not much just a bit i drink occasionally when there 's you know okay occasionally for how long now uhm about four five years uh uhm so i presume you 're a college student yeah okay and in your family history do you have any heredity  familial diseases like asthma no is there any diabetes yes there is uh who has diabetes in the family my mother okay uh hypertension no any uh any family member with tub uh tuberculosis no okay how about heart diseases no cancer no none of that seizures no uhm okay so i guess i just have to do a little physical examination on you now yeah would it be hard for me no uh that 's no problem so i would just be seated for a while and i 'll proceed with my examination thank you doctor okay uh would you please take a deep breath speaker a takes a deep breath  okay uhm i see that uh your sclera aren't uh yellowish your conjunctiva are pink uhm you have some lymph nodes here on your neck and please open your mouth uh opens his mouth  okay that 's good and uh i could see that your tonsils are inflamed and they 're word so that 's another sign of infection plus the lymph nodes on your neck what is the lymph nodes mean i mean uh uh it 's just a it just accounts more for uh the fact that you have a bacterial infection and the lymph nodes are swollen at this moment so you have an active infection going on right now okay uh take another deep breath please speaker a takes a deep breath  okay that 's good now you 're you have uh equal and symmetrical expansion of your chest and you don't have any retractions in your inter-coastal  spaces uh apparently i hear some fine rals in the base in your lung bases uhm this could be this could be the reason for your production of phlegm okay i 'll just listen to your heart uh uhm  well the it 's normal rate regular rhythm you don't seem to have any murmurs uh uhm okay uhm let me just palpate your stomach for a while  listen to it  okay as i 've observed that your abdomen is flat it 's firm you don't have any organo- word  i don't see any organo- word  i don't feel any organo- word no masses and apparently it 's not tender organo- what well it just means that you don't have any enlarged uh organs abnormally enlarged organs ah your pulses are full and equal and you don't have any edema okay that 's good well with uh based on my history and physical examination mr gonzales uh i would say you have an upper respiratory tract infection prior to which you had an acute tonsil or pharyngitis uh i 'd advise you to definitely stop smoking and uh kind of abstain from the alcohol uhm and i 'll just have to prescribe you some antibiotics some anti-pyretics for this and uh i 'll just have to ask you to follow up in a week okay sir yeah sure doctor if you say so  okay  it 's just an upper respiratory tract infection but uh make sure you don't take it for granted you might have uh pneumonia later on oh okay okay thank you very much doctor good day sir yeah have a nice day too  could you explain to me the use of this f r solution for uh canal filling uh yes i think i have uh tried it to my patient already and uh it seems that the uh the prognosis was very good and uh i would like to orient you with this also you see when we use uh antiphormine instead of oxidol we neutralize it with oxidol because uh it might cause degeneration of f r and secondly we have to take note that uh f r calcium hardens more quickly when the temperature and humidity is high in the operatory uh that is also the reason why uh why f r solution are kept in uh in uh dark bottles because of the alcohol content of this uh f r solution there is a possibility that it will then evaporate quickly so we have to be sure that uh uh when we use it be sure that uh when you cover it again the cap should be tightly closed and the uh because of air or moisture which causes degeneration of f r powder you should see to it also that uh the cap of the powder is uh thoroughly closed does this harden the f r with the powder if you if you mix the f r with powder and liquid does it harden how many minutes or seconds well it would take around uh five minutes inside the uh the uh pulp canal before it hardens   uhm uh uhm and uh and anyway it does not harden really that hard but uh you can uh uhm if you want to clean again the canal you can easily scrape it out  uh uhm  uh you can remove it yeah using the uhm what do you call this the uh ribber how do you how do you mix this do you use metal or uh well in my case i just use uhm metal and glass slab yeah metal and uh metal spatula uhm metal then mix the powder in the liquid in the glass slab uh uhm how long will it take for the for mixing maybe uh three seconds uhm it is very easy to mix such a solution  do you know already the the direction uh for use how 's the ratio uh-huh the ratio for using the powder and liquid one is to one uhm then you mix it uniformly either in the mixing pan  or in the glass slab but in my case i use i use the glass slab for mixing how do you apply it to the canal you you make use of the uh word and then uh fill the canal and uh tightly and be sure that the canal is uh well filled up  word is uh what i am using i don't know in your case you can uh use the the instrument of your choice uhm either liqui ei either metal or uh what 's this plastic plastic uh uhm we usually use word which is made of metal metal uh uhm spring type metal like a carrier uh uhm yeah like that  and by the way you 'd be you don't have any problem regarding the overflowing of the uh acetyl solution or of the of the said mixture in the apical foramen uhm because it will uh just uh serve as 2 words uh just like the vitatex yeah like vitatex uhm the only difference of that is vitatex is more on  uh it is premixed already  in the mixing  uh uhm and it has what we call an antibiotic property how about this f uh f r no antibiotics it 's more of a bactericidal and the essence of this the the essence itself of the solution is enough to to clean the gangrenous canal uhm how about in cases where uh there is a severe pain can we use this uh liquid f r for uh treatment i don't think so because it does not have any analgesic effect uhm so i did not try using it to my patient uhm this is only totally for root canal root canal treatment  we use it mostly we also use it both for vital and non-vital pulp how about in gangrenous pulp yeah same it is uh effective in in gang both gangrenous and non-gangrenous pulp in the case of gang of uh vital uh pulp you uh sterilize the canal first uhm then you let it dry like what you are using the same procedure when you uhm use the other medicines of your choice 'no uh uhm but since you are asking me regarding f r maybe it i might as well tell you also the the uhm procedure okay uhm then after sterilizing you make use of the word  again and then half fill the the uh rim portion of the canal cover it with the solution of uh f r then after that you seal it with the cement uh can you seal it immediately after putting the f r or after a few days after you have maybe after uhm a few days   twenty-four hours  first you let the cement dry to settle first   oo  and then put the permanent filling yes any permanent filling can be used as long as you have the uh   word  yeah as long as you have the uhm base you put base uh i think the uh after the f r if it dries you can put the permanent filling uh uh uh uhm uh uh ei ei either there is no base uh no no no you have to put first the the base the base before you make use of your uh permanent filling   composite or amalgam maybe with with amalgam  uh no no no both composite and amalgam there is a need for a base  just to be sure  uhm  like bicarb  that is if we are referring to a vital porchotomy   oo  but for for non-vital it 's okay you can use it  directly   directly uh uhm what else uh i also have a case here uh i would like also to ask your opinion about my uh uhm case wherein there is what we call uh an impacted uh tooth 'no  was that upper lower molar upper and then uh wisdom it is uh yeah it is bothering now my patient since you are more uh uhm well-versed in surgery i would like to ask your opinion also regarding this and in fact this is the x-ray uhm so maybe can you orient me with the treatment  uh that is the x-ray uh this is is this upper yeah upper upper first molar  upper   uh no upper third molar impacted   upper third molar  but you see there is eh second uh molar overlapping the the the uh what you call this the wis   yeah the wisdom tooth  wisdom  so how are you

thirty-nine thirty-nine thirty-nine you have a fever that means you have an infection what do you feel what are your complaints uhm headaches you have a headache what else headaches muscle pain muscular pain muscular pain muscular pain what else uh uhm and uhm i feel extremely hot feverish and you 're sick of school ha  uh i have a cold uh you have a cold you also have a cold okay let me take a look at your throat say ah ah are you coughing uhm a bit a bit  i 'll take a look at your lungs uh turn around your back you have to breathe hard inhale exhale ha  go ahead okay okay  results are okay you have no other signs and symptoms so most probably you have what you have is the flu influenza now let me explain what is influenza influenza is a viral infection  now when you say you have a viral infection there are two connotations okay one connotation is it 's contagious  and that 's the reason why i 'm going to give you a note and you 're supposed to go home to see your doctor okay  now another connotation of influenza would be it means that there is no medicine that can kill the the causative organism the virus because it 's a viral infection therefore the treatment would uh be the treatment is geared only towards alleviating your symptoms if you have a fever take something for fever if you 're coughing take something for cough and uh you have to rest and take plenty of fluids so i 'm sending you home with one slip i 'll give you the slip okay now when you come back get the slip from us i would want to make sure it 's no longer contagious at any rate see your doctor  now sometimes your doctors will give you antibiotics now you may ask why  antibiotics are supposed to kill bacteria not viruses but the reason why your doctor might sometimes give you antibiotic is to prevent bacterial complications that might kill you like bronchopneumonia meningitis okay so by the way the longer you stay in campus the more people will get your disease  so this is the note okay break in recording  i have a sore throat doc you have a sore throat do you think you have the flu just a sore throat have you had your temperature taken by the nurse yes i how how high how high is it  sabi niya sa 'kin thirty-seven it 's thirty-seven eksakto   thirty-seven that 's not a fever probably it 's beginning the beginning of something may i see your throat  say ah is it painful when you swallow  uhm  yes it 's your tonsils that is inflamed sir i have a test i have to get the ano  i should get an excuse you have a test you 're not coughing ha no i 'll just check your lungs i 'll just check your lungs turn around your back have a seat have a seat have a seat just turn you around okay inhale exhale again inhale exhale  breathe  your lungs are okay your tonsils are inflamed and they 're swollen  so most probably you are coming up with an acute tonsillitis now what is it it is supposed to be a bacterial infection now the treatment for that is the antibiotics  we do not carry antibiotics in the clinic so you have to get them yourself so see your doctor ha  and i 'm sure your doctor will prescribe some antibiotics  uh uhm antibiotics  sir in the meantime what you can get from the nurse are lozenges we have some lozenges that will allay the pain how about the certificate certificate for what certificate for what sir i 'll be excused from my quiz in my subject you have one more subject actually i have a class uh you go to your doctor right away ha  sir so would this be valid i don't know an absence is an absence  uh sir how about the although this is uh i suppose this will justify your being absent but you 're still absent yeah yes so you 're going mumbling not clear on tape  yes before you leave you ask for a a lozenge from the nurse ha and then see your doctor right away okay  break in recording  and what and we would like to uh make an interview about uhm the thing the things that uh that surrounds us our health and uhm  word  the common the common layman 's belief is even hepatitis b is ang kamalian nila they think if you have hepatitis b it 's fatal it 's not fatal only less than five percent die of the disease even hepatitis b even hepatitis more so in a a is the mild form usually they 'yon atang pumatay  naku sira yata 'yong ano yong tinape yon ba ewan ko kung yan  it 's not a fatal disease what makes it serious especially hepatitis b is statistics will show you that if you have had hepatitis b especially b ha  although a is included twenty to twenty-five years later twenty-five percent will develop liver cancer or liver cirrhosis these are incurable diseases in other words you die hmmmh so in other words if you have a history of hepatitis a or b more so in b one out of five will develop eventually later in life twenty or thirty years later they will develop liver carcinoma or or uh liver cirrhosis these are fatal diseases so that 's what makes it serious that 's what makes it serious is it incurable not cirrhosis is a liver disease that 's incurable cancer is incurable di ba  cancer is well cancer is curable there 's a com mistaken belief that cancer is not curable cancer is curable but the point is you 've got to catch it at the beginning at the start tumor but usually uh cancer you you only spot it or you discover it when it 's already in the advanced stage benign because usually if it 's beginning you don't exhibit any symptoms so you will not know you have it uh karamihan lang nasi- save na kanser sa babae kasi ang sa babae madaling ma- discover e kagaya ng kanser ng breast nakakapa mo yan kapag may maliit na bukol   ang sa lalaki nasa loob paano mo mapa palagay mo  cancer of the lungs paano mo makakapa kung maliit lang  wala ka namang maramdaman di ba   kaya malalaman mo lang pag malaki na madami ng  symptoms advanced stage  kaya magpapa- physical eksamen yan gagamitin itong kwarto  i could not sleep at night nahihirapan akong huminga  and i have uh had asthma for some time  i had it when i was a child but it recurred about ten years ago then sometime in november i got hospitalized but recently i got better until the last past day uh with regards to your difficulty of breathing now do you have accompanying symptoms like cough fever or sweat uh night chills uh do you have it no uh simple breathing problem  when when you were hospitalized last november what uh laboratory parameters were done to you well i had uh an x-ray and then uh uh i i don't recall if my blood was taken and then i had an x-ray uh huh what was your blood pressure then i think it was normal uh huh but uh i i remember they took my uh my breath a a breathing test maybe they they counted how many times uh what my pulse rate was but i don't recall anymore uh-hmmmh so what was your blood pressure then i think it was normal 'no about a hundred forty to ninety only okay i have to examine your chest   maybe a little less than that   i have to examine your chest right now   less than that  it looks like you 're having some wheezes on your chest so it looks like you 're still having some episodes of asthma  your heart looks okay regular heart beat breathing okay so we 'll still consider this is still an asthma oh i 'll give you what what medications did you take in  what medications   i am taking budesonide initial spray and mouth uh medication like what it 's like a spray budesonide also uh budesonide okay so okay this is what i we will do we 'll recommend you and i 'll write this all here for your instructions so you will do it continue with this and you need this exa and we will and we will observe it then  uh-hmmmh  you can come back after one week uh-hmmmh but i can call you back if i if i need   oh yes definitely  so okay you take this 
Philippines	okay okay melanie please sit over here and let me take that seat over there so what we 're going to do today is to fit your new contact lenses i 'll also be teaching you the proper way to handle to handle your new lenses doc would it hurt i mean the lenses would it hurt  well maybe a little at first but you 'll get used to it after awhile i guess what you should expect when i first insert the contact lens is that you would feel like as if a dust particle has entered your eye  para ka lang napuwing  you would feel tears in your eyes and may be a little dazzled by light it sounds worst than what i 'm going through with the glasses right now actually what you would experience is the normal reaction of our eyes it 's our sort of protective mechanism but it would only be temporary there 's nothing to worry about okay now the first thing you should do is learn how to insert and remove your contact lenses since i prescribed you with uh daily wear contact lens you should remove it clean it every night  let me show you how to insert your contact lens okay first thing is uh you should check if your lens is on the right side this is the way to do it hold it between your thumb and index finger and hold it like this if the edges turns away from each other then your lenses are on the wrong side but if it turns over like this it 's on the right side did you see the difference yes good now if you happen to get the contact lens into your eye while it is in on the wrong side don't panic it would feel uncomfortable so all you have to do is remove it turn it to the right side and reinsert it okay so let me insert the contact lens first okay now let 's try it with the right eye  now what i want you to do is to relax look straight ahead  that 's it look a little bit upward okay now don't blink there how does it feel a little weird but everything 's clear when i cover my left eye melanie if upon insertion of the contact lens you would feel that your vision is quite blurred what you should do is close your eyes and rub your eyelids lightly like this okay okay now if vision is still blurred and you feel uncomfortable remove the contact lens because most likely there 's something or some sort of particle inside your eye so what you should do is clean your contact lens again before re-insertion you understand yes so do you have any question so far regarding the insertion of your contact lens none okay  now i 'll be teaching you how to remove your contact lens then later you 'll have to be uh practicing removal and insertion of your contact lens alone okay okay so what you 're going to do right now is uh again look straight ahead  now don't blink  there we already removed it  how does it feel fine actually melanie 'no uh having your optometrist remove remove your contact lens is very easy pero  the problem lies in the fact that you have to do it by yourself  di ba   kasi siyempre alangan naman i 'll always be there to remove and insert laughs your contact lens so you 'll have to learn to do it yourself so what you have to do is when removing your contact lens for the right eye you have to use your left hand okay hold your upper eyelid like this and using your fing  uh middle finger for the right hand hold your lower eyelid like this now what you should do is use your thumb and index finger of the right hand and pull out the contact lens that 's it do you think you can do it i think so okay just relax melanie is this the way to do it yes just go on  i can't seem to get it in just relax and try it again  now slowly okay slowly there  ayan i got it in now does it hurt not really okay so is your vision clear yes it doesn't feel uncomfortable or anything well a little but tolerable good so basically that 's it so now you might as well try removing it okay concentrate slowly now pull it up there good now a little more practice and you you 'll be like a pro i want you to try wearing your contact lens for the for at least two hours and then increase your wearing schedule by four hours every day until your eyes can totally accept the contact lens now be sure to clean your contact lenses every day and everything will be okay now if you should have any problem regarding your contact lens you might as well drop by the clinic or you can maybe call me up okay okay thanks a lot doc okay you 're welcome   sige may

Philippines	uh this will just be an informal meeting uh because the lasallian ambassador group is a big group so we 're about a total of sixty plus close to seventy with the old members right so this is my uh way of getting to know everybody or each of one of you personally so because of my past experiences for the past three years in the lasallian ambassadors i see them come and go and then i really don't know them personally i just know them by face or i just know them by uhm by what they do but not actually personally but how they are what do they do what are their strengths etcetera and so since you 're a new member could you just possibly introduce yourself to me say something a little about yourself  yeah  uh well uh i 'm a second year applied economics and accountancy student uh   uh-huh  so actually uh whenever i say my course a lot of the other students come to a shock but then for me it 's not a very big deal   because uhm  uh-huh  why why are they in a shock laughs  i don't know because well the course is challenging   i find myself really challenged mentally and physically challenged with all the things like right now i 'm still on my second year and we 're already on our major subjects and by next year we 'll be having our thesis for economics at the same time   uh-huh   uh-huh   uh-huh   already  yes 'cause because regular uh regular applied economics degree takes only three years and at the same time we 'll be having our major subjects in accounting   uh-huh   uh-huh   uh-huh  so by this time we 're already we 're already struggling trying to adjust to the academic   struggling laughs uh-huh we 're really we really are because some of our classmates they already went back they repeated the course or something like that so it 's difficult also to maintain being a regular student so so for me uhm i don't think they should gasp  about it  they just like uhm i chose this course so it 's my choice something like that  uh-huh   uh-huh   uh-huh   uh-huh   uh-huh speaker a makes a lot of these uh-huh assent/attending markers within speaker b 's turn of speaking; henceforth, such assent/attending markers in the middle of the turn will not be indicated but you like what you 're doing yeah i i like the course why did you choose the course in the first place uh at first per personally like before i know that my line is on the business side because of my family background and so on plus we have our business uh-huh but then i didn't want uh certain management or degree only something like that uh-huh i think it comes with the pride uh-huh uh-huh yeah then i wanted something that would give a name or sort of like if i took up accountancy i would someday become a c p a hopefully  c p a  yes yeah at least there 's a title and then for well in high school i appreciated economics so so one day i said that i want it 's either when i go to college it 's either i 'll take up accounting or economics it 's either one of the two but then when i saw the application form  laughs from la salle it was a combination so unlike  uh-huh   uh-huh  uh-huh yes you got the best of both laughs  so this is great so i just chose it and then i got in so but uh-huh i didn't really it wasn't really an aspiration or something that i really wanted to get in this course so i think it was just god 's will really that i got into it uh-huh in what other organizations are you involved here in school uh currently uhm i am part of the student council office of vice-president for academics as actually i 'm into uhm team spirit academic grievance uhm yeah so what do you do uhm basically we handle cases grievance cases but then there are not a lot of them most people like when i was in my freshman year i thought that uh the grievance team was uhm had a terrible job of handling all those cases numerous cases i thought it was very tedious well the process is tedious but however these people are the community are is not aware of their rights basically they don't know what to do about them so what we 've been doing what we 've been trying to do is to disseminate this information information uh-huh on rights and so on but then uh it 's not that   uhm efficient yet because the team is so small because   nobody wants to join it  uh-huh   uh-huh   laughs because of the work yeah perceived work yeah perceived work but then uhm for me it 's not it 's not just the work it 's also the companionship you get to know other team members uh-huh so during your stay in the organization what did you get to do already uh actually i 'm in charge of publicity so when 'cause uhm every term every midterm final course card day we set up a booth for students to like they come and consult us uh if if they have a problem with the professor and then if they think uh they would ask if they have a case or not so they consult them then we would guide them but then also the common notion that we want to uh erase is that we are not the ones who will uhm file your cases for you you have to work on your cases we 're not gonna work on your cases we will just guide you and help you but what happens is they leave that to us which is a very big problem correct correct but how can we defend you when we don't know everything about the case laughs  yeah and that what happens is we example the student is not that cooperative but then we go on with the case uh we approach the professor and so on we are the ones laughs who get the blame yes yes we take then we take the blame you 're you 're caught in the middle laughs  yeah we 're caught in the middle the students think uh they 're not uh they 're not they go like uh  walang silbi ang mga yan gumaganon sila  uh-huh uh-huh something like that so it also hurts in a way correct if you 're doing your job and they 're not doing theirs laughs  yeah have you been in actual hearing uh no no not yet not yet as of this year i there are no uh speci serious cases okay and then actually those also what we know is that those personal cases like when they say sexual harassment cases they usually uh have them in private so it doesn't go through us it goes directly to the higher uh student council  officers and then to the discipline office and so on  right  uh-huh uh-huh i see so aside from your involvement in the student council what uh other organizations are you involved in actually the other team in uh uhm acad academics group is the education expo which has been moved and moved because of a lot of circumstances uh this is with the foreign countries foreign schools yeah external linkages and hopefully it will push through in march march first week of march okay so every now and then we had meetings ganon  so on how to prepare for it uh-huh what is your role in that committee uh actually i 've been assigned as the assistant coordinator and then uh ohhh so as assistant coordinator what will you be doing i will i will really be uh hands-on supposedly on the event itself because the preparation itself has we 're not that part of it because the external linkages an office in the university uh handled it they said that they will handle everything 'cause they have the contacts  so it 's also hard for just plain students to approach these embassies so we have to they have to back us up  uh i see  course it through external linkages so they did that work for us so then our work would be on the event itself the guests their food their uh the seminar rooms yeah basically logistics  more on taking care of the guests  their needs i see so aside from the student council any other organization since freshman uh j pia = junior philippine institute of accountants j pia member since it 's our org = organization  yeah then this year uh i got into the publications so i 'm the news editor oh so once in a while we go to the events and we write about about them uh-huh what made you choose the lasallian ambassador group why did you join us basically because uh did you join did you did you have the intention to join since you were in your first year or just now or yeah i wanted to uh-huh why because i think it was a chance and you also get to know a lot of people i didn't uh i wasn't aware of all the activities of the main activity i know is the l-pep l-pep yeah and then the other activities i i know that i don't know trainings and all but then the other other activities i wasn't that aware of them until i got inside like uh like all the first activities like the christmas  salo-salo that you 'll be the one serving yes uh-huh yeah then the ushering uh-huh i wasn't that aware of them that there are other activities uh-huh uh-huh yeah so how do you find the ambassador group so far yeah they 're okay uhm they 're a fun group uh-huh laughs  yeah i guess if you if you don't have that much confidence if you if you don't get to talk to a lot of people how can you talk to your orientees during the l-pep which is very important since you 're welcoming them into the lasallian community as a representative of your school uh uh-huh uh-huh so basically you 're doing p r work for the school yeah that 's why you 're called ambassadors that 's why we choose good people so as in about a hundred or hundred plus or two hundred plus who applied we only get seventy seventy or sixty 'cause we make sure we also get the best at least those who could project good of our university di ba  so what are you looking for in an organization uh actually like what do you think could you get from the ambassador group that you wouldn't be able to get in some other groups laughs   di ba  why the hassle of going through the tedious process of screening  laughs  yeah i well i didn't really know how hard it was to get in until i was there you have to be you have to be mentally prepared also with all those laughs what do you call it uhm they 're they 're sort of the challenges yes uhm i think it was okay even though some of them were funny  1 word somewhat stupid but then it 's low confidence level that you get to build up yeah and then we also got to experience some of my friends got to experience it 'cause i celebrated my debut last july oh you did yeah so we had uhm we really had a director who taught us and then he really taught us how to uhm be more confident of ourselves so he would let you uhm he would really let you walk down those 'cause we practiced on the top on the roof top of our condo unit so every some of the residents would come up every now and then  uh-huh  ( laughs) to look and watch laughs  and they would see us and it 's really embar it 's really embarrassing to see them look at you when you 're walking down uh as if you 're modeling especially the guards when they know you laughs   uh-huh  uh-huh yeah but then that helped uhm on the event itself because you won't really mind all those people anymore you wouldn't be bowing your head so you would uh look straight and be more be more confident since uh you 're pres it 's like you 're presenting yourself for me it wasn't just my debut it was everyone 's all my  friends' debut those who participated because we 're all part of it so it wasn't just it wasn't just me because my all my friends my family all those close to me uh-huh so that 's what you 're looking for in an organization something that would help you develop yourself in terms of confidence yeah well not only that uhm i think it 's very important to know a lot of people like i 've seen it in my parents when they established their business  oh what else  uh-huh their networks yes laughs  because my mom used to work in a bank so she did have a lot of networks uh-huh from her high school and college friends her colleagues and she knew a lot of people also my dad uh-huh so the through those people that they knew they were able to be more successful in their fields uh-huh yeah and then they were also able to build their reputations even though a lot of i guess it 's normal to have rivalries uh-huh and then some people have uhm they 're just insecure uhm and all those even though a lot of people tried to destroy them but then they had the credibility they had their reputation  so it wasn't easy it 's not easy to destroy that so that 's like for me that 's what they 've been teaching us all throughout these years that uhm no matter what happens you know that you 're right you know what is right and wrong and you know what you should do so for me uh i try i 'm trying to build my reputation i got i think i have already uh in my credibility  correct   uh-huh  and you 're just trying to build up your network so it could be better known laughs  i guess probably you 'll be able to get that 'cause de la salle ambassador group uh especially the core work with the administrators and faculty probably during your uhm working here you 'll get to meet uhm well most of the people who work also in the university okay of course they will be asking you to coordinate for us coordinate with different offices coordinate with the administrators so hopefully you would be able to have that okay if you 'll be active with our group laughs  yeah how long do you plan to be with us you 're you 're you 're going to be here for about two more years i have three more three more years yeah i 'll be graduating in two thousand six two thousand six still a long way so i 'm hoping that you 'll stay with us all throughout your stay hopefully if you like the group of course laughs  and what else would you like to know about the ambassador group i don't know laughs  uhm there will be there will be five committees in the ambassador group each committee will be headed by a core we have the publicity and marketing uh publicity group we have the logistics group the logistics group takes care of all the physical arrangements for our activities from campus tours to ushering to coordinating writing letters uhm what else physic uh reserving rooms or areas that we have to use so basically the bulk of the work during l-pep that is theirs we have the h r d human resource and development committee they care they take care of uh manpower take care of training of the ambassadors whatever the ambassadors need to develop in terms of skill uhm they make sure that uh these needs are given to them or addressed and then we have the marketing and finance committee they take care of solicitation and handling the budget for l-pep and then we have the documentations team they 're documentations and research they produce the lasallian ambassadors manual and uhm they make sure that the contents are updated 'cause every year we have new information the people change the officers change departments change even the physical structure of the schools change yeah so we have to change the what do you call this the maps the maps once in a while because of the additional of one building laughs  a building disappears or another classroom appears or whatever so we have five committees that you get to choose from so given probably your skills or what you 're good at what what committee do you think would you be more uhm where will you be more what do you call this used or maximized uhm i 'm not sure yet laughs  you 're not sure yet laughs  like you 've been in publicity right you 've been in publicity   in your other involvements and you 're good in math so maybe you have a choice between what publicity or marketing and finance  yeah 
Philippines	so nadia nadia basically this is uh just an informal interview because the lasallian ambassador group is a big group composed of about sixty plus or about seventy so in based on my uhm three years experience being the coordinator for the ambassadors uhm what happens is they just come and go and sometimes i really don't get to know them personally i only get to know uhm about a handful of them about siguro  uh about half half of the ambassador group personally for the whole year before they leave so what i want to do is uh have better relationship with them quality relationship with them therefore i 'm meeting you uh all personally one by one okay so uhm before we go on with several of my questions could you please introduce yourself to me a little background  god  uhm well i 'm nadia tolentino duque uh right now i 'm a first year b s a student uh i actually come come from liberal arts so it 's c l a then i shifted to accounting uh-uhm so my previous course was ano communication arts business management  then you know with all the requirements for shifting and all of that i was so glad that i was able to pass   and while i was doing the process for shifting i was also applying for lasallian ambassadors that time  so i was so glad  oo   uh-uhm   uh-huh   uh-huh   laughs so many paper work ha  yeah so many paper work then there was the midterms   those stuff and everything  i was glad that first i learned the results from the shifting   that i was able to shift  uh-uhm   uh-uhm   uh-uhm  like we were only four shiftees from uh external shiftees to accounting then only three of us made it to shift to the course  uh-uhm  uh-uhm why why why did you want to shift it 's my interest it 's like during the l-pep during the l-pep i was asking the lasallian ambassador uh how how do you do shifting  that 's what that 's that that was my first question because  uh-huh  was that was that your first choice your first choice yeah it was my first choice but then la salle wasn't my first choice then for a school ahh i see what was your first choice it was u p u p what happened at u p laughs  like everyone so i didn't get in i didn't laughs  okay okay chances are if i passed i 'd probably get 1 word  floating technology there or something so i 'm glad i didn't and right now i 'm here in la salle with ambassadors and everything uh-uhm so then what happened next was that i i was then i shift i was able to shift and then i learned the results from the internet   that i passed then that 's it right now i 'm an irreg = irregular student   i get to meet different people then i 'm glad that i 'm with the ambassadors because once in a while i could say hi to people and  say hi hello   uh-uhm   uh-uhm   uh-uhm  what are your other involvements in school other organizations uh actually i also joined j pia so i was the only communication arts student who was in j pia laughs  in j pia laughs  i really wanted accounting so during the we had this   general assembly  uh-huh  assembly then what happened was that uh people like uh uh introduce yourself so hello i 'm ganyan ganyan b s a i 'm like this b s a then i 'm like i 'm communication arts business management   so parang uh okay so that 's it so i 'm glad i 'm b s a also so i could mingle with them so  laughs so you 're you 're just a plain member in j pia yeah plain member din for tapat  but i 'm inactive inactive why did you join tapat  uh principles i guess i don't know it 's like it 's do you find yourself uh further involved in tapat  's activities hopefully but then i don't know where to start  like right now i my priorities are more in school with the requirements and everything  uh-uhm   uh-uhm secretary interrupts  just let her wait so that 's it i guess laughs  what activities would you like to be involved in tapat  tapat  uh-uhm what what found the what did you find interesting in  tapat  it 's their view of being quite leaning on the left side uh-uhm i don't know i think they have this thing and then during the neat activity they also made this presentation which there were points given that i quite agree on it  uh-uhm  uh-uhm like stude student things like that and   then and sometimes i guess maybe in second year and the third  uh-uhm  uh-uhm and what was your reason for joining the ambassador group the reason why i joined actually for it 's just that i wanted to do something and during my stay in la salle the fact that i was i was already here  then i saw the uhm application dates then actually i wasn't able to pass during the regular time it 's like they extended  that was the time i was able to pass it actually i didn't i didn't quite expect to make it with all the difficult interviews  you know i mean i was so glad that i was able but the reason why i joined because i like to meet people i like to meet uh like ano other students and then what i like what i wrote in my essay i said that i like to give back what i learned or what i experienced during my l pe l-pep which was  uh-uhm   uh-huh   uh-huh   requirements laughs   uh-huh  why what did you experience laughs  it was nice because i got the chance to bond with other people  and then there was then i saw the lasallian ambassadors like fun people because during the last part isn't it there 's a culminating activity for all the ambassadors they were like dancing paikot laughs   so parang wow galing tapos parang  you get to be a teacher for two days  so be the big guy i don't know that 's why i wanted to join  uh-uhm   uh-uhm   uh-uhm  do you think you 'd be good in teaching no laughs  i have a phobia phobia for ano   no laughs  phobia for what because i 'm a student myself and i know like for example  mina barok there 's this teacher who 's from visayas who who has an accent so chances are people would mimic it parang ganon  will try to ano  basically it 's the student relation i don't know if i could ano manage it  uh-uhm uh-uhm  but that 's part of the requirement for bring an ambassador   to have the facility   yeah yeah i know that 's what i want to get over in i mean to learn to learn the uh-uhm and then what else what else are you looking for in an organization probably one of the reasons why you chose the ambassador group something that 's active that that does something   unlike for you know for some professional orgs = organizations  like there you give you just pay the ano for being   a membership fee you have this party then that 's it for the whole year that 's the activity  uh-huh   membership fee  uh-uhm uh-uhm unlike here you get to go to the s p s then you have your own  tambayan those i guess would that 's nice  ano   uh-uhm  how how do you find the ambassador group so far fun we keep on laughing laughs then although  fun uh-huh  have you been with us during our past activities the  salu-salo   yeah words  have you attended some of the campus tours orientation uh there was a campus tour yesterday but my first class was one o'clock so i just  yes   missing words the catanduanes group didn't you you weren't able to join that what 's that we also had a campus tour for a group of students   from the state college in catanduanes  uh i was  uh no not yet so this is the first activity that you were able to join was the  salu-salo sa 2 words  yeah then the turn-over  yes and the turn-over so aside from them being fun they 're ano confident  imagine to handle all those people  they 're confident  people who you don't know yeah and then it 's only you it 's only you then those stuff parang it tak takes a lot of guts i mean parang the ambassadors itself it 's hard with all the interviews the things you have to do and then you have to act you have to do this i remember there was this question during the interview   ba't bilog ang manhole   parang they asked me that chuckles   ha i don't know and then there was also another question like how come the sheep in baa baa black sheep is ano black   parang bakit black ang sheep  sa baa baa black sheep   parang kasi it 's for kids so kids usually use uh  ano same letters sings baa baa black sheep so it 's supposed to be all letter b or they make all sorts of suggestions what if there was never a lamb parang there was there was never a sheep throughout history what would be the animal like  parang  you know the reason for that what was the reason for asking those questions no they just wanted ano get you a card  and then they asked that in between several serious questions   right  right so  so they they were just trying you on whether you and i kept on answering   you kept on answering laughs  the first thing that comes to my mind i answer it because it 's but they also made me shout in on the top of a chair  screaming darna pretending that there was fire how how did you find the screening it was hard before the screening i was actually planning to not take it anymore because i 've i 've heard from the other people who 've done it their their term was katay  uh-huh   uh-huh  what  katay   katay what do you mean by  katay   parang you have to go through  talagang super hirap because for other for other i think organizations just like ones the ones the ambassadors is like one of the hardest i don't know for for them  oo oo   uh i see  because we want to get the best laughs   yeah of course  oo we only get the best and the most confident because if you don't have the basic skills to start off with   we 'll be having a difficult time  training you   yeah   yeah   training them di ba  yes at least we have to have the basics the foregrounder which we could work on like what what are like we we we would like to have people at least a certain level of confidence already because if from the very start they 're already shy we 'll be having a difficult time training them we only have a short time to train them before l-pep  well actually on the way uh you 'll be more enhanced in terms of uh being confident and having the skills  but we want to have at least something to work on  so with the people we have right now at least we 're confident that we got uh that well the cream of the crop laughs the best    so you 're one of the best all right uh we see that all of you have potential uh   how however uh we would like to make you better so therefore we 'll be requiring you to attend all the trainings right now you 've been accepted as an ambassador   however you have to earn the title  you have to earn the title of being an ambassador for completing all the requirements meaning the trainings the meetings because uhm in our experience there have been several students who applied and then  but after that they weren't able to attend several   training sessions which is unfair because some of them uhm well almost all of them went through with all the training sessions and i think it 's very important that for you to be able to be a good ambassador you 'll have to have the skills and to be knowledgeable of whatever things that we 're supposed to do  uh which are   shy   yeah   uh-huh   uh for the   thank you that 's nice  thank you   so   but then   trainings  uh so what 's the training all about uh it 's all about the skills that you have to give for being an ambassador how to be diplomatic  ahh game setting  uh aside from that how to be diplomatic how to facilitate  effective presentation skills how to be more confident what is the proper way of dealing with guests uh the do 's and don'ts of being with guests uhm what else events management is also part of it because i also delegate projects to ambassadors for them to handle and then i what i do is just supervise because this is a preparation for uhm what do you call this your profession after you graduate you 'll be asked to handle projects you 'll be asked to uh talk in front of people you 'll be asked to uh what do you call this speak in front of a big group so i think that 's what uh we value in terms of skill more on public relations so we hope we could what do you call this we could create more confident public relations people for the university uhm with the ambassadors  uh   uh yeah   uh words   pero it 's nice that we 're called ambassadors  compared to before orientors  yes  orientors because the orientors only just work for l-pep  during the freshmen during the freshman orientation  for l-pep   pero it 's tedious during before the l-pep yes chuckles it 's tedious before and during l-pep and a little after probably especially for the logistics group 
Philippines	okay uh the activity is a year-end party for the college of business and economics and the college of engineering so it 's kind of like a celebration for all uhm la sallians not well uh we we 're aiming for all la sallians but in particular the students of both colleges it 's a year-end party so oh this is going to be on march fifteen that will be on a  saturday   yes saturday  and you 're going to hold it in rockwell yes so let me just review your project proposal objectives okay description, so it 's it 's a concert and a fashion show yes uh do you have do you do you already have sponsors for this or are you just starting to look for it well we 're we 're uh we have an idea na of who we 'll get yeah  pero we 're waiting pa for the approval and then we 'll get sponsors but we 've talked to some sponsors already so they 're just waiting for the approval of the packages then we 'll fax it to them right away uh who who 'll be going to uh be the models for the fashion show uh students or who are from outside uh outside school so there 's an entrance fee of one hundred pesos yes yeah project plan okay uh you 're angela yes i 'm angela yeah uhm projected income statement uh you 've already coordinated with rockwell regarding the venue yes they 've told you about the capacity one thousand yes yes we 've already seen it we 've already seen the place okay entrance ticket how much per ticket is it a closed venue isn't the car park medyo open well it 's open so how how can you control the the crowd well there 's one entrance lang for the cars so maybe yun yung entrance na we 'll use it as entrance yeah i mean i mean the the show the stage will it be open to other people so even if you don't go inside wouldn't the people be able to see it uh kasi it 's like this is the car park and then at the end of it at the two sides just like there 's a small land or something it 's like grass so it 'll be like enclosing the place uh-uhm and it has uh i think a wall on the side of a building so so your target solicitation will just be fifty thousand yeah, 'cause we 'll be getting a lot of uh revenues from the tickets souvenir program what 's the souvenir program for uh just for the sponsors we 'll put in the local sponsors and descriptions of the models just in case anyone would like to know okay the venue do you have uh the a moa between rockwell regarding the venue uh uh not yet 'cause it 's tentative tentatively reserved for us na pero we 're just waiting for the approval kasi we don't want okay so i 'll be needing to ask you a copy just a copy so it hasn't it doesn't need to be signed yet uh yeah we have one we just need to see to see something from rockwell showing that they are really charging you thirty thousand pesos no actually kasi the thirty thousand is still negotiable  oo  since and we 're waiting for the approval para  we can transact na  so wala pang there 's no specific amount yet how much yung venue but the maximum the maximum is thirty thousand yes thirty thousand so it 's it 's okay even even if you 'll uh be able to negotiate for a lower just show us the copy okay uhm stage design 1 word and sounds tickets tokens your total expense will be sixty-two yes uh did you include okay here it is 1 word  has seventy-five thousand this doesn't include yet what you 're going to get for the  stephen speaks   laughter i don't know  laughter the stephen speaks proposal also indicated seventy-five thousand so i guess this would be reasonable yeah  1 word has forty thousand so how much is that hundred one hundred fifteen one hundred fifteen and your expense is sixty-two thousand that 's more than enough sixty-two that 's about just half so it 's okay yes yeah alright ten percent will go to scap forty-five to eco forty-five to c b e okay uh can i need to have the paper actually signed okay laughter  you can't print the signatures we have na kasi yung signed kaya lang we didn't have the logo we didn't bring the logo so we 'll ask na lang  to sign we 'll ask them to sign again so if they could just countersign here so you shouldn't be doing this printing the signatures okay so this is okay this is good this is your solicitation letter yeah and this is the program the program and this is the memorandum of agreement between the two colleges between the two colleges so each of you would be giving fifty thousand no twenty-five thousand uh twenty-five yeah sponsorship uh so this means that uh each assembly should be getting twenty-five thousand sponsorship yeah  kasi 'cause uh the way you write you wrote this it seems that you 're giving twenty-five thousand from your funds but in case uh sorry so just try to rephrase this uh each party should be uh how do you rephrase get solicitations solicitations worth twenty-five thousand pesos so uh i thought there were only one thousand tickets uh sorry it was uh nagkamali ako  laughter  so is this supposed to be five hundred or is this supposed to be one five five hundred five hundred sorry i was thinking of something else  2 words not sell so all the five hundred is considered sold yes so that means five hundred tickets uh one thousand tickets hmm okay 'cause i 'm thinking uh when when you indicate that tickets are considered sold that you should reflect as your expense uh as expense on on us yes so this is just going to be cancelled out when you sell it sixty-two correct uh okay sixty-two sixty-two so three sixty-two fifty-five minus sixty-two negative income net loss  laughter  uhm don't you have expenses for the bands uh we 'll be getting amateur   amateur amateur bands amateur bands usually it 's free yeah 'cause they 're just starting it depends actually if we have i don't think amateur bands are play for free yeah we 'll hold out like new students you know but but how how would you be able to market the activity if you 're just going to to play amateur bands well the the amateur bands they 'll be performing for the intermission numbers of the fashion show but they 're really what the students would go for i think is partly the fashion show and the open house party it 's the party yeah it 's the party afterwards actually it depends uh if we uh okay okay because i 'm thinking that part of uh or the tickets would be you would have to pay some other organization so basically all of the uhm revenues from the ticket sales would go back to you yes so you don't have to share it with other with any other organization no okay okay the moa 's good now is it possible if you you also show the list of prospective sponsors uh okay  reads part of the document under his breath uhm try to rephrase this because i don't think it sounds so good when when you write in your letter like we would like to request for your financial help so instead uh try to say that uh we would like to invite you to be one of the partners of this activity so yours truly uh you need to yeah okay aside from that you also need to add uhm additional uhm people to sign so let 's get from nins and mr kalaw from the alumni office okay do you do you know other names no okay i 'll write down that 's under noted by or yeah actually if if you want you can yeah you can have uh just one person sign the solicitation letter so whoever will be the head of all the solicitations can you can let just one person sign so although you can still provide the contact details of the other people uh so under noted by ms kit mrs monina banaynal do you know what d s a stands for  trying to guess de la salle dean of student affairs so i 'll just write d s a okay okay and then mr kalaw vice-president for development and alumni affairs okay now uhm when i show this to ms kit she might uhm make additional comments or revisions on the letter okay although she 's not around today so the next time you return this that 's the only time she 'll be able to check the letter sponsorship 1 word uhm we normally don't allow room to room campaigns anymore so it was the decision of the different deans so although you can still uh have it during in between classes  pero but uh during classes you can't ask the teacher for you to publicize so don't indicate this anymore the rooms distribution jingle uhm streamers uhm you can't put up streamers that bear the name of the company or the product only so you can only put up streamers that indicate the details of the activity the name of the organizations the details of the activity and you can include the logos of the sponsors but you but uh streamers of sponsors that only indicate uh purely their names you can't put that so you can only put that at the venue at the venue selling it 's outside so it 's okay uhm this is good resum&eacute; of the project heads so just revise this from the other packages okay so now since this is going to be held outside we also need to fill out uh the requirements for off-campus activities uhm the off-campus activity form the yellow form the faculty conforme form so you should have uhm at least one faculty present there uhm you don't need to submit papers anymore kasi  it 's a party uh so faculty off-campus activity form faculty conforme  form uhm a copy of the map of the venue uh and the list of the officers going there going to be present there all all officers involved in the project in the project okay so we 'll be able to know who 's responsible for that activity okay and then just have this signed by uh a n b so they 're going to sign this first before you submit it to us okay  officers  so we have to revise everything uhm the corrections yeah the corrections i i although mostly are okay already uhm just the signatures uh this one you need to have this noted by your respective treasurers that 's it you just need the revisions and submit it di ba  okay  okay  okay thank you do you have any questions no uh yeah wait lang  when can we see you again anytime tomorrow anytime i 'm always here at the office okay okay thank you thank you thank you 
Philippines	i had the operation february twenty-eight  it 's the left  oho  how long did you notice the mass  ay ano ho e there was no mass i had a reg i had a mammo  and then uh there were calcifications in the mammogram and then uh i was supposed to have the operation but someone in the states said you have to have a second opinion and they looked at it and it was benign the calcifications were benign but i sought a third opinion si dr sammy ang and he  sai he was able to feel it at that time so mga ano ho three weeks in three weeks  mammogram  this is your histopath long pause - the doctor reviews the pathology report, takes notes, mutters to herself   words negative you have a t it 's a t two n zero n zero disease lesion words  estrogen receptor is strong  positive ho yan  yes   words this is good also  this is good doctor uh there was uh i don't know if you need it but dr gonzaga also did an h e r h e r   her two neu yes laughs i asked for that ahhh ganoon ho yeah i asked for her two neu but it 's not there 'no doctor no it 's here i got it only the other day  here doctor  yes this is words positive  your words are okay your alkaline phosphatase is okay chest x-ray is okay  did you have other indices before words  uh no ho cholesterol yung  high cholesterol in fact i 'm taking lipitor five milligrams and then i have allergies ho  in fact during my sur after my surgery i had allergies in your family is there a history of breast cancer yes uh three aunties father 's side ho  what about your parents words   hindi hindi breast cancer my my mother 's brother has prostate cancer uncle that 's your uncle uncle maternal uncle and a cousin first cousin and a first cousin right now has lung lung cancer your uncle has pros   prostate cancer and then a first cousin on my mother 's side has lung cancer  prostate cancer  do you smoke no before did you smoke never alcohol no how many pregnancies all in all did you have are you did you have children words  no i 'm single risk factor ho ano laughs  how old were you when you started to menstruate uh thirteen you had regular menses not that regular when did you have menopause fifty-three i think at age fifty-three may i take a look at you yes doctor here 's the bone scan po hands her the bone scan report   okay good  hindi ko pa rin hindi ko napa- xerox okay that means negative po ano  thank you kasi no definite negative sabi ko i couldn't understand  yes   i was assuring her   sabi ko doctor english yan  long break - doctor does physical exam  let 's check out your data  oho   ang ingay nung air-con the ano ho the mass is not very big but it 's not small either   either yes so it 's a t two lesion they call it t is tumor size it 's t one t two t three you are two  opo  the lymph nodes are negative so that 's favorable    so the probability that the tumor has spread elsewhere is not very high in that situation if the nodes are negative at most it 's twenty percent chance that it has spread your uhm estrogen receptor assay is positive so this tells us that you will respond to hormonal therapy  so any hormonal treatment most likely fifty percent chance you will respond to uhm the her two neu is strongly positive we we cannot give a correlation between tum the biologic nature of the tumor based on her two neu the the best test is still a fish analysis but since that test is not available locally or even if it is it 's so expensive this is a rough estimate of her two neu and you are strongly positive this plus three greater than fifty percent is indirectly telling us that as far as her two neu is concerned you are positive but the only correlation we can make with her two neu is that if this is positive we can we cannot use mild agents so hindi  directly telling us aggressiveness of behavior but those that are strongly positive usually do not respond well to mild treatment it has to be strong treatment so i think this is uh among your your factors is not very good all the rest words negative liver negative chest x-ray negative bone scan so it looks like you 're clear of everything outside except for that the uh tumor has a potential of being quite aggressive  number two there 's another problematic factor also the basal line of the section is too close is too close to the tumor it 's only point four c m so it 's very close to the base so in that situation i will worry about local recurrence the probability that just one tumor cell is left there is quite likely so uh there are quite a number of options for treatment it can be reasonable it can be reasonable to just put you on a hormonal agent you know that 's one option a hormonal agent now if you had to let me choose uhm it is either your your choice of hormonal agents will be either tamoxifen or arimidex either of the two now tamoxifen is the gold standard uhm but it it has side effects like proneness to ut uterine cancer and increased risk of strokes that 's where arimidex would come arimidex is a relatively new drug the studies show now it has a slight advantage over tamoxifen but this is on a short-term basis pa lang because it is a new study we do not know the long-term effect i mean the long-term efficiency as we know of tamoxifen so short of of assuring you that the the response will be sustained in the next five years i cannot assure you with arimidex but we just know that on a short-term basis it 's better than tamoxifen little bit words  now the second option is for you to undergo chemotherapy i think that is that is the uh option one would take if he really wants to be ten twenty steps ahead of the whole situation because even in lymph node-negative patients it 's acceptable to have chemotherapy because of the probabil the twenty percent probability still of recurrence despite you know negative nodes   words yes just to cover up for deficiency in the uh the uh assessment tests that we have so as i said it 's the ultimate if you are a person who who wants to use all the biggest bullets up front that 's the option you take that 's george w bush they all laugh   hindi yung talagang george   yung sa kanya yung sigurista siya  i 'm going to do everything now because i 'm gonna win now i 'm not going to wait until later i 'm not very sure if i will win if i will wait later  yan ang george w bush   yes   uh-uhm   uh   uh-huh   negative nodes   aggressive   oho   approach  approach okay then the third approach is to sit and to watch and i will not recommend that now in addition to all of this with the point four c m basal line i 'd go for radiation therapy radiation so in addition to hormonal to any of those three i will recommend radiation radiation therapy be given to you 'cause i 'm not very secure about that  yes   radiation   ang liit ano  it 's too close all in all in all i think you know you you you 're healing very well all right so it 's possible doctor to just have hormonal and radiation yes that is an open option radiation is fixed uh buti hindi chemo alone alone gusto mong sabihin  hormonal and radiation yes is that that 's acceptable that 's acceptable doctor what do i buy with chemo i mean what do i get with chemo a slightly higher response rate your your hormone therapy is only at best mga  thirty-three thirty-six percent response rate your chemotherapy is about sixty percent so i 'll buy fifteen percent and the radiation will uh the radiation is more for local control it 's really just a for my i look at it as just a cleaning-up procedure  you just tidy the place just to be sure it 's really clean na   yes yes   just to be sure  how long po yung  radiation if you go through chemo you 'll have the radiation after the chemo if you 'll have hormonal therapy up front we can have the radiation therapy the radiation  i have a cousin who 's an oncologist in the u s doktora yes oo  so maybe i can write him and mention all of these although you know he said exactly oo exactly he mentioned but he said it really depends on uh whether dr chan recommends chemo i mean it it 's an option he said but definitely he mentioned uh tamoxifen or arimidex  and he also mentioned radiation for local recurrence  parehong-pareho ho so the the question now is whether i want to undergo chemo  yes   yes  i i think it 's not your wanting to it 's it 's how how aggressive you are if you 're a person who 'll do everything now how much fighting you want to do if if you 're not really all-out to fight medyo-medyo lang  fight a little then you know you will do hormonal therapy you you 've gone far enough with surgery already so just that little more fighting and that 's it for you okay how brutal is the chemo  because you said that her two shows it has to be  chemo  a stronger chemo a stronger chemo four cycles of of a c doxorubicin containing words  should be fine four cycles of a c of a c  matapang ho yung a c ano   hindi naman   k&aacute;ya naman because you have all the support medicines for nausea vomiting doctor can i ask the cost the cost less than ten thousand per injection  yes the a c  the chemo  so injection po yun  i don't have to stay overnight no doctor what stage is this two stage two stage two so i have a good chance stage two yes  kasi iyak ako ng iyak   sinasayang mo yung luha mo e  so all my baseline data are okay are very good okay yes just a few points are if you had to sort them out to good not good konti lang yung not good mas marami yung good and how soon should the chemo start doktora  we should start the chemo about a month after surgery and so two weeks so we have two weeks to think about all of these if i if i do the chemo i will not do the hormonal or  sabay ho yun  no if you 'll have the chemo chemo muna  and then we will use the hormonal as a maintenance after the cycle yes to sustain to sustain you in the next years after and then the the radiation comes after the chemo yes uh you can have the radiation together with the hormonal agent ahhh okay  yun hong radiation how much is that  doktora  it 's quite expensive  the average is   ilang sessions ho yung  radiation  four to five weeks maybe four to five days weeks four to five four to five sometimes four weeks sometimes five weeks how often yung  every day every day wow how much ho yon doktora  the average patients spend about seventy thousand pesos per one seven she misheard the amount  for the whole treatment ahh seventy thousand so the chemo is roughly ten thousand per cycle per per per session i think my insurance can cover that  anything else i need to know just ano  i think that that 's about all i don't think i need how tall are you five six five five and a half i have some questions doktora  about nutrition uh is it normal to feel weak or dizzy sometimes i don't know if it 's psychological i don't know if it 's or menopausic symptoms  matagal na ho yung menopause ko e  pero i still have parang hot flashes i don't know it might be menopausic symptoms still and then ano ho yung what can i eat and not eat you can eat anything just so that i eat okay yes and then can i continue taking vitamin supplements   and lipitor  yes  yes okay  yun hong ano my aunts in the states are saying you buy immune enhancer ano m g n three and all that i don't know that laughs   hindi ho kayo  i don't know that it 's not scientific laughs   hindi ho kayo  it 's not scientific okay i think those are my questions so anything else so just continue the vitamin supplements how much do you weigh now did they weigh you a hundred i used to weigh one hundred thirty parang  one hundred twenty-five ngayon   naalis kasi yung breast  yung maliit  i should weigh you maybe weighs the patient  okay so the nausea can be controlled doktora  yeah yeah it 's uh because i 'm so afraid of the nausea doktora  yes we have good drugs for for nausea and vomiting not a very big problem  hindi na kamukha nung dati ano yung side effects the drugs the anti-vomiting drugs are so efficient so i have to let you know in uh soon you have to pray for a decision  it 's not a simple decision  yes yes doktora  but you 're i think you feel that maybe chemo should should be the best  words si george w bush i don't want to lose a battle yes doktora  and you know when you when you fight now i mean your prize is is a cure if you fight later your prize is only an extension 'cause if you wait until recurrence comes recurrence cannot be cured you just fight and fight that 's a very strong point  opo  so personally in the situation you want you want a cure then all-out fight you fight now you fight now  bring out the tanks laughs   oho oho doktora  you don't wait for the enemy what about what about so the chemo doktora because classes begin right now i 'm on leave but i 'm a teacher and classes begin may fifteen should i go this is ano i go on sick leave 
Philippines	female married from bataan was admitted with the presenting symptom of severe gastric pain the accompanying signs and symptoms were fever nausea and vomiting physical examination revealed fever tachycardia hypotension the lungs were positive for basilar rals  abdominal examination revealed tenderness diminished bre  bowel sounds and there is a positive collin sign pertinent past medical history revealed that the patient has mumps two weeks prior to admission uh we are entertaining a case of acute pancreatitis to rule out the following conditions namely acute cholecystitis cholelithiasis pyclonephritis and hepatic abscess abscess we are also ruling out peptic ulcer disease as well as acute appendicitis with uh epigastric pain noted on this patient is there any association association to meals does it occur uh thirty or ninety minutes after meals or is there any radiation of the pain to the right scapular area or at the back ah this patient has a localized epigastric pain it is not related to any food intake or ano any radiation at all that 's why we ruled out cholelithiasis disease   since in cholelithiasis the symptoms occurs only when the stone produces an inflammation or an obstruction of the cystic or the common bile duct but on physical examination the abdomen can be noted to be normal or there is only a rap an uh a right upper quadrant pain uh huh in your case the patient presented with an abdominal tenderness a diminished bowel sound and collin 's positive  collin 's signs which is uh likely not found in the case of cholelithiasis and one thing more on a simple ultrasonography of the abdomen in you will right away note a stone formation in the gall bladder so we can easily rule out the existence of cholelithiasis in this case how about considering uh a case of uh the existence of pyelonephritis in this case uh break in the recording the past medical  his history of this patient was negative for any urinary tract infection which is usually true in pyelone pyelonephritis break in the recording  and on physical examination the kidney 1 word  were also negative which is usually true in pyelonephritis that 's why we tried to we ruled out pyelonephritis in this case  break in the recording  because of the did you note any ab break in the recording on your physical examination did you note any uh ichtricia of the conjunctiva or any fever it was negative the ichtricia is negative but the patient was febrile on admission was there any uh profuse sweating during the night any weight loss or any any loss of appetite or any changes in bowel movement uh it was negative all of these were negative according to the patient so the the possibility of an existence of uh of a hepatic abscess is very nil since the history of this patient points uh rules out the existence of uh hepatic abscess on the basis of the absence of the severe abdominal pain the palpable mass on the right upper quadrant which was not noted in this case yeah that 's true break in the recording  the epigastric pain noted in this case is not associated with meals so peptic ulcer diseases is easily ruled out how about uh the obstetrical clearance and the surgical clearance of this case when was the last menstrual period uh the last menstrual period was uh june ten june ten of this year   so the existence of any ectopic pregnancies in the uh intrauterine tumors or whats whatsoever that causes that will manifest as an acute abdomen in this case is also ruled out   is also ruled out  how about the coexistence with uh an acute appendicitis an acute appec appendicitis as first at first was entertained however we immediately ruled it out uh after doing some physical examination because uh in acute appendicitis the pain is uh located at the  mcburnis area as well as the rebound tenderness which is all negative in this case ahhh so we easily ruled it out with all the differential diagnosis fully discussed in this case the manifestations noted really points out to an acute pancreatitis we are left with uh the laboratory diagnosis we will be guided if we request a serum amylase and serum lipase determination and other auxiliary procedures like uh complete blood count and if the patient can afford it would be much appreciated if we can do a c t scan which can confirm the diagnosis of pancreatitis and will be useful for predicting in predicting the outcome and identification of late complications we will manage the case as an acute pancreatitis we will be compelled to give analgesia preferably meperadin if it warrants we will put on i v intravenous fluids we will be placing the patient on a nasogastric intubation and n p o we will treat the hypocalcemia if we note a presence of this case antibiotics is also necessary when we if we will be able to establish a concurrent infection and we 're obliged to give cimetidine or any antacid to prevent a stress ulcer from developing so this is a frank case of acute pancreatitis   tape does not record what the other person is saying, just pauses so may twenty-three today is june fifteen seven plus fifteen twenty-two twenty-two days old he or she  girl good lucky you ha one boy and one girl  hoy albert is already three years old 'no  three three and a half oh good  you know how to space your children good family planning is there any problem  oh i see so this is your first well-baby check-up she 's cute okay she 's big and very active good suck ha  it looks hungry are you breastfeeding  why not  no you just have to be patient just let your baby suck so flow will improve you know the stimulus to improve i mean increase your secretion is sucking now every time your baby sucks she is sending a signal to your brain to produce some more milk it 's just like saying mom i need some more milk  so you produce some more milk whereas if you bottle-feed your baby at the time when you 're supposed to give her your breast there will be no more sucking and you will be sending a negative feedback so you stop producing milk because she doesn't need your milk anymore now in order that your secretion will increase all you have to do is let your baby suck it 's really sucking that improves the secretion  yes it may be painful but that is only temporary after some time you learn to adjust and there will be no more pain you know it will be very unfortunate if you stop breastfeeding your baby now because there 's just too much too many advantages not only do you establish a good maternal bonding that is a close relationship between you and your baby it is also very economical although i know you can afford to buy these expensive formulas but that is not enough your baby is a human being and you are supposed to give her human milk not cow 's milk then not only that 'no  the most important thing is your milk contains a lot of antibodies and these will help protect your baby from common infection well you know even if you have cough or colds if it is contagious whether or not you breastfeed your baby she will get it but if you breastfeed her you 'll be giving her antibodies so her resistance will improve and she will recover faster you see i 'm speaking from experience ha  more than a doctor i am a mother breastfeeding mother i have five kids and i breastfeed all of them funny 'no  you know every time i get pregnant a lot of these uhm medical representatives offer me their their formulas they 're giving it for free and yet i still breastfeed my baby and you know the feeling is terrific there is a feeling of contentment  you know another thing if you are breastfeeding you don't have to sterilize bottles you don't have to worry about formulas getting out of stock or your source of water you know a lot of mothers now are already using this what do you call this mineral water and it 's quite expensive you know and not only that you don't even have to get up at night to to prepare formulas your milk is there safe and ready available any time you need it but of course you you also have to take care of yourself you have to eat and drink a lot and take note ha it is not true that breastfeeding while you 're you 're depressed or you 're tired is bad there 's no such thing  well have i convinced you say yes because if not i will not stop unless you do okay oh by the way do you have a baby book  not yet okay i will give you one you know you 're really lucky ha  i just got it yesterday it 's been out of stock for several months already hmm she 's alright you can start with her vitamins now and be sure to burp your baby after each feeding ha and give sterile water in between feeding  gas pains hmm you know you will minimize gas pains if you let her burp every after feeding and if she still does you may try turning her on her abdomen like this okay like that and then gently pat or stroke her back like this okay and later on she will pass out air good okay bring her back on july eight oh july five for her immunization she will start with b c g then at two months o p v and d p t and so on okay 
Philippines	well first and foremost there are what we call signs and symptoms of pregnancy symptoms usually are the patient will usually complain of nausea or vomiting or dizziness usually in the early morning which is what we call morning sickness or the medical term for that is hyper- emesis gravidarium  now is that always the case when there is a pregnant woman   words   not really not all not all pregnant women complain of this but mostly uh uh about probably seventy percent would complain about nausea and vomiting   yeah will have hyper- emesis gravidarium within the first uh up to the twentieth twentieth week up to the twentieth week now yes   doktora now are there any other symptoms that i might uh  at the latest the twentieth week  well if there 's one more symptom which we call the pica   which is   now what 's a pica  the unusual craving for food  unusual food sometimes even some pregnant women will even resort to eating clay or soil 'cause of the pica  that is what we call in tagalog lihi   pica  yes  pica  okay so are those the only two symptoms that i have to observe   most of the those are the those are the most common symptoms other symp uh other signs will be amenorrhea or the absence of menses and other another sign will be the uh what do you call this enlargement of the abdomen some of some women will also complain of engorgement of the breasts and hyper-pigmentation or the darkening of the nipples the armpits and around the neck area uhm now doktora about the darkening of the nipples would that go back to normal yeah it will after pregnancy it will okay so i 'm just curious chuckles  now the second question is  laughs uh but the diagnostic of course the only  ti the only time you can be sure that the patient is pregnant if  you will get a positive pregnancy test or the you can see it in the ultrasound that there is a baby in the womb  pregnancy test  uh is that possible even in two weeks or one week old  the ultrasound   yes uh uhm uh i see okay so my second question is uh how do i take care of my wife for example if uh she 's pregnant what are the special precautions that i have to watch out or i mean what is your suggestion about it well pregnant women are usually most of the time they feel lazy they 're so sleepy you just give them uh provide adequate rest and if they are suffering from hyper- emesis gravidarium you can give vitamin b complex or some an anti-emetic like bonamine just bonamine yeah would that not affect ano have any effect on the baby the bonamine   no that 's safe for pregnant women uh that 's safe and of course you give them pre-natal vitamins and iron preparations because when the patient is pregnant uhm she would need all the supplies on her body to be   words for the baby   yeah because uh yeah the baby uses up the iron in her blood and calcium supplements also sometimes are needed so now what foods do you suggest actually a pregnant woman can eat anything she wants ex  uh but of course   except me laughs  no but of course we would suggest nutritious food for her for her good and for the good of her baby uh we would shy away from junk food because that has no nutritional value  right  soft drinks all the more because it just contains sugar and the weight will just go to the mother not to the baby yeah okay now what are the critical months that i have to watch out is it the first the second it 's usually the first three months or the first trimester  because during this time the baby is just being formed  uh-huh  so during this time it is uh if the mother gets sick or she takes medicines that are not allowed the baby can turn out to be deformed or with congenital abnormalities in in the first month   after the third tri after the first trimester all the baby does is grow up so most of his parts are complete already  yes  how about the last trimester  is that also the critical ay a critical stage that it might be a premature birth if something happens   it depends it depends it depends case-to-case basis case-to-case basis because like placen placenta  previa or abruptio placenta they usually happen later on uh-huh so you just have to be that 's why it is  necessary for the pregnant woman to go to  to prenatal check-ups monthly  well   uh-huh   now i have a cousin monthly prenatal check-ups   and then every two weeks starting on the seventh month and then weekly on the on the ninth month  uh-huh  now what if what would happen if uh during the first trimester  uh my wife would contact what do you call this uh  bulutong tubig ano 'yon  chicken pox chicken pox yes what would happen i mean would that be a big effect on the baby or or what or would that have no effect on the baby at all  or nobody is sure  well  you can never be sure if y uh sometimes we get pregnant women who get chicken pox early in their pregnancy but the babies turn out normal what is the most feared sickness during pregnancy is german measles  or rubella because chances are the baby will come out deformed  uh i see he will have congenital cataract microcephaly  or small head congenital heart disease and all those other things  and ment mental retardation also so we really have to avoid german measles yes now if you get rubella shots speaker b coughs  if is that advisable no not to pregnant woman to to single women or pregnant  wo single before getting pregnant  'yon nga if you have to get a rubella shot you have to wait six months before you can get pregnant uh i see or else or else the vaccine yeah it might affect the baby also within six months now now i 'm a dentist and i want to know do you suggest local anesthesia for extraction during pregnancy as much as possible minor surgical procedures should be deferred until after delivery unless it is absolutely necessary if for example you have an impacted molar which is causing the pain  the patient so much pain   intense pain yes well you should have to weigh the the pros and the cons the benefits for the patient and possible adverse effects to the baby uh okay if it 's absolutely necessary then now it is up to you now for example it is just a filling if it is just   a filling   do you use local anesthesia for filling yes we use local anesthesia now now what would happen if i use local anesthesia what  what are the effects would it go to the placental barrier or or would just pass the baby or what do you think would happen i 'm not so sure about local anesthesia but we usually advise them to avoid as much as possible   to avoid as much as possible okay so the interview is finished as of now and thank you very much any any further questions laughs  okay thank you  tapos na  yes dr del fierro judging from your uh uhm from my your opening remarks i suspected that maybe you had a change of heart regarding this  yes   about  your signature no i don't have a change of heart i don't have a change of heart and i mentioned it again to uh dr  mendoza  so but that 's alright i wish uh you could all sign it  and uh i have nothing i have nothing against the propositors  but signing it uh i can't   we have  it 's really up to you but i judging from what you said you made it appear that you would be in favor of such a proposal this morning  no i hope that i did not  i hope i did not i said let me see what did i say i said that i know that there is a move for his uh extension and that uh whatever might be the case uh you are against his extension in other words i am well i would say i am against the extension of uh it doesn't have to be to be uh francisco mendoza you know  but uh i i i i 'd like to stand by the uh present policy of the uh of the uh faculty manual  okay but i think  but it does say in the manual that on a case to case basis   uh people can be extended so if it were you i think we would do the same thing if it were dr quito we would also do the same thing  uh uhm  no i if it were i don't want any exception but there have been exceptions there had been but that was in the past that was during the uhm andrew administration but isn't this age discrimination uhm well then that 's a new philosophy no it 's not  it 's not a new philosophy  it 's a  it 's just that uh it 's just that i uh well i feel that there must be some retirement  would would the  yeah well it need not be sixty-five in fact it can be earlier in fact it could be later too it could be later but uh but in the case uh of some faculty members who retired they 're hired on a part-time basis yes and they are still considered competent you know yes no problem with that   so then what 's the point well the point is that uh if there 's no movement up there there would be no movement down here yeah but there is a movement there is a movement  there is a movement down here and we 're doing it  and once  no a movement in the sense that uh up here among among the seniors there must be movement uh but this is just cronyism isn't it we are all intelligent people i think we have a right to say what we think yes of course of course and i think we we have arguments to support our case so go ahead i mean uhm i i wish you the best and i have no i 've nothing against that your view prosper but uh i should hope not but anyway i think uh like i said before i think it 's a gesture and uh the point is uh when somebody has retired and then they turn back and re-hire him on a part- time basis to me it seems like exploitation  uh uhm  well then if uh the person feels it is exploitation then i think uh the thing to do is not to uh not to teach yeah but that 's a very cruel argument  because some people some people just don't have a choice when they turn sixty-five uh they don't have many other options and they 've been loyal to an institution and they 're still capable especially in an institution of ac academic learning an institution of intellectuals the mind is more fertile at that age  no  yes even even even later and uh so i mean kant uh wrote his work on religion when he was uh way over sixty right right and so you see for me it 's sometimes uh i just think that people should state what they think in order to avoid injustice i have no disagreement regarding that that the 1 word should continue words   the way i see it you know i just see it i think the way i see it very frankly is i think if there is some kind of solidarity here then uh i would expect your support uh uhm you see 'cause otherwise uh uh the chairman just becomes uh you know he stands in opposition to the faculty but if the faculty already has expressed its support i think uh a chairman should be should show his solidarity that 's not necessarily the case so i mean i 'm giving you the uh this has always been this has always been the okay well of course it 's your decision and this is not obligatory but that 's just the way i see it so i just want it to be out in the open 
Philippines	 not beginning of broadcast trade and commerce industry communications banking education for the southern part of the philippines and uh the need to establish malaca&ntilde;ang here has been the dream of the cebuanos for such a long time that 's one of the reasons why the cebuanos have been clamoring for a cebuano president 'no so that we can have a malaca&ntilde;ang here in cebu you 'd be surprised how many people fly to manila just to get some sort of government approval and uh many of these activities are really unnecessary except to help subsidize uh philippine airlines uhm the presence of a uh uhm malaca&ntilde;ang uh in the visayas uh would bring the president closer to the people and this is something that is truly meaningful to all of us we 're very very appreciative for this event at this point uh it 's hard to say how it will really benefit us but it has it 's never been tried before but most definitely uh we are very elated with this development and uh this is a step in the right direction a step in the right direction indeed and uh that sense of optimism by mayor osme&ntilde;a is one vision being shared not only by the cebuanos but by our people here in the visayan region especially when we talk about areas like uh eastern visayas and even parts of western visayas these areas in the past although the past administrations have tried their very best to ensure that uh development in these areas will come somehow the process has been very slow i think the momentum can be carried out toward the president ensuring that uh with the creation of the cebu of the south will be an extension now just looking at it here from cebu uh what and uh maybe you 've heard about the problems in other areas of uh the visayas what do you think should be one of the main agenda which uhm the people who are designated with the task should look at as uh priority areas uhm i think the the people now here in cebu are quite having problems as regards energy and water and i think the people are complaining about the system the electricity and the water and i think it 's a good thing that there is uh an established uhm e extension office of the president here in cebu so that whatever problems the people might have they can easily go there to the office and not fly to manila to give their complaints or whatever okay very good points established by you uh william you know one main element which the president mentioned last week when he went to davao to induct into office paul enriquez who will be heading the mindanao i mean the presidential office in davao city is coming out with a master plan of development for the whole of mindanao cebu over the past uh six years under the aquino administration has experienced an economic boom that 's why you talk about ceboom and about only to be stopped uh i think by typhoon ping when you had a lot of destruction  typhoon ping  how much sir was that worth in terms of destruction i mean it uh tore the whole province down but then due to the the driving enthusiasm of the cebuanos and their creativity their resourcefulness the province just rose from the ground and then as you can see there 's a lot of physical evidences uhm as regards the boom we have uh construction boom uh tourism has quite expanded a lot  and it 's very encouraging to know that president ramos has set his sights on cebu and the rest of the region also  yeah  well cebu over the past uh uh six years under the aquino uh administration has been experiencing very good growth rates g n p i think averaged between even higher than the national average of something like four percent and uh in terms of uh export earnings they have reached something like one or two hundred fifty million uh only last year uh tourism also a very good potential for development here in cebu and the visayas raked in about one hundred fifty-five million dollars in terms of the economy now at this time uh we would like to play back for you uh a the visit of the president president fidel ramos at the semiconductor plant uh right after touching down here in cebu there you see the president of course the semiconductor plant is just one of several companies that are located in the mactan export processing zone and this has provided so many jobs and one of the campaign promises of the president which he is now trying to attack is unemployment  in mactan yeah  uh uhm that 's one problem that we should address it 's always possible but uh if you try to look at the unemployment uh rate here in cebu compared on a national level or even uh in other parts of the region the rate of unemployment is not as high something like uh uh eighteen well seventeen percent uh other areas especially depre depressed areas they can go as high as twenty-five percent there the president now what is he wearing well in this area because semiconductor you talk about chips uh for computers which are essential in coming out with the manufacture of computers and high tech uh systems uh so the president is being gi given a briefing now exactly how the entire operation of semiconductors goes on the president uh uh has made this uh a part of his working visit to ensure that he goes to several areas uh where he considers the element of uh employment is very important uh i was talking to they say is this duri after they 've given him honors there in the mactan cebu international airport  yes  i was talking earlier to the trade secretary uh rizalino navarro now right now the present area of the mactan export processing zone is about one hundred twenty hectares talking about fifty-five companies but the trade department is envisioning a total of uh more companies they 're bringing in sixty so they need additional one hundred forty hectares how would you talk about the space here in cebu for business for investments  i mean  well there is uhm quite a lot i mean big a large amount of land which can be utilized as uhm business uhm to be used for business firms they can also have uh construct their building complexes for the improvement of tourism in cebu tourism in cebu a major prospect for development and cebu is can be a staging point to that  they will let tourist destinations uhm that will all develop tourist destinations to other part of met of the the visayas now the benefits for the uh establishment of the visayas uh here in cebu of the malaca&ntilde;ang here in the visayas here specifically in cebu is it becomes an extension arm for other regions in the country uh other provinces in the visayas uh like region six for western visayas you have the provinces of aklan antique capiz iloilo negros occidental in uh region eight this is one area that has been bothered so much by the insurgency but the peace and order situation has improved over the past five years and peace and order and political stability is one of the main agenda of the president during the first one hundred days and the province to be covered uh in terms of linking up with the palace through the cebu office uh leyte northern samar eastern samar western samar and biliran now for central visayas of course cebu main focal point for you you must be very happy bohol negros occidental and siquijor   yeah and siquijor  yes these are around central visayas which parts have you gone to which you think would be given uh top priority uh william well i 've never been out of cebu neither in bohol negros occidental or siquijor but i have lots of friends coming from bohol and they have more or less the same complaint they don't have potable water they they have poor electrical system and also there in negros i mean negros well negros business that is quite bad or well compared to negros ori occidental word  negros oriental is one of the provinces which is going to be given top priority it 's just very close to cebu one of the major problems that has some uh that has always uh prevented the economic development in areas like region eight like you talk about leyte samar has been the insurgency but this has been one problem that has been addressed very well and the uh reconciliation efforts of the president hopefully an amnesty program will be there for our rebel brothers from the communist rebels will be a very important element in ensuring that the peace and order situation in these areas will improve power development is going to be one of the key factors which are considered necessary in the development of uh leyte leyte already host to a major geothermal plant now at this time eli if you 're ready with uh some reports let 's have you  as we told you earlier the president took a helicopter from mactan airbase to the visayas command which is the headquarters of viscom and then he was joined and welcomed by uh the veterans the uh commander of the visayas command and the uh p n p chief uh mr roger dumila and a uh meeting with the veterans the council of elders they were discussing a lot of things to the welfare of the uh veterans among which of course is or regards the pensions of the veterans and this the president promised to look into at the uh instance of meeting the leaders of the uh veterans council there you have uh joel arnazo leading the president who used to be the uh commander here also at viscom this is a sentimental journey for the president because way back in nineteen seventy-one it was here when he was with the philippine army twelfth infantry brigade where the president earned his first star here at camp lapu-lapu so that this place will always be a part of his memory the president had a briefing also on the peace and order situation from the p n p chief and uh we 'll tell you more about the other activities this morning for the moment we turn you over to freddie and william thank you very much eli for that report uh with the uh meeting with the top military commanders in the area led by general zulueta who was only promoted last uh friday at the palace i had an opportunity to talk with him countryside development one area in the past administrations which was well not with the aquino administration i guess this has been given top priority is the area in samar and we 're very happy to have with us one of the governors governor bravo who was has been doing a very great job to ensure that development in that area will come with insurgency hopefully not a problem governor it 's a pleasure to have you again you must have a vision of uh i mean you must be very happy that the president uh is showing more concern now for the south and you are you have the malaca&ntilde;ang of the south here in the visayas in cebu how do you expect this to work in terms of forging a better and working relationship with uh the president yes first uh fred uh we 're very much uh gratified that uh there 's going to be a malaca&ntilde;ang in the south uh particularly in cebu i think this is the first right step uh because uh here you 're getting to know one another and you are reaching out okay that 's the first stage of development you cannot develop uh people uh unless and until uh you know their leaders in uh region eight where i come which uh comprises uh these the provinces of samar and leyte we are still in that uh stage where we want the basic uh needs for our people basic in the sense that uh while uh other countries would have reached that uh so-called word uh newly-industrialized countries here in the philippines and particularly region eight uh we still want uh power uh infrastructure countryside development uh and uh we would like to stamp out the problem of insurgency via these uh livelihood projects uh on the line let me ask the governor ho how can this uh extension office of th president be of help to your province as a governor number one uh cebu is a little bit uh nearer to samar and leyte and which means that uh it is uh less expensive uh in going to manila and uh besides uh we 're talking uh of decentralization and local autonomy and that is now uh the idea which uh whose time has come  uh with eric pelaez we do not have to be going to the bureaucratic uh debilitating system of governance in what you call the imperial uh city of manila which is after all has many problems of brown-outs of garbage of traffic and pollution uh anyway we are helping the nation by having malaca&ntilde;ang in the south so that we can decongest uh certain areas in manila did you know that for example uh the uh smokey mountain in tondo would uh really uh uh be solved uh if we really decentralized because most of the population in the smokey mountain uh comes from samar leyte so instead of uh you know uh going to manila every now and then in the process uh sustaining that policy of mendicancy and dependency where we have to beg for financial aid for approval of feasibility study for giving the go ahead signal towards uh uh programs of worth all we have to do is refer it to pelaez uh come now to uh the very nice pleasant pleasing uh hospitable city of cebu where uh we can get things done and get results uh thank you governor for joining us and good luck and hopefully all the support that you wanted will be coming from the palace thank you very much uh fred and thank you for having me   will when you come back to eastern samar you can spread the good news to those people i hope uh we have uh one like this in uh eastern samar i hope uh if this is via satellite we can be reached in borongan thank you very much thank you governor governor uh bravo of uh the province of eastern samar one area which is has been bothered by the insurgency problem but the peace and order situation has gradually improved over the years and hopefully with a very sincere effort with the president and with the support of both houses of congress to come up with an amnesty program for the rebels and hopefully there will be a very good chance that this twenty-year insurgency will be finally resolved and this time eli how are you  the sentimental journey of president ramos to camp lapu-lapu where he earned his first star was highlighted by two events this was the dialogue with the uh veterans but before that there was a closed door conference for the military officers with general romeo zulueta of the visayas command and the chief of the uh p n p general roger dumila these two officers namely general zulueta and general dumila are no strangers to the area as we know general dumila has just presently returned to cebu this was also joined by some of the members of the first family we uh have here the secretary the executive secretary peter garrucho we have the uh d i l g secretary raffy alunan and the other dignitaries who joined the president in this meeting with the officers of the viscom the president was given a uh comprehensive picture as to the peace and order situation obtaining in the area and uh there you have general dumila who gave the briefing to the president on the peace and order situation in the visayas we also have here the uh the chief of the of the uh secretary of the department of national defense secretary renato de villa and we will have more of the activities that are taking place here in cebu with the visit of the president for the moment we turn you over to freddie and william thank you very much uh eli for that report at camp lapu-lapu  the president meeting with top commanders in the area being joined by defense secretary uh renato de villa and uh local government secretary rafael alunan together with press secretary ro rod reyes of course when you talk about seeing secretary alunan one of the the things that comes into your mind is uh the local government code but at the same time the war against crime  he 's working very closely with the uh chief of the presidential anti- commission on anti-crime and the perhaps one of the major action programs which the president wants addressed during his first one hundred days is the war against crime and this has been very successful during the past two weeks since its launching with erap estrada right there and hopefully the momentum being carried out in uh in the luzon area will be carried out here in the visayas and even mindanao now william as usual uh the first lady will have the 1 word activities this afternoon uh she will visit maytabal rattan exporting company and right after that she will visit the street children center at parian for a short program and i think uh the first lady herself has a lot of things in her itinerary well the first lady also a very active uh person and uh one of her top priority well she has been designated as somebody who should be in charge of beautification but prior to the president 's oath-taking a i was talking to the first lady and one of her top priorities is to plant more trees and reforestation and one of the main agenda of the ramos government is sustainable development but at the same time ensuring environmental protection to ensure that the environment we have will not dissipate even if development will come joining us at the stage is the governor of a very small island but i gue i guess very beautiful twice governor ben aquino of siquijor governor uh welcome to our coverage you must be very happy that you have itong tinatawag nating malaca&ntilde;ang of the south dito sa cebu how does this help you in a way considering that in the past uh some of the attention is not coming out uhm not exactly  if uh government in this project of uh malaca&ntilde;ang in the south if government has to to appropriate uh funds for the purpose i feel that it is not necessary we have the different regional offices of the different agencies we have the governors who could uh directly go to malaca&ntilde;ang uh for anything that uh would need uh the attention from the president probably i guess we will have uh a monthly conference with the president so as i said if uh government has to to appropriate additional funds for this purpose i think it 's not necessary well anyway just looking at uh discussing regional concerns that can be worked out together among the provinces to ensure that development can be very balanced

reporting live from ayala makati meanwhile from makati we move on to the luneta area i believe the mood remains festive there as more and more  el shaddai members flock for tonight 's celebration karmina constantino is there and she gives us this update karmina thanks ron roasted cows and pigs are not the only one from the menu today it seems like members of the el shaddai charismatic movement have also developed an appetite for roads and any available space there is no stopping them from flocking to the quirino grandstand today to celebrate their founder 's birthday and the group 's fifteenth anniversary we 're here at the tenth floor of the manila hotel where we 've been closely monitoring the influx of followers of el shaddai  and let me tell you ron they 've been pretty consistent in furthering their number they 've already taken over a great portion of roxas boulevard let 's talk some figures here the western police district estimates the grandstand to accommodate about four hundry or four hundred and eighty thousand people and that 's only talking about the immediate environs of the grandstand alone that 's about four people per square meter and if the crowd spills over to roxas boulevard which it has already the figure according to the w p d estimates will only amount to half a million that 's five hundred thousand and judging from what we 're looking at over here that 's i think uh a rough estimate is about five hundred thousand people we 're looking at right now and that 's a far cry from the three to five million mark estimated by the el shaddai group but see it 's still quite early in the day also sporadic rains may have delayed the arrival of some groups but ron whether it 's a crowd of five hundred thousand or five million w p d director chief superintendent efren fernandez assures there are more than enough policemen securing the area aside from the one thousand four hundred policemen from the special action force the western police district and the regional mobile group have also deployed an additional uh two thousand policemen to strategic points in the area to make sure any untoward incidents will not disrupt today 's event ron we 're about an hour and a half into today 's celebration and so far no arrests have been made however our roving reporter macel ingles uhm have has told us rather policemen downstairs are already having a hard time patrolling the  lechon lines as some members of the el shaddai  charismatic movement are trying to get into to get in front of the line to take part of today 's feast now in spite of that chief superintendent efren fernandez is optimistic it 's gonna turn out to be a peaceful day their main concern right now is traffic and crowd control  interview clip  alright traffic enforcers from the traffic management bureau have already begun re-routing traffic the portion of roxas boulevard going to pasay has already been taken over by members of the el shaddai charismatic movement and north bound vehicles are also having a hard time going through the crowd and judging from the way it looks up here i think ron we 're only counting minutes before the whole of roxas boulevard is gonna be taken over by members of the el shaddai charismatic movement reporting live from the manila hotel i 'm karmina constantino back to you ron karmina constantino from the manila hotel now we move closer to the festivities we have miranda de quiros reporting from the quirino grandstand miranda music  thank you ron the rains will not dampen the spirit of the members of the  el shaddai  they are on their feet now singing and dancing to their favorite gospel songs they call this part of the celebrations the joyful worship and they are literally expressing their happiness as they praise their yahweh el shaddai  earlier we also heard some members deliver their testimonies on how their lives were touched by the lord while the program is going on other members are still lining up to get their share of the roasted calves and pigs brother mike velarde had in store for the el shaddai members in his sixteenth in his sixtieth birthday thanksgiving salu-salo  the el shaddai members have been lining up by the food stalls as early as ten o'clock this morning at three o'clock this afternoon a helicopter would be going around the quirino grandstand to drop miracle

change and uh there are provisions specific to certain sectors of society there are provisions from the farmers provisions from uh proposals from fishermen proposals from businessmen a little while ago we interviewed uh pastor saycon who was a vice-president of the management association of the philippines and who just resigned from that association due to circumstances that have been uh that

the podium uh behind her are going to be seated the senate vice president the speaker of the house and the vice-president i expect and uh she 's going to deliver her state of the nation address a very short ceremony before that uh malaca&ntilde;ang has been saying that her speech today is going to be short and simple her speech last year was around forty-five or fifty minutes long uh in that speech she outlined her thirty-five promises and uh out of the thirty-five there are some groups that say twenty-two promises were uh delivered by the president and her administration her cabinet uh word the the word is is that the president is going to make new promises in this new speech uh but focus on very few things uh peace and order uh being one of them uh power rates is another thing that the president is going to focus on that probably being the closest to issue to the hearts of the people at this time we we 're going to await the entrance of the president into the hall in the meantime we still have dr abueva and prof romero with us in the studio break in recording  jing at this moment uh president gloria macapagal-arroyo is still closeted in one of the offices here at the batasang pambansa  building with senate president franklin drilon speaker of the house jose joe de venecia the secretary-general of the house uh these personalities had met her earlier when she arrived here at the batasan  it is exactly sixteen minutes before the president is uh set to address the a joint session of congress uh great expectations once again of the president 's sona and of the president herself on this her second state of the nation address uh she will of course by this state of the nation address open the second regular session of the twelfth congress the president is now on her way to the uh session hall where speaker de venecia and senate president drilon are waiting for her waiting to hear what she has to say as i said great expectations because as we all know she will be focusing very strongly and emphasizing very strongly on the need to strengthen the republic she will be talking about a strong republic that will be the theme of her sona this year this historic batasang pambansa building has been witness to a very colorful political history of this country we all know that uh this was inaugurated in nineteen seventy-eight uh with the interim batasang pambansa calling it home uh many have said that it was actually a rubber-stamp parliament uh by uh of ferdinand marcos former president that parliament was elected in nineteen seventy-eight  the interim  pia  yes jing pia i 'm going to ask you to take off your hat as an as an anchor and our co-host this afternoon and put on your hat as a subject matter expert uh politically while everyone is excited about what the president is going to say today and we all know what the reactions are going to be in the days to come uh but the focus will be on politically what 's happening at the senate because a lot of things are hinged on that critical numbers game in the senate now that the majority uh has the numbers what do you expect to happen uh down the line well jing uh we can always say na the senate uh the administration has the majority now in the senate but let 's not forget it 's a very slim majority uh it 's thirteen eleven  so ang lamang lang ng administration sa  opposition ay isa lang so  napakaliit na na na linya yan ano jing  yeah   uh huh   clapping in the background the president now in the lobby of the batasang pambansa building she 's in a mustard orange uh suit beside her is senator loren legarda in a muslim-inspired attire a while ago uh the first gentleman mike arroyo was being escorted into the batasang pambansa session hall by uh mrs gina de venecia the wife of the speaker and with the first gentleman were the children of the president luli mikey and dato jing as you were saying yes a very slim majority in the senate it 's not something exactly to be comfortable about i suppose that the administration will have to get more senators on their side from the opposition the president uh going down the newly the the session hall as we can see it 's a brand new carpet brand new ceiling brand new walls and uh the refurbishment has cost the house of representatives seven point five million pesos the president there being greeted by members of the house of representatives and of the senate they 're going to be sitting in joint session this afternoon as they listen to her second state of the nation address pia yeah uh let 's not let 's not take the video away from the screen uh the president is expected to deliver her address soon let 's just be in the background and provide and provide color a lot of people have a lot of expectations but a lot of people also have been saying the same thing about what they expect about the president peace and order power rates uh jobs uh on top of a whole list of things that they expect the president to talk about have you had more information you gave us an idea an outline a sense of what the president is going to talk about is there anything any new information about anything that she 's going to say today pia well jing uhm you know the problem kasi with uh early releases of the president 's state of the nation address is that it can change at any time sometimes may magbibigay sa inyo ng isang kopya ng isang  state of the nation address at sasabihin as of two a m as of three a m four a m   that happens every year  sorry couldn't hear  that happens every year yes yes that 's right so you know kahit na maging specific tayo minsan nagkakaproblema dahil mayroong hindi na babanggitin si gma na uh una na nating nabanggit so we try to as much as possible not to be too specific the session is about to be called to order jing okay pia the president is introduced by the speaker and she then delivers her state of the nation address   applause fifty-four minutes prolonged applause the president 's state of the nation address the president 's second state of the nation address forty sta  forty-eight minute speech applauded seventy-four times interrupted by applause seventy-four times the president there declaring war on crime terrorism and poverty a war she says that must be won decisively if a strong republic is to emerge at all unsullied by dominant classes and sectors the president there saying that the economy is strong now that the philippines is the third best-performing economy in asia and the best-performing in southeast asia  the president also saying   on behalf of the senate   words the house of representatives the joint session is adjourned gavel; applause  speaker jose de venecia adjourning the joint session of congress right after the president delivered her second state of the nation address before uh the opening of the second regular session of this joint congress of the house of representatives and the senate as i said the president delivered a forty-eight minute speech applauded seventy-four times the president declaring war on crime terrorism and poverty a war that must be won decisively if the strong republic is to emerge at all the president saying that the economy is strong we are the third best-performing economy in asia the best-performing in southeast asia she says that a strong republic is one that will take care of its people and its future the president of course beginning her speech by referring to her father uh the former president diosdado macapagal and listing her accomplishments as regards to the promises that she made in her sona last year uh there was one thing that stood out in that whole long list of accomplishments where she said that apart from unilab no other medicine company was giving or selling lower-priced medicines and she said that the government would be studying punitive measures for in that regard as soon as she had finished uh her list of accomplishments the president had said that this is just the tip of the iceberg and that she had promised that she would deliver and submit to congress a formalized list of her accomplishments the booklet that was shown to us last week that was entitled g m a delivered or g m a delivers the president also saying a strong republic does what it says and as i said takes care of its people and its future there was also uh a lot of focus on peace and order the need to uh combat and defeat crime criminal syndicates and drug syndicates the president there saying that the philippine national police will be assisted by armed forces of the philippines by elements intelligence and combat elements of the armed forces of the philippines in its fight against the drug syndicates also the president making a joke at her own expense when she said  i cannot grow taller but i can always get better  this was of course applauded she uh in the meantime was saying that in the future her working agenda was to create more job opportunities and of course to intensify the fight against corruption to maintain peace and order and to bring down the cost of power she did say that she had ordered that the p p a be lowered be decreased and uh she 's taking credit for that of course also a a reminder to napocor and meralco to stop bickering to work together also the president making one of her more memorable statements  the stone of a strong republic when and she also said  and i intend to be well-remembered  in reference to the civil society groups and other sectors that had joined her at edsa dos she said i shall not disappoint those who went to edsa  also i suppose uh she was referring to these civil society groups that had uh just recently just about two or three weeks ago been very upset about the appointments or the joining the administration by the puno bro  by ronnie ronaldo puno and by jaime policarpio the president was saying that she uh regrets that there were broken friendships along the way she did also say and end her speech her her state of the nation address by saying many of the right decisions are the tough decisions but she did promise that she will lead our country towards a strong republic she ended with a very familiar line when she said stay with me uh this is something that former president fidel ramos had said many times before during his incumbency jing yeah pia uh this was a a speech as you said applauded seventy-four times uhm was there anything new was there any issue that was new in the speech other different from the speech that she delivered last year   in terms of focus  well uhm  jing uh appa uh actually last year yung  sona niya also had a lot to do with fight against corruption maintaining peace and order the fight against crime uh in a way masasabi natin jing na medyo hindi rin nagbago yung mga sinasabi ng pangulo dahil uh sinabi na nga niya paulit-ulit no na kailangang pag-igtingin pa itong kampanya laban sa krimen laban sa terorismo at sa iba pang mga problema ng uh ng bansa  although she did what made it different in a sense was that she kept hammering on the theme of a strong republic and how important it is to be able to put this strong republic together building it stone by stone so that we have one one full edifice jing 
Philippines	 music there is something about the araneta coliseum rainy days in july the blaring sounds of bass drums and snare drums the blaring trumpets and it makes you say it smells like school spirit all over again welcome everyone we 're back for more for season sixty-four of the u double a p first stop u p fighting maroons going up against the adamson falcons and in our second game the u s t growling tigers going up against our mighty host the far eastern university tamaraws we 're coming to you live from the araneta coliseum in the heart of quezon city i 'm mico halili with professor randy sacdalan by my side to welcome you to u a a p sixty-four uh partner it doesn't get 'no it doesn't get any any better than this one you know you can feel the excitement  basketball vacation is over it 's time to roll out the ball and you know play some good basketball and what a game to start things off u p fighting maroons against adamson falcons boy it 's gonna be one big start for sixty-four okay we had a great time bringing you season sixty-three last year and we expect this season to be uh to give us more fun more excitement first game u p versus adamson two teams uh which carried the losing record last year but uh a lot of promise for the two teams involved and the two coaches as well well of course u p went through some uh soul-searching 'no  they got four wins last year but why could they not have come out stronger they have some new recruits for uh the fighting maroons they look for a better year this year they 're looking to get into the final four for coach ryan gregorio it 's something that he has waited for more than ten months and he wants to get back uh here in the u a a p while for luigi trillo well it was his birthday yesterday 'no and i think he wants a fitting tribute to the start of the season he wants to get to the winning track for the adamson falcons okay before we get to the two teams the two combatants this afternoon let 's explain the battlefield for u a a p sixty-four well all the teams would have to play two games for each team total of fourteen so the u p fighting maroons will get to play adamson falcons twice until the eighteenth words and the top four will go to the uh semi-finals wherein the top two teams one and two will play three and four with a twice-to-beat advantage for the first two teams and of course the winners will fight it out for the best-of-three championship for uh u a a p sixty-four well a lot of people can't wait for the u a a p final four this year but uh we 'll go through the individual wars and battles for these teams after talking about the format let 's go through the officiating we have a lot of rule changes uh this year friend well of course the asian basketball academy chose now to uh help the u a a p and take over things in terms of officiating well the first one the four ten-minute period is no longer played in half so the teams just have to make this adjustment a lot of them have prepared for this the eight-second back court rule similar to our m b a so it 's gonna be a faster movement from the back court to the front court and of course the three referees is an innovation in amateur basketball in the u a a p wherein you know they 've even uh invited darrel garretson to to help us out in the three referees i think that 's gonna change a lot of the rules and the way things are played in the u a a p mico hey one thing to watch out for when you look at the referees this year is how they will position themselves that was the biggest lesson they learned from veteran n b a referee darrel garretson when he visited and when he trained our u a a p referees so watch out how they position themselves on the court and how they make the calls again a pleasant pleasant saturday afternoon from the big dome  let 's talk about the u p fighting maroons one of our combatants this afternoon u p finishing with a four and ten record good for sixth place last year but but people may not know it 's a fact that they had close games last year well the point that you 're raising mico is the six to ten losses there were four four points in 1 word but the biggest deficit that they yielded was ten points 'no  for a team to go out on a losing record with that kind of a a margin you know you can't help but feel you know it 's okay it 's okay 'no  you gave it your all there were no blown-out games for them and they got into three overtime games and look they the sixty-eight point eight points per game is you know is something that uh 2 words  it 's not the way that u p played the game that yielded most number of points to the opponents but it 's how really how they played the game and how they lost by a very little margin through the sixty-third u a a p okay we 're about to talk about two young men who made strong impressions last year we 're talking about uh michael bravo and robson bornancin the u p community calls them the killer bees bravo a former san beda red cap bornancin coming out of the brent basketball system impressive numbers for bornancin most especially as a rookie uh yes he almost made it as rookie of the year for rob bornancin and for michael bravo it was really a coming out year he was able to get the confidence of uh uh ryan grego gregorio and the rest of uh the team but you know the trouble with bornancin he 's very young with his third worst three point six errors but that could be forgiven now you 're looking at a tougher rob bornancin a more intelligent player and michael bravo i think very very confident this young man 'no he has established himself as the shootingest of the maroons and an heir to uh paulo mendoza for the u p fighting maroons okay so those are the dependables for uh coach ryan gregorio let 's talk about uh players we did not see last year but could have a big impact for the maroons this year patrick madarang was part of u p before uh he left after uh he left for a year and then we 're about to meet kenneth robin uhm this find of uh of the u p coaching staff from cebu these are two players who just might be the difference between a losing record and a slot in the final four well patrick madarang words this is his last year in the u a a p no more edric ferrer they could be looking for leadership from patrick madarang 'no  he brings about the seniority and stability in the line-up for kenneth robin of course i can see him from this distance as 'no uh we were told a lot of uh baby fat still surrounding his uh elbows well he shows a lot of promise and u p went into a runner-up finish uh last in the last philippine youth basketball league that should make it very exciting for this young ball club from u p diliman  laughter e a lot of observers have said that u p was just a big 1 word in the court last year of making a better uh impression or getting a better record after season sixty-three so that 's for u p a lot of promise for this team it 's a bigger team a more experienced team so a lot to watch out for for the u p fighting maroons let 's switch over to the other side the adamson falcons led by the youthful head coach luigi trillo they learned as a team they had they learned a lot of lessons from last year 's debacle so too much a pain to handle for from last year going uh winless in one season and the last win coming in august nineteen nineteen ninety-nine at uh over uh f e u but you know look at that uh team things for for adamson 'no they 're so much down at the basement 'no there 's no other direction for them but up the losing margin thirteen point eight is the biggest margin they were last in this very important statistical department and you know they 're really looking forward into this uh season they wanna get back to they had several close ball games last year i remember one overtime game against u s t it was there but they missed out on the three free throws could not extend it to the second overtime and uh who knows this might be the game to start things right for the falcons it could be a break-out season for them very young uh squad for the adamson coach luigi trillo will rely on the leadership of melvin mamaclay uh you 're about to see his numbers mamaclay had nine point two points per game four point six rebounds per outing uh he is one one of the dependable holdovers for coach trillo well he won't be uh well so many guys have graduated the likes of bruce lee uh no more eu uh cris eusebio no longer in the team but mamaclay well he was in the line-up of welcoat who was 1 word the last champions in the last p b l so that should put some stability into his ball game melvin mamaclay plus you know the rookies would be looking for uh mamaclay 's leadership on the floor 'no  he he could not afford to do mistakes as you take a look at uh the good players for adamson when we talked with coach luigi trillo during the free season he was so excited about his youngsters mark abadia steve rolan and ramil tagupa when i look at rolan now i could remember him him in the junior p b l he 's a stocky guy who could do things  that 's melvin mamaclay for you  so mark abadia who plays number two is one exciting guy that they got from uh cebu mico i think we 'll have the numbers of uh we have the numbers of uh mark abadia later on and then tagupa plays the one for the adamson falcons 'no  it 's a new team they went into the 3 words in preparation for this u a a p i think they 're gonna go better they 're gonna go still on the triangle offense on the part of luigi trillo 's uh philosophy for the adamson falcons okay we 'll talk more about this first game of season sixty-four between the adamson falcons and the u p fighting maroons when the u a a p returns here on studio twenty-three  music friends welcome back to the big dome the araneta coliseum and the return of the u a a p here on studio twenty-three we have with us to complete our team our student laughter courtside reporters of course the u p community will be represented ably by mr jorell legaspi and then adamson will be represented by aileen sabiaga two new faces that you 'll get used to throughout the duration of u a a p sixty-four we 'll start with this gentext report on the u p fighting maroons courtesy of jorell jorell good afternoon jorell reports  absolutely perfect report from jorell uh legaspi uh and now uh let 's go turn over to the reporter from adamson uh ms aileen sabiaga good afternoon aileen music  okay it appears we 'll have to wait for a second for that talking about u p uh again a lot of promise for uh for this young team a lot of close losses last year but uh three key big key additions big man wise for coach ryan gregorio that 's right 'no robin will put bornancin in a more familiar position for him that will be three and four so he won't be tendering much of the boards but looking really to score his numbers 'no and i think that 's one big advantage for u p okay let 's go quickly to ms aileen sabiaga from the adamson side aileen aileen reports  i think that is one thing these two young coaches will do a lot of this year and that is to communicate with their players uh coach ryan gregorio and coach luigi trillo two of the most vocal most emotional coaches we have in the u a a p i think they 're very good at that you know considering that they 're also broadcasters themselves 'no speaker a laughs  the power of communication is very much inside them and i think it 's the chemistry of the new players blending with the veterans that 's gonna put that '' be given premium at least for this game 'no the adamson with five holdovers the rest new players boy that 's gonna need a lot of chemistry to happen if they want to pull one over u p this afternoon it 's a new year it 's a new season for these two teams hoping to redeem themselves from disappointing season last year mike bravo he will be in charge of providing the scoring sock for the fighting maroons oh yes and uh u p starters mainly are the holdovers bravo jomaleza celo bornancin and santos you know they wanna make sure that no many not too many mistakes to start things for uh coach ryan gregorio while for uh adamson well that you 're looking at coach ryan gregorio i think he 's more subdued at the start of the season for now   yeah   he he has more time to prepare that 's the difference right right from last year he mentioned that he was really too weak to be able to prepare his team now no no reason for them to uh start things cold while for adamson it 's really a very young team two rookies or actually three rookies in the first five of coach luigi trillo in tagupa rolan and abadia so only yong and mangulabnan we don't even have a mamaclay in the first five of adamson
Philippines	the archers managing to survive a scare by the blue eagles at many occasions during the course of the first half especially when tenorio got into the ball game and scored with about eight points but unluckily for ateneo ateneo got into foul trouble and fonacier has his own uh highlighting the first half but still wilson and ritualo i think they carried the load heavily for de la salle while we 're still waiting for rico alvarez to sign on with three fouls to erupt in the second half but you know definitely blue becomes you today i must say that you were wise to wear blue here today  laughter oh yes i i 've to think about the uh situation of the laughter i have to blend with your group  laughter okay okay but uh this game is being fought so ferociously by both sides uh uh the foul trouble might be the key and the free throw shooting might be the areas where it could spell the difference oh sa free throw shooting for example sev 'no it 's uh eighty-nine percent by la salle they made seventeen points on nineteen tries while ateneo only made ten out of eighteen from the free throw line that could spell the difference right now it 's the difference in the first half in terms of defense both have tried to draw the press uh yeah ateneo managed to break it la salle also managed to break it sino ang matibay ang resistensya might be also a difference here in the game uh la salle we 're looking at two point guards only for la salle it 's uh mike cortez and eric arijola with matching joseph yong for uh de la salle cholo villanueva the other rookie is not playing today for ateneo l a tenorio would certainly be the difference for ateneo  ateneo is a different team without l a tenorio i mean uh they do move a little better the fluidity is there yes but they 're you 're so correct they are not the same team when tenorio is down on the bench because of three personal fouls yes because they 're confident that tenorio can bring down that leather unlike when they pressed gimko and tanchie there 's really a very good chance that they might lose the ball from the back court so if tenorio uh watches his fouls and gets to play on the court majority of the second half i think ateneo will be okay by the same token la salle is a different team when ritualo has to sit down on the bench we take a look at some of the significant numbers we take a red ballpen you 're the teacher here also and we circle some important numbers my friend well both of us uh belong to the academe sev so laughter i don't have a monopoly of the title professor here laughter  okay thirty-six percent shooting for la salle but today they atoned for that uh eighty-nine percent free throw shooting that 's actually fifty-six percent and eighty-nine percent free throw shooting ateneo did better from the field but only shot ten of eighteen from the free throw line ateneo had one rebound better but the turnovers it favored de la salle forty turnovers committed by the ateneo and only eight for de la salle jolly paz we mentioned earlier was thinking about quickness the pace of the ballgame  it looks like it does favor la salle when it 's wide open court basketball that 's where ritualo likes it and that 's where tenorio likes it but it 's just that he cannot stay on the floor for long  oh  oh yes that 's that 's that 's correct sev about uh about la salle 'no they want open baske  they have the men to do that  for ateneo they 're just feeling it the strength of ateneo is still rich alvarez and rico villanueva unfortunately rainier has not yet hit his stride membrere only fonacier i recall and tenorio has hit shots from the three-point area they need a lot more to free up the uh play offensively for rico and rich downstairs and just for the information of everybody i also brought a green shirt just in case  i knew that this was going to be the la salle side speaker b laughs  you also have your green shirt with you oh yes uh just to make sure for insurance sev in the meantime the uh blue babble battalion is on the floor right now with their all-halftime palabas  this is just getting better and better year after year oh yes the way uh and some people say that we 're the only teams just la salle and ateneo i hate to say we 're words   wala e 'kala mo nagkuwentuhan lang 'no  in fairness to our other members in the broadcast panel la salle and ateneo they 've stuck to the tradition of cheers while the other cheerers really you 're a the real cheer leader yourself sev words  long time ago but la salle and ateneo they 've stuck with the tradition of cheering and that 's what the u a a p is all about and the big thing that has developed here is because because these two universities which became co-educational some time in the seventies have now accepted that women are part definitely of the halftime palabas and i think rightfully so in fact the ateneo palabas right now even has their grade school cheer leaders on the floor right now  so it is the whole uh community so to speak  laughter that 's right and uh it 's a good thing for ateneo really to have the the women also participating in their cheering squad okay and uh you 're very nice to me today i noticed in the uh meantime talking about community we have for the ateneo blue eagles patty laurel with this gentext update take it away patty update from patty  thanks a lot patty and uh it is indeed up to the ateneans to bounce back because la salle they are not just going to give away this game and their championship they 're looking for number four no question about it they 're gonna work very hard for that and the same with ateneo ateneo wanted to break into the championship 'no  they 've been in the final four for a couple of years now and you know this could be the big year for them and and i i 've anticipated you know  we missed the la salle ateneo dream match-up last year f e u got in the way but so many teams wanted that and i think hard work would really be the the point for all the teams here in the sixty-fourth u a a p what are the other teams seeing here like u s t i see uh some players and some of the coaches from f e u and u s t what are they seeing here well one it 's a different la salle team that they 're looking at uh it 's it 's becoming a renren ritualo show eighteen points for renren ritualo and i think that 's gonna be one factor that franz pumaren may be happy at this point but be unhappy later on because you have the countdown on renren ritualo he can can't score eighteen points 'no la salle would not want him to do that for ateneo it 's becoming terrible for the other teams because they now have the last piece of the puzzle which is a point guard 'no  it 's just a matter of time before rico and rich alvarez combine together and really make the defense very difficult against ateneo because he 's gonna scatter the entire defense  we have the outside game of tenorio and uh and rainier sison complementing alvarez boguia and uh villanueva inside that 's three and four positions seems to be at at ateneo 's advantage in this game at the point  and at the four position la salle seems to have the clear edge in the game at least if we take out tenorio from the equation of course yes of course but uh tenorio 's part of the equation we could only take him out if he has more than uh if he commits his fifth foul or fourth foul early in the third period but ateneo would need to start tenorio in the third quarter  it 's very pivotal for ateneo but of course tenorio would have to watch out 'no he wanted an exciting ball game 'till the end sev and our full schedule of games we will be presenting majority of the games in the course of the u a a p season and i 'm sure the other teams will see this is the level not just because it 's ateneo and la salle but the level in which they must play to be able to go up against these two teams noise  it 's clear they 're watching the game between la salle and ateneo  of course everybody every team in the u a a p wants la salle 's head  they 're the defending champions they don't want to make another uh occasion wherein u s t in the nineties bagged the four consecutive championships the rest of the teams they don't want that to happen to la salle of course la salle wanted it for ateneo it 's been a long time since eighty-seven and eighty-eight for danny and company that they wanted i wonder who the center of that team was as speaker b laughs you take a look at director fritz infante who uh helped direct our opening palabas also and there of course well ateneo la salle he 's on the la salle side of the the floor but you 're right about the other aspect uh the big alumni so to speak yung mga in government politics and business they 're all around and all the pretty girls from a different time a different era speaker b laughs  my classmates are here they they 're my batch from high school seventy-four they said uh to kill you but i said you 're a nice guy really but you know uh they said uh can you at least try i have an atenean father so laughter he 's high school fifty-four partner  laughter so that neutralizes the whole thing okay i told you he 's a very nice guy in the meantime chuckle forty-seven the bob novales formula say the score when you 're too happy forty-seven to forty-one laughter is is the count as we begin the second half of play we are so glad you could join all of us here today in this very special presentation on studio twenty-three u a a p sixty-fourth season second day of competition yes i believe we have to jump again noise wow tall line-up together with cortez and ritualo ritualo circles around a huge pick by ramos finds himself open gets a good look unable to sink it noise   even renren ritualo in a pre-season interview said nag-iiba din ang laro niya 'pag ateneo la salle  oh yes ibang-iba yung level that was a plain steal ritualo is gone any markers for renren ritualo noise  and that was sort of expected when you have ritualo if you can bottle him up maybe it will help your cause in the meantime here comes membrere across the time line applies the breaks sison sends it over to uh tenorio in the meantime rico villanueva got a foul from santa maria doubling up on rico villanueva noise third foul on uh adonis and that 's a clear smart zed steal smart zed the power to live the life you choose smart zed your telephone now noise  it 's enrico villanueva outside to membrere 1 word connection with tenorio there in the meantime there 's a foul  la salle will have another and that is on michael reyno second team foul now for uh la salle  it' s a difficult match-up for vainio he 's covering uh rainier sison vainio used to play the foreign five in high school but he has to contend with somebody like rainier sison  and from the outside he moves very well from the outside  na magalaw   oo oo  there 's alvarez altering his pace drives hard loses his control of the ball santa maria was not exactly going to give him an open lane but look at this tenorio with a heist up up up and away that 's gonna make cortez think about dribbling in front of tenorio noise  tenorio may be feeling right now i 'm on a bit of borrowed time and the coaching staff i 'm sure told him huwag kang susundot pag alanganin  cortez managing to get it to santa maria santa maria starts his drive to the basket blocked by villanueva but there 's a foul prior to that block ouch we missed george during halftime now we would get an opportunity to chat with george in this gentext update update from george  excellent report uh george and of course i 'm not surprised that la salle is a bit worried about what tenorio can do as far as damage to their cause is concerned if la salle doesn't figure it out he could be this big in his first game in the u a a p noise  here 's rich alvarez seeing his wide opening unable to fill in that gap decides to slow down membrere switches it over to tenorio who cuts up the inside but to no avail noise   rico villanueva can't get to it he 's beaten to the punch that time by ramos
Philippines	bravo now it 's robin robin with the ball back to bravo four on the shot clock they 've got to get it up bravo takes the three shoots the three in and out and the rebound goes to estrada tubid to ronquillo back to tubid now it 's yap yap dribble drive up to tubid open for three passes it up for ronquillo from the corner air ball here comes bornancin on the fast break four on three fast break bornancin and the pass to bravo is bobbled with a traveling violation and that time bornancin made the wrong decision he was free for that uh lay-up but he opted to pass to bravo  a lot of maroon shirts here and bravo just bobbled the ball off the pass once more still four two ronquillo breaks it up now it 's yap out to tubid tubid in a motion for three nice pass to almenario who drew the foul and the fake good ball movement that time by u e because it 's not it 's not necessary jude for you to shoot from three point down three when you 're facing a zone defense that time good inside pass by uh tubid to almenario so quick substitution for the maroons celo goes in the ball game to replace robin so coach gregorio i guess that that 's the same thing to say uh laughter  coach gregorio saves the tall line-up for the fighting maroons as almenario hits his first gentext free throw brought to you by gentext by globe handy phone the official privilege card of the u a a p games i think that u p can afford to put in a tall line-up like this because there 's a lot of big guys in this line-up like bornancin and santos even though they 're playing the forward positions they pretty much can be defense guards now u p brings it across they 're down by four six two is our score nunag pass to santos doesn't take the shot back to nunag now it 's santos double team on the corner santos cross court and open aby nunag for three the whistle off the ball almenario came sprawling to the ground so i guess there 's a foul off on the u p fighting maroons or is it on almenario so double block time for almenario  almenario   so we see a lot of action off the ball early on and both teams are putting an emphasis on their defense the first few minutes of this game nunag dribble drive spin move passes it to tubid foot race is on against bravo ronald tubid slams it home that 's the problem if you don't have a natural point guard nunag turning the ball over that brings jomalesa off the bench nunag out to bornancin bornancin surveys the situation out to nunag once again this is santos from seventeen feet out santos fakes great defense by estrada santos forces it up draws the foul noise  here 's that high endurance slam by ronald tubid brought to you by high endurance old spice and a sure shot slam dunk from ronald tubid maybe ronald tubid can also join the u a a p track and field uh meets for high jump for high jump  santos misses the first free throw free throws brought to you by gentext globe handy phone the official privilege card of the u a a p games words takes the second eight three our score ronquillo brings it up for u e out to yap this is tubid now back to yap still a zone defense by u p this is estrada back to ronquillo open for three  and they still have not solved that zone defense  a nice save by almenario to tubid and they got a fresh twenty-four second shot clock  ronquillo out to tubid tubid tries a stab at three still not there the long rebound back to the warriors out to yap he tries the three and he misses the three so the shooting percentage of u e very low here they pass to bornancin and a cut there 's the two free throws during that last possession u e missing three three pointers from three different men and ronquillo who is normally a good outside shooter missing two three pointers there 's that pass to bornancin and those were good three point shots for the warriors actually i mean if you 're a coach coach boysie zamar in fact they cannot fault those shots that time i 'm sure coach boysie zamar telling tubid and james yap if you get shots like that again you should take it robson bornancin gets the two rebounds out of brent high school second one in and out there is a lane violation against almenario  robson bornancin only averaging five points per game he 'll have to put that up to around double digits for u p to be a threat that 's not even half of his average last year jude bornancin averaging close to twelve points a game last year almenario back to tubid eight five is our score three point lead for the warriors yap out to ronquillo back to tubid now it 's yap once again five on the shot clock spin move double team out to nobody and that 's a turn-over well u e hasn't scored in the last few minutes  eight five is our score three-point lead for the warriors  we got a time-out music   words ateneo gym  the u p fighting maroons down by three and every now and then alumni former players of the teams come and watch here in the u a a p and that 's a former u e player  name who now plays for the batangas blades in the m b a he played for u e by the way for people who uh laughter who weren't sure he never mentioned his alma mater  call on another foul off the ball here against ronald tubid that 's number two on tubid so two quick fouls on uh ronald tubid correction that 's on estrada rather so that 's number two on estrada and he 'll be replaced and will sit on the bench let 's go over to china jocson for gentext update ten-second report from china  thanks china the important thing with that start with this start of u e jude is their defensive start  u p only five points in over in almost six minutes of this game well we covered one game where the u p fighting maroons only scored two points against the blue corner against the blue eagles against ateneo yes indeed here 's tubid open again from the corner and u e is just shooting blanks here that 's probably the fourth uh air ball 1 word for u e in this game let alone the other non air ball misses ronquillo out to tubid dribble drive inside out to almenario from fifteen feet back to omiping and he won't even get an opportunity to have that three-pointer down as a three-second violation is called that time almenario was wide open fifteen footer he should he should have taken that shot cervantes now in the ball game replacing santos jomalesa brings it up against ronquillo he wants celo inside ready to double team still gets in there against almenario now it 's bravo back to celo celo takes his post move 1 word not there nice follow by cervantes so that 's that is where u p is dominant against uh u e in the previous game rebounding ronquillo from the corner gets into a clearing omiping inside to almenario back to omiping bobbles the ball all the way in a corner to tubid back to ronquillo another open three pointer another miss the ball is with bornancin three on two fast break pass to bravo this time he doesn't bobble and dunks it in this time bornancin makes the right decision in that three on two fast break  he drops it off to the open bravo u p has taken the lead nine eight  tubid with the ball on the corner he 's gonna try another one no he 's not omiping out to tubid tubid a long two pointer he was bumped no call  u e with the ball now it 's jomalesa ahead to bornancin bornancin out to jomalesa that 's the time for the shot clock u p up by one bornancin against omiping makes his move dribble drive back to jomalesa five on the shot clock jomalesa loses control and we 've got a jump ball so far jude u p winning this gamble playing their zone defense and daring the u e players to shoot from the outside so twenty-seven left in the first quarter u p has taken the lead  we got a time out music smart zed assist from robson bornancin right to mike bravo the power to live the life you choose smart zed your cell phone now  cough you know jude i was impressed with this uh smart zed thing because uh yesterday when i was in uh pampanga they were sending me up to the minute updates about that uh of the ateneo n u game yes indeed so if you 've got a smart phone i think uh the steps u a a p space news to two one one or two eight eight i think it 's two one one laughter  i get confused now or p k g u a a p at the same number and you 'll get uh timely updates and i think this game is also being updated two twenty-five left  u p in the lead in the ball madarang already in the ball game for the maroons remember he exploded for twenty-four points last time out celo and he commits an offensive foul both teams in the penalty now here 's rodel celo lowering his shoulder u e wants to get the lead back  booker with the ball out to omiping and a foul will be called on jomalesa good jude good substitution here by coach boysie zamar now he has three new players to shoot from the outside in booker omiping and paul artadi the way they 've been shooting so far they definitely need a lot of help from the perimeter we mentioned this before this is the kind of team that really lives and dies by how they shoot from the perimeter as omiping hits his first gentext free throw olivar omiping gets the second jomalesa pushes it up gets past artadi bornancin out to mas madarang inside to celo once again cross court to jomalesa left-handed dribble drive to booker booker stole it away two on one fast break booker nice bounce pass to artadi for two points that 's the perfect way to win a two in one fast break jomalesa a little bit wild here gets to celo double team out on the corner madarang and he picks up his pivot foot making his move so u e jude scoring a lot of points here in the early going because of their defense so even though they 're struggling from the field they 're still up by three points booker surveys the situation passes to omiping omiping to artadi artadi dribble drive out to omiping to booker booker drives inside to almenario from the baseline took it four points for almenario full court pressure once again for the warriors madarang back to jomalesa five-point lead now for u e less than a minute left in the first quarter and jomalesa ill-advised three pointer there u e now a chance to extend a five-point lead  artadi to omiping back to artadi from the corner open for three another air ball for the warriors  ahead to jomalesa it 's a foot race again booker jomalesa that double bounce is missed here comes u e with only thirty seconds left in the first quarter artadi the pass to booker booker for three still misses the shot bornancin with the board u e way off with their three-point attempts ahead to cervantes ther 's about a two second differential between the shot clock and the game clock  jomalesa against artadi wants celo inside gets him inside celo cross court and there 's a foul on masbang off the ball so we 'll have two free throws for madarang you know jude u p trying to go to rodel celo in the low post but celo as we take a look at this fast break first by u e smart zed assist from booker the power to live the life you choose smart zed your cell phone now and jude i was mentioning celo does not have the footwork or the moves to attract that double teaming in the post so u e 's been doing a pretty good job at defending against celo madarang gets the first gentext free throw brought to you by gentext by globe handy phone the official privilege card of the u a a p games noise   second one on the way and he misses it we got eight seconds to get a shot up  here 's booker dribble drive against celo that double bounce it 's still a miss but did he draw a foul yes he did so he 's gonna have two free throws the foul will be on uh celo that 's number two here 's that challenge by booker going inside booker coming off the bench sure adding a lot of spark a lot of hustle for the u e warriors we got a substitution almenario will sit on the bench replacing him will be butel  arnold booker one of the spark plugs for the u e red warriors misses the first free throw  just four point four seconds left here in the first quarter fourteen ten is our score u e up by four a big challenge to it u p 's got four seconds here bornancin with the ball you can see the time remaining madarang a long three pointer and it 's off right so after ten minutes of play a five-point lead for the red warriors fifteen ten is our score we 'll be back with a second after these messages every now and then the alumni or certain alumnus of your school this time it 's from u p and jude with the uh u p uh scoring only ten points maybe they need paulo mendoza to suit up for this for this game laughter  this guy i know can laughter score thirty points uh he used to score thirty points in the u a a p
Philippines	 music starting line ups of both squads being announced right now  i think ateneo blue eagles right there coach joe lipa likes to start the game with uh edward quimpo for as a point guard for uh for ateneo well he holds the key l a uh l a tenorio comes in but you know we 're looking at abadia but it 's tagupa who 'll be covering uh quimpo as a point guard  and first possession goes to blue eagles so first possession for ateneo it 's now the starting line up you see the graphic membrere throws it away to tagupa tagupa pushing it up against quimpo tagupa nice cross over the hoop hooks it up backs it out mangulabnan with the follow up tagupa making uh well well over quimpo but offensive board it 's two points for the falcons quimpo against tagupa ateneo second offensive set they built it over last time here 's sison inside to villanueva no double team sison open for three that 's long rebound to yong adamson up and running once again yong rolls it down to tagupa two to nothing is our score quimpo and against villanueva inside into the lay-up followed by villanueva villanueva brings it up to membrere who loses control here comes tagupa one on three fast break and tagupa says i need some teammates that 's a a good decision jude he doesn't have the numbers backed out he waited for the head of the falcons let 's go over to aileen soriaga aileen soriaga for gentext update yes thank you very much guys in spite of their three consecutive losses the adamson falcons are still very much eager and optimistic that they will be able to win this ballgame over the ateneo blue eagles but the boys they know that they are off for a big fight and they have to work hard and they have and they need to have dedication to win this ballgame more than just a game plan coach luigi trillo also reminded his boys that they they need to put more heart into their game and more and the heat and the heat itself will start carrying above their need even the players themselves were not that satisfied with their last year performances especially during words  but this time around they 're hoping that they will be able to win guys back to you thanks aileen  so confidence is one of the problems for adamson so far rolan nice rebound but there 's a whistle could be a foul could be on membrere trying to go or could it be on uh villanueva who word   here 's enrico villanueva will hold that ball well villanueva picks up his first foul let 's take a look at this smart zed steal by tagupa smart zed the power to live the life you choose smart zed your cell phone now and adamson rolan gets his two points from the field let 's go over to the ateneo side this time with patty laurel for gentext update yes uh earlier on i spoke to coach lipa and i asked him what does he have to fear from adamson and he told me you know that overconfidence can kill sometimes that 's why he always tells his boys to treat each game as if it were a big team adamson is very hungry for a win we should not allow them to win just at our expense with more reason we should watch out for that so today 's definitely gonna be a good fight between ateneo and adamson back to you jude and randy thanks patty and uh overconfidence is definitely something that uh the better teams have uh to watch out for here these gentext free throws by villanueva brought to you by gentext by globe handy phone the official privilege card of the u a a p games  words continue for enrico villanueva for his first free throw actually the pressure is not on adamson but so much on ateneo i feel jude that this situation is very clear to adamson i think all year long they 've not picked up a win so it 's not really very difficult for them ateneo really feels the pressure right now words as the quarter passes but you know they should treat this game like any other ball game they have to win it on the court play your basketball even against the adamson falcons at the bottom of the standings tagupa against quimpo tagupa all the way inside misses the lay-up villanueva gives it to sison here comes ateneo  1 word to the side with the three-pointer membrere out to quimpo across to sison inside villanueva villanueva makes his move the half move from the baseline is good this is definitely gonna be a very difficult match-up for rolan because he doesn't really have that jumping ability to cover rico villanueva the most that he could do is try to push him outside of the shaded area the lead is down to one abadia the fake the shot good good shot he shoots over membrere the person words in offense but not a good sign for the blue eagles abadia scored twenty-four in that first game and as you mentioned probably the next two sison drops a three-pointer but it 's not gonna go and there 's a foul it will go against the falcons  michael yong picking up his first foul and the second team foul against adamson michael yong one of the very few holdovers from last year luigi has eleven rookies in his line-up cross court to villanueva this is the match-up they want to exploit villanueva against rolan villanueva and a turn-around jumper he probably got fouled rolan words to that level he needs to double team early for rico to give up that ball and not make rico just to make his curl over rolan who looks like a rotonda to me against rico villanueva well he touched the arm of villanueva and the referee didn't uh he just let that go and you know villanueva we 're gonna be watching his free throws he was one of the players strongest from the free throw line during that game against f e u that 's mark abadia or rather tagupa he has an advantage over requito i think that 's a mismatch going out of the way the rest would have to be really ateneo advantage in this game let 's take a look at the numbers of rico  again he splits his free throws one for two for enrico villanueva  tagupa against quimpo a left-handed drive inside to abadia nice move by abadia great pass and great recognition from tagupa that 's really the one two punch for adamson  they really recognize each other 's threats oh laughter it 's quimpo saying payback time as he goes by tagupa draws the foul  they have another opportunity for a three-point play here 's that nice play to abadia high endurance sure shot brought to you by the high endurance old spice mark abadia   for ateneo you have to be word for quimpo i think the minute has given him the confidence with two points a rebound and he 's still active in the ballgame he welcome he tenorio starts for the game and i think they have forgotten about baguio for long time now for ateneo  well danny wasn't able to play against f e u because he had a prior family commitment his sister got married here 's a steal by ateneo here 's sison sison throws to villanueva but nice anticipation by mangulabnan gives it to tagupa adamson down by one with the ball abadia against membrere abadia makes his move out to tagupa fifteen on the shot clock tagupa gets a screen from rolan tagupa words to quimpo tagupa from the baseline hammers it in  that 's what they 're doing right now  they see the mismatch and they go for the words with tagupa scoring ateneo takes a quick thirty-second time-out with ateneo down by three seven to four is our score commercial break  here in the u a a p the thirty-second time-out in the first half is allowed and not only the coach can call it but the players the players as well rico obviously very unhappy with the way tagupa 's burning word and no help coming his way here 's our smart zed steal by mangulabnan the power to live the life you choose smart zed your cell phone now  rico is calling the shots for the falcons randy we would like to remind everyone to watch the new u a a p games right here on studio twenty-three and the t f c the filipino channel abroad and log on to u a a p dot pinoy central dot com for some statistics  that 's the official u a a p website  alvarez inside to villanueva villanueva again against rolan this time he misses the shot abadia with the rebound  abadia walks it up for adamson they 're up by three tagupa throw it away nope bounced back by rolan  one time the on rolan against villanueva that 's uh that 's a tough match-up randy well i really don't know if it 's really that wise to give uh rolan that opportunity to go against villanueva  probably the idea is to just get rico into early foul troubles and then you know that can take a breather by taking the defense right in the face from rico alvarez he 'll be called for the offensive foul and alvarez is not involved in the offense of ateneo i mean the first foul on alvarez  it 's the first time for him to get that leather and that pass to mangulabnan alvarez last year 's most valuable player in the league  from 1 word high school in japan  abadia makes his move against membrere nice sison to rolan but rolan traveled rolan hesitated giving the ball back to the blue eagles well this time coach joe lipa is taking a thirty-second time-out he takes the full time-out we 'll be back break in the recording  you 're watching u a a p games live on studio twenty-three  back for more in season sixty-four ten seven our score the adamson falcons in a bit of a surprise are up by three against the ateneo blue eagles less than five minutes left here in the first quarter  membrere with the ball out to quimpo in the corner quimpo makes a play left-handed drive out to sison  sison gets a screen from alvarez now it 's membrere membrere trying to find a hole inside blocked the way by yong  well six seconds to shoot for the blue eagles  first name membrere he was the m v p in high school of the n c a a playing for san beda  alvarez with a double 2 words   a completed bounce play for rich alvarez  he got himself in the field area in a jumper  just a one-point lead now for the falcons  tagupa 1 word to quimpo  in the corner this is yong looking for the 1 word shoots the 1 word doesn't make it  ateneo a chance to take the lead  quimpo with the ball hesitation move out to alvarez he made one from a little closer earlier  here 's sison sison back to sison now it 's villanueva against rolan double team fast court to sison on the corner it 's quimpo for three
Philippines	it 's saturday afternoon a gorgeous afternoon for basketball welcome to the u double a p second game today between two bitter rivals de la salle university green archers and the university of santo tomas growling tigers that 's your second game today and of course today cyrus baguio comes back against la salle the last time cyrus met the green archers was way back in nineteen ninety-nine and of course we all know that he missed all of last year since nineteen ninety-nine the tigers didn't win over the green archers cyrus baguio and the growling tigers will meet the green archers this afternoon live from the rizal memorial coliseum i 'm mico halili with of course mr randy sacdalan to bring you today 's big game well good afternoon to you mico and uh you know la salle and u s t whenever they play it is always a rivalry partner and tonight today we 're gonna see that rivalry again here at the rizal it 's overflowing here at the rizal memorial and boy it 's so difficult to get a parking it 's so difficult to get inside the rizal memorial what is not difficult is to find out if these two teams are considered the top teams going into this tournament as we look at the team standings of course la salle with an immaculate three zero slate tied up with arch rival ateneo and then u s t not far behind with two wins and just one loss oh yeah u s t wants to tie up uh la salle at three and one after this ballgame and wants just to keep ateneo on top with a three and zero rating but the way u s t is playing you know it 's very difficult really to take u s t this is a different u s t team mico that we 're watching this year compared to last year certainly they have an inside track to get to the top they almost did it against ateneo uh but against la salle i think they will try again and see and continue and break away the pattern of a win then they lose and then they win and hopefully today they 'll try to avert a loss against la salle so they 're tigers are trying to go for a winning streak there but that will be hard against this balanced la salle offensive attack now many people felt that going into this year la salle would be a mike cortez team but that 's not the case you have to guard people like mac-mac cardona joseph yeo and adonis santa maria if you wish to stop the green archers but partner easily the fifty-five points for uh de la salle cardona yeo santa maria and cortez it 's so easy for them to score but you know that this plan of attack just makes it difficult really for the comp  uh other opponents to play against a team that is so explosive inside out in well for santa maria and yeo this is really a surprise to cardona he 's leading the pack for de la salle of course so that 's la salle 's balanced attack now for the growling tigers what uh their fans are very happy about is the return of the dunking duo as you look at the cool cat mike cortez there 's joseph yeo uh green archers really leaning on the scoring production of uh these uh players oh yes and uh you know if it 's not for the shot of yeo a lot of people say la salle could 've been over in that game against n u but in the case of the u s t growling tigers if you go by numbers mico they have five as compared to the four of la salle i think u s t at this end would have the advantage but look espiritu one of reasons for espiritu and for baguio i 've never seen him with the fire in the eyes of cyrus baguio gelig hubalde and loanzon would just complement how u s t is so potent this year and so far that potential has turned out to be a reality for coach aric del rosario so keep in mind uh everyone uh u s t the last seven meetings they 've had against the green archers they haven't won so total combination for the green archers uh since nineteen ninety-nine and the dunking duo alwin espiritu of the growling tigers they are eager to get back at the green archers this year we 'll bring you la salle versus u s t after this very short break  commercial break  uh u s t growling tigers coming into this game with two wins and one loss they defeated adamson on the op uh on the opening weekend then lost to ateneo and then blasted u p just days ago and of course the u s t fans coming into this game full force because they know this they have a very very good chance of finally beating la salle after seven straight losses as we look at the starting line-ups well they 're trying to break the spell this afternoon mico and for ev for any las la salle u s t game it 's an event both in along taft avenue and along espa&ntilde;a and they brought the challenge here along vito cruz you know this is the probably the best probably for for u s t to hack out a win over la salle la salle after uh three games has been exposed in that game against n u and for u s t they know they have a chance against la salle today green archers coming into this game with a perfect three wins and zero loss record nico vainio can't pick up the loose ball and it 's with iago raterta so here 's the u s t starting line-up gelig manansala raterta espiritu and baguio a goal quickly to the big man against manny ramos who and is tapped almost stolen by vainio loose ball picked up by gelig five on the shot clock gelig fires and it 's no good rebound goes to cortez it 's cortez cardona santa maria vainio ramos standard issue starting five for coach franz pumaren manny ramos top of the key looking at santa maria there 's a long pass and he cannot be stopped for that easy two the two big men passing around u s t employing the zone santa maria getting that uh ball and the two points for la salle noisy background and so to another part of the ball game  well so far this season cortez is fifty percent from the line he was last year 's uh recipient of the sportsmanship award misses two free throws but the offensive rebound goes to the archers  now here 's cardona zigzagging through but gets lost that is a match-up to watch mico cyrus baguio blocking mac-mac cardona this early they 're paying attention to the leading scorer of de la salle check out this rexona solid defense play brought to you by the twenty-four hour rexona your best defense against odor and wetness rexona it won't let you down there are two players down on the floor and it 's an offensive foul against nico vainio well he saw the opening go to the basket but the defense was steady against him first foul on nico vainio ten all is the count we can really feel the sixteen drums of u s t behind us mico  laughs well you know you talk about la salle and u s t you 're basically talking about the two most dominant teams in the last ten years in the last ten seasons u s t had four championships la salle four championships and then f e u with the two championships in ninety-seven and ninety-two and you know what u s t doesn't want to happen is for la salle to break that four-peat for the four straight championships for u s t la salle is attempting its fifth straight and that would eclipse the record of u s t of course u e with a win earlier of course they 're smiling saying well try to beat our seven-peat back in the seventies b laughs okay let 's take this time-out the ballgame is tied at ten all between the archers and the tigers we have a time-out we 'll be back after this short break noisy background and so to another part of the ball game  wait a minute who 's in and who 's out so raterte sits down not baguio baguio thought he 's the one who 's who 's gonna be seated but he 's maintained on the floor for u s t with a score at twenty-one sixteen five-point lead for u s t and tang loses the ball against edsel del rosario it 's always a challenge for la salle when mike cortez sits down t y tang comes in he needs to be warmed-up to take control of that leather de guzman was part of the all-rookie team last year here 's gelig from the right side they go to espiritu at the post the pull-up is no good sharma with the rebound archers down by five and the xavier boys are in the back court tang and yeo  tang on the right side over to sharma from seven feet  words with that important shot from sharma for de la salle sharma now with four points in the game a three-point lead for the tigers time is running out in the first quarter gelig shaking and baking and pulling ten points in the first quarter for ni&ntilde;o gelig so it 's as if he has already hit his total for the game and ni&ntilde;o still has so much to give for u s t tang to sharma on the right side again to gelig sharma goes to yeo nine on the shot clock yeo couldn't pass air ball goes to cabatu the rebound but he lost the ball picked up by words there 's the rebound  cheering drumming noises  tigers up by five gelig he slightly overshoots two seconds to go tang needs to hurry up and he needs to launch it buzzer  but he wasn't aware of the time so that 's how we 'll end the first quarter of the play the growling tigers are certainly roaring ni&ntilde;o gelig with ten big points to lead the tigers and give them a five-point lead twenty-three eighteen we 'll be back with the second quarter in just a while  commercial break  the former green archer dindo pumaren of the pumaren clan is here supporting uh their brother franz pumaren who is coaching the green archers hopefully to a fifth straight round the perennial tip-in that 's settled yes partner joseph yeo has has the intentions but of course he had the advantage over caba alvin espino partner ni&ntilde;o gelig was really a soaring tiger for u s t he 's had ten points and he 's given the uh the energy to give them the five-point lead over the archers after one quarter so welcome to the second quarter friends between u s t and de la salle as de guzman misses that time espiritu with the rebound the power hook that won't go in but look at the tigers go for the board vizcarra is fouled and sharma says enough is enough 3 words by espiritu  laughs oh my gosh what a game inside again u s t having trouble the same trouble they had with ateneo look at the block here posted by carlo sharma vizcarra would somehow get that rebound and then sharma would just wait in and

revilla and then also n u the favorite whipping boys but don't bet your money uh your life on it this time uh jim  here 's the game or two to win words this year  i know  as they did last year they

like that the students the fans they all come out and support the teams you know there 's nothing like uh college ball okay noise the universities and all all schools right now are very competitive and that 's the reason why i think we have a very good turn-out jim and we can barely see that the uh alumni of la salle have uh come in great numbers with uh eighty seventy-seven we keep score  they have the glory years and of course well we 'll be talking more about uh a little controversy that occurred last year but as we talked to the concerned parties a little earlier it 's past them now it

because they played in the league you you covered some of those games opening ceremony  we 're here now with uh the mayor of quezon city of course newly-elected mayor mel mathay congratulations uh mayor thank you joaqui and uh jimmy jimmy yes now that you 're the new mayor uh the new mayor of quezon city what uh programs do you have to develop sports in uh quezon city mayor well uh definitely it was one of the highest priority in uh the city 's program in fact uh when i uh address the city council for the state of the city it would be one of the programs that will be part of the address we 're trying to uh consolidate and recover uh the uh amoranto stadium precisely so we could utilize this in a more uh vigorous and aggressive sports program you know in the public schools alone in quezon city elementary and high school we have a population of quarter of a million two hundred fifty million should be thousand student population  wow  and considering that uh one of our uh principal uh concern is the drug problem you know sports will have to play our key role in uh addressing this problem of uh drug addiction  key role yeah i share that view really that drug addiction problem i mean through sports i think i think you 'll be able to do that that 's the reason why uh the theme of the u a a p this year i think is very appropriate meaning uh character exerted the character promotes sport and help the nation and of course help the host city quezon city hey we 'll be playing a lot of almost all our games in quezon city loyola center and uh araneta i think a few games some other place but most of the games will be held in quezon city yes that 's what i was told uh by the president of u a a p and i assured him that i have given orders to the central police district that uh to guarantee and ensure that these two venues would be uh safe not only for the those who would be attending the games but uh to see to it that uh there will be no carnapping  laughter okay that 's really nice to hear from the mayor hey that 's really very nice now tell me is there a favorite team you 're rooting for or no well not really i uh come of course from the uh state university i know but uh you know uh this is one area where we would really like uh all the teams to do their best after all uh it has been a truism that it is not in winning but it 's how you play the game how you play the game very true and besides the mayor couldn't say for u p because there 's an atenean there and a la sallite here so laughter  so mayor is there any parting words you 'd like to uh jimmy would you like to ask uh anything well uh it 's a little political but i 'm sure it was a very gratifying win for uh former congressman now mayor-elect of quezon city uh mel mathay and uh i 'm sure uh there will be a wealth of experience from the metro manila authority and uh his stint as congressman as he goes into his new position of mayor of quezon city thank you uh jimmy you know it has been a twenty-five year quest having been elected vice-mayor of the city twenty-five years ago having served metro manila as vice-governor and also elected to the batasang pambansa and uh before elected to the mayorship as uh member of the uh congress of the republic so i think uh hopefully with everybody supporting us we will be able to approximate and reach the vision of uh the late president quezon of what quezon city ought to be and on that hopeful note we thank uh mayor mel mathay for gracing the occasion and i 'm sure you 'll be here with us in the coming games to watch the rest of the of the u double a p season  of course  congratulations we 'll see we 'll see you around thank you okay let 's go over to the studios now jim we 've got some very important reminders break

number two of the semi-finals  the world record holder in this event is ian thorpe with the time of uh one minute eighteen point eighteen seconds that 's a very fast time i think and uh he holds also the olympic record set this morning with the time of one minute nineteen point eighty-two seconds here at the aquatic center  and the entries for semi-final heat one stephan paul on lane one onison on

uh for australia yesterday anchoring the four by one-hundred meter relay and beating the united states in this particular event so two golds one individual and one team for ian thorpe  remember this is four lengths of the pool the world record is one minute forty-five point fifty-one seconds there should be a correction of what we have seen earlier here a split and we see that the swimmer on lane four lane four is hoogenband of the netherlands together with josh davis and it 's the netherlands' hoogenband with twenty-four point fifty-one at the first fifty-meter mark  and uh we see that josh davis of the united states is trailing in third place james salter of great britain as we hit the first one hundred first two lengths of this pool and uh it 's hoogenband of uh the netherlands with the time of fifty-one point twelve seconds josh davis fifty-one fifty-four james salter of great britain in third place van den hoogenband starting to spread the field while josh davis is just trailing just half a body length as we hit the one-hundred fifty meter mark of the two-hundred meter freestyle the world record just a correction for what we mentioned earlier is one minute forty-five point fifty-one uh what we mentioned earlier was the first hundred uh uh fifty and we are approaching the homestretch of this race and hoogenband of the netherlands no doubt is going to win this very easily over josh davis of the united states and the battle for third is either on lane number three and lane number five but hoogenband of the netherlands winning with the time of one minute forty-five point thirty-five seconds and josh davis of the u s with the time of one minute forty-seven point o six seconds very slow record and that is a world record i think that 's a world record for you yes a world record by hoogenband breaking the record of uh ian thorpe with a with a swim of one minute forty-five point thirty-five and breaking the record the world record and the olympic record set by ian thorpe this morning so pieter van de hoogenband winning the first heat of the semi-finals with a time of one minute forty-five point thirty-five there 's the dive and josh davis of

Philippines	 missing words p c a open tennis championship this is mia fernandez with mr ron de los reyes ron yes uh very pleasant day uh sports fans we 're coming to you from the center court of the philippine columbian association here in plaza dilao in uh paco manila and uh we 're going to bring you the finals in both the men 's and women 's events of the tenth or the nineteen ninety-one edition of the p c a open the most prestigious uh tournament in the country  mia ron this is going to be a very exciting match because these women 's finals are going to be uh very very uh memorable because this is between the two top players of the country number one is jennifer sared who is a veteran asian campaigner and always a team member of the asian team while the other side is joanna feria the number two she is the lone filipina to reach past the second round of the wimbledon juniors that 's right and of course both players are fresh from their trip to wimbledon where uh as you mentioned joanna feria uh won in her first assignment but uh lost in the second of course uh jennifer sared is also a veteran internationalist having won some of the uh junior titles in southeast asia and of course uh later on after this uh match we are going to bring you the men 's championship between jun allerre and of course robert uh bobby angelo two new faces in the p c a uh finals list jun allerre has been the national coach of the men 's and the women 's junior team since nineteen ninety so it 's going to be exciting because bobby angelo just came from the states where he learned new strokes and now he is more powerful by the way the tenth p c a open tennis championship is being brought to you by san miguel beer super dry milo stronghold insurance company grant sportswear only store easy call copacabana hotel the a g q construction integrated sales and of course nike let 's go to the men 's doubles the men 's doubles will pit danilo pila and camoy palaha against jun allerre and bobby angelo are semi-fi our finalists for the men 's finals so that 's going to be pretty exciting that comes after the men 's finals between bobby angelo and jhun allerre uh well what do you think uh of this uh match mia jennifer sared has more experience more exposure in the local and international scene but joanna feria has been moving very well her forehand has been consistent and so is her backhand so you really can't tell although jennifer sared has the upper hand that 's right uh before going into the finals of course jennifer sared adventured to beat francesca la'o in the philippine international junior tennis championships uh held last april where she lost to uh uh francesca la'o in uh in the finals joanna fer feria made it to the finals by beating bao kim in the semi-finals in the exciting three setter she really showed her persistence and patience in that match ron that 's right  well not everybody knows that uh the girl on the other side joanna feria also competed in track and field before really concentrating in uh the game of tennis as i was talking earlier to her father uh nonoy feria and he said that uh well joanna was part of the track and field team that went to beijing in the nineteen ninety asian games that 's right too bad she had to quit because she she had leg injury already but then she chose tennis because she feels that she is going to do more in tennis than in track and field it 's already love fifteen in favor of joanna feria with jennifer sared serving  our drives by uh jennifer sared you know ron that looked like an unforced error but if you just could see the power in the forehand of jennifer sared then the spin just was too much for joanna feria then that 's right uh fifteen all is the count this is the first game of the first set  another error by joanna feria both players are still playing near the baseline maybe trying to feel each other out right  it 's thirty fifteen in favor of jennifer sared  there 's a fault  second big rally here  first time on the net it 's out that 's too bad joanna feria had the chance to make a beautiful approach out and go for the winner but then she just sort of blundered it 's forty fifteen in favor of jennifer sared  nice short clapping   this special is brought to you by san miguel super dry beer in cooperation with milo nescafe and coffeemate  joanna feria served with feria leading with feria down love one in the first set  okay  another unforced error in the backhand by joanna feria you know in the national level you can't afford to make too many of those  a double fault by joanna feria  maybe she still has opening set jitters but she 'll go come over it she has to so looking at the score board it said joanna feria is leading i think our umpire there yes uh it 's supposed to be thirty fifteen in favor of jennifer  the score is fifteen thirty with joanna feria serving  beautiful rally here  thirty all joanna feria has come back from down love thirty to thirty all with her long baseline rallies i think she 's playing with uh more confidence now uh compared to the first game of the set that 's right  jennifer wasn't able to make the ball go over the net as her racket was just too high it 's now forty thirty and joanna feria will now go for the game point and the chance here for joanna to even the score at one all in the first set  oh bad choice of shot there by joanna feria she was at the baseline and she opted for a drop shot missed opportunity by joanna to level the count at one all  joanna feria dictating the point here  powerful backhand by jennifer sared forced uh joanna feria to commit that uh error let 's take a look at the slow-mo brought to you by milo the olympic energy drink there 's a a powerful backhand a 1 word shot by

backhand to backhand rally  and the second game going to jennifer sared two love in the first set  i think the turning point there was the double fault by joanna feria it gave jennifer sared the upper hand and the confidence to go more for the second serve let 's look at the slow-mo of that brought to us by milo the olympic energy drink she had at least uh two or three times or three chances to make the second game but lost it that 's right  just a little out by the backhand of jennifer sared seems like this match is going to be punctuated by long rallies ron that 's right and uh well both players are opting to go for the baseline and so we can expect that kind of play in this championship and so far i think that was the first time jennifer went uh to the net let 's take a look at the slow-mo brought to you by milo there 's the short and the beautiful cross court by jennifer sared fifteen love uh fifteen all 3 words  first serve by jennifer sared  backhand to backhand rally again jennifer is forcing uh that error by that backhand error by joanna feria joanna feria 's doing the right thing she 's making jennifer sared move because jennifer can't stay at the baseline all day it just gives the balls to her thirty fifteen  just a little out by jennifer sared it 's thirty all  forty thirty with jennifer sared leading the first serves 've been coming in lately that 's one of the advantages of being a little bit taller  beautiful rally by both players backhand to backhand again  jennifer sared dictating the point now moving joanna feria  beautiful backhand to jennifer by joanna feria she capitalized on that short ball by jennifer sared there it is brought to you by milo there is that beautiful cross court which caused jennifer sared an error it 's now deuce  by the

Philippines	tons of brick have been taken off his chest they 'll be replaced by a medal of gold and the philippines has broken its drought in tennis via the men 's singles finals wherein barrientos disposed of a tough and hard-fighting rookie in the men 's circuit name of indonesia six three seven six  there once again barrientos falling down three five in the second set climbing back up six five and name forcing a tie break in that second set a long drawn-out affair but nonetheless felix barrientos prevailed and now we take you to green valley country club were butch maniego and lyn sembrano will bring you the ladies masters semi-finals in our first uh full day of coverage of bowling music commercial break   missing words country club lanes in pasig site of the bowling competition of the sixteenth sea games this is the sixth and final day of bowling competition ten bowls have already been handed out and my name is butch maniego  working with me this afternoon is a bowler a national team bowler who only began playing two years ago but she 's gone a long way since then this is lyn sembrano good morning lyn yeah good morning butch and uh lyn was a member of the national team for this main competitions but uh she was not able to compete i believe here in this tournament but uh she 's here to provide her expert analysis and opinion of what 's transpiring here in the women 's masters this is the fifteenth and final game  2 words will be bringing you flat to step ladder finals later on right now lyn how is the country doing as far as uh medals are concerned here in the bowling competition yeah uh regarding the medal standing so far uh we have won uh the for the silver medal on the doubles event  yes  yes and uh a silver for the silver for the men 's we also have won in the grand in the all events for the men we have captured all the medals the gold the silver and the bronze and right now we 're hopeful that we can get at least a gold medal here because we have arianne cerde&ntilde;a and liza fernandez in the top three positions and for the men as far as the men 's are concerned we have the one two three four of which we can hopefully get into the step ladder later this afternoon yes thank you very much lyn so far here in uh women 's masters where the top sixteen players in the all-events qualified as uh lyn mentioned liza fernandez occupying the number one spot after fourteen after fourteen games this is the fifteenth and final game they played a round robin type of a match play in which uh the bowlers go head-to-head and the winners will get an additional ten pin if they uh beat their opponent in their head-to-head match-up but still what counts is the total number of pins garnered by the players after fifteen games  right lyn   yes uh uh liza is leading way way ahead and the number two is so far grace young of singapore and uh close behind down by just forty-one pins is arianne cerde&ntilde;a our olympic gold medalist so arianne always has a final kick and we hope that she gets into that number two slot anyway uh what whoever is the number two or three gets a crack beating liza fernandez who 's our top qualifier bowling the last game yes lyn can you just explain to our audience right now how the step ladder format works for this uh women 's masters competition of the sixteenth sea games yeah based on total pin points butch we get the one two and three the number rank number three and two battles for for one game only one game match and the winner of that goes to compete with the top qualifier who gain who has gained the top seed fifteen balls and with it is a knock-out game it 's the total pin point who gain you have to beat your opponent twice right  to win the number two   so that  yes so so from what i understand the top qualifier only has to beat the challenger whoever she is only once to win the gold medal here in the women 's masters event so far the philippine team uh has prepared good mental preparation for this type of a game because we just had our mock sea game wherein all uhm good players from the local local from organizations competing against each other and so so far we have we landed on the one two and three we were placed under pressure really so uh we can see that the philippine bowling congress did everything they could to get uh all the players here in high gear we take a look at some of the previous winners so far already here in the women 's side of the bowling competition of the sixteenth sea games earlier you saw the ladies' triples which was won by indonesia and now the latest doubles won by malaysia with the philippine team coming in second and third yes and one thing for sure grace young is really came here to to do her best because she 's a defending champ masters champion of the last sea games yes i believe uh in the previous game game number fourteen we saw a titanic struggle over lanes twenty-three and twenty-four between liza fernandez and grace young yeah uhm actually grace young uh did a two hundred forty-six game and liza fernandez did a two hundred thirty-four so it was really a battle it was a battle of strikes not of spares yes arianne was so close behind with the two hundred forty-five game exactly break in the recording commercial break  open frame in the ninth uh uh word in the tenth uh going out on three straight strikes to h i n by one minute in the fourteenth game but now this is the fifteenth and final game and uh after this only the three top players will remain in the women 's masters finals  yes so right now we will now be going over to lanes number fifteen and sixteen to witness close hand a match taking place between liza fernandez and popy tambis who had won the gold medal in the women 's singles earlier last week yes actually right now lanes fifteen and sixteen on the first frame liza made a strike and on the second frame she had a one down but was able to convert it and now liza shot a double yes a double in bowling is two strikes two straight strikes and liza fernandez who as we mentioned is leading the field going into the fifteenth game you saw her deliver a strike and this is her opponent in the match play division that 's popy tambis uh while on another set of lanes grace young who is a contender for the top three position has only two spares and two splits and on another pair of lane wherein arianne is trying to make a run for it she has a strike and has split two spares yes we 're trying to get the scores as of game fourteen what we have here is a two uh game number thirteen which liza fernandez she 's she actually had the overnight lead uh lyn the way i understand it bong revilla was number two coming into the final seven games but something has happened to bong 's game and she 's right now at number four and i don't think she did so well in game fourteen yeah actually bong is having a tough time right now maybe perhaps because of the lane condition 'cause as of three frames she has already two open frames so it 's gonna be a little bit hard for her to get into the top three but in the meantime liza fernandez has really prepared well for this game she was a former flight stewardess and has really begged off from her work to prepare herself for the sea games so you can see the amount of dedication that has to go into the pursuit of excellence here in the sport of bowling lyn yes actually also arianne has a slight knee injury but you can't see from her any injury at all so she has mentally blocked off that injury actually we have uh the philippine team has a court psychologist really to help you on your mental training because bowling is not only plain skill it 's also more on mental game mental training and we also have undergone some uh we have enrolled on words sport uh we went underwent training at fit center philippines and we did some work-out i hope you 've seen liza fernandez getting her fourth strike in a row here in game number fifteen it looks like she 's really bent on entering the step ladder final in the number one slot lyn yes as far as arianne cerde&ntilde;a is concerned she just made the wash out wash out means uh leaving six for the head team and was able to convert it you can see her intensity right now because this is the last game this is go for it and go for broke and arianne has that skill and that intensity  uh earlier you saw in blue liza kwan one of the more popular popular players i believe here in the southeast asian games uh bowling competition  uh yes  yes actually liza kwan as of the world f i q held in singapore was a silver medalist actually it was a big uh game for her it was just on the last game that she made a five two hundred game to enter into the top three and she was uh the only asian to qualify on the top three positions and right now i think liza made another strike for making it a five dagger  yes that 's five straight strikes thrown by liza fernandez  you can see liza 's form right now she makes a five step delivery and really she hit a brooklyn shot but you know in bowling when it really scores what counts whether it 's on the left side of the head pin or you hit the right what is important is you get a strike because it 's the last game butch yes and liza fernandez working on a probable two hundred eighty game if she manages to strike all the way out  she needs five more strikes to accomplish the two eighty game as far as bong 's game right now it 's really tough for her because she just has one mark and has a split on the fourth frame and a possible spare but you know butch she needs more than that probably a punch out which means a strike all the way probably words little to qualify  liza right now made a heavy hit and she makes a baby split that is a convertible split if she converts the split it 's going to be a very good game for her i believe she left the number three and ten pin standing now yes butch actually she would just aim for pin six which is supposed to be in the middle of those two pins and liza can do it because of her mental preparation right now and intensity yes liza fernandez uh it 's a little bit worrying because the r p women 's team so far has failed to deliver a single gold medal lyn uh yeah it was sort of a probably a sort of a not the right timing but then we had we have the line-up for it butch yeah we have bong and uh arianne cerde&ntilde;a are very good uh combination for the doubles because bong is a very experienced bowler twenty-one years actually in bowling and has so many records and arianne cerde&ntilde;a is still young but she is an olympic medalist but you know breaks of the game that 's why they didn't make it for the doubles but they ran away with the silver and for the other contenders we just some had bad breaks of the game yeah bowling is a game in which uh you may be the best player in the world but if for one day there is somebody better then you don't win
Philippines	here in manila the games that started on november twenty-four is finally coming to a close and of course for the philippines from the worst of times to the best of times we have seen our athletes do us proud and we have seen that as a country united and one we can see that we can overcome all odds in order to host these southeast asian games a pleasant day this is freddie abando together with sandra dayco sandra the feeling here at the rizal memorial stadium is one of celebration there is joy there is jubilation and perhaps a game like this one is something that will never be matched in the history of the southeast asian games because this is one of the most fiercely fought the philippines coming close to striking the greatest upset in the history of the games yes good afternoon freddie and good afternoon philippines you were right freddie that if i should say so say so it 's outright elation for for most of the participants and especially for the filipino people the staging of the biggest ever biennial sportsfest here in manila is really quite successful that 's uh that 's an understatement in fact freddie well of course the crowd has been a very big factor in all the fronts in all the venues there was no doubt that filipino nationalism is on the rise philippine flags waving all over cheering our athletes giving their best and if there 's one clear line to sum up the performance of the filipino athletes in all the events it 's guts and glory and there 's no doubt that they have proven themselves to be the rising stars of sports in the asean region yes particularly impressive of course was the large turn-out like you 've pointed out in all the venues for most events even though the more exotic ones the demonstration events a beautiful turn-out from the filipino people they all just went out and supported their countrymen in the in their bid for the gold first of all the most important thing that you 'll remember in these southeast asian games is you know that the world is one big community and through the magic of satellites television not only here in the philippines nationwide but the whole of asean is watching us because they know this is an endeavor of countries nine countries who have come here for nine days for one thing sports excellence and friendship and we have really done it we have forged a closer unity among our asean brothers and there is no doubt that uh when our asean brothers will go back to their countries there will be so many stories to talk about what they have seen what they have experienced in manila and there is no doubt that we as filipinos have come of age and we have seen that as a people this country can move forward i think freddie the games in itself our hosting of the sixteenth edition of the southeast asian games is a demonstration of our resiliency our ability to rise up above all the difficulties we 've gone through the flashfloods in ormoc uh leyte and uh the the the earthquakes and all the nat natural calamities and al even the man-made disasters  definitely we have proven that we are one nation we are able to rise up and we are able to host something of this magnitude something that would foster greater brotherhood and sportsmanship among the peoples in the region you know in nineteen eighty-one they called that a renaissance of sports there has been a slide after nineteen eighty-seven when we performed with the performance of nine fifty-nine gold medals in the jakarta games when we only had twenty-six gold medals in the sea games in kuala lumpur but definitely ninety-one gold medals that will be difficult to match in the history of the games at this stage we would like to turn you over at the uh main stadium because her excellency president corazon aquino will be here is now here to declare the closing of the games  and there 's no doubt that her excellency there where the trade secretary the chairman of the organizing committee of the manila southeast asian games has been instrumental in pushing through these particular southeast asian games despite the string of calamities we 've had which started in july sixteen nineteen ninety and ended with the ormoc tragedy where more than seven thousand of our people died in that uh typhoon and of course this as eric buhain sums it up i wanted to give our people something to smile about my triumph is their triumph  and there 's no doubt that the president for being here this afternoon is here to celebrate a new joy a new dawn in the life of this country of course freddie maybe as a symbol of her elation over the tremendous performance of filipino athletes you can see the president is wearing the logo of the sea games on her beautiful yellow dress the traditional yellow dress which symbolized cory power is here and that power which started in eighty-six now very much alive here at the rizal stadium as we now have the national anthem of our country playing of the national anthem  there you have it the national anthem clapping   the crowd here it 's a very electrifying mood the country is in a state of euphoria sandra well definitely coming of course after that string of victories uh the past eleven days of the sea games we definitely feel very good very proud of ourselves freddie and uh like like uh what eric buhain a while ago said this i think should all the more inspire the country to to to move forward that if we 've set our minds to it we will be able to achieve anything we want to there 's no doubt about it the filipino spirit has triumphed the triumph of our athletes is the triumph of our nation there you can see the people near you people who have milled around here in the stadium some of them already starting to come from the south end of the stadium because uh it is only now that they are coming in and more are still out waiting for the start of the parade a beautiful cultural presentation later on here at the rizal memorial stadium noise  you know going back to those twelve days sandra when we started the opening ceremonies obviously the question is will we perform very well as a country for the hosting be successful and after twelve days we can definitely say that we did this country proud and the whole region proud because we did and the philippine filipino ability and style in hosting these games i think we performed even more than our expectations actually  originally uh the sports officials were uh thinking of getting about sixty golds for the philippines well we certainly surpassed that right now freddie we are seeing the mascot of the sixteenth edition of the southeast asian games kiko labuyo a warmer friendlier representation of the wild rooster native to our country no doubt there kiko labuyo must be celebrating himself now because it feels very good but of course there 's a feeling of nostalgia also in every participant of these southeast asian games and all those who have come here to watch these closing ceremonies you know closing ceremonies can always be very heartbreaking because after twelve days of fiercely-fought competitions in all the venues you win new friends you lose uh some medals and yet the whole spirit uh which comes in you is why it 's not only winning but i guess winning medals but winning friends which is essential in these games well as a as symbol of of winning you have the victory girls parading down the track oval uh carrying the sea games flag the sea games flag uh taking its panel of blue for the final march here at the rizal memorial stadium thousands upon thousands of people here inside and those who 're watching millions more on television and those listening over radio and there 's no doubt that for those volunteers who have been a part of these southeast asian games from the manila organizing committee i think more than two thousand of them they must be very proud that despite uh maybe the lack of resources before they have given their very best in serving the athletes and delegates and all the tourists who have come over to manila for the southeast asian games you know freddie the very best minds have participated have volunteered their services for the sea games and the more beautiful you know filipinas are certainly here they represented the country as victory girls in this edition of the sea games and uh these people are volunteers actually and they have volunteered to award the medals to all the deserving athletes who have conquered their respective contests well we now have the parade of the flags of the different competing nations in the southeast asian games nine countries from the whole of asean competing and battling for three hundred thirty gold medals in the southeast asian games and of course for the terrific performance by indonesia and the philippines you know during the first two days the philippines did very well nine gold medals first day second day nine gold medals  uh uh  we led for two days from there on it was indonesia but in the last three days we gave indonesia its biggest scare in the history of the games sixteen gold medals on saturday and sixteen last sunday a total of thirty-two gold medals and indonesia was thinking what does the philippines have and there 's the possibility that the philippines will win the overall crown well freddie uh i 'd like to point out at this point as opposed to the opening ceremonies which was also pomp and pageantry and words atmosphere today 's closing ceremonies of the sea games is going to be very meaningful now we see the athletes this time breaking the barriers of their uh nationalities and marching according to sport or event which they have participated in hand-in-hand they are they 're marching down the stadium it 's amazing that after uh ten days of bitter competition in the playing field just going for that gold medal the pride and prestige of knowing that you can win it for your country there you are now locked in arms together as friends and you have to forget the bitter rivalry on the playing field and knowing that you can move together and share the dream and opportunity experience of knowing that after everything has been said and done you are after all friends and the medal is just only one aspect of these games yes that 's right freddie apart from uh winning and and conquering one 's self and then making one 's country really proud the sea games in itself is is after all for fostering brotherhood among uh the peoples of the the nine countries represented here in the southeast asian games and for the benefit of our viewers who do not know a lot of socials were uh scheduled and and and the athletes themselves participated in a lot of these events uhm they were able to witness a lot of cultural presentations and they shared a lot of time together if one is to chronicle these games there were so many stories that need to be told retold written in for future generations to talk about but of course before we go to those stories of each personal athlete let 's go to the medal tally after today 's competition in the marathon indonesia winning the overall crown ninety-two gold medals

Philippines	thank you very much and ladies and gentlemen we have a uh knockdown for today and uh luckily we have the filipino fighter for the heavyweight division that 's rolando escobar fighting it out against joko soriyono this is the first round of action okay so even pa rin ho as we have the caution by the referee about the uh head butting for both uh fighters okay soriyong speaker makes mistakes with the name of the indonesian boxer of indonesia scoring a left to the chin of escobar by uh soriyong and we have referee once again stopping the fight okay so  meron siyang napakinggang nagko- coach doon sa  corner ng indonesia that 's in the blue corner  okay pormahan ulit  a left by escobar to the chin of uh yaharong and yaharong is counter punching a big right to the face of yaharong or rather soriyono and we have uh soriyono right now left right combination to the face of uh escobar escobar is squinting words  left right combination by uh soriyono and escobar is cornered another left right combination by soriyono naku maganda 'yung puntos ni soriyono  left right to the chin another right by soriyono to the left chin of escobar and break okay so sumuntok si escobar pagsigaw ng break  at uh siyempre binigyan ng warning a left jab by uh soriyono and there goes the end of round number one so even po ang kanilang labanan  at this point iyon po ay sa sariling score card  natin  this is uh the uh last bout for uh today 's action and the day number two of the amateur boxing competition at the sixteenth south asian games between rolando escobar and joko soriyono of

pormahan sa gitna ng lona  soriyono left right combination to the face nag-  cover din si escobar  escobar is backing out a right to the face of escobar by soriyono  okay another right oh this time

by uh soriyono to the face of escobar a left right combination this time by soriyono and escobar is squinting okay there goes the break  okay a left by escobar to the chin of soriyono and the attack by escobar right now and then medyo may tumamang ulo sa chin  ni escobar  okay so dalawa nabigyan ng dalawang warning  itong si soriyono ng indonesia for not listening to the referee pagsigaw ng break hindi nakikinig  left right combination by soriyono and there goes a no ducking by escobar mababa 'yong kanyang ulo at siya po ay binigyan ng  warning din at pormahan uli  a left to the mid section by soriyono soriyono of indonesia with his uh uh left right combination and uh soriyono is cornered right now okay we have a clinch and there goes the break  okay escobar looking at his range once again and soriyono backing out a right to the chin by soriyono a left to the chin once again of escobar by soriyono and escobar  medyo groggy 'yata  a left right by soriyono to the chin of escobar another

a left right by soriyono to the chin of uh escobar escobar right cross it 's wild one a right upper cut and a head blow by uh by soriyono and escobar is counted out okay so medyo groggy itong si

Philippines	good afternoon philippines mabuhay  and we welcome you back here at the international broadcast center dito po sa sydney australia for the continuing exclusive coverage of people 's television network in the on going twenty-seventh olympiad  ngayong hapon mga kaibigan nakita niyo po yung medal tally mukhang magiging exciting yung labanan ng u s at china dahil tatlong gold medals na lang ang uh lamang ng u s sa china so any time any moment ay pwedeng uh mapantayan or malampasan ng china ito dahil on-going pa rin po ang mga gold medal matches dito po sa twenty-seventh olympiad at this point in time mga kaibigan uh ang ating coverage ay ililipat po natin sa exhibition center sa downtown sydney for the on-going uh quarterfinal round of men 's volleyball  nandoon po ang ating kasamang si sev sarmenta at maila gumila upang ibigay sa atin ang match ng cuba against russia in the quarterfinals of men 's volleyball uh losing the number one rank seeding to italy in one set to three and finally this team this russian team gets the second place in pool b in the preliminaries and cuba on the other hand is currently in third place in the team standing from the pre preliminary in pool pool a losing uh two matches against brazil and the netherlands in three straight sets but winning the matches against spain in three three sets to one and uh egypt three straight sets and australia also in three straight sets and the winner of this match will end up going up against the winner of the brazil argentina match and here we go  now you should watch out for yakolev of russia number ten and in the cuban side dennis angel dennis who can really fly sev yes and this is our first sit-in into the men 's competition because of the schedule that we 've followed here and the men 's game mas mabilis ano mas uh   yes this is much faster yes  that 's right this is really fast and uh you know if you 're used to seeing power volleyball in the women the men 's uh well you know of course it 's expected that it 's gonna be faster because of the power of these uh these guys so how each one manages the power dealt by each other will be the factor here and you were absolutely correct yakolev with that point  sobra lumilipad talaga si yakolev  yakolev also is quite tall standing six seven but you know it was really an interesting match these russians played against the koreans because uh they really didn't expect that  they almost lost that match  sabi mo nga nung bus trip natin papunta rito medyo nakakapanghinayang din na nawala yung mga koreans because they did quite well in the course of the tournament   yes yes  and uh last night we we saw that match the americans going up the korean women  sa women 's ano  that was really something else and uh the koreans almost got that one and they could have just moved to the semi-finals already   yes  and snatched that one from the americans as of the moment this stands at three two in favor of the russians however it it 's the cubans who will be serving pavel pimienta now on your screen to serve  tapos agad ang puntos ano laughter   oh what a shot  that 's that was olikhver of russia  words pati yung first name niya russian words  jump serve go to the right strong one what a shot osvaldo hernandez stands six eight his serve strong one again from hernandez as yakolev is easily putting that one over from the left it 's den angel dennis the cuban squad extremely loaded unveiling quickly the arsenal of strength now who will be craftier here scrappier perhaps may have the edge let 's see let 's let this game flow hernandez nice service there  alam mo sev yang si angel dennis uh he 's he is actually short 'no he 's uh compared to the other players he 's just six four but that guy can really hit the ball way up you know he can fly  karamihan naman dito talagang lumilipad e  sometimes uh small but terrible e di ba  actually sa t v mukhang hindi ganun kalaki 'no pero pag katabi ninyo silang nag-aantay kayo ng bus diyan sa labas mukha kaming mga dwende kahit sa women 's side ano  that 's true and the winner from tetyukhin of russia talk about height anong average height ng cuba six six yeah  sa kabilang panig naman and uh we 'll see this point being played while we check out the average height of the russian side the russian side the average height six seven that 's tall hernandez putting that one away going down in the russian squad is tetyukhin too strong here 's the team captain yosvany hernandez  that 's a club   patay na ang puntos oo  not being able to get that one he was blocked you know kazakhov is quite a big quite a tall uh player seven one ano  oh yeah he is always there you know when you need him to make points but that that error is from kazakhov  alam mo itong sa international volleyball ano patuloy na na nare- redefine yung game dati-dati hindi mo makikita ang mga seven one pupunta na ng basketball yan but now dami nang seven one ano  and russia can like that gentleman on your screens right now that is the gentleman who stands seven one yakolev it goes to the left down the line there was there was a touch the point goes to cuba and the score now is eight seven because this is the first technical time-out when we reach the level of eight we press the button for the first technical time-out we 'll use it break in recording   patuloy po ang olympic volleyball attack points over the cub cubans seeding at an efficien efficiency rate rather of seventy-five percent the attack points six to four the edge to the cubans  hindi nagtatagal ang bola walang uh hindi na umiikot ano   ang game is set attack set attack and who overpowers the other is going to be the trend here that 's men 's volleyball for you eight all diago  hammering that down was number six of cuba ivan benito ruiz cuesta a long name sev  oo galit siya nung grade one kasi ang daming isusulat na pangalan e  that 's right from the back that was tetyukhin swept over by the cubans' back set  huli  well done and the cubans getting that point from the net angel dennis stands six four doing an excellent job of protecting their surface and protecting them from any kind of attack the cubans ahead now by two back set that 's in great shot name   alam mo sa men 's volleyball mas nagiging more valuable yung role nung libero kung minsan yung mga uh announcers natin sa australia libero italian yan pero itong libero ang gagamitin natin  so sa power game ano importante ang laro ng libero ano  oh yeah it is interesting to note that sev in the women 's team there is no libero but in the men 's team   sa cuba sa cuba  there is there is a libero   kanya-kanyang philosophy e  the cuban team which is uh going to go up against brazil in a major major showdown in the women 's category  they 're actually looking for a double e  that 's tomorrow they 're looking for a double  if the women can score because the volleyball program in uh that area 'no cuba brazil malutong  uh cubans playing well here ano   great blocking   malutong  single blocking there by hernandez blocking yakolev of russia as you mentioned the cubans ending up only in third place in their pool which is pool a dropping two matches and uh anything can happen here because one loss you 're gone that 's right  just like last night   yes  the the u s almost lost that match against the koreans that 's it olikhver not successful over the net  natutuwa talaga ako dito sa back-up dancers yung nasa nagwa- warm up sa kanto endless stretching yan e ano  oh yes because they can be called to play anytime   anytime  anytime they don't occupy the bench e   sa culture ng volleyball ayaw nilang paupuin lahat ng players dun sa bench area yun lang pinalitan ipapalit at saka yung mga kailangan lang  and do you know the people who were there at the phil sports at the grand prix they 're pretty familiar with that already because they saw they saw liela barros there a lot of times   oo  because she hardly played because she had an injury and she wasn't playing at her best but i think she 's playing very well oh she 's playing very well in the olympics  her heart out here   laughter look at these russians trying to pursue that one tetyukhin tetyukhin did not want to give up that was way outside the cubans are dictating the flow of this first set fourteen eleven they are

cuba has been hitting a lot of balls there in this first set and already the russians have committed two errors it used to be the cubans with four and just in about every statistical category the cubans have the edge and the score reveals and confirms that particular advantage those advantages in fact  ang ganda nung style nitong si angel ano uh si dennis angel ano  oh yes  sa side view muna

trainor from russia for the philippines well   at this at this point no mentor we have uh nine kills for the philippines and it 's so early in the game and uh we can see how aggressive they are that

que once again pick it up over this time with a soft smash barina almost had that uh half ball but uh he needed to take a few more steps so now serving for myanmar they 're down by four seven to three here 's iba&ntilde;ez on the other side under tip one of the rare rare tips that that 's what 's too far word close to the net with her height the uh nobody can block her anyway that 's correct seven to four philippines on top by three
Philippines	dr villacorta mr del rosario thank you for the rare fortune of having been introduced two times laughter and therefore exposed to the hazards of double jeopardy laughter  let me place those two introductions in proper perspective  the truth of the matter is that i was such a lousy student i decided to be a professor no reflection on professors who may be present here today laughter  and after having taught law for almost thirteen years i decided i was such a lousy professor i had better be a dean laughter no reflection on deans who may be present here and after four years as a dean of law i decided i was such a lousy dean i had better run for congress laughter  and indeed i became congressman representing the second district of rizal but after four years i decided i was such a lousy congressman and so ran for the senate now this is my third term as senator of the philippines and i 'm beginning to toy with the idea laughter and clapping that perhaps i 'm such a lousy senator i had better run for the presidency if i were qualified for it for the presidency of the rizal high school alumni association laughter   akala ninyo kung ano ang sasabihin ko  in any event mr president pedro mora of ley la salle and the other presidents who are here in our midst my dear fellow students i am sure that everyone is aching to know about the latest developments in the liberal party which culminated in one the resignation of my dear friend erap estrada two the unanimous acceptance of that resignation by the executive committee of the liberal party and three the nomination by the executive committee through the consistory method of voting of two candidates for president and two candidates for vice-president actually this is the first step chosen by the liberal party in order to eliminate the practice of bribery and vote buying the curse and at once the evil of the old system of politics in this country there are therefore three steps in choosing the l p candidate for president and vice-president the first step is at the level of the thirty-five-man executive committee which met last march eight at the residence of former president diosdado macapagal the first two names with the highest votes for president and vice-president are then forwarded to the national directorate composed of six hundred party leaders the directorate which will meet in june or july will either ratify or reject the said nominations and the third step will be when the national convention composed of around four thousand leaders of the liberal party throughout the country meets on or around december twenty-nine nineteen ninety-one and renders the final verdict on who shall be the liberal party candidate for president and the liberal candidate for vice-president last march eight that is to say the other friday when the executive committee was holding its consistory a method which i shall explain very shortly my friend erap reportedly charged that i was a dictator and that i wanted to control the entire selection process by handpicking the thirty-five members of the executive committee you might recall that after his resignation and this was featured on television that same evening and in the newspapers the next morning i said i wish senator erap estrada well and that i do not wi wish to speak ill of him the reason for that statement is that in truth erap was misinformed or ill-advised which is why only last week he denied that he had called me a dictator and offered apologies to me through the mass media in any case allow me to say something that is a matter of record i was imprisoned twice because i was against absolute rule i was against dictatorship first during the japanese occupation when as a young man of twenty sabagay bata pa rin ako hanggang ngayon laughter when as a young man of twenty i joined the underground i was the editor of the guerilla paper in the province of rizal was captured by the kempetai the japanese military police severely tortured in the presence of my father i thought then that my father must have suffered a thousand sufferings he must have died a thousand deaths and then i was transferred to fort santiago and you will find the plaque there later sentenced to fifteen years of hard labor kaya't hindi po lamang ako senador presidente ng senado ex-convict po rin ako sapagkat nagsilbi po rin ako sa muntinlupa and of course during the marcos years after the release of ninoy aquino in may nineteen eighty ako na abogado ni ninoy ako naman ang pinaaresto ni marcos at inihalili doon sa kulungan ni ninoy doon sa fort bonifacio  it would therefore be a little strange bago ko makalimutan mabuti sabihin ko sa inyo  before i was released by marcos there was tremendous pressure brought to bear on him from within and from without marcos must have been surprised that he received telegrams even from poland which was then under communism actually a fellow worker of mine in the world council of churches sent him a telegram urging my release i was released before the end of nineteen eighty-eight ngunit ang pagkakasalita ni marcos doon sa kanyang directive ay napakaganda  he said i am hereby releasing salonga from military custody and placing him under house arrest under the custody of his wife mrs lydia salonga laughter  when i got home that night i was debating in my mind as to which was better laughter military custody or marital custody laughter  in fact when i got home i saw on my desk a note from my pamangkin for whom many of you might have voted during the last election  rene saguisag sent me a letter saying dear uncle i pity you on top of martial law you are now under marital law laughter  and i sent a quick note to him i said dear nephew do not pity me long before the imposition of martial law i had always been under marital law laughter   ang hirap paniwalang-paniwala naman doon ang misis ko so i have to reassure audiences that i 'm still the commander-in-chief at home laughter  and that my last words every time i got out of home are of course yes i agree darling laughter  anyway let 's go back baka madiskaril tayo  what i 'm trying to say is that it 's a little strange that i who fought dictatorships and risked my whole life should act like a dictator anyway let us review the latest developments toward the end of nineteen ninety last year erap estrada and tito guingona our majority floor leader in the senate approached me separately and told me about their understanding to entrust to me as probable presidential nominee the prerogative of selecting my vice-presidential teammate note that this is the usual practice in democracies like the united states and the philippines in the philippines you will recall ramon magsaysay chose carlos p garcia as his running mate macapagal chose emmanuel pelaez president marcos chose fernando lopez in the united states john kennedy chose lyndon johnson reagan chose george bush and george bush chose dan quayle so there is nothing dictatorial in that kind of a practice but i was not comfortable with the idea for one simple reason both erap and tito are very close to me i am the ninong in marriage of erap 's son jinggoy the vice-mayor of san juan and i am also the ninong in marriage of tito guingona 's son  hence i felt i should select the vice-presidential nominee only after consultation with the executive committee of the liberal party the assertion of my friend erap that it is undemocratic for me to choose my running mate is therefore historically wrong and more than that it is repudiated by his own press statements i will just cite one in the philippine inquirer issue of february twenty-three nineteen ninety-one erap was quoted by senate reporter jenny ilio in the following words yes said erap i 'm willing to forego my presidential ambition if senate president salonga will get me as his vice-presidential teammate otherwise erap said i will leave the liberal party quote unquote in other words what my friend erap had wanted me to do that is choose him over ti tito guingona as my teammate is precisely the very same thing he now considers undemocratic or dictatorial and which we in the liberal party did not follow anyway at any rate on january eight nineteen ninety-one i invited erap and tito to my residence as i was bothered by the fact that their version of their understanding differed in some respects for example tito told me that they had agreed that whoever lost in the selection would be the campaign manager of the other erap denied this to me hence i prepared the draft of an agreement embodying their idea of vesting in me as presidential nominee the prerogative of selecting my running mate in accordance with the election law and the liberal party practice but giving me enough latitude to consult the executive committee of the party what erap did not like in that written agreement was the last paragraph it said we solemnly promise to abide by the decision and work unconditionally for the victory of the liberal party it was this paragraph that he did not like erap told me if you decide in favor of tito this means wala na akong pupuntahan i have no more option in fairness to tito however he was prepared to sign that document erap brought that document with him and eventually showed it to some people who leaked it to the press with their very critical comments   dito pala may partial brownout laughter   pagka ang pinag-uusapan pala ay si erap nagkakaroon ng brownout laughter   parang may shooting tayong palagi dito  as a result the l p executive committee which met several times formulated what is now known as the three step process and adopted all the proposals of senators maceda and estrada in the selection of our candidates  although erap has already apologized to me let me clarify the baselessness of his charge that i handpicked the members of the executive committee under the party constitution the great majority of the members of the executive committee are the national officials elected by the people the former president of the philippines diosdado macapagal is the titular head all the eight l p senators and all the nineteen members of congress compose the majority of the executive committee members they are not there because salonga handpicked them they are there because they were elected by the people eminent legal personalities such as former justice cecilia mu&ntilde;oz-palma president of the con com of which vice-president villacorta is a shining star laughter patay sila dun laughter and chief justice pedro yap who was abroad at the time of the meeting are in the executive committee because the l p constitution so provides these are distinguished men and women known for their independent-mindedness their integrity and their competence how can i possibly dictate to them  marahil at ito'y sinabi ko kay erap hindi lamang nabasa ng mga advisers mo ang party constitution at ang party rules  hindi mo kasalanan 'yan ang sabi ko kay erap 'yan ay kasalanan ng mga tagapayo mo na hindi marunong magbasa  now this brings me to the consistory or concrete method of voting which was followed last march eight at the meeting of the executive committee in the house of president macapagal incidentally this is the method used by the cardinals when they choose the pope  in the march eight meeting of the executive committee presided by president macapagal there were no nominations  everyone belonging to the party was a potential candidate there were no speeches the balloting was secret and there was no vote buying money politics under the new politics of the liberal party was completely eliminated before the balloting began at around nine in the morning we received a letter of resignation from erap estrada handcarried by congressman rivera of bulacan the letter stated that due to quote recent developments within the party unquote he arrived at the painful decision quote unquote to render his resignation effective immediately this caught the executive committee by surprise a week ago on february twenty-six and a day before the meeting of the executive committee erap had reassured our congressmen that he was coming to the executive committee meeting he was going to participate in the voting and he would abide by the results therefore that time and again erap had threatened to bolt the liberal party if i did not choose him as vice-presidential teammate in one breath he wanted me to exercise one-man rule but in the next breath he condemned the practice he had wanted as dictatorial or undemocratic
Philippines	i 'm sorry that i brought a uh laptop here in the bank i am in charge of the audio-visual uhm treatment i was responsible for bringing in the marketing touch for our presentations that 's the reason why i can get away with this equipment without the bank knowing it anyway when i told them that i was going to share the uh corporate vision of union bank with uh you la sallites they did not hesitate to allow me to borrow the equipment it 's sort of a uh selling also a selling tool to you la sallites who would like to work later on with our bank so much for the advertisement  some of you know that i am an atenean and you may wonder why what am i doing here i didn't realize that max uh tricked me into this 'no uh but it was from a great la sallite by the name of dr bernardo villegas that i got to learn about business ethics you may say that in ateneo we uh are taught sixteen units of theology and sixteen units of philosophy more than our major uhm course  you may think that us ateneans would have more or less a lot of this social awareness or social consciousness in fact the battle cry of ateneo is man for others  but even with that i did not know how to face or i was not prepared when i started working on how to judge whether what was good or what was bad in ateneo they taught you uh for as long as you 're serving others then you 're okay but there 's this big question when like my myself when i started joining a corporation or working for a corporation we very well know that the ano and we were taught in business that the end goal of business is profits so i was not able to reconcile profits and social responsibility  but it was uh when i studied at the center for research and communication when dr bernie villegas taught about two principles in business ethics and these principles are called the principle of solidarity and the principle of subsidiarity what is my laptop doing here well inside that laptop is two months of hard work translating in visual terms what union bank 's vision is all about this is my shared experience with you uh you 're one of the few and lucky shall we say lucky viewers because this isn't shown to everybody right now our bank is up for for sale at least thirty percent i am supposed to be there but uh since it was a previous commitment i 'm here in any case i hope that you will uh seeing it a lot of uh values that i just mentioned about uh solidarity and subsidiarity but i 'll tell you much late much more about this later on but first let 's talk about solidarity and subsidiarity  how many of you here would say that business is based on greed  you know i 've i went i 've gone through the mission statement of of uh la salle and there is a lot of it there 's a lot of social responsibility there isn't it and uh there 's one thing that i observed also here that every six o'clock i dunno if also every twelve o'clock you say the angelus that 's very admirable  but i think this group here is coming from the business economics am i right group and am i also right that you are here and you are taking your courses so that you would earn a living right how many of you here would say that you are here uh for altruistic reasons ha  isn't it that you would like to crash in your course and finish your course as soon as possible so that you can start working hindi ba and not only working but working in the best companies because do you know that it is only here in la salle that i realized that you are already learning courses or subjects which normally if you compare with other graduates they get to learn only in their masteral courses not even in their masteral courses but during actual work experience so you 're very fortunate but that all adds up to your trying to get the best in terms of income if you want to work for a corporation right you want to be employed hindi ba  how much how much are you expected to earn right now before one thousand was fine with us 'no let 's just say five years ago laughter  but now i think the uh average hiring rate at least in commercial banks would range from three to five thousand pesos okay let 's say let 's say that you know inflation is high and uh things have changed and you guys are more experts supposedly  but can you reconcile well some of you here i know i have some students who are all who would also like to be entrepreneurs but isn't also the end goal of a business profit hindi ba  i can see some students here who would like who would one of these days would like to put up their own business and make money and become heroes exporters  so let 's let 's say that you are here in la salle studying working your your very best to get the best grades so that you can if you want to work for a corporation you can earn the highest salaries possible or if you become entrepreneurs immediately join the big league in export business all for what money hindi ba  but is money bad  how many of you say that uh how many of you here think that money is evil laughter  otherwise you all shift courses to what and you will become priests and nuns 'no  but money per se is not bad just like business just like earning a career earning a living  what is bad is the abuse of money or what is bad is the abuse of business di ba coughing  let me quote george guildern  he is a noted uhm american socio uh socio anthro anthropologist he says that christianity preaches that it is better to give than to receive but in business it is better to receive your profits hindi ba  now he also says that the church condemns the abuses of capitalism but not private initiative and that 's the core of business and that 's the core of that 's the core of you working for corporations private initiative  and he goes on further to say that enterprises are essentially altruistic hard to believe 'no  so it is other-oriented not a zero-sum game when a gain for one player can only come at the expense of another  hard to believe again 'no  but i think knowing i mean knowing uh la salle for two semesters uh they also bombard you with a lot of social responsibility but let me share with you these two principles which can help us uh make judgments when we 're working either for a corporation or when we put up our own business and these once more are the principles of solidarity and subsidiarity   solida well subsidiarity is essentially human right it is part of a basic human right for one to earn his living okay and make money in the process because if we think of it some of you here who have more or less uh some background on theology or religion isn't it that we are primarily responsible first to our creator di ba  next to ourselves then others because how can you help others if you cannot even help yourselves and how can you help yourself if you 're not you don't even know that you have a creator to serve first  so it is okay so it 's okay that you 're studying what business economics so that you 'll earn money but i 'm sure some of you are doing this what primarily for your loved ones some of you would have families later on and you 'll do this what for your families but not for yourself then it becomes altruistic then the principle of subsidiarity which is basically private enterprise or self-interest becomes a noble thing but there 's a problem if all of you would start getting interested primarily for hi for his or her own concerns there might be some trouble di ba  because who can tell you or who can tell the other that once i start doing my thing it might be at the expense of the other so there 's a need for order social justice and the order of law and thi this is where the principle of solidarity comes in just simply common good 'no  uhm let me give you an example the government has no business running small enterprises which can produce goods and services more efficiently this is the reason why mr gorbachev went through perestroika and glasnost  this is why china has started to move into market capitalism why because they 've realized that you guys who would be businessmen later on or working for businesses can produce goods and services more efficiently than the government but on the other hand you have no business building roads building bridges public uhm utilities it 's not profitable di ba  and this is where the principle of solidarity comes in wherein the common good is at stake then the government has to come in then private individuals like you and me have to bond together and work for this common good i hope i have shared it with you as as well as lay-mannish as possible  now the dangers to avoid are the of course anything the dangers to avoid are extremes and one extreme is liberalism well in in liberalism uh the individual is glorified okay this is where we have the rightists 'no and uh they sometimes do their thing at the expense of the common good now we have what the uh military rightists right now threatening the country for as long as they pursue their cause even at the expense of what investments that could have gone to the country and gone to productive purposes bahala na kung wala 'yon basta 'yung masusunod 'yung gusto namin   mapapalitan si 'yung present administration and they would come in and uh claim to put order into the government on the other hand what do we have the other extreme leftists uhm they 're technically called socialists hindi ba  where the collective is glorified at the expense of what the individual or individual freedom and so we 're left with no choice but to strike that happy balance between the two extremes wherein going out making business and making money for altruistic purposes or working for companies and getting as much salary as you can can be justified and in fact i encourage you to even get more because the country needs more i told some of my students that graduating after graduating they 'd better work in hong kong uh thailand malaysia singapore south korea all of these newly-industrialized countries or tiger economies why it may be for altruistic reason they can get more in terms of money and in terms of experience and of course that money would not go to swiss accounts like somebody else did because if that money were circulated within the system then even if uh no matter how greedy that person can become that money would benefit a lot of people especially those in the financial sector  don't you think so but it was pulled outside of the country so who bene benefited from it the swiss  so if you guys work outside for say five years while you are young 'cause each year i understand that the age limit is getting younger and younger you have what five years is easy to spare hindi ba  gain that experience  not only not only will you be uh if you will be if you would be pit against a local here in terms of experience you 're ahead but i 'm sure that money that you will be earning and that experience you will be earning will be brought back here the p l d t commercial babalik ka rin di ba  that 's why they 're called heroes right now the new heroes those who are bringing in the dollars  so i 'd like now to share with you uhm an example of uh our vision i work for union bank of the philippines it is a uh government-owned bank and i 'm very happy to inform you that we underwent a visioning process and it was in this process that we were able to find out that our stockholders were not greedy at all okay they of course they demanded the best returns on their investments they also were able to open their eyes to the needs of employees and others and we also realized that we not only have to concern ourselves with our employers but we also realized that we had a responsibility to share or we were responsible not only to our stockholders but also to other stakeholders so this is another uh principle which i 'd like to share with you  it 's the concept of the stakeholder concept wherein which guarantees that if you uhm take care of all of those guys who are part of your business be it a janitor your supplier your buyers management employees even the community the nation then if you take care of them pretty well not only managing your own business but also your relationship with them then you can be guaranteed of success in your business endeavors so so much for the theory let 's move into the into uh an actual output of our bank   you 're falling asleep audience says no  okay uhm this is uh supposed to be space referring to presentation material laughter  now the background here is that our stockholders the aboitiz group s s s who owns sixty percent aboitiz owns forty percent together with uh top management meaning department heads and some middle managers uh got got together and decided to find out what do we really want to be in the next ten years okay and so and and the process was such that uhm let me pause for a while ha kasi baka naunahan na kayo  the process was such that uhm we were supposed to come up with drawings 'no literally a literal vision of what they expect the bank to be ten years from now surprisingly uhm they found out that the owners the employees and management came up with more or less the same picture and this was really hair-raising because we didn't expect it to be that way
Philippines	as i was saying uh in ayala we have been very fortunate to have had uh one of the not graduate soon-to-graduate uh uh from ley name of organization from uh legal management one of your very own rowena tan who was assigned to us as a student trainee and we are very happy to have her with us and in the pro process uh we got to know uh people like imelda lim juna mae de leon and a couple of others so it 's good to know that the relationship continues uh beyond uh being a student trainee and coming over to your school to be able to share with you uh our own thoughts okay uh some of you have class uh after this so we 'll go ahead with our presentation coughing  what makes ayala click or what makes ayala tick as uh the dean was telling me well uh i 'll walk you through just to give you an idea it 's one fifteen i want to do some good time management here so what i want to talk about is uh the basic fundamental beliefs that uh make ayala what it is today and focusing on three principal areas which i will not preempt but talk about a little bit later on and then go through those three areas and then later on do some summarization and then close it and open the floor to questions if we have time and so if some of you need to leave the room nike and jimmy was apprising me please don't feel embarrassed uh that 's fine if you have to leave leave and then those who want to stay by all means stay i will be happy to answer as many questions as you want uh i asked for leave for the balance of the afternoon so that will justify my presence for the rest of the afternoon here at uh de la salle so let 's talk about ayala and what makes ayala tick  ayala is really a holding company and a holding company is a company that is in the business of managing several companies so the holding company is ayala the employee force is a hundred and eighty-nine not too many but when we are talking about the whole conglomerate we are talking roughly of an employee population of forty thousand so not not big if you compare say to the san miguel 's or what have you which is very much manufacturing labor-intensive so when we talk ayala this afternoon we 're talking about the philosophy the rationale the thinking of the holding company and how it concretizes itself in several diverse businesses that it is involved in here i flash the logos of several of those companies not not complete but for example purefoods which is the flagship of our food manufacturing enterprise the most recent company called ayala land which we shall make reference to later on ayala life insurance company which is the flagship company of our insurance business  then we have integrated micro-electronics incorporated which is involved in the semicon industry and the like and then we have the bank through the unibank the bank of the philippine islands and then we have the ayala foundation you may be wondering what a foundation is doing uh in uh a conglomerate we shall explain that a little bit later on and then we have a presence in the agricultural side through ayala agri so we 're talking about ayala and its philosophy concretized through the conglomerate  i hope you can read that uh it might be a bit blurred there for the gentlemen at the back so i will read it out loud i quote directly from a statement of the person whom we fondly call in the organization j z a  j z a represents the initials of jaime zobel or ja he would say if you wanted to impress him thobel tho the spanish th the jaime thobel jaime thobel de ayala whom we fondly call j z a by initials and i quote uh what does he say he says in an environment of constant change which i 'm sure you 're familiar with you hear it from your professors etcetera both domestically and internationally it is critically important for ayala to be a flexible institution in the long term flexibility and the ability to adjust quickly to changing circumstances are very important to long-term success so i just want to highlight that in terms of the question what makes ayala click what makes ayala tick well precisely because it wants to respond to an environment of constant change not only in the local scene but internationally as well and it strives to stress flexibility and the ability to adjust quickly  and here i 'd like to share with you a problem and the problem is ayala corporation is one hundred fifty-eight years old and when your uh group that is that old and you talk about flexibility how do you build in flexibility into your organization knowing that you do have to respond to the changing times to the various scenarios available  in this light adjusts presentation material we would like to focus on three areas which the company believes are critical components or major publics to be addressed as it focuses on change flexibility in the long term environment what are the three the first are the stockholders ang mga nagpupundar sa kumpanya in the parlance of the marxists ang mga kapitalista uh the employees mga kawani natin and the nation so we 're looking at three critical constituents or major publics and this is critical i think this is precisely why ayala is what it is today because it tries to balance the interest of stockholders employees and that of the nation  balance mind you that word is carefully chosen because sometimes if you 're an owner you want so much in terms of profitability and if you talk about profitability in the context of the mideast war right now you can see the potential profitability of being into the armament business imagine if you were manufacturing a patriot or a patriotic missile you 'd be earning something like one million dollars a day just for one missile and so many missiles etcetera plus all the equipment that goes into it so if you 're just thinking of profitability why the arms business brings in tremendous profits but is that the type of business that you want to get yourself into i just throw that there or in some m b a classes they show that there are certain types of businesses that give you a big return on investment but you question again what type of service does that investment offer so we 're looking at three critical components or publics the stockholders the employees and the nation  let 's look at the stockholders  those of you who are interested in the financial side you might be interested to know that ayala has five thousand six hundred stockholders employees uh the armed forces of the philippines have invested some of their retirement funds in this uh all kinds of people i 'm proud to say that i myself am a stockholder several years back through salary deduction they allowed me to buy into the company and even while i was paying for those shares through salary deduction i was already enjoying the cash dividends and the stock dividends that uh fully-paid stockholders enjoyed in fact uh just to share further when i was putting up my house through a housing loan with the company and i needed extra funds i liquefied some of these shares to be able to add to the construction of the house and until now i still have some of those shares  ika nga sabi nila nanganak na nang nanganak na 'yung share na 'yon  and my concept is i 'd like to be able to hold on to the those shares and leave a legacy to my family and say you know when you 're old enough hopefully those shares have grown and you have a share or several shares in ayala so we 're talking about five thousand six hundred stockholders in nineteen seventy-six a share was valued at four pesos and twenty per share  today today referring to presentation material is nineteen ninety because the study was done last year nineteen ninety including the dividends and the stocks that you would have gained is something like two hundred eighteen pesos and fifty-two centavos per share so do your mathematics the growth of that share people in the stock market analyze things like pri uh price and earnings ratio that sort of thing it grew by an average of thirty-two percent per year and if you factor in the the good times and the hard times because as you well know uh since seventy-six we have had the good times and we have also had the lean times profitability rose by twenty-six point two percent on the average and what is the key the key is to be a diversified and balanced portfolio of businesses i can be more concrete here i used to be assigned as the personnel manager for purefoods corporation and at that time the only line that purefoods was in was in the what we refer to as fresh processed meats 'yung hamon hotdog delata  and we asked ourselves with all the competition going around you uh couldn't rely on one area merely to be able to carry your business so within purefoods they were already talking about chicken poultry and uh considering that the lead market leaders for poultry anybody know who 's the market leader for chicken nowadays magnolia magnolia 's number one uhm purefoods is number four considering that it is a late starter in the ballgame to be up there in the big league is to achieve no mean achievement 'cause we came into the ballgame in nineteen eighty-four but you see what happened in the the times when delata or fresh processed meats were down me sumasalo at ang sumalo dito was chicken business and then in the purefoods we further diversified our export market we shall talk about that a little bit later on not to preempt that to be able to balance off and diversify the portfolio  talking about one critical component what makes ayala tick the stockholders their confidence in what we are doing the businesses that we are in the second critical component are the employees now all of us are familiar with annual reports and they say uh that the single largest asset of the company is not the money it 's the people and you will hear that often said and ayala is uh not alone in that we also believe that a critical public to address in terms of uh being critical to success are our employees we are concerned for the quality of life both work and personal life of almost thirty thousand nine hundred thirty-seven work force our statistics show that on the average uh you multiply that by five the average size of a family generally speaking is five so you multiply that by five and you can say that is the reach of the ayala group of companies and if you wish to add the extended ties of families perhaps that will go up a little bit more we follow a holistic approach to our human resources that sounds like jargon sounds like uh a technical term what is what is meant by a holistic approach holistic approach simply means thaat we look at the total person we look at the environment likewise in which the employee is at so we don't only focus on compensation on on salaries we also look at uh things like psychic income none of you have heard that term psychic income  it 's good to have pesos to hold in your hand and you can spend it but it 's also good to know that you are recognized for your talents for your abilities it 's good to know that uh the company gives you authority to do certain things and that gives you a feeling of uh self-esteem a feeling of importance a feeling that you are valuable to the organization that 's the type of thrust that we have and we do that to things like uh referring to presentation material jumping down a little bit training and development  we train our supervisors to be able to motivate our employees not only through things like increases that sort of thing but also to be able to turn them on to be able to show that they can contribute and give value to the organization we honestly say that we are not the top payer kung gusto mo ang pinakamalaking suweldo puntahan mo mga multinationals  pero ang multinationals from my experience they really squeeze you dry after a time they will tell you okay i think it 's time that we get another uh group of fresh blood into the organization so what do they do they dangle very nice uh separation packages which is very attractive some become millionaires overnight so what do some of these people do they leave they become entrepreneurs or they start looking for jobs again ayala 's philosophy is a bit different we believe that our compensation is above industry average but we also go beyond the legal requirements and the c b a uh c b a here refers to the collective bargaining agreement uh we are in a unionized environment and uh as pointed out a little bit later on over twenty-seven years relationship with the union there has been no single day of work stoppage for the last twenty-seven years i think that 's uh something to boast about in terms of the type of relationship we have with our uh friends in labor family needs are are also addressed seventy percent of our employees own their own house some of them live in ayala alabang and if they were to liquefy their own investment in that i mean we 're talking millionaires since dindo pumaren al solis millionaires they could be millionaires in their own right because of the advantages that the company has made available to them
Philippines	i apologize most abjectly for coming late it was i assure you uh something that i could not control 'cause of the hearing uh in in the senate anyway uh we are here today as students of economics and as interested citizens interested especially in how the economy is performing and i would like to tell you that my talk is going to be in the following manner first i 'm going to say what i think the potential of the economy is second i 'm going to say how the economy is being poisoned and third i 'm going to say how we can remove the poison from the economy so that we can get back the economy on a sustained growth path which is the objective that is most desired by everyone  so my first statement is the potential of the economy i can stand here and unambiguously say that there is absolutely nothing wrong with the economy and the potential of the philippines that a dose of good old economic policy proper economic policy can uh will be able to attain what do i mean by that if you look around at all our neighbors you will find out especially the asean you will find out that the philippines in nineteen sixty was second only to japan as far as its economic development was concerned as far as position in the economic in the developing economies of the world was concerned that position has deteriorated steadily since then so that although in nineteen sixty we could be compared favorably with thailand by the time we reached nineteen eighty-nine economists from abroad had already said that it was not fair to compare the philippines and thailand any longer thailand is just too much out of our league that hurts why because as far as the resources of the philippines are concerned as far as the human resources especially the natural resources name it we 've got what it takes so the next question that can be asked is where did we go wrong we went wrong simply because always economic policy and good economics has taken second place third place and fourth place to every other particular perspective of concern of the filipino people this has got to change and i think it is changing because where before economics if there was a lecture on economics we would have maybe two three four people uh coming in now everyone is interested to find out what in heaven 's name is wrong about our wrong with our economy and what can be done about it  the prospects the immediate prospects for the philippines are very gloomy but that does not that should not give us any cause for depression or for a or for giving us the the incentive to crawl into a hole and die that should rather elicit in us the response that we are fighting mad we are going to do something about it if we can't do something about it right now where by god by the time we get to be responsible citizens and in positions of power we 're going to do abou something about it then  there is always hope while there is life the question only be is must we have so much more problems to resolve in the future as a result of the compounding of the pres of the problems of the present and the past why do i say that the prospects are gloomy well if you will notice or if you have read in the newspapers the text of the memorandum of economic policy which contains the stabilization program that the philippine government has submitted to the i m f for approval you will find out that while the targets there are so many specific targets with respect to revenue with respect to expenditures etcetera etcetera very little mention is made about what the growth prospects of the economy are in fact in the text of the memorandum of economic policy you will find out that they all all they say is that for nineteen ninety-one the growth of g n p will be quote slow unquote what slow means i don't know i just attended a hearing this morning where they said well about one and a half percent one and a half to two percent the question is is that good bad or indifferent i was just in thailand last week or two weeks ago and a thai economist very good economist who also happens to be one of the leading economic managers in thailand was pulling my leg when he said when he said in answer to my question what 's the growth prospect of thailand this year and he said very bad very bad we 're only going to grow by six and a half percent laughter  that hurts especially since because at the beginning of the term of president aquino the government had put forward an economic plan that targeted a growth rate of six and a half percent on the average for the medium term everybody at that time said that was too ambitious and i said no that is just absolutely mediocre because that was going to be the growth rate of the rest of asia on the average for the medium term 's eighty-seven eighty-seven to ninety-two now not only are we not talking about the six and a half percent we 're not even giving a numerical magnitude to it one and a half percent was taken out of the out of the as a as a grudging admission on the part of our economic managers because one and a half percent growth rate of g d p will mean that on a per capita basis we will have contracted by negative one percent and even that ladies and gentlemen of the audience seems to be an overestimate given a close study of what exactly the features are the other features are of this memorandum of economic policy for this economic stabilization program now as students of economics for example just as a for example to to show you why i think that one and a half percent may be too much of an overestimate given the specific measures that are in this memorandum of economic policy there is a relationship economic relationship between for example the money supply and g n p m is equal to p q for all those who have forgotten in other words the growth of money the rate the growth rate of money is equal to the growth rate if you talk talk about it in logarithmic terms is equal to the inflation rate plus the real growth rate of the economy well what do we have in terms of the targeted increase in money supply this has not been published and i don't know why but the growth rate in money supply according to confidential sources and i sincerely hope i am wrong the growth rate of money supply in terms of base money has been stated as a ceiling by the i m f agreed to by the philippines or vice versa whichever way you want to it 's the same at ten point eight seven percent for nineteen ninety-one  gawin na nating eleven puwede ba  i mean this specificity up to the second decimal point really awes me especially since they ignore completely what the growth target is for the economy as a whole so that 's eleven percent that 's the growth rate of base money inflation is really projected to be about fourteen to fifteen percent this year so if growth rate of money supply is equal to inflation rate plus the growth rate of g n p that means that g n p more or less will contract by three to four percent this year how they came up with that one and a half percent is beyond me it must either be because they have made the wrong assumptions with respect to inflation or they actually think that the filipino people will sit will take this sitting down i certainly hope that we don't but until and unless we see the entire memorandum of economic policy not just the text but the tables and the accompanying appendices we are not going to be able to make a judgement but one thing sure even at the present uh even given all consistency one and a half percent should never be acceptable if that is what we mean by stability then my only answer to that is what is good about stability if being stable means being dead death after all is a stable condition it 's about the most stable condition of all words and that we do not want  why is it that we are accepting these kind of measures cough  well so what how do i know what are these measures all about these measures essentially say you 've got to decrease your deficit the public sector deficit and by the way you 've got to decrease your national government deficit you also and in order to do this you are going to have to increase your revenues and or decrease your expenditures or both we are doing both exactly how much are we supposed to decrease our public sector deficit it is supposed to go down from what it was last year five point two percent of g n p to supposedly nineteen ninety notice how specific they are to three point seven percent of g n p that 's the public sector that includes the national government the local governments the government corporations the government financial corporations the central bank etcetera  so you must decrease it by essentially one and a half percentage points of g n p but they say that the national government which is part and parcel of this public sector deficit must decrease this deficit by two percentage points of g n p in other words the entire burden of the deficit reduction is must be borne by the national government to the extent by the way of even more than the reduction of the deficit of the public sector in other words they 're expecting that the public sector deficit the rest of the public sector deficit will increase but that 's all right the national government is going to bear the brunt well folks the national government means you and me because we are talking about taxes from the taxpayers i i mean revenues which are going to be paid by you and me and expenditures on the people that are supposed to be spent on you and me so the first thing that can be said about this memorandum of economic policy about this particular measure is sobra naman ang kanilang pagkahigpit  why do i say that because as far as comparisons with other countries are concerned the really the government deficit the national government deficit is less than the average deficit of countries of a comparable size comparable income comparable debt structure etcetera  we have actually less why we did not fight for a uh for a more uh for a less contractionary policy is something again that is beyond me because mexico in nineteen eighty-six was given an i m f program with a deficit of g n p of the national government of mexico of more than fifteen percent  binigyan pa sila   e tayo e we are being asked to decrease our deficit from three point eight percent of g n p national government to one point eight percent of g n p and you say well so what that 's two percentage points let me tell you how that deficit is going to be decreased there are ways and ways of decreasing deficits one by increasing revenues and the other by decreasing expenditures but even in increasing revenues there are ways and ways of increasing it and in decreasing expenditures also the problem is we are increasing revenues the wrong way and we are decreasing expenditures the wrong way wrong in the sense that it is going to be down or be inimical to not only the development targets of the philippines in the short term which is this year but also in the medium and long term why do i say it 's the wrong way revenues they say uh you 've got to increase your revenues therefore until and unless congress passes all these alternative measures you have got to introduce or to impose an import levy of nine percent folks a nine percent import levy is essentially a sales tax it is an indirect tax we have been fighting since nineteen eighty-six to try to reform the tax structure of the philippine economy so that it is less regressive and more progressive we do not like the regressivity of the tax structure because it is more burdensome to the poor so we have been fighting since nineteen eighty-six to increase this progress uh a this progressivity of the tax structure and in one fell swoop we are bringing it back to what it was in nineteen eighty-six it is as if all our efforts at reforming a uh a tax structure at implementing it very much needed structural change in the economy which is to increase the equity of the economy has just been completely neutralized by this one revenue measure
Philippines	thank you very much for your very kind uh introduction mr enrico villanueva incoming president of uh this very prestigious student organization clapping laughter  that introduction i 'm happy to note did not sound like a campaign speech laughter  may i address uh your respected dean dean lydia echauz and also dean edralin as well as uh all the other members of the faculty and i also greet uh nike mora who wrote me the letter that will be today 's forum today and uh also to thank the entire administration of the de la salle university i say this because for the last uh eleven years i have been supporting this fora here in the de la salle university  my daughter is graduating from high school at alabang and by the way margie my daughter i don't know if she 's around here i told her to sneak in even if she 's uh only a high school student  nandiyan ka ba margie laughter  uh she was asking me to do her a favor  sabi niya papa pakisilip mo naman yung results ng examination ko laughter talagang gusto kong pumasok uli sa la salle for uh college anyway ladies and gentlemen i was asked to speak on the subject of insurgency and i am fully prepared to do that for the next one hour and a half with all of these materials that were brought by my assistants in uh two suitcases laughter  but uh perhaps since insurgency is uh really one of the many manifestations of uh basic conditions that exist in our country today you might want me to talk about other matters pertaining to other threats to our security situation that includes not only the communist insurgents but also the muslim secessionists in the south and also the military rebels some of tho some of whom uh you may know or maybe your friends uh no reaction 3 words laughter  as well as maybe the gulf war and its implications on the philippine situation but anyway uh whatever be the subject you might want me to branch into later on let 's bring that out in the open forum but on the insurgency first of all let us look at the our government structure to cope with the basic problems of philippine society i think if we can start from that since uh as i understand this group is very socially conscious and that one of your uh mandatory subjects is a social outreach program uh let me just show you that uh our philippine government now under the aquino administration uh surely because of lessons learned from the edsa people 's revolution of nineteen eighty-six has seen to it that we attend to the basic causes that have led to various problems and difficulties in our country so uh alex would you kindly show the flow not clear could be whole chart so very quickly let me just say that uh as identified by most uh social and political scientists that the basic problems of our country arise from the poverty of a great number of our people also ignorance ignorance not only in terms of the lack of education but also the lack of communications coming from the authorities to the masses of the people to inform the citizenry of what 's going on in the country injustice of course which has many forms fear and apathy arising precisely out of insurgency and uh criminality and secession and even rebellion graft and corruption the favorite subject of uh miriam santiago defensor as well as also my favorite subject together with many others and uh we have recently added overpopulation with no offense meant to anybody especially here in the de la salle university but uh as you can see poverty appears there as the biggest of them all estimates show that uh about fifty to fifty-five percent of the filipino people now in early nineteen ninety-one fall below what is known as the poverty line and this is reflected in many many physical manifestations out there in the streets but also in many other ways which are not readily visible to the ordinary observer such as the poor health of our children the uh lack of opportunity and social mobility on the part of uh many of our youth as well as also the uh unemployment and underemployment of many of our people anyway to attend to these problems our government has devised a uh two track system the two tracks of the railroad as we say which would lead to a better future for the filipinos especially the young filipinos and these are the twin tracks of economic development and peace and order and security  now let me explain this chart which shows the inter-agency linkages in government as well as with the private sector to achieve socio-political economic reforms and goals all of which are to be protected by the military and the law enforcement authorities throughout the entire process of reform and change uh first of all uh with the president at the very top there there is the socio-economic development side which is the which are the red blocks at the national level of course there 's the president she 's the chairman of the national economic development authority or neda then down below we have the regions there are fourteen regions in this country twelve numbered regions and then the national capital region which is metro manila and the cordillera administrative region which is out there in the mountains on the north now at the regional level we have a regional development council which attends to the coordination of uh the various programs of the various line agencies in government and this means public works health decs transportation communication uh etcetera  now each regional development council is advised by what they call a regional development assembly which is uh the body that consists of the elected officials in the region senators congressmen and representatives of the uh most respected non-government organizations so as you can see right away the people represented by n g o 's are represented now at the provincial level we have the p d c chaired by the governor and then down at the city and municipal levels the city extra-development council headed by their mayors and on down to the barangay and then to the people hitting and working against these basic conditions of philippine society that have given rise to our various problems be they social economic political or military now on the other side we have the security and the peace and order council system again the president heads this in her capacity as the commander-in-chief of the armed forces as well as of all other armed forces in the country meaning the philippine national police at the national level there is the national chairman which is who is the secretary of the department of the interior and local government secretary luis t santos and uh yours truly is the national vice-chairman now there 's also a regional peace and order council headed by either a regional director or a provincial governor who is elected by his peers at the region then more importantly again a provincial council headed by the same governor of that province who is also the chairman of the development side and then again the city and concerned mayors down to the barangays to the people again hitting these basic problems now facilitating these two tracks of the railroad harmonizing them coordinating them is the so called cord system cord meaning cabinet officer for regional development cough  i am the cord for region nine i don't know whether any of you know where region nine is uh there is an ateneo university there in region nine but no de la salle laughter  uh this is in zamboanga and uh there are five provinces in that region zamboanga del sur zamboanga del norte basilan sulu and tawi-tawi it 's probably the most difficult region to work in because you have there the secessionist movement you have the c p p n p a then you have the problem of just being so far away from the center of action which is manila anyway you might wonder where you belong in this entire set-up well you as young citizens from the private sector are in in are in all of these levels you are either yourself a member of the community in the barangay where you live whether it be a barangay in las pi&ntilde;as or alabang or uh here in uh manila itself or as someone represented by any of the non-government organizations that have memberships in all of these various components and elements of our government system to uh attend to these problems and so uh i thought that it is important for me to show that you are right here you are in the people portion you are in the barangay portion you are in the city and municipal levels as concerned citizens and uh surely as students of our social and economic milieu in the philippines in nineteen ninety-one you must constantly inquire into how is it in your community how is it in your neighborhood how is it in your municipality how 's my mayor doing because what i shall tell you later on are some of the things that they are expected to do so that we shall have a better condition of security and development in our country now uh may i just show you also by way of backgrounder our national defense system in the country there are three levels here the biggest one which is the basic and to me the most important layer is what we call the civilian volunteer organizations or bantay bayan  this has many names barangay tanod bantay bayan nakasaka c b o neighborhood association etcetera  and then uh let me go back to that later on and then we have the so-called territorial forces these are elements that are found in all of our towns and cities that 's why they 're called territorial  and these are mainly the police and what we call the cafgu or the uh units of the reserve force of the armed forces that are on duty to provide protection of their respective neighborhoods and then uh thirdly the mobile forces of the armed forces of the philippines with brigades battalions uh naval uh patrol 1 word of uh helicopters and fighter planes those of you who are in the r o t c or c m t are familiar with uh these units that we call the mobile forces now the uh civilian volunteer organizations are unarmed they are not really expected to fight as combatants but they do provide services that are important to the safety and the security of the community such as information services information about strange happenings or strange people or strange uh movements in the community and uh also they provide emergency services medical fire-fighting uh etcetera  now you will note that they are surrounded by the people without that sea of people around them none of these elements will be effective at all you 'll also note that these three elements are interlocking and overlapping and that 's because they do overlap in their functions but more importantly they are interlocked as a integral chain of defense for our safety and security now the uh system operates in a certain manner which is what we call the four steps method or the four step operational strategy in the field uh suppose there is a barangay let 's say here in laguna near the mountains that is still affected by the insurgents or by the communist ideology and there are armed elements therein  what happens insofar as government actions are concerned first of all there must be a clearing phase  dapat e labanan natin kaagad yung mga n p a who are armed so that they can be ejected from that barangay  this is the clearing phase and here we use our most capable units our mobile forces battalions uh strike companies etcetera  and after the clearing has been done the same barangay must be held and protected so that the uh armed enemy does not come back again and then beyond that a consolidation phase and this is where some of your efforts can contribute to the welfare of a community when you go out there to uh provide medical assistance for instance you are really taking part now in the consolidation phase which leads to the final phase which is the full development of the barangay  that is when uh twenty-four hour electrification is provided uh a good water supply system is uh put in place and maybe there is a nice schoolhouse with a full time teaching staff that would be established in the community at that point we consider the barangay to be fully developed
Philippines	uh the title of my lecture is the same title of the book that uh isabel read in the introduction unfortunately that book is not available in the philippines however those of you who are interested in uh reading in greater detail what i 'll be talking about there 's a uh filipino version uh it 's in english but this is the philippine edition of the book and it can be obtained in u p 'no  uh i 'm also not going to lecture i 'm going to try to make this a little bit more informal okay uhm i will be talking to you about the results of a study we conducted a couple of years back about the cognitive consequences of literacy and i 'd like to uh acknowledge the cooperation of my research associates uhm mariano santo domingo who is uh with the u p diliman and uh edith lianne pe&ntilde;a who is now a graduate stude  what we were trying to study well the motivation for doing this study was to look at the effects of literacy pa particularly non-formal literacy programs in marginal communities in the philippines by marginal i mean these are economically disadvantaged communities usually found in the very far-flung areas very remote from the urban areas uh and the the communi there there are several such communities in the philippines and for the study we selected five within the luzon area and these are uh of different uh types of communities meaning some were agricultural some were uh fishing communities some were urban poor communities and so on and what we wanted to look at was basically what was the effect of having non-formal literacy programs these are usually adult literacy programs on the way the people in these communities think about their lives think about their livelihood and think about the world it was originally intended to be a case study although uhm my my training in uh cognitive science uh predisposes me to more experimental and quasi-experimental approaches  somehow the study evolved to become a quasi-experimental study involving more more cut-and-dried variables so to speak what we ended up actually trying to answer was the following question i apologize it turns out the it 's probably not going to be very clear referring to powerpoint presentation  uhm it says there what are the effects of literacy acquisition on thinking processes this is a very broad question you know it can be answered in many different ways but what we wanted to find out was when one becomes literate what happens to the way he or she thinks now this question has actually been addressed by many many different other researchers mostly people who study literacy people in uh who study cognition in literacy in particular because some people have argued that literacy has an effect in changing the way we represent information about the world i i 'll talk about this uh in a while uh there 're many many different versions of that proposition and an important distinction we have to make is between the so-called direct and indirect effects of literacy on the way people think when we say there is a direct effect the actual process of acquiring literacy in and of itself transforms the way you look at the world uh a very im the most popular version of this is proposed by uh maybe bruner is familiar to you uh cole early on was saying talking about things like this  the idea was that shifting from the oral to the written mode of representing information allows the mind now to become more flexible in terms of handling the information just think about it if there is no printed word everything we have to know has to be stored in memory and the there will be a greater primacy on oral information and if you think about it in old civilizations those with uh no litera literary tradition most of the uh most complex forms of information were stored in things like narratives uh songs 'no long ballads epic ballads and so on these were not all almost always they were not written down and they were passed on from generation to generation by actual uh rehearsal and practice and actual experience it 's not something that they put in stones so to speak and put in a library 'no  on the other hand when things started coming to print it achieves ideas start having some degree of permanency you fixed it on paper and what that does is it frees up according to some theoreticians it frees up what we call cognitive capacity or your cognitive resources suddenly the ideas don't have to be here all the time they can be on paper and so your mind can do other things so that 's the direct hypothesis that the act of acquiring literacy and ability to represent information on print in print rather allows the mind to start operating in different ways there are indirect ways by which literacy can also affect the mind and uh simply there are this means that literacy first affects something else and then that something else affects the way you think so uh it may be that literacy for example changes the way people live literacy might change the way information is uh handled by a community and that doesn't necessarily require uh uh a direct transformation in the way people think but because there are important transformations in the way the community now handles information people come to think of information in different ways as well so you see this effect of literacy on thinking is more mediated and uh we all wanted to find out whether literacy does have a direct or indirect or maybe both effects on the way people think uhm this was an important question to answer particularly since we 're looking at marginalized communities because in these communities literacy practices were uh to use a more uh recent term were not yet technologized  they were not yet institutionalized in the communities uhm and you can even say that literacy practices were marginalized in most of these communities  as you would expect in these communities literacy rates were low but there were literate people in these communities there were even high school college graduates in these communities but you can imagine that uh in these communities literacy is not the most important thing to have in order to survive and succeed in that community in fact most of in some of the communities those who were highly literate worked outside the community because there were no opportunities to capitalize on their literacy skills within the community themselves i will give you a little bit more description on the communities in a little while what we tried to do uh what what we did to answer this question was uh we looked at the communities and found participants who were either illiterate or literate uh we also looked at people who acquired literacy using two different modes those who acquired it through the formal educational system and those who acquired it through non-formal education uh programs 'no  so that was a very broad category uh they might have participated in non-formal livelihood cum literacy education programs a lot of which were sponsored by decs the b n f e in that area in fact all of the areas we looked at there was a bureau of non-formal education literac adult literacy program which was tied up with uh a livelihood program others acquired their literacy skills on their own by reading comics uhm those who acquired literacy formally you we the cut-off was they must have been in formal education at least until grade six because previous research shows that if there 's reversion to illiteracy it 's usually around grade four or grade five so we felt that making grade six as the cut-off was the was quite safe uhm the the non-literates or the illiterates were those who did not acquire literacy uh and we usually relied on self-reports and they a uh key informant in the community to determine this if you 're concerned uh uhm just linking it to dr davis 's paper a while ago we did not uh we used a very low level definition of literacy here we were not defining literacy in terms of functional or higher level literacy it was really being able to uh process printed words okay uhm you might be worried that uh about whether we were sure whether the participants were actually literate or not uh you know especially illiteracy is not something we would feel comfortable uh ad uh talking about but surprisingly the people in these communities were not that apprehensive about saying whether they could read or write or not 'no  we only had maybe two or three cases where the participants claimed to be literate but actually were not and uh we were able to find out because of the key informants 'no  in these communities everyone knows everyone else okay uhm aside from well the idea was we were going to compare how the literates and the non-literates would perform in certain cognitive tasks to find out whether literacy does make a difference or not okay we also i said i mentioned we looked at the mode of literacy acquisition a very important variable that uh we looked at  something we were not thinking of looking at initially was the degree of literacy integration in the community others would call this the the extent to which literacy was technologized in the community the idea here is that each community integrates literacy practice to varying degrees you can imagine metro manila is a very literate community 'no  almost everything we do involves some form of literacy practices you know uh when we go uh go shopping in the supermarket we have to read labels we have to be able to find out what are the prices of uh things we have to be able to read signs we have to fill out forms you know taxes you have to be able to read to fill complete tax forms  almost everything we do requires reading in metro manila well for most people but imagine uh an agricultural community or a fishing community where most people have to deal with the elements of nature to earn a living uh people don't regularly read newspapers if they do it will be tabloids 'no  uh it 's not an integral part of what people do 'no  parents don't usually read to their children uhm if at all children will only be required to read in school if at all there are books available uhm so you can imagine there are there 's a variance to the degree to which literary practices are important in a community all of the communities we studied were relatively low in terms of degree of literacy integration that is in none of the communities do we find the same degree of sophistication or technologization of literacy if you don't like the word technologize i will stop using it just tell me it 's easy to read but it 's hard to say uhm i will describe this variable in greater length when i talk about the communities finally we wanted to look at the range of cognitive processes uh conceptual understanding conceptual organization reasoning explanation the first three were al have always been implicated in studies looking at thinking and the mind in particular because the hypothesis the literacy hypothesis is always stated that literacy allows people to come to achieve more formal and abstract levels of thinking and this is most manifest in conceptual thinking that 's conceptual understanding conceptual organization and abstract reasoning that 's why we looked at these things okay you will see get a flavor of that in a while the communities we looked at uhm are as follows there 's this community in uh kiangan ifugao the s i l has done a lot of work at kiangan in particular we loo focused on a barangay uh barangay nagakadan uh which we say calling it a barangay for so those of you who are based in urban communities chuckle mi you might think it 's like a small thing but a barangay in kiangan is several mountains you know uh so it 's like actually quite encompassing uh it has a very low literacy rate uh unique to this community was the fact that we only got illiterates and formal literates there were no non-formal literates in this community
Philippines	uh it 's always good to come home whenever people ask me uh they always like to ask uh o how are you doing how 's everything and then they they try to bait me into making a comparison between de la salle and u s l s audience laughs  of course i will never buy it i simply say well you know i work professionally at de la salle but i only have one home so that will never change audience claps  okay uh when eli wrote me uh i was i really had no hesitation to to accept this invitation  'cause i think it 's good for us to to come together and and just i think the mere act of of reflecting and trying to make sense of what we are experiencing as a people 'no and uh also trying to deal with sometimes honestly you know extreme feelings of uh frustration and sometimes even almost despair at you know what is happening  because uh i think those of us who are old enough remember that when we went through that after we went through and we got over the edsa experience and the marcos dictatorship i think we thought that was it 'no  we were looking forward to uh uh i guess a quiet and nice peaceful existence uh of course cory 's term i think that woke us up early enough that it wasn't going to be that uh ramos 's term we uh i guess we were sort of lulled into almost a false sense of security because things seemed to be looking up then when the nineteen uh ninety-eight elections came i think you know what some of us did uh myself i broke an old vow i promised never to get involved in partisan politics because of the obvious uh difficulties it could present to our institutions but i broke that and you know why 'no   because i had a tremendous fear uh that if this popular candidate would win we would be in for a very very difficult period 'no   but after he won okay again i threatened to go into exile but i did not  uhm instead i think like most filipinos uh who believe in the constitutional process i said let us see let us give this administration a chance so we did that we tried to work as as much as we could with the uh estrada administration uh you even know that i made a rather unpopular decision which cost me heavily uh it can be told now when i agreed to accept an appointment in this so-called constitutional convention the concord 'no uh i was told later on that some of our faculty members at de la salle uh actually wanted to ask for my resignation because of that involvement of course it never got to that and we went through it and i guess you know it 's history now concord was shelved for the record i would still like to say though that if we had given that a chance i think it could have helped the country a lot but the timing i guess was not right uh basta many factors so it 's all of those the work we did for about four months i don't know if you ever found time to read that 'no the proposed amendments to the constitution but i think they would have helped a lot especially in terms of uh encouraging what foreign investments in the country uh in terms of correcting the flaws there were some real flaws in the nineteen eighty-seven constitution but right now well that has been shelved and has since been overtaken by events but the point i 'm trying to make is that as i said like most uh filipinos i wanted joseph estrada to succeed especially and i would pray hard for him to succeed okay and i really wanted him to succeed   but in the end i guess when this whole thing blew up uh what last october when the uh you know as as the revelations started to come out initiated by governor singson and now as we hear more and more in the senate then i guess it 's sort of my worst fears were were just were were were borne out and therefore there is really if there was any doubt there 's really no more doubt in my mind that uh the best thing for the president really is to resign and that 's why when this broke out if you would remember de la salle manila was the first i think the same day that u p came out with its statement uh we came out with the statement calling for the president to resign and uh since then i think like you uh we 've been watching the impeachment and uh well we can talk about this maybe during the open forum if you have questions but anyway i watch the same uh t v channels you watch  although i guess i just have one advantage i was able to physically attend uh some of the senate hearings 'cause i wanted to see directly how the senators would behave to see and uh get a sense a feeling of where uh they are going to to vote 'no  so this is where we are now and uh i 'd like to uh just analyze the situation with you a a little more uh deeply if we can 'no  so the current situation is that there is an impeachment trial going on uh now on its what fourth week depending how you count fifth week depending on how you and as the evidence comes out for us non-lawyers i think all we look at is the substance 'no   uh although it 's fantastic uh again i said as i watch this i knew it i should have been a lawyer audience laughs i said i would have made a very good lawyer because so many things that you know are so obvious to me you know and to some people  but as a non-lawyer uh i mean the substance to the evidence in this court it just simply confirms 'no the the unbelievable extent of the greed and the corruption of this man 'no  uh you know one witness after another uh especially the more credible witnesses just telling stories that make you quite frankly sort of ashamed that you 're a filipino you know that you have a president who you know would do these things resort to these things so however i think like you we also realize that uh this is gonna be tough many people uh especially the hard-nosed uh what uh observers from the very start have said you know uh he 's going to be acquitted in spite of the preponderance of the evidence and they give you uh many reasons for that 'no  uhm number one all he needs is what eight senators to to acquit him and it seems we know who they are now there are others also that uh are sort of borderline maybe you can count about eight senators also who are definitely going to convict him and some in between 'no  but the numbers are certainly in the president 's favor plus the cough of course it 's still unconfirmed rumor but uh you you know in manila when the rumor persists i think you can almost be sure there is something to it and the rumor one rumor really that refuses to go away is that a billion pesos you know has been set aside to make sure that these eight senators will get handsomely rewarded for a verdict of uh acquittal 'no  so those are the stakes that we are uh in a sense that we are up against so the economy let 's look at the economy the current situation uh about a month ago a month and half ago i talked to one of the highest ranking finance officials of the government and uh well because i was trying to persuade him among others to resign  but he told me his reasons for not wanting to resign and i said okay so i listened and i didn't want to argue with him 'no uh but the most important information that he gave me was this that was last i talked to him in november and at that point he said brother we only have the government has money for the next five months we can run the government up to march the senate had been able to borrow some some monies but after march if nothing gives if there would be no significant changes okay the the economy will really be a very very serious problem cough  the i i think again you don't have to be an economist to realize the the macropicture uhm i think foreign loans have stopped i think the world bank i m f cough i think they would not give us any new loans until this political crisis is resolved somehow uh foreign investors uh are are not coming in if anything they 're pulling out and of course big business and this is critical 'no  almost all of the major business leaders uh makati business club and even the very you know the conservative uh p c c i 'no uh have withdrawn their support for this administration so with all of these factors the economy again of course uh if you listen to the economists uh marami silang mga projections which probably are are true they 're saying when you put all of it together what are they saying our first two quarters next year pwede pa 'no  they claim that we would not yet really feel the the really ill effects meaning uh rise in unemployment uh rise in inflation okay uh  so all the indicators they feel will hit us in the third quarter that 's what they 're saying and recession if it 's going to set in would uh set in maybe in the second half of next year uh so that 's the state of the economy and what is clear what is clear at least from from where where i sit is that there is no turning back as far as some of these key players are concerned parang wala na 'no  uh as every day that president estrada continues in office you know will lead to this you know will lead to the further deterioration of the economy that 's the situation okay so let 's just take a closer look at uh what are the questions  the first question the question i 'm often asked is so what 's gonna happen brother is is he going to be uh would would the president uh be able to survive this will he stay on in power or would he be removed i think it 's important to look at the key factors contributing to either his his removal or his stepping down from power what uh versus his continuance uh i think the critical factor that could lead to either his his impeachment his conviction or his resignation is really public opinion now this is i think eli was trying to make this point 'no that the president must get the very clear message that the public opinion you know increasingly would call for his stepping down from power now how do you communicate that to him well there are many ways uh but in the end it 's going to be public opinion it will also be public opinion that will that could tilt the balance among the senators don't forget i think about five of them are going to run for re-election uh many of them are planning to stay in politics and only a few are are not going to uh continue in politics  the senators of course they are very sensitive and this has already been tested many times if you 've fo if you 've been following there were many times that we were not sure how the vote would go for example remember when the defense panel was trying to block the testimony of uh clarissa ocampo in the end i think the senators called for a meeting called for a caucus and they unanimously decided to allow clarissa uh because of public opinion i think nothing else 'no because i think they knew if they had somehow blocked her testimony uh you know they would have had a lot of explaining to do to the public okay uh another factor that could still lead to his uh uh conviction in in the senate the quality of the witnesses if you notice the first batch of witnesses were all most of them are connected with chavit singson 'no and most of them are somehow related to him or working with him so parang pwede mong sabihin well they have you know you could question their their what their their credibility because of their connections with singson
Philippines	thank you very much mrs chavez fellow victims of both man-made and natural calamities  i 'm not very much really for uh monologue i 'm more in favor of dialogue but let me set the tone before we dialogue  we cannot even begin charting the future of this country unless we look at it in the long view in a global perspective because mark my words well within your lifetime you will see a borderless world this was experimented after the second world war in europe and now you have this very efficient unit european economic community that will soon extend from the iberian peninsula all the way to siberia the united states of america cognizant of how potent this economic community will be and how efficient it will be is not only opening north to canada in spite of all the labor protestations they 're opening south to mexico and very soon you will see an an american economic community from the north to the south pole here in the philippines we sit in the middle of half of the world 's potential market because in the asia-pacific we have half of the population of the world we sit in the middle of the fastest growing economies in the world and so the significance of a borderless world the efficiency of mass production economies of scale with all the modern technologies that are coming into place will accelerate and will put us at a very good vantage point it is at this point in time therefore that we should identify the areas where we enjoy the best comparative advantages and we have many of that if cebu has succeeded although we are nowhere near where we want to be it is because the cebuanos have identified this at a very early stage perhaps out of necessity because among the eight major islands we are the poorest and we are the most densely populated per square kilometer if i succeeded in doing anything in cebu it 's putting it together and accelerating it but by far the credit goes to our people our brothers and sisters in cebu and very little of it will i admit was my doing  but before we can join this community of nations and benefit from the advantages of open borders we have to get our house in order first and there are certain rules without exception that we must begin to realize let me begin with cebu it is the only major island where the demography has moved from agriculture to services and manufacturing because this rule is without exception nations where the greatest number of hands are dedicated to the production of food are the nations least capable of feeding themselves think about it the u s a the most mature economy in the world only has three percent of its population dedicated to the production of food and yet they feed not only all of america but a lot of people in russia in china in japan all over the world as well but to say that we must industrialize is not to say that we should abandon agriculture because the only source of industry is land it accelerates and increases the efficiency of agriculture when a nation industrializes and it frees many hands when you 're efficient in the manufacturing sector to go into the higher ends of income which would be services to illustrate it is a bad example but it 's the only one i have in my pocket to illustrate these are nineteen eighty ballpark figures but i 'm sure they are not far from where it is today in this pack of cigarettes it is an agricultural product because it 's tobacco but in this pack there are four cents worth of tobacco  packaging the paper the filter the paint whatever is eighteen cents and advertising to sell this product is twenty-two cents it 's a bad product and yet it sells but what am i trying to say if the philippines is to become only an agricultural country and the manufacturing or the processing and the selling will be done by other countries and they source their raw material from here all we get is the four cents  you know i 've often wondered uh when i was in the private sector i 'm only i 'm only in government for three years why the philippines a democracy a free market economy very high literacy rate we certainly have the human infrastructure was so far behind left so far behind by our other democratic countries in the globe  see to me i view government function as nothing but a continuous process of sourcing of funds and application of funds and when i made an analysis i found out two things one that our so-called democracy is a myth democracy only in form but certainly not in substance let me explain first let us go to the sourcing of funds government has three visible sources and one invisible source the visible sources are income or taxes derived from income we have beautiful laws they 're almost as beautiful as the most perfect form of government the communist system but it doesn't work for the same reason communism doesn't work the human factor the human element our laws are the most socially equitable the higher your income the more you 're supposed to pay you have the brackets and the formulas but what 's happening in actuality the ones who are carrying the burden of income taxes are the salaried class and the ones who should pay the most really pay the least because of the human element or factor in other words it is beautiful only on paper so we go to the next sourcing of funds and that is taxes derived from imports or duties and customs while it is a good way of sourcing funds there is a cap or a limit to what we can charge to this initially it is a good protection to the local industries in order for them to be able to grow and compete but in excess it is an encouragement for inefficiency and in the end it is the consumer that suffers so there are pluses and minuses in the sourcing of your money for government from income from import and so we go to the next which is the big controversy now the income from consumption this may not be the most socially equitable but the theory here is that when it is taxed from consumption the more you consume the more you pay and it does discourage waste in consumption and you have seen how gasoline consumption in the philippines plunged by twenty-five percent when they upped the price and you must remember oil is a product we don't produce locally this is a very controversial issue but i stand publicly and squarely with jess estanislao against all the politicians who want to take the position of what is popular and what i say is this if they take back position because they don't understand economics that 's bad but if they take that position because they understand economics but they want to take the popular stand that 's even worst and this i will try to illustrate to you the necessity in the next area by comparing it to the next area of sourcing of funds the invisible tax what i call the criminal tax of borrowing the money and deficit spending you see you we have a budget today of three hundred billion pesos it is anticipated that government will collect only one hundred and eighty billion in taxes so the government will have to borrow a hundred and twenty billion to be able to cover the budget we have these three visible taxes one the invisible now let me illustrate to you why to me this is a criminal tax you see when government goes into deficit spending every man woman and child in this country pays for it equally including the unborn when i used to go to school and a few professors here as well we used to pay ten centavos for a coca-cola you remember this now now you guys and gals there are paying five pesos maybe for it that four ninety is the tax you are paying now for fiscal irresponsibility overspending by government in those years where you were not even born yet and you are paying for it now  now when you say and demonstrate to bring down the prices of fuel and make uh you will of course note that none of those were in the edsa revolution these two groups but when you go around are you really doing the poorest of the poor a favor you know these are special interest groups transportation groups labor groups etcetera yes they consume some some of that oil but who speaks for the native in mount pinatubo who never consumed a drop of that oil who speaks for the jobless who don't need transportation rides to jobs because they have no jobs who speaks for the farmer who hardly consumes that fuel and that is the greatest mass of this country and if it is not sourced from consumption then everyone pays equally as you are paying for it now for something that was spent even before you were born and that is the equation  so they 're barking at the wrong tree because where we should be barking is towards congress and the administration and i say not only this but all administrations past have been irresponsible fiscally because of deficit spending that is the area that we should eliminate let me at this point go therefore after discussing with you the sourcing of funds of the national government to the area of application of funds why do we need such a huge budget of three hundred billion pesos i think this is where the biggest defect is and this is where the demonstrations should be loudest in the government 's inability to apply those funds efficiently let me begin by the fact that government is involved in a lot of businesses and interventions into our economy where they have no business being there philippine airlines bankrupt you know you 'd have to pay the buyer money to take philippine airlines fertilizer plants that lose seven billion hotels and so on all these investments  break in the recording you know it is not break in the recording government involve itself in areas where the private sector are more efficient  in break in the recording privatize to the extent possible what now the government is doing including education because it is proven that private education has had much much more quality and is much much more efficient  second local autonomy you know what i call imperial manila want to hold on to those powers and to that money as if their dear lives depended on it i do not want to impute malice but let us just say that if they wanted to construct two school rooms instead of one in the barangays in cebu if they just gave those barangays the money for the same amount of money they could probably build two or three more rooms than they are doing it now when it is centrally handled by the d p w h again this is human nature they are never going to see or use those roads those water systems those schoolhouses and so they couldn't care less that 's just a piece of paper in front of them i can give you a million examples but what we did in cebu is we just in case of national highways i just threw out d p w h you know when i came to office they had already awarded the cebu south link that would have linked us to tagbilaran bohol and uh dumaguete negros with a beautiful highway so that we could have expanded our uh our industries to those areas because distance is relative to time travel and cost of travel the bidding was in nineteen eighty-six to this day we 're nineteen ninety-one the accomplishment is less than thirty percent by the same token the province of cebu had an a cementation project longer stretch in the west coast and in the north theirs was asphalt ours was cement we bidded this in march of nineteen eighty-nine in march of nineteen ninety total completion you know it 's not just the cost our cost will probably be only a third of what it will cost the national government when they finally if they finally finish that project the opportunities lost is what is more expensive in other words the economic activity that would have occurred if this highway were to have been completed linking the richest agricultural island in the republic to the number one industrial island so i won't give you any more examples i think that is quite enough but before you go to sleep let me tell you let me break this with a joke you know this professor from university of la salle is very fond of experiments and uh one day he caught a grasshopper right out there where you have your grass and experimented on a grasshopper  he put it on the table and ordered it to jump so the grasshopper jumped takes the grasshopper removes one leg puts it on a table he orders it again jump lopsided but it still jumped takes it he removes the last leg from the grasshopper he puts it on the table and he orders it to jump jump of course it wouldn't jump so prognosis he writes in his book after you remove two legs from a grasshopper it suffers from hearing impairment laughter  these are the solutions that our government has been giving us from time immemorial  you know to me even how difficult the situations are you can always find a way to veer away from the normal and if there are any people who have succeeded in doing this the cebuanos have we have pretended now there is no national government and we 're proceeding on our own full steam  let me show you a few transparencies on how we perform after we gained six basic freedoms
Philippines	uh ladies and gentlemen good afternoon uhm even before coming here i was expecting the kind of treatment i was going to get from your present president and i have been faulted for two reasons the first thing i have been faulted for is my past namely my having been at the ateneo all of my scholastic life practically uh the other one is of course being related to mr daland uh the ateneo i had a choice about my relationship to mr daland i had no choice about so i hope you will forgive me for one and tolerate me for the other uh if you will note this is the waldo perfecto hall uh the perfectos are ateneo boys in fact uh mr waldo perfecto was a former jesuit and uh he decided he was going to fulfill his duties to god by evangelizing and then he joined la salle laughter  so the process of evangelization takes uh many shapes and i suppose that 's one of the reasons why i 'm here enough of the nonsense uhm you are in business and that is good you are catholic businessmen or you should be catholic businessmen and that means it will be difficult to be good but neither being a businessman nor being a christian or a catholic or even just being a decent man is a justification for anything else except being a good businessman good at being a human being and good at being a businessman and being a general member of the community uh the the gentleman who introduced me i mean the gentleman who opened the the proceedings talked about uh honesty and business or the law and business that is so broad a field that i could write books on the darn thing and not be finished with it but the topic given to me uh in the letter from uh mr daland was with regard to the corruption in government whether there is any hope of minimizing it the title i think is rather well phrased in the sense that corruption like original sin or like the consequences of original sin cannot be abolished at best we can minimize hopefully we can live with it and if we are really lucky to live happily with the very little that there is insofar as graft and corruption in government will be concerned uh the issue of graft and corruption is both historical and psychological the political aspect of graft and corruption is mer merely consequential rather than caused the political situation can be sometimes a product rather than a cause for graft and corruption but that is neither here nor there it is almost as easy or just as difficult to talk about which came first like many other things that which came first let me then take off from a number of perspectives let me pull uh rank on you by age and tell you about how graft and corruption has been recorded not only in this country but elsewhere let me then take you to what i do and then take you finally and hopefully to what we can do maybe that will make a little sense uhm corruption is not a uniquely filipino weakness or fault government corruption is not uniquely filipino i hope undoubtedly we have been presented many examples of honesty and uprightness in different countries and as you look at these and then look at those countries you realize that graft corruption or dishonesty whichever way you want to call it takes or manifests itself in many different forms we are told for example that certain third world countries are replete with graft in all aspects of society whether in government in business or in any other generally accepted form of human endeavor including schools if you don't believe in graft and corruption just go to an examination room one any day and you will find that a form a budding form to say the least of graft and corruption is in process and apparently i would imagine as much in la salle as in the ateneo corruption in class is in good health thank you  perhaps is in good health no thank you  at all events uh insofar as government is concerned we are pointed to with references to honesty to japan to the european countries and even to the united states however i i submit to you that these examples are partially correct and serve only to demonstrate that these countries are filled with human beings and that for all of the external appearances of honesty they have their own forms of graft and corruption which they have carried on to a rather refined and very very prosperous enterprise japan we are told is the epitome of honesty in the sense that if you lose or leave a bag or any article in the japanese subway or on the bus you can generally find it within the same day or else in the next day at the at the headquarters or at the nearest offices of that particular bus company and this is probably true this is equally true of many other forms of honesty we are told in japan however japan is also the place of the yakuza  and the yakuza has a very viable and very fruitful relationship with the national police department of japan if you want you could go into business and think about it some more there is also the problem of stockholders' meetings as you might know if you don't know as you may have been told stockholders' meetings are places where the owners of the company both large and small may be heard may demand an explanation for certain matters of importance to the company and can demand explanations from the managers and the owner or the officers of that company and as you may have heard large corporations tend to be te tend to have raucous rowdy stockholders' meetings because there is always a group of stockholders that are out there to just exercise their lungs and generally give everybody else an uncomfortable time at the head table this apparently is something that never happens in japan for the very simple reason that before the stockholders' meetings the bosses talk to the hoodlums who come to the stockholders' meetings so that if anybody gets rowdy he gets surrounded and very gently taken out of the premises if you think that 's honesty you 're welcome to it but it 's not particularly something that you would like to point out as the epitome of civilization needless to say there are the the scandals that have rocked the business world in japan are current and quite often you can start with a large scale bribery from the sale of lockheed aircraft tri-star aircraft if any of you are interested to sell to japan a lot of kickbacks took place and it was not the japanese who complained it was discovered because the americans had to go over the balance sheets of lockheed corporation and they discovered that lockheed was paying off people in japan in europe and in different parts of the world graft and corruption does exist there graft and corruption of course exists in the united states where do you think we learned all of the ways to do things in the philippines and they continue to do it only because of the nature of the job because of the nature of how they do things it is has to be done in a more refined way needless to say in europe graft and corruption exists in its own way there is a lot of uh improprieties which take place in government which are being looked at and kept quiet about one of the more exciting things for you gentlemen who might indulge in the better life is that periodically in europe one of the greater and more profitable forms of corruption is to dilute or to mislabel wine  this is uh apparently a matter of large honor for many wineries for many vineyards in europe to be able to ascertain that a particular brand of wine does indeed come from a particular vineyard so that its quality can be maintained and the label will sell the wine but big rackets take place big frauds are discovered periodically in this respect governments have fallen because of the irregularities would you believe also in public works and in other forms of government activity so graft and corruption is not exclusively filipino neither is it a modern happening in the philippines we have had graft and corruption for as long as there has been recorded history and for all we know since even before recorded history there were filipinos who were human beings we can be almost certain that graft and corruption took place at that time as well but insofar as the philippines is concerned you will recall that recorded history in the philippines is a western staple that is to say when magellan came then they say recorded history in the philippines took place although those of you who know better will know that even before the entry of the spaniards before the entry of the european colonial masters there was history there was literature and there was organized government in this part of the world at all events one of the difficult problems at that time was how to bring into this administrative system that was known as the philippine colony that is that was the philippine colony of spain efficient administration and honest administration remember that at that time the entry to the philippines was motivated by two historical spanish facts one was religion the faith and the other was money  there was a great competition in europe at that time and the two maritime powers at that time were portugal and spain they divided the world by cutting by drawing a a line around the entire globe and said everything on one side belongs to spain everything on the other side belongs to portugal of course the dutch had not heard about this and the english had not heard about this so eventually they started coming around and deciding that the lines were drawn improperly or that they were going to ignore the lines at all events the philippines was peculiarly situated insofar as spain is concerned and since this is not going to be a lecture let us just moves away from the microphone  if you would look at your globe draws on the board that was meant to be complete circles equidistant from the center and of the same size if you don't think so at all events uhm you must assume that spain was on one part of the globe and the philippines is on the other side and the only reason why the spaniards got to the philippines was because somebody tried to prove that the world was round somebody else went ahead of him christopher columbus who was a genuine italian carrying the flag of spain and had landed alam ko na 'yung words na 'yan had landed in what he thought was india was the east so he crossed over to the atlantic and he went there of course the rest of the civilized the rest of the european world went there as well eventually spain took a very dominant position on the on the matter and almost word of southern the lower north america central america and south america became spanish or latin dominions in the meantime of course magellan had crossed over gone through the strait of magellan down to southeast afri south uh south america went all the way up and then landed in the philippines the point of it all was that at a certain time it was very easy it became quite easy and quite prosperous to go to latin america that was where gold was pizarro in peru and everybody else words plenty of booty for spain  for this reason there was very little reason there was very little cause for anybody to cross the pacific once more and come to the philippines  and therefore the people that came to the philippines were a very limited group generally they would be people who 'd be highly motivated like priests and religious who would be burning with zeal to push forth christ among the dark worlds of the of the heathen which this part of the world was supposed to have been populated with but the bottom line was that unless you were highly motivated you would not come to the philippines the other people who would come to the philippines would be those who 'd want to advance their careers in spain and therefore choose hazard duty the third class was the kind of spaniard who had to get out of spain because he was running away from the police he was running away from the debtors or he was running away from his girlfriend 's family and if he went particul if he was particularly unfortunate and he went to the new world that would not be far enough and if he couldn't hide in the new world he would land in vera cruz cross over to acapulco and then take another boat to the philippines he had to be a fairly desperate man apparently to come to the philippines and very desperate men are very seldom honest men at all events the only interesting economic activity as far as the spanish colonialism in the philippines is concerned was the galleon trade and the galleon trade was nothing else but a 1 word from acapulco to manila so that it could trade on spices silks and silver with china and everything was a business was a matter of making percentage on what the costs were so the entire principal economic activity of spain in the philippines for a long long time was concentrated in manila and as happens to these things graft and corruption became rather rampant in manila and in the philippines of course this couldn't happen for very long so what the spanish government one of the steps that the spanish government decided to adopt was this idea of having the incoming administration conduct an investigation on the outgoing administration the assumption would be that anybody who was unhappy who had objections to the way the government had been run on the last few years would now protest and present their complaints to the incoming administration who had no connections whatever and therefore would be able to render fair judgement
Philippines	thank you prof bala for that generous introduction i was beginning to wonder if i recognized myself from that introduction  dr sibayan sir greetings again and a happy birthday may you have many many more mrs sibayan and family bro andrew officers of administration and faculty of de la salle university fellow members of the linguistic society of the philippines donors of the chair staff of the uh s i l my commander-in-chief colonel ravina who is there laughter who said he was going to stay away this afternoon to spare me my nerves laughter and who had granted me all the space for my professional growth my one and only sister and sibling sis sibling and best friend dr purificacion valera quisumbing colleagues friends one and all good afternoon  i hope this paper is going to answer one question that uh dr bautista here asked me not so very long ago with all of that which nita enumerated she asked me where do you get time to do any research  i have not given you my full text i have given you only some sheets that will be central to my paper and to which i will refer you can follow follow me every now and then  when pressed for a title i took one week to play around with many possibilities and when the deadline was on me i had to dish out what you have there interlanguage and error analysis revisited  but it is most apropos  schumann in nineteen seventy-five proposed three variables in the growing interest on second language acquisition these are the why the how and the what of the learner the why consists of the affective variables that can be seen as initiators of second language learning and to which to a large degree regulate the extent of the learning the how are the cognitive operations that the learner performs on the target language input data the what referred to as the linguistics product are the linguistic results of the operations in terms of the particular grammatical forms the learner uses when he attempts to speak the target language  uh much earlier the first uh time i encountered this uh theory uh it was presented in three boxes with the why as the first box going into the second box which is the how and into the third box which is the what  a little earlier than schumann 's proposal selinker at an international conference in the late nineteen sixties nineteen sixty-nine introduced the notion of interlanguage and may i refer you to the first sheet there with the three circles  he later pursued this concept of interlanguage along with a new look at errors the term interlanguage is referred to by other names depending upon the viewpoint of the investigation of language learning it is called approximative system by nemser and transitional language by corder  if the investigation is viewed as developmental therefore dynamic it is called approximative system uh you have the other figure there which is linear  in the view if the view is of a particular point in time in a continuum it is more often called transitional language on the whole however the general term is interlanguage  now you can see that in that first that first circle there is supposed to be the native language of the learner with its own rules and the third circle which i which is language two or the target language also has its own rules now the circle in the middle which is the interlanguage is the uh circle i am i have sourced my uh data  it is that which has fascinated me for more than a decade this paper revisits the interlanguage of a group of filipino professionals it looks more closely at the what of the language user meaning the linguistic product of this group to do this in some detail and to arrive at an interpretation of why it is what it is the companion hypothesis called the new error analysis by richards as well as by selinker is here operationalized  this interlanguage refers to a separate linguistic system whose existence we are compelled to hypothesize based upon the observed output which results from the second language learners' attempted production of a target language norm it is a dynamic product of a psycholinguistic system along with this dynamic view selinker further expounded the notion of fossilization which he characterizes as a mechanism whereby speakers of a particular native language will keep certain linguistic items rules subsystems in the interlanguage no matter what amount of instruction they receive in the language two target language  related to this notion of fossilization is that of backsliding called regression which refers to the regular reappearance or reemergence in interlanguage productive performance of linguistic structures which were thought to be eradicated this he called an interlanguage norm not the interlanguage norm the reason being that an interlanguage norm refers to an individual learner 's development and not to an institutionalized code of a language community uh may i add here that when this i l theory first appeared and was tried out it was best found to work uh with individual learners when i used this for my dissertation i uhm thought perhaps that even if it were best to work for an individual learner 's uh language two and because of course i was having problems with my uh teaching and uh hunting witch-hunting for errors i thought perhaps that trying out this uh theory this hypothesis i would be able to come to some kind of a direction that would be not necessarily the interlanguage norm of filipino uh speakers of english but at least some kind of a norm especially for my students without having to say here definitely that the data here is an institunal institutionalized code of the filipino adult professional i posit however that the language investigation can establish some lang common language characteristics of the filipino bilingual professional who has not attained near-native professional proficiency and that is where i uhm i have culled my latest uh collection of these so-called errors which uh you also have in your handout  uh i have i will end this paper with a question of which i do not have an answer but which i think maybe you will help me provide an answer in due time the next time around uh the first time i tested this hypothesis was for my dissertation  i collected data from the written works of sophomore students at u p diliman who were taking their last g e english course  three sets of compositions from each student subject were examined a total of about two hundred twenty-five compositions were corrected by three professors the deviances or mistakes or lapses were identified and examined collected and classified according to a scheme suggested by selinker and richards  the next time around that i ex tested this hypothesis was with a sampling of college teachers across disciplines in some selected state colleges and universities around the country the findings of the first research were confirmed by those of the second and they seemed to hold in my present research  the subjects the subjects of this research are adult professionals also from different disciplines an added dimension to my earlier conclusions and insights had posed a question about the filipino bilingual professional that i will ask at the end of this report let me postulate that when a non-native speaker of english like the fini filipino adult in this study learns english as a second language may i uh refer you to that line there where you have the beginning of the line the learner one uh uhm language the native language speaker with l one and the end of that line the speaker of the tar target language excuse me who is which is english in our case  uhm so he moves through a series of intermediate stages in between his native language at one end and english at the other end this assumes that these stages are necessary way stations which the learner traverses if he expects to make progress in achieving proficiency and competence hopefully in the target language  errors are characteristics of these way stations  and they are the ones that have fascinated me all of these years error analysis used to examine identified lapses deviances of the adult professional subjects is not new as we teachers have engaged in it for all our professional lives but there is a significant difference between the old and the new and that 's the one that is intriguing it 's a little bit difficult because you just don't count uh the uh occurrences of these deviances and assign numerical uh grades to them and from my experience before i encountered this hypothesis just like everybody else and i think that that is exactly what 's still happening the more deviances mistakes you call errors the better for a grade for for a grade of five meaning uh failure  that 's what i called witch-hunting then  but my outlook has changed drastically since  uhm i even say that i have become more human in my teaching and in my outlook at errors since i encountered this uhm theory  the old error analysis looked at errors and classified them on a superficial basis  linguistic items were either omitted added substituted or reordered in spelling in grammar or in diction  and i have a table there the third one the third figure which shows which gives you a matrix of what we used to do or what we what most of us are still wont to do  these were labeled as such and accounted for  the total number of occurrences were assigned percentages the new look at errors was based on the c a theory  the contrastive analysis theory by the way attempted at describing a language with all its features and then comparing these with a target language equally and thoroughly described later it began to look like an impractical and formidalble mispronounced the word formidable task meanwhile the seeming impracticality or impracticability and formidability of the task showed the contrastive analysis' inadequacy at predicting and im explaining all learners' errors the strong version of this theory states that one could predict and describe the patterns that will cause difficulty in learning and those that will not cause difficulty this eventually could not however be sustained to determine competence and that is when the interlanguage theory and hypothesis came to being hence the introduction of the i l hypothesis and theory that refers to a system whose existence we are compelled to hypothesize based on the evidence of the language cough that the speaker-user is using meaning that which he has learned at a particular point in the course or in time and keep looking i keep uh inviting you to look at that line there which i said earlier uh is a line through which the learner traverses as he tries to attain proficiency and competence in the second language  the new error analysis is said to be more adequate for judging not only performance but more importantly competence that 's the old error analysis uh including that of the uh that was based on the contrastive analysis was said to be best to judge only performance and not competence and selinker with his i l had proffered the uh advantage of the new error analysis hypothes uh error analysis which is best to gauge competence  the new error analysis is said to be more adequate for judging not only performance as i said earlier but more importantly competence it takes off from the old by interpreting the errors from the viewpoint of knowledge of the language not knowledge about the language in the end the theories of both psycholinguistics and sociolinguistics enter into the judging or the decision-making on whether a sentence or an utterance is error-free or erroneous now you can see how it can be a little bit tedious to engage in this new error analysis hypothesis because there are certain assumptions from language acquisition as well as from sociology psycholing sociolinguistics that one has to have on hand or to be familiar about if he has to be able to make all the necessary inferences to judge the degree of erroneous uh of the erroneous sentences degree of errors  this new look at errors is a natural adjunct on second language acquisition it yields not only performance analysis but also error sources to gauge degree of competence thus the questions to put each superficially well-formed sentence through are shown in figure four
Philippines	 missing words microphone not on to be here although i must say i dreaded the thought of having to face uh language experts uh one reason being that uh i 'm not at all an expert in fact somebody one of the faculty members of u p 1 word said you have arrived you are now speaking before the linguistic society of the philippines she probably knows what sort of grades i got from the english department laughter  uh uhm the other reason uh as i said i 'm a chemist i 've never written anything on language and third as you probably know this is a very highly emotionally-charged issue and it 's like entering the lion 's den uhm when i was assistant to the president of the university of the philippines uh a few years back just before i became commissioner of the commission on higher education uh president javier gave me an assignment and that is to advise him on all the science and technology activities of the university he tried also to give me another assignment and that is to work with the uh linguists in the u p to put together a language program okay i said uh emil uh i i never retreat from work i i you know i work very hard uh i 've never refused my president whoever it was angara abueva and now you i 've never refused but this time please this is one job i don't want to do okay so you can understand now the only reason i 'm here is because brother andrew wrote me a little note and since i have worked with brother andrew for a long time and he has never refused me i cannot refuse him now laughter  uh may i now read my paper and uh i 've written a lot of papers uh uh but i 've never studied as hard as for this one laughter  i don't wanna make a fool of myself so i hope i won't today uh the language as i already said the language policy in education is a highly emotionally-charged issue and has been debated over several decades apparently without a final resolution uhm this paper will discuss the present language policy of the commission on higher education it must be made clear however that the ched is still relying on the old decs bilingual policy instituted in nineteen eighty-seven a reiteration incorporating some modifications on the one earlier issued in nineteen seventy-three when i received the invitation i talked with chairman alcala i said do we have a new policy and he said none so but i knew that you 'd throw me bodily out of this if if that 's all i 'm gonna tell you the constitutional and legal basis of the policy will be presented and the status of implementation discussed finally some recommendations will be made as basis of future action i must emphasize that these recommendations are not official ched policy but are purely my personal views on the matter some of them of course these some of these recommendations are already being done by ched so those and those will be mentioned accordingly what is the constitutional and legal basis of the present policy uh i don't wanna bore you with this but i 'm going to read it anyway section six of the nineteen eighty se and article whatever of the nineteen eighty-seven constitution provides that and i quote the national language of the philippines is filipino as it evolves it shall be further developed and enriched on the basis of existing philippine and other languages  i for those who haven't noticed it yet i changed the topic to language policy not english uh policy or whatever furthermore it states that and i quote again for the purposes of communication and instruction the official languages of the philippines are filipino and until otherwise provided by law english end of quote pursuant to this uh the congress passed a law creating the national language commission which undertakes coordinates and promotes research for the development propagation and preservation of filipino and other languages  uh the what is the present uh policy in the so called bilingual policy i will go through from the nineteen seventy-four so we will understand how this evolved on june nineteen nineteen seventy-four the department of education culture and sports issued department order number twenty-five mandating the use of english and filipino as media of instruction in philippine primary and secondary schools according to a set timetable  the purpose of the policy was for the philippines to become and i quote a bilingual nation competent in both filipino and english  at that time it was pilipino p and not filipino f filipino f and not pilipino p okay domains were divided into an english domain english communication arts mathematics and science and a pilipino domain which includes all the other subjects beginning in grade one for tagalog-speaking areas for school year nineteen seventy-four seventy-five and beginning in grade one for non-tagalog-speaking areas in school year seventy-eight to seventy-nine sorry about that it 's nineteen seventy-nine referring to mistake in transparency  note that by school year nineteen eighty-one eighty-two the shift of medium was to begin in all high schools however for the tertiary level institutions there was no set timetable but it said that by nineteen eighty-three eighty-four graduates from colleges and universities were supposed to be able to pass examinations in english and or pilipino for the practice of their professions i want to emphasize this because uh this is a major issue  the first uh bilingual policy was based on the nineteen seventy-three constitution when the nineteen eighty-six constitution was ratified the educa education department now called decs revised the bilingual policy which is now entitled the nineteen eighty-seven policy on bilingual education  in the nineteen eighty-seven uh b e p tertiary education institutions were now given a primary role in contrast to their relative freedom in the earlier version as i mentioned already in the earlier version they just said by such and such date the students should now be able to take the examination in this version now it says tertiary level institutions shall lead in the continuing intellectualization of filipino it 's now f  the program of intellectualization however shall also be pursued both in elementary and secondary levels  uh by the way i must confess that up to now i 'm still confused about the p and the f but the way i understand it p referring to pilipino is really mostly uh tagalog and and uh f referring to filipino would now incorporate more of uh the other languages and in fact has uh the the alphabet is a little bit uh includes other other letters  how about the implementation of the policy again i would like to review the implementation of the policy because the recommendations i 'm going to make which as i said are purely mine are based on what we have and what we can do okay i don't wanna dream and say i 'm going to do this tomorrow  to have an assessment of the effects of the bilingual education policy instituted in nineteen seventy-four a formal summative evaluation was made which covered the period nineteen seventy-four to eighty-five in nineteen eighty-six the six volume technical report bilingual education in the philippines prepared for the edu department of education culture and sports was completed this was done by a group of uh brother andrew the findings of the evaluation study on the implementation of the nineteen seventy-four bilingual education policy showed to what extent intents and purposes may have been realized also it must have provided the context within which the subsequent policy in nineteen eighty-seven was formulated the above-mentioned studies by gonzalez et al nineteen eighty-eight and segovia for the tertiary level on the implementation of the nineteen seventy-four policy was made and the following is a summary of the findings and i must confess to brother andrew we practically copied what he had there  i will not read everything uh but i will just like to point out a few things and uh okay for example number one language and language use pilipino is used often at that time it was still pilipino even in classes where english is supposed to be used exclusively the vernacular or local language is used only rarely that 's one quite important uh  now how about achievement again this is very important because uh generally the students did better in pilipino than in any other subject  this is still true up to now few students at all grade levels reach a point of being able to handle questions calling for higher cognitive functions the inescapable conclusion is that there is a real failure in achievement and indication of real problems in the system however uh okay uh down the bo at the bottom okay may maybe in the middle referring to the transparency the influence of the number of years of b e p on achievement in subject skills is negligible so these are some of the more important conclusions and lastly uh you can read the rest uh later on the popular na notion that pilipino negatively affects the learning learning of english is not borne out by the data correlations of test scores in pilipino and english with test scores in the three content areas araling panlipunan mathematics and science are all positive significant and mostly high so these are some of the more important conclusions uh there are more   pampahaba ng papel itong ginawa ni father an brother andrew  uh now number four uhm okay the impact of b e p and pilipino on test scores in general pilipino test scores and b e p seemed to be good for tagalog as uh i could imagine n c r and excellent public and private schools in learning mathematics and science thus favoring native tagalogs especially those in already excellent public and private schools learning was facilitated by pilipino while english was maintained and enhanced a decided advantage of tagalogs in urban communities  off the record we uh the u p uh uh i can't remember the year i was still vice-president at the time uh gave tests in both languages okay medyo nagkamali naparami 'yung pilipino  when when uh we looked at the results okay it turns out that all in all regions of the country what we did was we analyzed the results okay for english only uh tagalog pilipino only answers in english only answers in english and pilipino only and uh uh the mixture okay we studied all three and we looked the ones who passed the upcat were those who uh passed you know uh those who had higher grades in pilipino those who had higher grades in english and the combination so no one was disadvantaged anyway what we found out was except for n c r uh those who took pilipino had higher uh achievement in all the regions had incre you know we compared it with the previous prior years uh better uh scores in all regions of the country so we cannot say that uh the the tagalogs have and i have uh i think i have a reason it 's because uhm in in manila in n c r most of the most of many of the kids who take the upcat are from the private schools and the better high schools and they they are quite fluent in english so that 's uhm so you know  uh i 'm sorry uh  the findings forces us to rethink the basic objective the teaching and learning of pilipino it turns out that its contribution to the learning of content subjects even in araling panlipunan is minimal these are the studies in the elementary and high school oops transparency falls laughter sorry  uh and uh number six the transfer of english language skills between pilipino and english it shows increasing dependent on pilipino to learn english in the upper grades but decreasing dependence on english to learn pilipino uh so again that 's an interesting result of the study uhm  another one is that the non-b e p students those who were not following the uh policy in students in grade ten scored significantly better in english i just i can imagine that there were no significant differences in math and science while b e p students scored significantly better in social studies higher in pilipino a not expected result unexpected result because they were learning in pilipino uh  now since our interest is really in the tertiary level no for english the best predictor of achievement was science for pilipino social studies and english and for english pilipino was significant though a minor predictor the other thing that we learned from the upcat is that those who are good in science are also good in language and those who are good in language are good in both english or filipino  at the tertiary level it seems that uh b e p is not a priority at the college level considering that only slightly more than one third of the schools in the study implemented it this was in nineteen eighty-eight okay and it was a study from seventy-four to eighty-four most of the tertiary institutions that implemented it had no carefully designed comprehensive and long-range support system for its implementation implementation was more a perfunctory compliance than a desire to try b e p as a solution to the language-of-instruction problems in tertiary education generally moderately positive the attitudes of administrators faculty members and and students at best could mean simply openness to the policy or at worst an accommodation of it through lip service this is tertiary level on the one hand respondents perceived that pilipino can be a language of unity or national identity it may be pointed out however that one can be a nationalist even without communicating in pilipino i had a long argument last night with some of my relatives about this language policy
Philippines	good morning everybody i 'm sorry i 'm late  uhm my topic is on creative therapy and uh when they told me about this topic i had to think really hard because uh sometimes when you practice for a while you don't any more uh you know reflect on what you 're doing it 's sort of like it comes and sometimes i think to myself that when i face a particular patient i 'm not really the one there you see i 'm just an instrument so it more or less has a lot to do with uh being open 'no  you open yourself to to the patient and whatever it is that the patient says to you so uh when you when you decide to do therapy with a patient unlike when i initially started as a therapist that i was very careful about referring to specific uh theoretical models what happens is i don't know which comes first is it the theoretical model is it the experience that i have is it me is it the patient or is it uh is it enlightenment from above you know so i decided to really sit down and think about think about uh what it is that that a person does i think that after a certain time all of you without knowing it you become creative 'no  what stimulates the creativity primarily i think is the desperation that you sense from your patient and you don't really have very much time to reflect uh on it it 's like you respond automatically 'no to the patient so uhm i i sort of look back into my my notes and i said to myself uh maybe the best thing for me to do is really sit down and systematically show you uhm the various things that that goes through that that goes through the process of of uh doing therapy with a patient i 'm only speaking for for myself 'no  and i think i have sort of referred this to some of my colleagues doktora ruiz is one of them 'no so i i don't know if you 'll agree 'no  first of all i 'd like to define what the meaning of therapist is for me for me a therapist is a healer specifically a therapist is a healer of the psyche of the soul if you want to call it or of the spirit and the spirit or the soul or the psyche has been wounded uh and the wounds come from human conditions  and so uh by the very nature of the psychic wound uh the therapist must explore the realm of the unseen 'no of the abstract of the symbolic so most of the time it 's intangible and uh that 's the reason why uh in my work in the hospital i work with psychiatry residents and these people these medical residents have spent twelve years of their lives working with the concrete in other words they work on the human body so they know all about the circulatory system all about the nervous system all about the digestive and the reproductive system they know that very well and then suddenly they enter the world of psychiatry where there is where you are required to make a dramatic shift from the concrete to the abstract  needless to say it becomes a very difficult task for a medical student who has always been hands on on the physical to suddenly shift 'no and go to the abstract process so i think for me working with psychiatry residents the first year is the most difficult wherein there is a shift from the concrete to the abstract the concrete is now just symptomatic because you are more concerned with the abstract process or what the unseen what you don't see really 'no  i don't find that as difficult when i work with uh psychology uh students they seem to automatically shift 'no into the abstract process or let 's say the symbolic process or what is unseen by the naked eye so that that that 's those are the two things that that that uh really strike me it 's by the nature of your own training  also i think no matter what a person says or no matter what people say that you can become a therapist i also think that you cannot force yourself to be a therapist you must already have been one maybe unfinished or there must have been that must be your gift from the beginning 'no  so some of you might have known from early childhood that you could see certain things that other people cannot see i 'm not talking psychic 'no  you can see uh you can sense that somebody is hurting whereas perhaps your brother or your sister tells you oh you it 's all in your mind you know what i mean you can sense it you can pick up sadness 'no  you can pick up conflict but you don't have those terms but you already have that gift so coming into a more professional training what they try to do or what the institutions try to do is they just try to give you uh systematic ways of figuring out how it is that you are sensing this 'no  and sometimes i don't know if that 's good or bad when you take a p h d as i 'm telling my class you end up pressured harassed and depressed laughter okay so in other words you 're so pressured kasi to memorize all of these various theories and you 're so harassed because you have these fifty thousand papers okay and you 're so depressed because you 're not giving yourself enough time to reflect on what you 're doing and if you are a therapist you are a natural reflector 'no  so sometimes you just want to sit down and say to yourself wait a minute what 's happening to me and for me that is what a therapist is all about for as long as you 're working with someone else it 's not only that someone else that you 're dealing with you 're also dealing with your own  how am i reacting to this am i interpreting this person 's issues because of my own issues or what 'no  so there 's a constant interplay between you and your client so you might have a person who is fantastically trained in psychoanalysis but that person is not anything for the client because that per that analyst never interacted never gave of himself 'no  so more than that creative therapy i think is the ability to be able to touch the other person in a healing way and at the same time allowing that person to touch you and to make you grow needless to say i think what happens is clears throat somewhere along the way most therapists get burned out 'no  i think anybody who 's in a helping profession gets burned out why because i think our tendency is always to look to the needs of others and forget our own needs  so hopefully creative therapy will be a way of getting your psychic perks 'no by in your interaction with your patient as well as providing your patient uh with psychic perks 'no  so by the very nature of the wounds that your specific client has in other words we get a lot of those kinds of people in the hospital they come in and they have a thorough check up and they have all sorts of doctors looking at them and then the doctors will say there 's nothing wrong with you you can go home and the clients and the patient says no i don't feel well and then the doctor will come out and show all the results you see your blood is okay your x-ray is okay there 's nothing wrong with you get out of that bed because we need it for somebody who 's really sick okay but they don't know that this person is really sick it is what you would call perhaps in the bible sick in the spirit or what you would call experiencing the dark night of the soul  and it is what perhaps what uhm what you would say not in the presence of if you are spiritual not in the presence of god 's grace or someone who has shut himself completely from any kind of uh interaction in other words that person has become stagnant inside 'no  so how do you say that how do you put that in a chart dear dr so-and-so thank you for your kind referral my diagnostic impression of this patient is that he is experiencing the dark night of the soul laughter  okay now what would happen to you is they would confine you in the psychiatric unit beside the patient that they referred to you so you don't say that although at the back of your mind you know you just know why because this person perhaps is manifesting certain kinds of behavior which even as a child you could already sense  i don't think there 's any one person in this room who has not had that kind of call it what you will intuition sensing or whatever  even as a child they could feel the other person 's pain  so by the very nature of the wounds the therapist must consider several things you have to have you can say oh i can feel you are in pain nobody gives very much value to your feelings so what they have tried to do i think uh as you go into higher education is they try to sort out manifestations of this pain and so what is the main manifestation of of this particular pain in your patient or this particular conflict  that is what you are studying now that is what you would call the behavioral symptoms so we are very attuned to behavioral symptoms uh examples of behavioral symptoms would probably be constant ticks you know like that or uhm signs of uh restlessness or disorientation forgetfulness okay use of language how do they use their language do they do they speak in uh a a gentle tone or do the words come out very rough 'no  so these are symptoms and other behavioral symptoms probably would be if you go a little further a person can no longer use his right hand although neurologically and muscularly he can he 's supposed to okay but he can't use it anymore uhm aches and pains that have no pattern 'no  so a person has an ache here an ache here okay notice usually if there 's an ache it 's all on one side that 's supposed to be the pattern but you have people who have aches and pains all over their body and if you suggest you have a pain here yes doctor there too laughter  okay so in other words whatever you suggest there 's pain so you are able to pinpoint that sort of thing also you have to pay behavioral symptoms pain symptoms language symptoms voice tone okay you know that very well in neurolinguistic programming 'no  is the person auditory visual kinesthetic those things you take into consideration too okay what are all these symptoms uh   for for the therapist these symptoms are nothing more but the expression of the patient 's conflicts anguish frustrations and anxieties okay which john of the cross summed up as the dark night of the soul okay take for example a man who all his life has always done the right thing upright  i just had this kind of patient a couple of months ago he has always done the right thing he has always abided by the rules he has always been the ideal husband and father  then one day his wife 's mother died and so she had to go back to the province and she brought her children with her but he could not go because he had to work in manila the man is forty-three years old okay two months later when his wife came back he sat down and he told his wife i no longer love you and i don't want to live with you anymore i want you and the children to pack up your bags and go back to the province and so the wife said what did i do i mean you know was i a bad wife no you were not a bad wife  then what is it i just don't feel for you anymore  and so the children of course reacted and what did they say what kind of a father are you you 're not the person we know our mother is so good and so it became a family problem but actually what was the problem was this man  suddenly he had to confront aspects of his life which he thought he had overcome many many years ago by being very strict with himself okay so the wife said there must be another woman and then he said no there 's no other woman then there must be another man laughter okay then he says he says no there 's no other man so i i came across this man not because he was my patient the children the children were my patients because the wife was saying that the children were acting up so they would manipulate ways and means of getting him to come so finally when he came he said he just doesn't feel anything for anyone he just wants to quit everything he wants to quit his job he wants to quit his family he wants to quit everything okay but the wife is such a formidable person that she said i am not going to quit i am not going to give you up without a fight and the husband said you can fight with your own shadow because i am not going to be there
Philippines	where is your president mr president fellow inventors ladies and gentlemen at one of the occasions uh i was invited to after uh addressing the crowd uh a man sprang up and asked a question with certain degree of enthusiasm and said why did you address us uh fellow inventors then i shoot uh another question how many children do you have and he said i have eight oh my god you are as good a prolific inventor as i am but i uhm i mean you are more prolific than i am i have only two  my point really is that everybody is an inventor in his own right right perhaps you have invented so many alibis laughter and justifications for coming late at night because of such uh an exciting date but if we agree that uh necessity is a mother of invention then everybody 's necessity has to be addressed with certain degree of inventiveness  at any rate before we go on inventing let me just briefly tell you about the filipino inventors society in nineteen forty-three during the war a group of true blooded filipino nationalists grouped together to organize the filipino inventors society at a time when imports were curtailed you know that uh if the war is uh ongoing freedom halted  and so the society was formed if only to address the promotion and development of local inventive capabilities  so along that direction the filipino inventors society was able to lobby and uh congress approved the then known as republic act number thirty-eight fifty and then later was amended by apo ferdie marcos by p d fourteen twenty- three to be responsive to the need of our so-called technological requirements regrettably under the current administration i don't know who of you are pro or cons especially the treaty the republic act number was abolished that would include the tax exemptions that we were enjoying that would include the funds that supported the development of crazy ideas  you know ideas have to be prototype to make it you know make it to make them workable demonstrable and then perhaps convert that into economic realities   yun ang nakakalungkot   kung baga ako may trauma kahit na kasama ako sa edsa   dahil nung panahon ni apo the filipino inventors were given kahit na consuelo de bobo mayron din  to tell you frankly we were given enough support we were holding regular inventors' week in which contests were held and for which presidential awards were given including the international awards of the world intellectual property organization under the u n system but under this current predicament we have been plagued by what the doom of the referendum the lahar the mount pinatubo the quake the flood why is this country cursed oh my god almighty have mercy upon us  what is happening to this country ladies and gentlemen for the last fifty years we have stagnated immediately after the war we were only said to be second to japan but what is our per capita income now it 's about seven thousand dollars vis a vis japanese twenty-two thousand dollars much higher than the u s twenty-one thousand  this is very regrettable then we have to address this and we have to ask questions like why have we stagnated the following statements will give some as unassailable answers let me read to you so that i 'll not get lost  in seventeen ninety the president of the united states george washington during the inauguration of philippine patent office said the advancement of agriculture trade and industrial manufacture with all appropriate measures may not need a special recommendation but i cannot refrain from pointing out to you the necessity of effectively encouraging introduction of inventions from abroad as well as the skills and genius at home for the production of these inventions  mr name an attorney-at-law head of the japanese and far east department max planck institute munich federal germany he said industrial property as an element of national industrial strategy  he said uhm averred in his paper regardless of development or growth economics regardless of whether you have a developing or industrialized country or regardless of which branches of industry a given industrial strategy strategy focuses on one factor that is essential to all was essential for sustained high growth in korea and taiwan is technological progress  werner von siemens the inventor of the telephone that we are using now perhaps whose efforts were decisive for the adoption of patent protection in germany he added national interest and national industry must come first because patent law was established so that industry should develop not for the inventor himself to make money or especially good profit that is only secondary  our industry shall blossom and progress for this inventive activity is necessary not for itself  mr takasha takashi tahakashi korikyu of japan founder of the japanese industrial property system he said pasensiyahin mo yung english ng hapon we have looked about and see what nations are greatest so that we can be like them and he sai and he said uhm what is it that makes the united states such a great nation and we investigated and found that it was patents meaning inventions and so we will have patents and look at japan now of course the organization of which the filipino inventors society is a member mel said uh a voting member yes and the united nations uh world intellectual property said industrial progress and prosperity are to a large extent heavily dependent upon the inventors   the significance of the inventors becomes overwhelmingly evident when we consider a situation had many of the great inven inventions never been made  the latest uh statement i have gathered the u s claims to a foundation educational foundation of inventors quote our inventors are the single greatest national resource unquote these are some statements which perhaps can address the question we asked earlier and in this uh in the country we have uh a very active uh secretary then of president marcos and i have been overwhelmingly fascinated by his uh popular popularized phrase and he said innovate or stagnate so at least you know now why we have stagnated  if we ventur venture to say that the government has failed to employ the invention or the technological inputs into its economic agenda then it is a sign it is a reflection that will tell us perhaps it 's indifference or outright ignorance of putting the invention into the industrialization process  alam mo don't uh be malice about this you know the government has been embarking on industrialization thrust  ang sabi ko sa bisaya we can never un industrialize i tell you we can never industrialize  so sinabi ko sa bisaya patuli ako uli papatuli akog utru kung makakamot makamtan nato ang industriyalisasyon sa the year two thousand i don't have to interpret that in tagalog anymore because namimilipit yung dila ko  it is sad to state ladies and gentlemen that our government has been inventive i tell you has been inventive look at the invention of the garchitorena scam the graft and corruption the two billion pal scandal the borloloy the lear jet  alam mo binili raw ng amerikano e ay seven million e dollars pero ang dini-clare ay five million lang   nung bumalik dito ang sinisingil ay seven million nahalata tuloy  i think uh at the very late i mean lately i think you have not that lately uhm you have perhaps seen some t v pluggings no during the time of joe con  alam mo yung background dun is the song of uh ninoy aquino yung favorite favorite niya yung the impossible dream   baka nangangarap lang tayo nananaginip tayo sa ating industriyalisasyon without the aid of science and technology it 's uh nakakalungkot no  it 's a sad thing that uh why this government has not been able to establish a strong science and technology policy why why the private sector perhaps like you has not been able to address that problem of science and technology as one single economic factor because if we have to industrialize we should employ technological innovations or inventions there is nothing else there is no way else that we can industrialize without the aid of science and technology  so additionally the filipino inventors society has been aggressive to restore what was abolished by execution order one two eight i mean executive order one two eight that abolished the incentives there is now the hou the senate bill seventeen fif uh seventeen fifty-eight which embodies the ten year tax exemption for inventors who may be able to to to commercialize an invention a fifty million guarantee fund but this bill is still pending in the senate there is also the house bill three three eight seven which would make the filipino inventors society as a chartered organization  as a chartered organization it can now enjoy tax exemption corporate tax and perhaps customs duties to be free if an import would complement the r and d activity of the filipino inventors society let me mention some filipino inventions for your information which have uh per ga uhm gone into some kind of a world fame but uh i know you know rizal he was the first to invent the hollo the block-making machine that could produce at that time six thousand blocks a day i don't know if you are aware of that then he invented a cigarette that he gifted to dr blumentritt and other friends at the age of nine and then he made a some kind of invention an irrigation system that only made with uh was made with bare hands and some innovations that irrigated his autarchic republic within the republic during his exile in dapitan 'no  he he collected about three hundred forty-three conchology items 'no  and then he invented some equipment for bakery making biscuits among others and so i think from the very from the very history of the filipinos the inventive gene has been there that 's why i call you inventors uh in your own right take a look at the fluorescent lamp this is documented during the time of quezon this was presented by agapito flores to to the president but uh wala ngang alam e ng invention di mayro'n mayroong certain diplomatic visitor there who was interested doon sa kumukuti-kutitap uh nakikita niya e  and so he brought uh agapito flores in the u s and it was further developed and perfected there and so it was known flores-cent lamp look at also the moonbuggy one of the aggressive designers was ed san juan during the time of marcos he came over and we presented him a plaque of appreciation he died two years ago in the luxury of wealth at the nasa look at the signal light yung sa yung sa kotse baka hindi ninyo alam yan  it was patented by a filipino in nineteen twenty-one in the united states 'no   kaliwa kanan kaliwa kanan ha by buncio william buncio the t v telephone association it was demonstrated in nineteen sixty-seven between the depa the development board office at herran and malaca&ntilde;ang during the time of president garcia it was done by dr greg sara the multivitamins and and many other inventions but the recent one the sing-along system was copied everywhere else this was originated by then president roberto del rosario 'yung sa trebel 'no  in fact he has invented a new a new tape colored tape  yung mga paos yung mga sintonado pwede nang kumanta  believe me 'no kakanta kayo pwede na   tatlong kulay yun na- distinguish yung kulay ng boses nyo   sabi ko nga hindi yan colored tape kung hindi voice range find uh voice range finder at any rate unless we do something about our inventors this is quite uh self-pity but i have to say with all candor from within my heart unless we do something with our inventive capabilities and put this into the vortex of economic strategizing we will never never industrialize  ang sabi ni concepcion we have there is already an investment to as much as three billion dollars or three hundred billion dollars in the country what three hundred billion dollars do you think that is an industrialization per se never because this capital siphoned in would only exploit your skills and my labors our natural resources and what is foremost is the repatriation of income perhaps hindi pa magbabayad ng income sa atin  and that would tend to exploit rather than industrialize our country so unless we do something about this we would be left singing to dream the impossible dream to reach the unreachable star no matter how hopeless  then the n i c or the new industrialization program of tita cory administra administration will never be as good a dream as a nightmare thank you very much the following is a response of the speaker to a question raised in the open forum  okay cough as per international statistics the ratio between success and failure is anywhere from ninety-five to ninet ninety-seven failure only three to five percent success remember thomas edison when he was experimenting on one of the items uhm sina sinabi do'n sa boy uh ang nagreklamo yung boy e sabi niya 'yun boy eh uhm sir sagad na   do'n sa calibration 'no  uh that was the that was the limit according to the boy
Philippines	good afternoon everyone audience greets the speaker  uhm i 'm actually scheduled to do i was supposed to read 3 words  for a monk who does not who should remain in a life of silence i speak a great deal audience laughs especially on occasions when i 'm outside the monastery uh  so uh i actually prepared two lectures because they asked for a question of heroes and i felt it would be appropriate to deal with the the two major heroes andres bonifacio and jose rizal depends if we will have time for the second one uhm i decided to speak first on andres bonifacio simply because eighteen ninety-seven is his centennial year we are celebrating boni we 're not supposed to celebrate it but uhm this is one reason why bonifacio centennial unlike rizal last year there was such a lot of things going on re-enactment word stamps coins contests uhm even kite flying audience laughs and they had all sorts of things last year for jose rizal but for andres bonifacio we could not celebrate it uh simply because uh may ten eighteen ninety-seven a hundred years ago uh he was killed in the mountains of maragondon cavite by uh fellow filipinos i mean uh with rizal rizal was killed by spaniards that 's fine audience laughs  uh bonifacio was killed by fellow filipinos that 's not it 's not something you want to remember uh but since uh we are dealing with uh history and i think if uh pepe diokno were alive he would 've liked to listen to something that we sweep under the rug and uh bonifacio unfortunately is one of the heroes we like to remember but we only remember bits and pieces of him so the history you will hear this afternoon uh is kind of shocking in some parts  it is uh it is something i wish i did not see anymore and uh i would have been happy just dealing with what my teachers and my textbooks told me then of course it is uh one of the tasks of a historian to present truth even if half the time that truth is not popular or might even be painful for people so uhm people usually assume uh that i spend most of my time researching in libraries or archives or date matching   i 'm always at my desk which seems like an easy life i mean in my monastery for example some of the brothers cannot understand why i spend half the day in front of my computer so for them they don't think it is quote unquote work because work means leaving at eight o'clock going to an office and coming back at five so if you sit in your room half the day reading uh half the time sleeping audience laughs uh actually i 'd rather think that is reflection audience laughs 'no uh or resting in the lord but then uh the brothers are not so keen on that uh what many people actually do not see is the heavy burden that responsible historians carry on their backs and even if we think eighteen ninety-six and eighteen ninety-eight something to be celebrated there is very much underneath the glorious trappings that is a very painful cancer to filipinos who seriously look into their past personally eighteen ninety-six is a very distressing part of our history and if i did not have the great misfortune of being both a historian and a journalist i would rather sweep it under a rug than talk about it at the time andres bonifacio began the philippine revolution in balintawak in the latter part of august eighteen ninety-six because we 're still fighting over the dates uh little did he know that he would be swallowed up by the very revolution that he started this is the greatest irony of andres bonifacio bonifacio was killed by the very revolution he started this is our first painful lesson for this afternoon unless we come to terms with this part of our history we will never get anywhere and you remember the proverb ang hindi marunong lumingon sa pinanggalingan tae ang maaapakan audience laughs at the way the proverb has been twisted or again as words in order to foretell the destiny of a nation one has first to open the book of her past  now one of the main problems is that philippine history is sadly written by rather dull and uh rather mediocre people audience laughs  we have uh many textbooks but we don't have interesting books of history uhm if you go to a bookstore and this is not well uh my books are not very serious you don't have something that every interested pinoy must know  all you have are these thick books with dates and names but the thing is history is not just this accumulation of data it must be presented in good and lively writing and it must give a point of view for without it history is a story without meaning one of the main problems facing filipinos is our terribly short memory uh the fact that imelda and imee marcos sit in congress is a very great proof of that we have very little or no historical sense at all and it does not help that our historians cannot get their act together the end result is that philippine history is often confused and confusing so this is one example last year we had a roundtable discussion in the university of the philippines well i call it the 2 words audience laughs  uhm we had this uh roundtable for a whole day in the hope of resolving this fifty-five year controversy of where and when the first cry of the revolution occurred is it balintawak or is it pugadlawin is it august twenty-three eighteen ninety-six or august twenty-six eighteen ninety-six so i was invited to react to uh one of the papers presented on the forum because three years ago i wrote two essays on the thing and i could not resolve it either  and to be rather flippant i just teachers and students keep writing or interviewing me can you give us a definite answer  and i say you know just take out a coin toss it heads it 's balintawak tails it 's pugadlawin audience laughs  so the thing is they couldn't quite understand it i think personally that the controversy is like the controversy of the first mass uh where was it held was it in limasawa or is it masau butuan and of course being a monk i think i should be interested in it but i always tell my students we shouldn't even discuss that at all it should be thrown in the basura and it shouldn't even be in textbooks at all because uh if you know what a galleon was like they were having mass every day so we really do not know when this first mass was held audience laughs and come to think of it so much precious time is wasted on something which is so uh well it 's important but it 's not very very important so anyway getting back to this roundtable conference we began at nine o'clock in the morning with only two options balintawak or pugadlawin by the time we adjourned at five in the afternoon we had more questions than answers audience laughs  as an added bonus we all left with a very big headache because at after from nine to five uh we started with balintawak and pugadlawin but we ended up with bahay toro kangkong pasong tamo words pugad ng lawin and pakpak lawin audience laughs and ano pa  and one of the light moments was when one of the scholars said it was pugad baboy audience laughs  so then uh it was not only that so we started at nine o'clock with two things august twenty-three august twenty-six eighteen ninety-six that was before lunch by late afternoon we had the following dates august twenty twenty-three twenty-four twenty-five twenty-six and to top it all someone even suggested a wild card in 1 word september audience laughs  i mean you know uh this did not faze me uh this was nothing new  uh then somebody said uh since we can't settle that let 's settle something else they said  somebody said uh why don't we figure out what bonifacio shouted there audience laughs  and then uh then there was another debate there so somebody said you know in spanish it 's grito de balintawak like grito de something in mexico and cuba so it is we shouldn't take it literally you know described so uh rather we should see it symbolically as the beginning of the revol revolution so it 's a figure of speech etcetera etcetera  so then later on what happened was somebody said there was no shout at all there were two shouts somebody said audience laughs  somebody said there was one shout and then sige na let 's leave that na lang  so let 's uh do other things na lang  so uh after this so we talked about other things and then uh somebody he brought up what bonifacio was like and uh uh we when you look at a statue of bonifacio today what do you see you see him wearing a kamisa de chino that 's open here and you can see his muscular chest audience laughs and then uh he 's always with his red kundiman pants and then he 's holding a bolo and he 's always angry he 's always shouting or he 's mad or uh whatever uh a few months ago i talked for example to the daughter of gregoria de jesus uh bonifacio 's widow and then she said uh look at those kundiman pants and i said yes yes that 's what 's in all the statues and then she said you know adults do not wear kundiman pants only children wear those pants audience laughs   and then she said you know and also the cloth of that it 's like something that you use for pillow cases words yes yes words and then she said something which which was striking and she said if you 're going to war will you wear bright red pants audience laughs   and then i said no no you try your best to camouflage yourself you 're a moving target there so it occurred to me i started thinking of other things  did he really fight with the bolo everyone is so upset now when i tell them that although he 's always brandishing his bolo bonifacio never fought with the bolo the preferred weapon was always a gun and the thing was when he went to uh balintawak in august of eighteen ninety-six this scandalizes everyone he went to balintawak dressed as a woman audience laughs because it was he could not pass through all the sentries so andres bonifacio tied his uh bandanna on his head and he wore a woman 's dress and of course he cannot travel in a woman 's dress carrying his big bolo audience laughs  uh so what he did was he kept the bolo in place name and brought his gun uh which is why uh we find out later that his preferred weapon was a bolo so you see every day everywhere you will see images of bonifacio which are historically inaccurate but then that is the image that we see in our textbooks in pictures in plazas in everywhere 'no  so uh what what really happened  then somebody talked about the tearing of the cedula somebo one scholar said there was this great uh triumphant tearing of the cedula  somebody said there was no such thing maybe they didn't tear any cedula and then somebody said no there 's a source that says they tore their cedulas twice and i said how can you tear a cedula twice in three two different areas uh people found that strange until later on i found a document that showed that andres bonifacio was using fake cedulas which means he probably had half a dozen on himself audience laughs 
Philippines	 beginning of speech not captured because speaker did not use the microphone and the regular polymer that you see around okay why you can look at it you can feel it you can touch it but don't turn it laughter  now there was a bit of uneasy concern on my part when i was requested to give a talk about the role of polymers in the environment but after hearing some of the speeches and reading articles on polymers i thought that this talk would be timely enough so as to clear a lot of biases that most people have about polymers in general and plastic in particular now as a polymer now as a scientist we usually measure progress in terms of technology and the amount of innovation we introduce and on the other hand as an environmentalist we would like to use these innovations and technology in order to better if not maintain a balance between polymers and the environment now the main concern or one of the main questions we would like to answer at the end of this talk is have we maintained a balance between polymer technology and environment or are we tilting the scale way towards technology if so are we trying to do something in order to bring back the balance between polymers technology and innovation and the environment so hopefully at the end of the talk you 'll be enlightened enough and you can answer that question  now as i 've mentioned before polymers at present has affected our day-to-day activities most of the conveniences that we enjoy now are due to polymers if we refer back to this century as the atomic age then the next generation can aptly be called as the polymer generation since by that time each and every facet of our lives will be influenced by polymers now it is a sad fact though that students get out of the university with having the barest knowledge of polymers now this same indifference can be seen even during the early beginnings of polymers it was in eighteen thirty-nine when the goodyear bo  brothers charles and nelson transformed natural rubber and vulcanized it and formed as a formed a more thermoset material that we use now and one of the products that is being used uh that came out of this innovation is the eno ebonite which is used as bowling balls now we have tires automobile tires and after goodyear 's inventions and even before world war first polymers were considered more of an art and an empirical formula rather than a science so in the field of polymer science art precedes more than or precedes that of the science for almost a century polymers had been used and commercialized but it was only after forty years when polymers were taken seriously and developed as a science it was also do during those last forty years that polymers experienced a tremendous growth in science and technology one of the one of the forebears of polymers science is staudinger now sto staudinger laid the groundwork towards an groundwork of polymer as a science and at the time that he was working on on the concept of science he was advised by his colleague and i quote  dear colleague leave the concept of large molecules well alone there can be no such thing as a molecule as a macro molecule  now getting this kind of of letter or advice from your peers is a big turndown especially in the field of science but in the year nineteen twenty staudinger was able to demonstrate that natural and synthetic polymers are not aggregates like colloids or cyclic compounds like cyclohexane but are long chain-like molecules with characteristic and groups now staudinger went on to win a nobel prize now what are polymers then and what makes them different and unique from regular compounds now i brought some visual aids in here  now according to composition we can classify polymers either as addition polymers okay  now i pick a necklace bead in here and addition polymers okay are made up of the same kind of beads same sizes all throughout now polymers can range in length it could be short like this or it can be real long  now you can you can form longer monomer polymers if you want by connecting one specific polymer to another polymer as what i 'm doing right now  okay  so you can have one polymer chain and mix it this one up with another polymer chain and form longer and longer polymer chain now you can make a lot of structures out of this in fact one of the common inventions that are being done right now or what we call the structural polymers you can make stars out of them   laughter  okay now you can make ladder polymers out of them it looks like a ladder  okay here we go it 's not perfect but it looks like a ladder and you can make comb-like polymers out of them you can make all the structures you want to make out of polymers now there 's another kind of polymer which you can observe take a look at this now you have different sizes of the bead we have small sizes this is the big one words  now this kind of polymers can also be made now here 's a more uniform kind of polymer we have an alternating small big and small beads in here and this is another kind of addition polymers now condensation polymers are those polymers you prepare using two different kinds of monomers so if i have this purple one and i mix it with the yellow one then we end up with what you call condensation polymers now what is the importance of using addition and condensation polymers now it depends upon the end use so polymers in general are prepared in order to satisfy the consumers now according to structure okay according to structure we can classify polymers into three different kinds we can have the elastomers or rubber okay this is what came out from natural rubber it 's it 's not so sturdy you can break it you stretch it a little bit and you break it what goodyear did was vulcanize this and form a little bit more strong rubber now another one now some of the examples of polymers we  okay  i mentioned earlier elastomers and the natural rubber for the chemist they are otherwise known as the word  now we have neoprene which is polychlorophene they are used for automobile parts now we have word in rubber or known as  word s and word s is the one that you use for automobile tires now we have polydimethoxyethylene that 's our silicon rubber and silicon rubber are the one used for biochemical or for purposes because for purposes of uh biological parts because silicon is biologically compatible so heart valves okay ahm contact lenses are example of poly uh xylene now we also have polyalkaline sulfide otherwise known as xylopol and chlorosulfinated polyethylene or hypalon now for fibers you can have cotton wool and silk which are synthetic fibers and the first uh these are word or natural fibers and the first synthetic fiber we have is nylon six-six now this was uh synthetically prepared i think in the year nineteen thirty-six pretty close and we have polyethylene dacron and acetate rayon now the last three have played a very important role especially in the aerospace industry  okay all of you have seen this one okay you 've seen a picture of a spaceman walking in the on the moon and wearing a heavy suit now this suit is made up of reinforced nylon composites and what they put in there is are what word we have alkylated uh polyethylene and the purpose of that is you don't want it to get burned okay now they 're made up of different layers and rather uncomfortable what they 're trying to do right now is to move towards polymers which are lightweight and and examples of these are what we call the acetates or the polyacetates okay now here 's your uh space mobile okay and you have very few metallic parts in here most of the metal parts that you see in there are just used to hold the structure together now most of them are made up of again reinforced composite light polyurethane and also words  now you can see an aluminum foil uh covering out of this this is the module where uh where this where this is the module where the scientists live okay this is where they live during the space exploration and as you can see it 's not very convenient or tight packed in there you can have only about five of them the maximum is five if you have more of them then it will be very uncomfortable okay  now this is uh this is the cabin where similar to the one that i 've shown you the first time and you can see that you have the mobile arm in there the mobile arm is the white one that comes out and this is where all the astronauts go through so it 's way way up in there it 's so small and all of them are made up of reinforced uh composites or polymers now here is another picture of the mobile space mobile that i 've shown you before and okay all of these are placed inside your spacecraft and if you look at the spacecraft they look like rubbery in form yes simply because they 're really made up of reinforced rubber again in different layers  and this is when you scrape off the out the outer layer of the spacecraft you you scrape it off and look at what is in there you can see that it 's made up of plexiglass and plexiglass is one of the more common structural materials we have urethane is another one  now one of the innovation of polymer is computer okay without polymers there won't be any computers and as you can see this is the kennedy space center with all the  com computers installed in there and what they do is monitor space exploration and every time they have airplanes or not airplanes spacecraft being sent in space  okay now the third third kind of polymer is the most visible kind and those are the plastics and the plastics are made up of polyethylene and under this we have the low density polyethylene the one that you use for packaging this is an example of a low density polyethylene okay now the high density polyethylene are the one that you use for milk and juice bottles and the linear low density polyethylene are also used for packaging now it 's mo the linear the l l d p e are sturdier than the linear poly dens low density polyethylene so we increase the tensile strength of the polymer by increasing the or varying the proportion of these polyethylene uh polymers now polystyrene is what you normally see every time you buy something from fast foods so you could go to mcdonald or wendy 's now you have those uh we call them expanded polystyrene and those are made up uh by simply getting your basic polystyrene and try trying to inject gaseous substances into it now polyethylene terepthalate are what you see inside the bottles there was a time that most of the drinks we have are in in bottles okay those are easy to recycle but we 're shifting a little bit now into plastic and that is when you have poly polyethylene terepthalate uh being used more often now the cover that they use for the soda bottle is made up of high density polyethylene now if you come across the structure uh which is glass-like okay it looks like plastic but it 's a little bit more glass-like that is polymethyl methacrylate okay or otherwise we know as plexiglass or fiberglass as what you mentioned now polyvinyl chloride is another polymer which is being used for packaging and polyoxymethylene is a polymer which is used for gaskets okay so all of the polymers under plastic in there you 'll find out that polyethylene polystyrene polymethylene terepthalate are the one actually that is our main concern  the visibility of plastics as a consumer item and the misconceived notion that we can do nothing to get rid of plastic safely has made plastic subject to inordinate amount of attention and legislation the alternatives given range from either recycling to outright ban of plastic packaging people 's biases towards plastic has subjected polymers as a whole under critical scrutiny in nineteen seventy-six the united nations met in france and formally introduced a new concept in resource management and environmental control now this no-nonsense front end approach to environmental control involves minimizing resource input and effluent output even to the extent of revamping and redesigning industrial processes and products now for quite some time this was met with indifference and branded to be impractical expensive and idealistic 
Philippines	 clapping thank you very much ten thousand apologies it was my fault i we de i had an interview with someone else and i didn't realize it was so late so we actually left at five minutes to one and i want to thank the they were so good they were sitting there so quietly you know and i didn't know it was so late already uhm i 'm also happy this is the is this the first time 'no pala this is the second time i 've entered la salle the other time was somewhere else just before edsa i think it was so i 'm happy to be here with you uhm actually i 've been turning down a lot of the offers for talks be requests for talks because i 've been so busy but i couldn't say no to you because uhm our lady 's message is directed specifically to the youth and it 's very important that you know this because even in medjugorje she had one year that she called for all the youth to come and then the next year she had an extension and she 's calling the youth because this is a message that you probably hear sometimes when you graduate whether from high school or college or what and they 'll tell you you know the world is in your hands or you face a hall of life and you can do much to change what 's going to happen but that 's precisely why she 's calling you because it is in your hands and you have to believe it you have to believe it and you can take a hold of it you can grasp it it is within your hands to change the world wa in what it 's it 's it 's rushing head long to today and uhm i 'm very happy to hear that that you 're talking about the devil as if he really did exist because sometimes you know there are people who refuse to accept the existence of the devil i have had friends who have told me don't talk about the devil because it 's negative uh uh it 's it 's negative i don't want to upset my children and soon and that 's when he works the hardest and he works the best but when you recognize that he does exist and that you are aware of how he will uh of how he makes use of you and of things of the world then you are already halfway there the key is recognizing that 's what 's happened to this world today and that 's what 's happened to the youth today you see this world teaches you that the devil no longer exists is he or doesn't exist or never has existed this world tells you in terms like positive thinking negative thinking etcetera and so on uh the old ways in which even we were brought up and raised in you know we were brought up and raised into the fact that hey you know there 's a bogeyman out there well it 's true let me tell you there 's a bogeyman out there and he 's working and he 's working with you he 's working with us the first thing that he has set off to destroy is the family and even this our lady has said very specifically in medjugorje the family is the first thing that the devil will attack why because the family is supposed to be uh the haven for love for happiness security uh i think when i think of jesus coming and i think of the fact that jesus came uh as he did many people point out you see jesus ' love for the poor because jesus himself was poor there 's a deeper message than that jesus came in a family jesus could have materialized out of nowhere could have walked out of the desert and started doing all of his miracles and they still would have happened but jesus chose to come in a family why because he wanted to show us that that 's the most important unit uh in the world that exists the most integral unit is the family if you don't if you cannot if people who love each other can't even live together in love meaning giving accepting being kind and and so on to one another sacrificing for one another how much more can you expect to love your neighbor your classmate how much more can you accept uh other people who are not of the same cultural background and later on how can you expect other count to love other countries and so that 's what happened you dissolve this integral unit of the family and everything else starts to follow and that 's exactly what is happening in the world today and now you have uh just as your professor has pointed out you have you have women who have taken on to themselves the duties if not the duties or the rights of god you have young women who have taken on the rights to decide on life whether they can choose in other words they now have what they call they fight for the right of choice the there are millions and millions of abortion that have been taking place in this last decade alone uh somewhere in the scriptures it talks about how streets are running red with blood you don't have to see it flowing on the streets they 're running on the canals they 're running in the canals of all the great cities of the world when i was in korea to see the uh apparition that was happening there a priest a belgian priest was telling me sis you know here in korea uh abortion has been legitimized by the government and that 's just say he says for an example if you say that there 's one abortion just only one abortion that takes place a day that 's thirty abortions a month and if it has the consent of both parents that 's sixty uh that 's sixty murderers that you have a month but talk about it i mean this is what he was saying alright uh you have six hundred murderers in ten months i mean these are people who will carry the burden and the scar of that in their souls and you have women in the united states who will fight for the right to the life of a dolphin who will go after women who are wearing fur coats because it 's inhumane okay they arrested a guy and put him in jail because he poisoned the tree in austin texas under which the constitution was signed but they go ahead and they kill their babies and nobody puts a stop to it the elections ninth next year of nineteen ninety-two is a very pivotal election even for the world because next year the election in the united states is going to hinge on one very important issue abortion right now everybody has been making their moves the the elections that took place last year for the governor and the state senators etcetera and so on was hinged on that so much so that even men who didn't believe in abortion kept silent because they didn't want to jeopardize their political careers and that 's what happens because we have uh careers to think of because uh we have other priorities we have kept silent and so the murder of the innocents goes on and in the end we will have to answer for that that 's why our lady is coming and that 's why our lady is crying and that 's why our lady is calling because i think you have to understand that we must participate in our own salvation and we must participate also in the salvation of others that 's her strongest message she is saying that we have at this time lost all sense of sin we 've learned to justify everything husbands and wives split up because they are unfaithful to one another or they don't they can't get along with one another and the lives of their children are destroyed their children grow up broken-hearted embittered and so on many of them go on to have broken families themselves in fact there was a study that was revealed that was released in a newsweek magazine about two years ago where psychiatrists and psychologists who had done several tests on broken homes uh discovered that they were wrong because normally psychiatrists and psychologists will say uh if the husband and wife or the parents start to fight and they fight uh intensively then it is best that they separate because the children suffer the trauma of hearing their families fight well they discovered twenty thirty years later after they had propagated this message that almost ninety percent of the children who came from families that had separated have all got married grew up got married and had separated themselves could not keep their families together whereas the children whose families have stayed together despite the fact that they were fighting managed to grow up and have families that stay together and so they released this article and saying they were wrong but in the meantime you have an entire generation of wrecked home lives because they were being taught what was wrong what happens to the idea of sacrifice our lady says we must learn to sacrifice for others that 's why she 's coming she 's appearing in almost every country of the world i just got a call this morning five thousand people in georgia in a place called conyers or something like that in georgia went out uh she 's been appearing there to a white woman a very simple white woman in georgia and she 's been giving messages on the thirteenth of every month and jesus would appear too and five thousand people were there and they saw in the sky what looked like cloud formation but very very clear this woman who called me told me she saw it herself she says i saw it so clearly it was like you were watching on t v it was etched so clearly the face of jesus our lady and the father the signs are everywhere go back to the bible and read what it says there the signs are everywhere it 's happening in the sun it 's happening on the earth the earth is trembling everything is happening and our lady is crying i don't wanna sound like a prophet of doom but you should know you should know that right now everything is making tugma  our lady is appearing in many places of the world and the and the ap and the and the messages that she 's giving there in some remote mountain or some hill or some poor village or what will tally exactly with what she 's saying somewhere else and everything is coming together and so she 's calling on the youth and she 's telling parents a lot of her messages now her latest messages i didn't have time for my lipa i don't know how many of you saw my lipa show but uh i mentioned in the lipa show that the petals were falling again and that the messages that she 's receiving messages again well the messages are directed at parents very strong that parents have to realize they have a responsibility to bring their children to god that parents have to realize that they must give the good example for their children because many times it is the par the fault of the parents who cannot bring their children who don't teach chi the children that god is an intrinsic part of their lives our lady says she teaches us in medjugorje she says begin and everything begin and end everything with god she said you know the problem with you is that you you work too much and you pray too little  she says you know if you reverse the process if you reverse the process she said you 'd see how easy it would go and she was talking to people who are farmers in medjugorje very poor very hard rocky country they grow tobacco and you have to work hard for tobacco
Philippines	okay uh good morning my fellow administrators uhm a student uh came to me one day to interview me for a school paper and the first question he asked me was uh how do you find your work as an administrator by way of an answer i said uh would you tell me what you call the season from june to december here in our country and at first his answer was rainy season ma'am and i said not quite because sometimes in a normal situation you don't find any rain in december and because he sensed that i was driving at something he said uh it 's the typhoon season ma'am and i said precisely that is the season that we go through as administrators typhoons come sometimes if you 're unlucky you uh you get from akang to bening to herming to yoling names of typhoons  and we have to you know handle them well and uh today i am going to give you as share with you some of the cases that we 've have come our way in dasmari&ntilde;as and uh give you a short background and maybe uh tell you how we handle the case   break in the recording faculty member she was on her second year of probation who sued the school for illegal dismissal and unfair labor practice you know this is uh a baptism of fire for me because the decision of the national labor relations commission uh which was final and executory came during my first month in office so i was telling myself my goodness this is the tail end of typhoon akang  but there are some lessons that could be learned and these i 'd like to share with you because in this case the faculty member who was on probation was rehired after one year despite the unfavorable evaluation of the chair that is she was given a second chance although the chair 's evaluation rep uh pointed to her teaching approach as not fit to college level teaching uh we were saying that maybe that should not have been done because one year would be enough for us to assess two uh two semesters to assess the competence of a faculty member second the faculty member felt that her poor evaluation was a personal bias on the part of the chair and the coordinator because records show when i saw this in the file that to substantiate their stand against the faculty member they did an interview of her students and she learned about this uh people who were present at that time intimated to me that if only those involved had sat down to talk and had really engaged in a sincere dialogue and discussion this could not have been a court case the university lost the case uh we paid back wages and attorney 's fees in the amount of three hundred thousand pesos we tried to appeal the case to the supreme court but then the lawyer did not take good care of our case and therefore we really lost the case and paid the attorney 's fees and the back wages this is for three years back wages for three years luckily the the salary at dasmari&ntilde;as is low so even for three years it amounted only to that much uh the second case i 'd like to uh share with you is a case of breach of contract uh by a faculty member all these cases are involving faculty members the university was constrained to seek the assistance of a leg legal counsel to handle the case of one faculty member who abandoned his classes at the middle of the semester in favor of a job abroad considered a beach a breach of contract the abandonment really caused tremendous difficulty on the part of the school who assigned classes to other faculty members but a close look at the case revealed that his immediate supervisor failed to explain to him the consequences of his act and even facilitated his exit by endorsing his letter of resignation to the v p academics so we asked the help of a legal counsel which is accra and accra sent him a letter informing him that he indeed uh committed a breach of contract and demanding a payment of twenty thousand pesos for moral damages twenty thousand is not much money but we wanted to give the teachers in school a lesson not to abandon their classes in mid-stream well he has complied with this requirement but the harm has been done to the classes that was assigned to him and that is for one half of the semester the third case i 'd like to share with you is a case of misappropriation of funds  using a college trust fund we have trust funds in our university a check was issued by the university to one department chair for implementing a school activity i think this was a case of a debate this was a debate to be attended by a group of students in one university now at that time one faculty member who was also on probation was in-charge of the activity and the money was entrusted to him by the chair the activity did not push through for some reasons but the faculty failed to return the money meantime the status board had to meet because the faculty member was on probation and it was the term was about to end and the the decision was to let his contract expire when he learned about this he stopped coming to school but of course he had given the examination that was the end of the semester  when the course card distribution came he could nowhere be found and so the chair uh did his best to look for him he succeeded in retrieving the grades but the money is still uh not returned to the school well in our opinion the person accountable for the money should have dis fa should have disbursed the fund himself and entrusting the same to one who is on probation and had a record of indiscriminate borrowing from fellow teachers should not have should have been avoided  another case is the case of uh cheating during examinations would you believe that we we had a teacher who tolerated cheating while proctoring a class and a uh a group of students complained about it and now because the complaint was written we had to to uh institute due process and so therefore we had the grievance board and there and so forth and so on and the findings by the grievance board showed that the teacher was indeed guilty of the charge and he admitted it in writing well the v p academics consulted me and asked me what are we going to do with the case i said well uh we can terminate him 'no but uh out of compassion we simply asked him you resign now because the students might you know pursue the case so he resigned at the middle of the term  uh this is one case where the vigilance on the part of the faculty could have prevented a formal complaint by the students because we were informed by some faculty members that in the past similar cases had already happened uh involving the same teacher but these were not reported to us and therefore nothing was done so far so only when the complaint was filed that we had to act on it and the last but the not the least uh case i 'd like to share with you i entitled it status board decision versus promised ranks by the chair and the coordinator  uh as in other units ranks are decided by a board not by individual persons 'no  but in this uh instance uh many times the decision proved to be different from those promised by a chair when he hires or recruits the faculty member and a crisis occurs when the concerned faculty who was promised a higher rank than the one decided by the board will not respect the board 's decision and in our case the faculty member even stopped teaching after two weeks because he did not get the rank that he wanted but we have a faculty manual which has to be followed and uh it has to be respected  so the situation could have been avoided we said if an initial but thorough assessment evaluation of the credentials of the faculty member had been done even before promising anything and maybe he 's telling the faculty member that that is just an estimate don't don't take it as as already awarded to you the the appointment the rank because it is the board that makes the final decision well ideally and i think we all should observe this no one starts handling a class prior to his official appointment so that we will not get into trouble and that presupposes then that those of us in the departments should be ready with the papers and all the hiring requirements so that the status board can meet the hiring board can meet before the start of any term that 's all that i can share with you today
Philippines	now i know that i succeeded in teaching laughter  that was a very very good lecture thank you very much tish uh you do not know how happy i am because uh you are not the professorial uh honoree clears throat  but with all you around here uh why you honor i don't know how much  hon how honored i am with your presence here uh i do not have a unlike brother andrew who wrote his paper i note that it is just remarks  dr castillo made a mistake when she said a few remarks  it just says remarks here uh in other words i can make as many as i want laughter  uh ab thirty years ago in nineteen sixty-two when i left the department of education after uhm twenty-nine years in the bureau of public schools earlier bureau of education uh when i was leaving i can still remember my friends at the general office telling me there must be sand in your head or rocks in your head there must be there 's something wrong here you are about to become a big shot a superintendent and i must say that the ambition of every classroom teacher when he starts is to be some day a division superintendent so that he will have many men under him  but uh i had just gotten my p h d the previous year i got my p h d very late uh and uh i became dissatisfied with what i was doing in the bureau of public schools as a general office supervisor there was no time to think no time at all to think we would i would travel all over the provinces in for two weeks i saw almost all the provinces in the philippines then come home and what do i do write a report then afterwards while you are writing your report your boss tells you clears throat i can still see my boss now mr jose cortes and mr tupas befo just before five o'clock time to go home boni will you please stay because we have to write a speech for the secretary well i was just a general office supervisor so i stayed and we would write this speech because it was going to be read the following morning i thought that uh this was not the life i wanted so uh when i had the request from the university of the philippines and the philippine normal college at the same time almost at the same time one day the late dr aldana called for me and said uh sibayan there are two requests here for you to either go to p n c or to u p and he sai  and he said if i were you i 'd go to the p n c because you are not a u p graduate laughter aldana ha aldana laughter  director of public schools those of you who know academe in this country know what that means  laughter it 's a commentary on our cult on our culture so i left and uh i remember doming landicho i 'm giving you his name so that you know him from batangas he said why do you leave now soon you 'll be there in the philippine normal college you 'll just be a classroom teacher you 'll have only maybe thirty forty students at most you must be crazy i left i have never regretted my leaving clears throat the department of education for academe because imagine the people i would have missed i would have missed you laughter i would have missed my students and there are quite a number here and even if they were not my students i would have missed people with whom i would not have had the privilege of coming in contact trying to pit one 's uh ability to think through a certain problem with another one who thinks he has a better solution i think that 's there 's nothing more exciting than that and then of course terrifying your students to quote laughter  tish last year she said terrifying your students to excellence uh let me look at my notes because you know at my age sometimes well it seems i 've accomplished everything the only thing i don't have is money laughter uh but that 's all right some day i 'll win the sweepstakes maybe uh somebody asked me well now you have accomplished practically everything what do you want what 's your next ambition and i said my next ambition is to reach my next birthday  laughter because we 'll listen again to a lecture like this you know  laughter  there 's something to look forward to so i 'll live one yea one day and one year at a time right so that 's my that 's of course i have many major and minor ambitions that 's a major ambition now yes a minor ambition is to make money it 's too late he laughs according to nanette uh here it 's too late that 's right it 's too late uhm about two weeks ago i got a proposal for a doctoral for a doctoral dissertation after reading it clears throat i called up dr otanes where 's fe is she here oh i 'm disappointed she 's dean of the graduate school and i said let 's postpone this uh this colloquium because we 'll have a colloquium because i 'm going to convince brother andrew and tish bautista to be members of the panel of uh of those who will question this girl so i asked them what time they would be available and they said they they would be available tomorrow afternoon at two so we will be at the philippine normal college tomorrow afternoon brother andrew and tish and i to grill this girl uh she 's here points  she 's there laughter on her proposal why because here 's a proposal here 's a girl willing to do something that nobody has ever attempted to do before and it is something that we should have scholars in in this uh field uh clears throat besides of course uh i didn't know too much about the subject it 's tish bautista who 's number one in the philippines today in that field and uh brother andrew is now a very close number two laughter, he also laughs because he 's so busy in the bulletin  laughter, he also laughs and and anyway so but when we find a student i think the most the thing that is good about teaching especially in graduate school is that when you  bec find a very good student that 's a gem you begin to become excited you know you want to to mentor this student you you want to to to  i i cannot describe to you what what joy you can get uh by by working with with a good student there 's there 's no nothing you can compare it with uh brother andrew has a uh has an expression which i will not say here because it is not said in polite company laughter, he also laughs  but that that 's what i mean you see without telling you what he said  clears throat  i 'm glad that i 'm very happy that tish talked about the classroom because i 've said many times i said it in fact about last month i think january four when i spoke at the philippine normal college without the classroom teacher without the classroom education will not will not take place uh the teacher when the classroom teachers of the city of manila went on strike not all the superintendents and the supervisors and the coordinators i don't know what kind of job is that coordinator not all these uh non-teachers could do anything to educate the children so the classroom is still you you have to go back to the classroom really to to get education going an uh oh the future i wish i were young again i wish i were i said last year i wish i were sixty but this year this time i think i wish i were fifty maybe next year if i will reach the one more year i 'll wish i were forty and conquer the world clears throat  so one thing that we are trying to do now actually in fact it seems my interpretation of tish 's lecture is that finally we are trying to find the problems in search of a solution you see we have many solutions uhm in fact teaching is when you face the class the first time you begin applying what you know you know the solution you never find out the problem yes uh that 's why so many pupils fail because we don't know the problem we have so many look at for example the first comment the first recommendation of the angara commission the decision is correct but the timetable is wrong why because they know the solution but they don't know the problem when they said that we are going to uh you know replace english in ten to fifteen years from first year to fourth year uh high school uh with filipino it just shows they know the solution but they don't know the problem they are like my clears throat when i had my my windshield wiper was not working so i brought it to the repair shop and i found a guy there trying to fix a car like that the lights would not go go out he tried everything he tried everything and then finally he gave up he knew the solutions but he didn't know the problem so i 'm very happy that uh we 're going to find problems and eventually find solutions coughs  you know if you will allow me to talk i can talk until tomorrow morning but i 'll not do that laughter  uh so uh by the way i was invited to talk on may eighteen on uh on the role of grammar on uh in uh the development of filipino but i 'm telling gani cruz isagani cruz here who is going to run this that i 'm not going to talk about that uhm the role of grammar as if i know the solution no what i 'm going to talk about is uh mga mahalagang suliranin tungkol sa pag-uunlad ng filipino   okay good laughter, clears throat  so my friends thank you very much for coming here taking your precious time and i know that at this hour to go home is uhm not only a problem it 's a compounded one and uh i 'm really honored with your presence and i hope that i will realize my ambition of reaching my next birthday and that you will come again well and i hope one more of my students will read the next lecture thank you very much applause   missing words uhm may i also thank all my friends here uh the moment you appear here you are my friend yes laughter, he also laughs like colonel ravina there whom i met and the lady i uh who sits beside him who is your sister-in-law uh your sister your sister okay your lecture dr ravina redi reminded me of many things i was reminded of that the most famous one of the most famous uh letters written in the teaching profession during the early days of this uh century uh any old teacher like me knows this uh story this uh there was this lady who turned in her resignation and uh uh said uh you know at that time every if you write to the division superintendent of schools it 's always the division superintendent of schools baguio and it 's always sir  if you are below if you are inferior in position you say  sir but if you are superior and you write to a teacher it is  dear sir or dear madam   and this teacher res tendered her resignation and said uh sir i have the honor to resignate because the salaries are too few and the works are too many and besides that the supervising teacher are always is always making too many lovings to me laughter now this is one of the most famous uh resignations in the annals of philippine laughter education uhm i do not know whether her resignation was accepted or not  laughter but it must have been he laughs  uhm errors errors errors uhm dr otanes who 's here who was my colleague at the philippine normal college once told me that english has not deteriorated because we always say the deterioration of english in the philippines  no english has not deser deteriorated and it is still there very good the peop the ones that have deteriorated are the teachers and the pupils maybe that 's true so uh now uh clears throat there is i think a difference between correctness of english and acceptability you mentioned about acceptability my favorite story or anecdote about this is about this man who worked in a shipyard and he noticed that during lunchtime nobody would like to have lunch with him all the other workers would group themselves and he would be left alone and uh uh one day he had the courage to ask one of his friends why is it that nobody wanted to have lunch with him and uh he was always left alone and so the man said brother do you want to know the truth or shall i tell a lie and he said uh tell me the truth look he said do you not notice in this dockyard he said you are the only one who is always saying those ships while everyone here says them ships laughter  so it may be wrong but it 's the acceptable thing so sometimes we are uh we don't know those of us who have taught english is it correct but not acceptable or wrong but acceptable that 's a that poses a dilemma 
Philippines	ms subido participants in this uh afternoon 's affair at the management of financial institutions good afternoon when uh mr anderson went to my office to invite me to be your guest speaker this afternoon i immediately accepted the invitation notwithstanding the very tight official schedule that i have because we always look at this opportunity to clarify whatever misconceptions people have about the bureau of customs  your written invitation requested me to say or to speak on the subject of the role of the bureau of customs towards nation building i don't know really if this is the real intent because if this is the one it will be much easier for me but maybe many of you here who are in one way or another has something to do with the bureau of customs either you personally or your parents or your friends who 'd like to know about the bureau of customs  i think all of you are students of economics and uh our economics textbooks tell us that the primary purpose of the bureau of customs is to facilitate trade  so that the revenue-generating function of the bureau of customs is only secondary however in a developing country like the philippines wherein the sources of revenues of the government is not enough to meet all the financial obligations of the government the bureau of customs is considered as a major revenue-generating agency  the bureau of customs is second only to the bureau of internal revenue in revenue generation for this year the original target given to the bureau of customs to collect is eighty-five point one billion pesos that is thirty-five percent of the expected revenue of the government  if you will compare this with developed countries percentage wise what is being expected from the bureau of customs is too much if you take for instance japan or the united states their customs services only collects about three percent of the national revenue of those countries you can see therefore that the bureau of customs is heavily burdened by our government to collect revenues  the expected revenue for this year was eighty-one eighty-five point one billion but the computations of this expected revenue were based on several assumptions first the assumption is the volume and value of imports which was estimated to be thirteen billion dollars  it 's also assumed that sixty-five percent of non-oil imports will be subject to tax and duties and thirty-five percent are exempted from the payment of duties and taxes  it was also assumed that the oil-import ninety-five percent will be tax-exempt will be subject to tax and five percent will be exempt from tax another assumption was the nine percent levy i think all of you have already heard of this nine percent levy will be applied for the entire year of nineteen ninety-one and that the dollar exchange will be twenty-eight pesos and fifty centavos to a dollar these were the major assumptions in the computation of our target however there are economic developments not only in the philippines but in other parts of the world that affected our economy for instance the gulf war another is the national calamities that happened in our country  so that sometime in july the target for the bureau of customs was recomputed and it was lowered to seventy-eight point five billion however as of last month september our planning institutions particularly the neda have come up that the most reasonable target for the bureau of customs this year is sixty-four point eight billion if this latest assessment will be followed we in the bureau of customs are very confident that we are going to meet our target as of now we just have to collect sixteen billion up to the end of the year to meet the target and the rate of import is very encouraging administration of the bureau of customs is not simply collection of duties and taxes if you are really interested on the role of the bureau of customs on nation-building in addition to the revenues that the bureau of customs collect for the government we have to consider the many services that we provide to importers and exporters you can see that there is a continuous growth of importation in this country even if we remove the effect of inflation in other words if we consider the real value there is a definite increase in the amount of imports in this country the same thing can be said about our exports the same thing can be said about investments of foreign businessmen into the country we can say that in the growth of import growth of imports export and growth of investment the bureau of customs contribute in the proper administration of all their activities let me start from the pricing of imports when i first joined the bureau of customs in nineteen eighty-seven our processing procedures required forty-two signatures before an importation can be released from the bureau of customs and sometimes it will take up to a month or more before an import can be released so the very first thing i did was to examine our import procedures and with the help of my staff we were able to reduce the number of signatures from forty-two to seven and the number of stations from fifteen to seven to four  so we really expedited the processing of import documents i ordered that unless there is something wrong in the importation they should be released within seventy-two hours upon unloading in our country this system that i have initiated we call it the non-stop processing in the release of shipments as we progressed we further improved our uh processing procedure we came up with what we call express processing in the release of shipment wherein theoretically import documents can be processed even before the arrival of the goods so that when the goods arrive in the pier they can be transferred from the ship to your truck to your warehouse so it is possible that a shipment can be released from the bureau of customs within hours upon arrival into the country this is our biggest contribution to the importing industry by facilitating the release of their shipment we have several procedure in the handling of exports we have also sy sys systematized the procedure so that exportation would be very easy for our exporters the second line of services that we provide is in the storage of raw materials in other words the bureau of customs supervises the warehouses that our importers and exporters operates in the metro manila area alone we have more than eight hundred warehouses warehouses of all kinds manufacturing miscellaneous public and private and garment it is the bureau of customs that supervises the operation of these warehouses before i came to the bureau of customs for every warehouse there is assigned a warehouseman a storekeeper that will account for the raw materials that they 're importing and they are exporting in view of the numerous complaints of warehouse operators of abuses committed by customs personnel and with the advent advent of computers we have adopted the what we call open banded system wherein the monitoring of imported materials is done through computers by account officers in our central office this procedure dispensed the services of a warehouseman and a storekeeper you can see that in almost everything that we do in the bureau of customs is to support our importers and exporters who after all are the prime movers of our economy we cannot point out a single project that supports economic development but we can say that in almost all economic activities in this country the bureau of customs has some participation so as you can see the bureau of customs is one of the most essential element or agency of the government but sad to say because of the very unfavorable image of the bureau of customs in the past and the very unsympathetic attitude of many of our politicians the bureau of customs is encountering so much difficulty in performing its mandated function for instance the bureau of customs last year collected forty-eight billion pesos but our appropriation was a measly amount of three hundred eighty-eight million there is not a single centavo appropriated for equipment maybe some of you have gone to the bureau of customs and you saw for yourself the very pitiful and miserable working condition of the bureau of customs for example in the manila international container port a port that collects about hundred ten million pesos a day is housed in a former warehouse i mention this because while so much is expected from the bureau of customs very little is given i think uh mr. anderson can tell you the appearance of the office it could not maybe even equal the office of a section chief of the g s i s or the philippine national bank but that is the attitude of our people they feel that because the bureau of customs is collecting so much money everybody in that agency has plenty of money and the agency as a whole is supported with the proper amount of money in its appropriation the bureau of customs is facing so much problems i have already mentioned to you the financial support  the second is public apathy and the corrupting influence of our society i say public apathy because many of our people know a lot of illegal activities of our importers and exporters but they would rather remain silent because they don't want to be involved or if they do they make anonymous letters to the newspapers or radio announcers accusing personnels of the bureau of customs or the agency as a whole for graft and corruption and yet they would not like to come forward to be identified  our newspapers are only very good in printing articles or stories derogatory or against the bureau of customs they have never taken pains to study and understand the many reforms that we have instituted in the bureau of customs to make it an agency useful to the economy and more responsive to the needs of the people dealing in the bureau of customs that 's why sometimes when i open containers involving irregular shipment i would rather not invite the press or the radio and television people because many people have already developed the impression that the main purpose of the bureau of customs is to catch smugglers if ever we are doing that it is only incidental we catch smugglers to protect our local manufacturers who are being prejudiced by the items that they are smuggling and to protect the interests of the government so that we can collect the proper amount of duties and taxes there are many other areas of the bureau of customs which i can discuss with you but as i told mr anderson i think it would do us better if i 'll just give an overview and you ask questions because by so doing i 'm sure that i will be addressing the issue that you are interested to know   like for example i don't know how many of you here would like to learn more about our anti-smuggling campaign how many of you here would like to know what are the measures that i 've taken to fight graft and corruption in the bureau of customs how many of you here uh are interested to know what are the things i have done to help importers and exporters and what are the measures i have done to improve collection efficiency in the bureau of customs and i said the topic which you wanted me to talk about is the role of the bureau of customs in nation-building and i can simply state that our contribution in nation-building is by facilitating trade so that our importers and exporters can conduct their activities in such a way that will promote growth and stability so i leave you at that i am prepared to answer any question about the bureau of customs clapping 
Philippines	okay can you hear me uhm i think that it 's very difficult for people to to just listen uh i think we 've spent too much of our time in classrooms where all the teachers gave us was the talk talk talk talk so i think i 'll just stay here this morning uh before we even begin to think about the possibilities for early childhood development in the media i would like to put a put it in a proper context 'no in terms of the relationship of children and media because as an educator i still think that nothing takes the place of hands-on parenting and hands-on teaching especially for young children so let me qualify with that premise right away at its best any form of media television radio cd-roms 'no books can only be a supplementary learning tool and uh in that way we have to put it in its proper place it can't work miracles it can only be like a good book a good an additional resource for a parent but the children today are growing up in an environment where media plays different roles for them it 's been called the surrogate parent it 's also word for the youth considered a touchstone by which they define their standards and recent studies among metro manila youth and even the the nineteen ninety-six survey of the s w s among filipino youth bares this out 'no  they spend more time watching television listening to the radio than they do interacting with their own parents and these are the youth from the ages of fifteen to twenty-four uhm we could also consider some some filipino youth who are in urban centers as trekkers of the information superhighway and we like to think that filipino children belong to a global village 'no but how how actively they are participating in that i i would question later on how do parents use the media maybe this also tells us how children especially now in urban centers spend more time than they should watching television and what 's on television  filipino children spend an average of three to four hours a day watching t v  this is a cartoon but it 's actually correct data because yes by the age of six that 's about the number of times a child would see murders our organization has just completed a study monitoring content of children 's television for the last year and both advertising and day time television contains not only a lot of violence but also a lot of sex sex sexist uh gratuitous or something that is beyond what is uh appropriate for children to deal with okay  what 's the media landscape like for filipino children we we say that they are uh media users we say that they 're media consumers okay if this if we were to take a look at it this is how it 's like  sixty percent of our youth are in the rural areas and what they have access to would be radio t v and v c rs which which we should not be taking for granted 'no  i was in ifugao just recently and uhm in the sari-sari store in the poblacion i had behind me several grade schoolers borrowing aksiyon pahiram nga ng aksiyon  so pagtingin ko ano 'yung aksiyon 'yung mga ramon revilla bong revilla movies 'no all the violent kinds of filipino movies so they 're no longer sheltered from those kinds of action movies they call them in urban centers you have everything 'no there 's access of course this this would depend on the socio-economic group okay in terms of access to channels we now live in a world of multi-channels we have many options 'no  cable is increasingly more popular among the middle class and upper class students or children uhm teenagers take in thirty hours of broadcast media and spend much less time reading okay  there are four four hundred ten t v programs now on air eighty-nine only are considered children 's programs it 's a very skewed uh balance dito uh for this ratio because children spend more time watching than adults but even when we were working on the children 's television act with secretary escudero the k b p was strongly against the provision to to compel uh all broadcasters to allocate fifteen percent of air time by the time we got to the senate so nakalusot 'yan sa house kasi pinilit ng mga congressmen by the time we got to the senate on the last before the bicameral conference they were still at it finally i said you say you value filipino children when you say form these organizations these networks because you uh value the quality of t v that should be given to filipino children but it 's lip service because you refuse to give even that fifteen percent so sabi ko puede ba ibalato na lang natin 'yan sa batang pilipino  but until now that 's still a thorny point 'no  so uh it 's still a question of how much time and what there is for children okay filipino kids watch twenty to twenty-eight hours a week which means a thousand up to one thousand thirty-four hours per year so by the age of thirty they would have spent four to five years of their lives watching television what a waste if what they see on television is like the cartoon i showed you wasteful okay so what about content 'no  what does television have to offer our children in our monitoring study that we did on what what children have now aside from the fact that seventy percent are imported meaning mostly american second japanese cartoons uhm dubbed also in filipino okay the others are re they 're mostly really the kinds of cartoons that are 'yung wacky type 'yung looney tunes type they 're the ones which the u c l a study a national television study did in the u s in in by it it 's the biggest national study of its kind they are the cartoons which are considered violent  'yung mga maya't-maya merong napipisa o kaya nadadaanan ng pison o sumasabog 'yun  uhm it 's not a problem if you 're dealing with children seven and above but if you 're dealing with children five and below and they have an overdose of those kinds of cartoons then you are in effect desensitizing them to that kind of physical aggression that 's the for me the biggest problem in violence in television is not the fact that there is violence because if violence has a context our own historical struggle as a people is very violent 'no  in batibot we had to uhm to show filipino ethics and there 's no avoiding the violent the conflict because that is the story of our that 's our collective history as a people but there is a context bloodshed had a context and there 's also a way of deemphasizing it rather than making it the major part of the story so the biggest danger really of children 's continued exposure to violence is that they become desensitized to it that it becomes a normal fact of life that it becomes the one best solution and so how do we deal with it if the content is uhm overtly violent or overtly sexual and children can take can only look at it out of context we have to take a pro-active stance and that 's what we 're trying to do in the last many years 'no  uhm batibot was born after sesame the philippine co-production of the children 's television workshop had to go to sleep or we had to put it to bed because the nineteen eighty-three political and economic crisis did not make it tenable to keep uh paying the children 's television workshop all those dollars 'no  so we looked at one another and said sayang 'yung natutunan natin  so let 's go for it premature but let 's give birth to a premature baby and nurture it so far batibot is on its fifteenth year and so we 've literally helped to rear to nurture a generation and uhm now i still meet college students as i 'm invited to speak to different groups and they tell me i grew up with batibot  and i ask them what was it that made it uhm you know meaningful to you or relevant to you many of them were saying that it taught me that i could be proud to be a filipino and i think if only for that we 've accomplished what we set out to accomplish  hindi ako nahiya magsalita ng tagalog o ng filipino okay i know that now and fuse specialists are very concerned about uhm the problem with english learning as an educator and especially in terms of early childhood development one of the most important developmental milestones is language learning and it is an asset for cognitive development if an individual has a dominant language even if you are going to be mul multilingual i i can take myself as an example i think i 'm quite fluent in english i speak two other languages in addition but my language is filipino my parents brought us up to speak filipino in the household kasi nagkataon pareho silang tagalog  if we were maybe ilonggos we would have spoken ilonggo but they felt strongly that we should have a good grounding and that grounding was important for cognitive development as i later learned in in my undergraduate and graduate courses why because you have a conceptual base language and thought are too closely interrelated if the language of the environment is your predominant language is also your dominant language then it is mo easier for you to strengthen that conceptual base  hindi ka lito  i have worked with college students who could not write a complete sentence u p ito who could not write a complete sentence in either english or filipino and i would say to them mag-desisyon ka nga choose one language and use it but use it well okay and i think uhm if we give our younger children a firm base in filipino from which to understand 'no para maging framework nila for understanding not only other languages but especially mathematics especially science which are really uh heavily reliant on cognitive skills then we give them a firm foundation for literacy and we give them a firm foundation for critical thinking and that is why the choice of filipino for batibot many years ago was deliberate it was not just a nationalistic fervor i was fully convinced as an educator that i must help we must help lay a firm foundation for that conceptual framework for that base from which children will make sense of their world language and thought the two most interesting and most critical uhm tools that only human beings have that 's the only thing that sets us apart really from the rest of the animal kingdom and every generation of young children must reinvent 'no the use of that language so uh that explains why until now if you think that batibot should be in filipino we 've developed a filipino chinese program called pin-pin to teach hokkien 'no to filipino chinese we are working on a program that will be for older children seven and above that will be about media literacy and that will be bilingual because we then i think from seven onwards it 's important to teach in a very systematic way both english and filipino to complement the school system but we give them that strong base  also it would be very incongruous to teach children for example among the goals of of batibot uhm is to teach children to value what it is to be filipino okay we want to teach them that uhm you can have a positive self-esteem and share it with other filipinos by appreciating first of all knowing knowing for example there are children or even adults who tell me 'yung bubot pala trumpo 'yun   alam n'yo ba 'yun 'yung bubot   bubot is a top it 's a top that ifugao children make and sabi nila sa batibot lang nila 'yan natutunan  or certain words like uh in nineteen eighty-five to eighty-seven we approached the department of environment and natural resources and we and told them you want to reach more people at the time when it wasn't really in fashion yet to be pro-environment and to teach about protecting the environment we said let 's do something on batibot okay uhm four years later so first we started with introducing some basic concepts and we looked at the most severe environmental problems first we teach is domestic waste  'yan ang main problem natin talaga 'no  we are probably uh the most inefficient and really uncaring in in dealing with our waste
Philippines	uh thank you dr quirino uh before i begin uh let me thank uh first of all fuse for extending this invitation for us to disseminate to you the results of our re  research for the past seven months and of course doktora  cortes uh the president of u e who was the one who recommended me to fuse so let 's begin the one you see uh in front of you this is an aerial photo of uh manila taken in nineteen ninety-six our project area is that uh area so let 's begin with the title the title of our project is potential initiatives for urban renewal of the university belt in the city of manila  as you can see this was funded by the u e foundation for research and advanced study through a grant from pagcor may i may i at this point introduce my co-study leader uh who 's right at the center environmental planner joel oa&ntilde;a so uh i think the word urban renewal has to be defined here what we mean this is really a development approach that aims to have a revitalization of the urban environment and what is very critical here is community participation to be able to ensure sustainability so let me go over very quickly the objectives of the study first we looked at what are the problems and issues and concerns in this area particularly in the context of urban renewal public-private partnership and community governance and then based on an understanding of what these problems issues and concerns are we proceeded to have uh to draw up a preliminary area development framework this led to the identification of the development initiatives when we say initiatives these are the some of the proposed programs and projects that may be implemented in this area so we also looked at what development schemes and policies uh that we could introduce to be able to have a renewal of the university belt and finally it uh aims to create awareness that 's why we have this dissemination phase and possible partnerships particularly among the stakeholders in this area so uh what would be the study area this is our study area actually it 's composed of six blocks covering fifteen hectares we begin with legarda going to claro recto nicanor reyes or morayta p campa then tortosa and m v de los santos we 'd like to clarify that the university belt is very very large and because of the largeness of the area we needed to have a pilot area of six blocks which is a doable area to demonstrate that the private sector can come in and be involved in this this is about thirty-seven percent of the land area of zone forty-one and this falls within the fourth district of manila now our conceptual framework uh there there are three essential elements of urban renewal that 's place people and partnership to be able to understand the place we did an area resource assessment and we will present the findings to understand the the capability of the people to undertake urban renewal we did an area capability assessment and based on an understanding of place and people we proceeded to identify what kinds of partnership may come about and as you can see the word effectiveness is in red uh that really means to say that to be able to have a successful urban renewal it is it is really premised on having effective partnerships on the ground among the stakeholders so what are the findings we did the study uh in terms of a survey of students of u e which is about a large sample uh survey the these are the three major uh there will be three major streets that will be shown to you so what did the students say how did they describe the area in the order of description based on the most frequent frequently given answer first it 's dangerous then it 's dirty it 's disorderly for the following reasons there are many criminal elements there 's an l r t two construction on-going there are just too many people who are loitering aloun around there 's a lot of garbage dilapidated buildings inefficient drainage leading to flooding there 's congestion of traffic unsystematic parking and basically noisy environment we proceeded to ask about other streets that are vital f dalupan was asked this is gastambide the old name the same thing emerged in the order of preferen in the order of frequency of answers it was described as dirty disorderly displeasing to the eye almost similar reasons given and the third one is s h loyola this is the former lepanto and r papa again they said this place is dangerous dirty and disorderly these are alarming answers coming from the major uh population who are frequenting the area which would be the students based on this let us uh we tried to validate whether there 's any basis for the students to say this or to describe the area so we did part of the area resource assessment is a physical and visual resource assessment so what did we find here we looked at it from both good and bad side as you can see we 're say saying there are arcaded sidewalks like these they represent very unique urban spatial character you don't always see these arcaded walkways in other cities but then what do we see under these uh uh arcaded walkways we see sidewalk vendors uh that are in the area we see breaks in the arcaded walkways so you get wet when you cross from one building to the other so basically there 's non- adherence of some buildings to the design of the uh as given in this area but then we looked at also are there historical sites here no matter how dilapidated the area is we did find some historical sites this is la gota de leche  this is a old old building nineteen o six which was used before as a feeding center and still continues to be one today and uh as you can see it is in a state requiring a lot of restoration and adaptive re-use this is found along lepanto now walkways we looked at the walkways there are there 's really no unifying design they 're all different now in terms of landscaping you can see some have trees some are waste baskets already and some are just grasses this is the state of the area now uh because of the lack of public spaces where students can congregate they tend to go of course to the shopping mall which is ever gotesco and fast food chains like mcdonalds jollibee and chowking so there 's really no open spaces or public parks where they can congregate now we did a pedestrian count we actually fielded counters on a straight eleven-hour basis just to find out how many people are walking in the streets claro recto has uhm about twenty-nine thousand eight hundred one people or pedestrians uh followed by r papa which connects f e u and u e and where you have p s b a and other schools about over twenty-five thousand and nicanor reyes or morayta which has about over twenty-five thousand pedestrians at any given date of a straight eleven-hour you can see that in the morning in rush mor uh rush hour in the morning between eight and ten r papa has the heaviest pedestrian movement and therefore you the reason i 'm giving stress to r papa is because we have program recommendations for r papa which connects a lot of schools now there 's another major uh thing there which is on-going the construction of l r t two this is the old sampaloc uh site which will be the l r t two station so it really cuts across and that 's the reason why the students are saying that this is really basically disorderly because of the construction and this will be operational by two thousand four next to the sampaloc market the next station will be the old bilibid prison a across quezon boulevard now what about the traffic you can see those big areas this is where you have the choke points and choke points are caused by indiscriminated indiscriminate loading and unloading queuing of  jeepneys at intersections there 's also narrow turning points like in this lerma junction and of course uh pedestrians dash across the streets so they don't get run down plus of course pedicabs  so this is a concern which is uh validated when the students say that it 's really quite dangerous to cross and a disorderly set up now there 's also flooding there 's also as as seen in this picture and also seismic hazards because this is very close to the quiapo santa cruz area which is a high risk area for earthquakes the u-belt really is uh because of the population size that traverse it is a high solid waste generator as you can see uh in this area this is a common sight where you have these kinds of uh environmental problems now we looked at the economic resource assessment as well and uh let us let me share with you the findings we did an actual establishment survey actually counting business establishments and there are about three hundred thirty-six uh business establishments the largest is services and this is understandable because they cater uh to principally to the students now in terms of the sidewalk vendors we call them the informal vendors they 're about hundred forty-one and they 're largely selling food and the others plus of course services like those uh of repair key duplication what 's the implication of this uhm when we looked at the establishments both registered and unregistered and we just looked at the universities along claro recto the ratio is very high there are about thirty-four establishments per hectare and about seventeen establishments per educational institution which means instead of having a dominant educational character in this area because of the presence of so many schools what is dominant is the commercial character so there has to be a bit of a balance we 're not saying we should remove commercial but it should be a bit more balanced than what it is today socio-cultural resource assessment so we looked at the people uh in the area and then we looked at the establishments here is a very interesting thing the university belt is very important it 's historically significant because this is where the pioneers of tertiary education chose to locate starting in nineteen o one with san beda and la consolacion this is the mendiola side across the bridge from mendiola you have the non-sectarian schools came about starting with the university of manila in nineteen thirteen in nineteen twenty-eight with f e u and u e in nineteen forty-six so really uh there is a lot of justification for having this renewed because of that historical significance in terms of tertiary education now furthermore uh when you see this area in terms of socio-cultural we found out that the resident population is very small it 's roughly only about six thousand and we 're talking only of the pilot area not the entire university belt and then uh there are about in the tertial tertiary level about hundred thousand transient tertiary students who don't live there no uh this is only considering eight colleges and universities so what 's the implication the of this having a very small resident population which is serving a very large number of students who are not in fact their students they 're not economically active the implication is there 's a very high social service and infrastructure burden imposed on the residents and local legitimate business through the tax system and you 're talking of garbage uh collection police protection traffic management road repair and improvement so what 's the consequence of this heavy burden when cost and capacity to pay for such services do not match coupled with the very highly dense daytime population you would expect that without serious efforts on the part of different sectors you will have a deterioration in the quality of urban services so you have garbage you have traffic you have flooding this is almost an automatic consequence of that so what can we what can we do actually uh this is the challenge that the researches pose because of the importance of the educational sector in the history of the university belt the challenge then to the affected universities is to take a more active role in the u in the renewal of the urban environment where they operate and here you have six universities and colleges a advance academy now has a new name it 's called saint john bosco computer school very recently it has a change in name the challenge translates to having the community partnering with the government to bringing about a better quality of life in the u-belt particularly for the students and the rest of the academic community there 's a further justification of why we should move because as we have uh as i have shown to you there are historical assets here there are also century-old institutions here like  colegio medico farmaceutico de filipinas university of manila the p u p rizal campus these have been recognized by the national historic institute and are already reflected in the historical markers book of the n h i therefore we 're saying preservation of the culture and heritage and this becomes another major argument for urban renewal in the university belt 1
Philippines	thank you for your kind introduction uh good afternoon ladies and gentlemen  today 's pa uh my paper this afternoon deals with the biological waste water treatment as applied to industrial and agricultural wastes as a researcher interested in waste utilization and in biotechnology as a biochemical engineer i have come to appreciate the conventional processes in industrial and agricultural waste treatment usually organic uh industrial waste water are treated by the activated sludge process while agricultural wastes uh by an aromic anaerobic digestion i believe that applying the principles of environmental biotechnology and biochemical engineering we can formulate more efficient treatment schemes prepares presentation material  i want to apologize if uh there will be some uh discrepancies because i did not have enough time to prepare because of the busy schedule during the past uh two months  basically uh this is the outline of my paper  i will discuss some considerations in biological treatment schemes with some comparison of the those used for industrial and agricultural waste water and then i will discuss some of my uh recent research works and how i will uh get some of the distinguishing or uh advantageous features which you can integrate and adopt for a new process or a preferred uh process that is we can use especially cultured microorganisms we can improve the bio reactors and uh we can advocate the use of anaerobic fermentation  now let 's have a comparison of the usual treatment schemes for industrial and agricultural waste water as i said usually the activated sludge process is used for industrial uh waste water of course these are for organic uh waste waters while uh anaerobic fermentation usually production of biogas is uh used for agricultural wastes we know that the activated sludge process is an aerobic process and needs uh oxygen while the for agricultural waste it 's commonly the anaerobic process that is in the absence of oxygen the activated sludge process needs tremendous power for aeration and agitation while in uh biogas production we have we can get methane that can be used as an energy source of course from uh the original design we have had modifications such as the trickling filters fluidized bed packed bed and in the same manner in the in agricultural waste water there have been similar uh modifications of co and uh the latest uh method is to immobilize or retain the microorganisms within the reactor  this is the conventional activated sludge process you have the aeration tank the clarifier and a resecretion system for the microorganisms  then the modifications this is the conventional uh activated sludge process an aerator and a clarifier can be modified to be uh to have a flood flow configuration or in terms of a tapered aeration step aeration or contact stabilization where most of the sludge is uh revived  the prime consideration is the aeration and here is where the expense uh of the process is then these are the different uh further modifications quite some departures from the original type you can have multi-stage you can have static mixers multi-tubes with recycle or with uh inte external recycle and internal recycle  one of the uh design that is used and is very effective is a deep shaft process whereby by using a depth of uh as as high as fifty meters the solubilization of oxygen is higher  now the aerobic treatment or as it is called the bio methanation process can have the traditional biogas systems the example in particular here are those from uh china and then the different modifications you can see from the batch in a similar manner the development follows that of the activated sludge process first you can have uh from uh from the batch to the fed-batch to continue a system stirred and complete flow now uh also the the same uh principle in activated sludge is the retention or the recycling of microorganisms so in this case you can have more efficient digestion by collecting the sludge or the microorganisms and recycling them and so on up to a modification of the sedimentation tank called the clarigester again with the fluidized bed and then the late the the in the seventies we have the uh high rate anaerobic filters such as the anaerobic filter you can have an up up flow where uh in these processes the microorganisms are retained by support materials can also have step processes and of course for uh solid waste you can use landfill  now let us uh compare ana the aerobic and anaerobic treatment the aerobic process proceeds in the presence of oxygen and leads to the mineral mineralization of the organic matter into carbon dioxide and water and some of these are used in the production of the sludge or the microorganisms while in the anaerobic process the organic matter is reduced to ethanol methane acetate and butanol because of the use of aerators the aerobic process is energy intensive less energy is used by the anaerobic process and in the and it also produces extra energy the metabolism in aerobic process is faster so that microorganisms multiply very well in anaerobic uh fermentation microorganisms grow slowly because of this we have faster reaction rate in aerobic processes while slower in anaerobic process and this leads to shorter retention time in a aerobic processes usually uh eight hours and longer retention times in anaerobic process could be five to ten days so while the energy uh requirement is the major expense of the aerobic process the size of the anaerobic uh treatment plant is lar is uh larger  now the next consideration is the use of uh uh especially cultured microorganisms the activated sludge process or even uh the anaerobic digestion uses naturally occurring microorganisms now we can speed up the process by using cultured microorganisms we know that the fermentation process is due to enzymes and if we can employ enzymes from uh efficient producers then we can speed up the reaction usually we can get as a result faster reaction higher loading rate formation of sludge is rest and sometimes uh some of these microorganisms are facultative so that you can cut off the oxygen supply some hours in a day for energy savings now these microorganisms are available commercially  and this is an example of a commercial product used for treating uh for instance phenols uh phenol containing wastes biphenols waste containing organic solvent residues aromatic hydrocarbon  so when the for the activated sludge process the problem is when the wastes contain poorly degradable substances or synobiotics and other toxic compounds some uhm microorganisms can treat this for instance pesticides uh chloroaromatics or even oil uh containing uh waters can be treated  now the by using these especially cultured microorganisms we can improve the performance of activated sludge process but then we still need to provide the energy for aeration now if we are able to use anaerobic processes then uh the expense for aeration will be eliminated and actually the anaerobic fermentation should have been the vogue of the researches in nineteen eighties however it was overshadowed by the development in genetic engineering where aerobic processes for uh some uh biochemical substances have been used so this is to the application so it is expected that in the future beginning in the nineties the use of the of anaerobic fermentation will be the more efficient process now i will present some of my researches that is directly related to this and uh in the future i have already have plans to go into this uh research that is anaerobic fermentation for instance in production of acetic acid this is done by uh fermentation or uh the oxidation of ethanol we know that in biogas production there are microorganisms or bacteria that produce acetic acid but of course the problem is how to speed up the growth of these anaerobic microorganisms now i will present a case study on the treatment of waste waters high in phenol content as i have said the microorganisms are available commercially however the technology to utilize these microorganisms is either not available or they are very expensive so even if you buy these microorganisms which cost around one thousand pesos per kilo you will not be able to use them  now uh there is a company in the philippines that produces two-four d two-four dichlorophenoxy acetic acid as a herbicide this is the structure  this is the manufacturing process uh two-four d is produced from uh the reaction of two-four dichlorophenol and uh sodium the sodium salt of uh chloroacetic acid and in the process this is neutralized with sulfuric acid and this is where most of the pollutants come from the high acidic high acidity uh between one and two p h and the unreacted two-four dichlorophenol and the chlorophenoxy acetic acid now uh in this process this rest which is just the modification of the two-four d acid produces little or no waste water at all so the problem of the plant is really in this portion this is the waste water characteristic and uh you can see the c o d up to fifteen thousand which is uh non-biodegradable very difficult to degrade the phenol as high as five hundred parts per million very high uh i mean very low p h and uh these are the major pollutant  now i did some uh experiments in batch processes and uh these are the characteristics of the microorganisms available commercially you have to supply it with fertilizer ratio ten to one for every one hundred parts of c o d  now this is some of the results obtained up as high as uh ninety-eight percent reduction of phenol but however you can note the length of time requires about four days of course this depends on also on the amount of microorganisms so we can go maybe twenty-four between twenty-four and thirty-six hours  the c o d is reduced up to ninety percent now from the result of these batch studies we came out with a process similar to the activated sludge uh process where we have the we neutralize it first aerate then clarify and return the sludge however we encountered problem  that is due to the size small size of the microorganisms it will not settle it will be difficult to recycle them it will just overflow with the effluent now we we found the solution that is to simulate the activated sludge process or another uh alternative is to condition the activated sludge to high phenol contents but then we have to dilute the waste water by six hundred times  the solution used is that we can use activated carbon powdered or silica gel to use as a carrier or support material of the microorganisms now the 1 word are provided so that they are easily fluidized by introduction of air and then we can recycle this carrier and some is disposed or reprocessed we did this by designing this type of aerator which is essentially a plug-flow uh starting feed and this uh providing a clarifier which will recycle part of the microorganisms and then continue into the third uh compartment going to the effluent now this is uh the uh plan view neutralized waste water goes in these are the aerators clarified here and then the sludge is returned while uh some goes on to the next stage finally clarified and the effluent uh polished we were able to get the final uh phenol content to as low as one or point five p p m  this is uh the result with uh using support material and that is recycling we got uh almost similar result in this manner we can retain the microorganism and recycle them  we were not able to uh construct the original set up plan but in this case we had three containers or three stages with uh recycling in each stage  you can see foam uh while aeration and in fermentation you can tell the microorganisms are happy if foam is forming now we had this uh first the design parameters we used this is now for the treatment of the plant usually we we estimated this using the parameters for activated sludge because uh for the process the we have no basis yet for the design and according to this estimate about uh one million over one million or at the cost now it could be two million
Philippines	today i decided not to speak on education because it 's i think over-discussed over-talked and still no action so it 's there is a sense of frustration on my part that despite the very familiar and well-known problems of education in this country not not much in terms of policy change in terms of uh of reform initiatives have taken place and uh so i said i 'm going to choose another topic which also affects in a way not directly but affects in a way our educational our education our standards our or or the state of education and that is corruption e corruption in our country  i have a powerpoint = presentation here like like dan 's introduction it 's also a summary also a summary presentation this will not be the last word on the state of corruption in our country but i 'd like to sketch to you in general terms the magnitude of uh official and political corruption in our country and uh how in my mind it affects the the even the direction of our country so let me begin by saying that the stench of corruption is the only constant it seems in our public life for every peso for every peso spent on infrastructure projects and the procurement of goods and services you know public bidding for goods and services between twenty to fifty centavo of that peso is lost to corruption so if you have a let 's just for simplicity a one hundred peso road that road is only fifty peso worth so very very shallow and one night of rain will be washed away  now this is the this is an official study an official study conducted by the world bank not just of the philippines but of uh of several member nations of the world in uh last year you see the magnitude of money of public resources lost to official corruption in the last twenty years forty-eight billion u s dollars and as of twenty o one that would have been sufficient to pay off our debt our foreign debt you know i attended an anti-corruption conference in ottawa in the middle of october one of the resource persons is the president of the world institute which initiated this study and gave an overview of corruption in the world and i really sat so embarrassed because he cited us specifically as one country that has not done anything to stem the tide of corruption well this is familiar data the transparency international a berlin-based monitoring and surveillance agency last august issued this  sur this uh finding our country is the eleventh most corrupt among one hundred two countries that places us in the same category as paki pakistan  zim zimbabwe and romania i think that this uh level of corruption is also eating up into our competitive status into our competitiveness because another study by the world economic forum which is a geneva-based uh uh group of uh businessmen that holds regular fora all over the world came up with this competitiveness 1 word  last year we were forty-eight number forty-eight in the competitiveness ranking today just one year later we have dropped to sixty-one a change of thirteen thirteen levels the same group the world economic forum has a public institution index and the components of this index is how we administer contracts what is the state of our law the independence of the judiciary etcetera  and the other is the corruption level how do we rank in the public institution index last year we were number sixty-three today this year barely a year we have dropped to number seventy so the the pace the pace and and character of corruption in our country is is on a rapid decline rather on a rapid rise now how much does our country lose every year in terms of purchase of goods and equipment and the commissioning of civil works that is the calculation not by us the opposition that is the calculation of our own department of budget we 're losing twenty-two billion pesos a year bec on account of corruption in the public bidding process what can twenty-two billion do this is a rough translation of what twenty-two billion a year if we have that can do well it can we can build forty-four thousand seven hundred new classrooms we can buy twenty-four million new books we can purchase four million desks and acquire forty-four thousand computers new computers so if we can only save on what we lose through corruption i think this perennial school crisis that we encounter every school opening of lack of classrooms lack of teachers lack of desks and textbooks can be alleviated we i think we we remain the only country in the whole of north and south east asia with the largest class size our class size is averaging fifty-five to sixty pupils per per per class china with one point two billion pesos should be people  has a class size of only thirty-two thirty-two pupils malaysia malaysia and singapore of course they are relatively prosperous has a class size of nineteen so that that measures the magnitude of the lack of basic basic uh needs of the education sector in our country now but what can we do should we just uh uh tell each other and relate this sad story to each other and not do anything what can be done as a practical doable way i suggest that uh this i think this can be done number one we must strengthen the oversight function of congress unfortunately our people the public doesn't doesn't think that  congressio that congress could be a redeeming factor which is quite unfortunate and that congressional investigation helps but in in any in any parliamentary democracy congress oversight function is an effective deterrence to public wrongdoing of government so we we ought to to do this and strengthen the oversight function of congress we must reform the the public bidding process of our country the the bidding process of our country which requires a pre-qualification uh stage then a main main evaluation is so designed that it can be easily manipulated for instance my own experience in the department of agriculture when we were bidding out not just millions but billions of pesos for irrigation projects shows that in the pre-qualification process itself you can already favor the contractor you want somehow they 're able to to arrange that a favored contractor and a favored contractor is usually one who can give the most is chosen even before ahead of the main evaluation of the uh tenders so i have filed and i am i have we are now debating in the plenary a government procurement reform act and this essentially this essentially contains the the following requirements we are now going to announce bids not just in a newspaper but uh but in the internet we 'll put we 'll post it on the web site every government agency must post it on the web site this practice of putting a floor also deprives government of the opportunity to get really the best price because usually the the floor set the floor set is generally higher than what the market tells us we 're going to prohibit or at least regulate the so-called price adjustments and change orders what what does what does this mean when you are a contractor you will bid and you will submit probably a ridiculously low low bid and under our rules since the lowest bidder is the is awarded the contract then i will get the contract but after we 've concluded the contract i will ask the agency to change i will submit a change order or the agency will submit a change order and it 's not unusual that the original bid which won can be doubled through these change orders and price adjustment the classic case of that is the so-called diosdado macapagal avenue it doubled not because of the original bidded price but because of change orders the contractor won it because he really underbidded everybody and by our rules he he got the contract we 're now going to impose a five-year warranty which there is none as of the moment a contractor can build that road to your village in one year it may be wiped out by the rains and he 's not liable at all even if you can demonstrate that he put in less gravel he put in less cement and finally this open and competitive public bidding as i said tenders now will be placed on the internet on the web site anyone anywhere in this country can bid so we hope that uh by making public bidding more open and more transparent we would at least reduce the incidence of under-the-table and corrupt practices the third uh the third area of concern to us is campaign finance in this country you can really pinpoint the business interests the businessmen who regularly finance electoral campaigns whether for president or senators or congressmen or and maybe i am exaggerating but sonny knows this there are regulars they 're professional fund uh campaign donors year in election after election they are the regular regulars but when you are elected as a result of the support of this these few who do you think you owe your allegiance or your loyalty do you think you can really introduce radical and structural reform in business in the society if your funder or his interests will be hurt but that is the traditional state of campaign finance in our country but there is a new even more sinister funding source and that is the gambling and the drug and the drug lords  jueteng lords have always funded especially the local elections but we 've seen that even national elections have been supported by jueteng lords and we 've tolerated it i think and we have not made any outcry at all up to now but we are seeing drug money going into the electoral uh system and to me that is that is so dangerous and that 's why that 's uh we i i put together with other senators a campaign finance reform act and i 've convinced my colleagues in the house to file it too that will may not eliminate it totally but at least bring it out into the open compel candidates and donors to disclose their donations in the same manner that many countries outside the philippines have done so consistently and uniformly in the past two or three years we 're the only country now remaining without a campaign finance reform act because when you come come to think of it maybe the state of politics in this country is such because we 've not taken care of the way we are financing and choosing our leaders and if unless we do something about it i think we will be perpetually held hostage by vested interests gambling and other illegal activities syndicates as well as drug drug lords now let me go back to effective oversight  really if uh if our parliamentarians realize the the good that can be achieved by the proper exercise of of parliamentary oversight of congressional oversight i think we will we will it will serve a very powerful deterrence to wrongdoing in government but unfortunately as i said you know people don't look very kindly on congress and on our investigation and that 's why it 's important that we invest our congress that quality of integrity and credibility otherwise we will never we 'll never be able to effectively provide the check and balance that we need in in our country and also that means that the committees and and its staff must be well-trained and well-motivated i 've been to to several international fora discussing all this and i 'm really quite impressed at the efforts being exerted by many parliaments by many governments in providing support in terms of training and resources to to parliaments and and the professional staff which we are not doing in this country  now let me clears throat go back again to the political parties we must also worry about the political parties because political parties both in theory and practice is supposed to be the the screening mechanism by which we select potential leaders of our society and of our politics and supposed to provide the training and the orientation to them that 's not being performed by any political party in this country because as you very well know and i 'll repeat the trite remark political parties in this country are more factions rather than genuine political parties based on ideology based on programs it 's more personalistic than you can ever find i just attended over the weekend an international conference of political parties of asia and uh and uh many political parties in asia except the except the totalitarian states really have a competitive party system they look to the parties to to influence the course and content of public policy and through their selection of the present and future leaders they really make a big impact on the society now what is the bane of our political parties apart from the lack of ideology why is it that it 's so easy to leave your party and join another the yung balimbing star fruit, a many-sided fruit, reference to turncoatism i think that 's unique to us i think that that 's also a function of the of the political system our political system is a winner-take-all system uh pag natalo ka talagang talo ka e = if you lose you really lose you 're wiped out and all the all the patronage and the advantages go to the winner who now dispense the perks and the pork barrels but that 's not i think the main goal of of the party system just to patronage and all but yet that is how it operates in our country 3
Philippines	thank you very much and good afternoon uh how many of you are familiar with n l p already anything that you know about n l p  okay uh spelled out 'no we use n l p to really mean neurolinguistic programming and when we talk about neurolinguistic programming this involves looking into the nervous system okay and when we talk about the nervous system we focus on the five senses that i hope you remember from your grade school years what are the five senses  bakit kayo sa touch nag-uumpisa ha laughter  okay touch okay sight hearing taste and smell 'no  okay the idea here is that we get in touch with the world and we experience the world through the five senses and this is what uh the neuro aspect of n l p refers to so we become aware of the world we become uh familiar with many things about the world and then we respond to the world in terms also of these five senses that we have okay now the linguistic aspect focuses on the fact that we use language whether consciously or unconsciously internally or externally to represent this experience of the world that we have like for instance 'no when you 're feeling warm internally you may be saying ang init naman you know then nagpapaypay ka  or for instance uh a very handsome man passes by 'no you may not really be saying it verbally but internally you might say ang gwapo you know like that so whatever comes in contact with a part of your or with one of your senses gets to be linguistically represented 'no  okay and then the programming aspect means that we really systematize our responses to the various experiences that we have so we systematize 'no we encode and we decode certain uh messages now as we grow then some aspects of responding become patterned that 's why it 's already programmed 'no we are sort of programmed okay now uhm so that 's what basically the three words would mean now simply speaking n l p says really that this may be the world that we really have 'no  okay this is the world that we really have but we may not experience the world as it really is if this is the big world which we might be able to respond to actually we just make representations of the world or we make maps or models of the world 'no  okay uh if you think about a model airplane what comes to your mind huh something what that looks like an airplane from the outside but it 's a small version so it cannot really function the way a real airplane would 'no  it cannot fly or perhaps if it flies only within certain parameters or only within a certain period of time and it may not be able to accommodate passengers just as the real airplane would be able to 'no  so in a way when we make models or maps of the world the models that we make may resemble the real world but may not actually possess all the faculties or the functions of the real world okay now so supposing uh you there are three of you one 's model of the world may be bigger the other one 's may be smaller and the third person 's model may be even smaller now the smaller the model of our world is then the less it approximates or the less it resembles the real world you 'll notice that 'no  a globe is a model of the world  hindi ba 'yung globe has all the countries of the world and the the shapes and all that but the smaller the globe is 'no the less countries it can contain 'no  maybe the philippines might not even be found in that small model or the small globe so that is it 'no  people develop different sizes of the models of the world the problem is some people 's model of the world may be so small 'no that it really incorporates very little of the big world and the smaller our world model is then the more tamed we can be the more problems we have okay now what makes the world model small or big 'no  maybe we can talk about it being smaller than the actual world model because there are constraints that we experience what are some of the constraints of the uh modeling process 'no  one would be that we have nervous system constraints uh there are neurological constraints like for instance 'no if i ask you right now right now at this point what are you aware of okay  okay can you enumerate what you became aware of  you 're aware that you 're hungry okay what about you what are you what were you aware of when i asked that  having a lecturer in front of you and what about you okay you were aware that you were listening 'no okay so three of them had different areas uh speaker stutters uh where they were aware of or speaker stutters of which they were aware 'no  now uh the thing is there are many things that you could have been aware of at that given moment 'no  like uh some of you might have been aware of this microphone stand or the podium or the box here or the tables there the chair the chair there the lights the sound of the air conditioner the picture over there the people around you you could have been aware of such things because they were in existence during the time that i asked you what are you aware of 'no  but see some of you were focused or uh just one or two items at that given moment 'no  according to the proponents of uh neurolinguistic program gramming bundler 'no and grinder we can be aware only of seven plus two chunks chunks 'no seven plus two chunks of information at any given time so bale a maximum of nine information at any given time 'no  like and we say chunks  like you can say i am aware of this specific person this specific person this specific person you 're saying i am aware of people i am aw that 's a chunk of information i am aware of chairs 'no  i am aware of the sound system rather than different sounds specifically 'no  so at any given time we will only be aware of seven plus two chunks of information therefore our nervous system already limits 'no  what we do not become aware of do not become part of this world model okay now we are also limited by our language 'no uh like some of you may be coming from one region another a few may come from another region and you might have different dialects 'no  let us say somebody is somebody is from iloilo 'no and he 's talking to a tagala 'no okay now this ilonggo had a very very uhm fantastic experience 'no  and as she is describing it in ilonggo she can describe it very very well in very very specific more felt ways but then this tagala says i cannot understand what you are saying you translate it to tagalog and then when she translates it to tagalog mahi nahirapan siya or the meanings of the experience are lost already  parang it doesn't sound so good anymore like for instance 'no when you say in taga let 's say the tagalogs 'no in tagalog you say nalulungkot ako 'no  that 's tagalog 'no  when you say nalulungkot yeah there 's a certain element of sadness and you just feel that something is missing something is lacking 'no  but if a person can say nawiwindang ang puso ko 'no it has it gives you a different feeling  di ba   nalulungkot there 's a certain sense of sadness kasi something is missing something is lacking but nawiwindang means there is something more actively eating you up or devastating you 'no  that 's why when you say i 'm sad rather than i am devastated it has a different meaning now if you cannot use the more accurate terms to graphically describe your experiences your world model may be smaller okay now for instance i ask you what 's another word for snow   ano yelo   ano pa   nieve   ano pa   trinanslate n'yo na sa different languages  o ano pa  okay  tayo 'no we have a hard time really translating some people would say another word for snow is ice  but you make an image of ice and you make an image of snow are they the same  hindi ano   di ba   ganyan  but the eskimos 'no okay the people from alaska they don't want to be called eskimo anymore so the people 'no from the cold cold place 'no have seventy different words for snow so alam nila kung ano 'yung snow 'yung pwedeng paglaruan kung ano 'yung snow na pwede nilang i- expose ang sarili nila puwede ring uh lumabas 'no or go out only for necessities or don't go out at all they know which kind of snow would be harmful by the use of the different terms but we cannot find a synonym for snow because we are not exposed to snow at all okay that is the linguistic uh constraint 'no  and we also have what we call individual constraints in this world uh building 'no  okay why because we are individuals we have unique experiences and we have unique interpretations of the experiences so our individual histories can affect how we will view the world like for instance 'no uh if you have a girl who grew up in a family tha where the father was very loving the mother was very caring 'no and she felt very much loved and you have another girl whose father abandoned them when they were young and whose mother committed suicide or attempted suicide several times 'no  who would have a better outlook about relationships with the opposite sex the first one 'di ba   kasi siya 'yung tingin niya ah maganda ang marriage maganda mag- fall in love you will be happy and all that but the other one may huh i 'm not saying automatically she would 'no but the other one may be very skeptical or very cynical about the permanency of love or the fact that love really exists 'no  so ang tingin nila ang ang world model nila would be different 'no  the other one would say oh being in love is a beautiful thing marriage is a beautiful thing but the other one may say marriage is a dangerous thing 'no  so that becomes part of their world model okay are you clear okay now those are the constraints that i said would affect the size of your world model now there are also what we call uh the universals of the human modeling process for instance i say to you can you complete the sentence a man with a moustache is can you answer that can you complete that sentence a man with a moustache is uhm for you is old is mature-looking uhm is big  okay what about this gentleman   is different okay what about the one beside you a man with a moustache is  just for you don't ask anybody is bad  next masculine is not a woman okay laughter   kanta 'yan ng apo hiking ano uhm  o ano pa ha   good looking okay  scary okay  dirty-looking   old okay you notice that i asked several of you 'no  two people answered old one answered mature looking someone answered uh cute i heard it i overheard it somebody said scary somebody said bad somebody said good looking 'no  okay you have a different kind of response 'no for each person now when you see na therefore 'no depending upon the response that you gave when you see a man with a moustache what is the likely response that you will have or reaction that you will have 'no   pag sinabi mong scary or bad 'no kahit na sino pa siya basta meron siyang bigote matatakot ka or iiwasan mo pag sinabi mong macho lalapitan mo 'no cute lalapitan mo di ba kahit ano pa siya this is what we call a generalization 'no  we are saying okay you 're answering once when a man with a moustache is cute but when you really see men with moustaches are they really cute all of them no di ba  okay are they really all bad  hindi naman 'no  are they really all scary  hindi nama  are they really all macho  hindi naman 'no  so you will notice that there is a really really a difference but the thing is sometimes we have a generalization 'no  we generalize that just because a person has this attribute or an experience occurred then it will have the same outcome 'no  like for instance one generalization that we can have is this kunyari naglalak umaakyat tayo ng hagdanan ano tapos nahulog tayo 'no tapos nabalian tayo okay then what happens every time that you see that staircase what happens  natatakot ka na 'no nag-ge-generalize ka na na komo nahulog ka noon mahuhulog ka na naman hindi ba  and you forgot perhaps the one hundred times before that you climbed up that staircase and you did not fall you only remember that particular time that you fell that 's why every time that you approach that staircase medyo sumasakit ang tiyan mo o kaya ingat ka hawak 'no you really hold on very very tightly 'no  okay so you generalize
Philippines	you know uhm laughter i just wanna say thank you for uh inviting me over to share with you a little bit of myself uh more than just my music uhm i can see that uh all of you are uh uh crowd 's noise  you know i hardly audience replied  is it okay if i just talk from here okay lang 'no because uh i do have some i i wrote down some things that i 'd like to share with you and it will be easier for me to just use this if that 's okay with you okay lang  okay crowd 's noise  okay uhm you know before i begin i just like to tell you all that when i got the invitation to come over to speak to all of you it was uhm a very big surprise 'cause usually when i 'm invited to come over to the d l s u it 's usually to perform but tonight it 's not uh this afternoon is not a performance you know i 'd like this to be as casual as possible and later on i 'm opening the floor to whatever questions you might have or whatever questions you might want to ask me i don't want it to be you know like a forty-five minute talk on just you know a one-sided talk i want it to be you know like what it says you know a dialogue first of all i 'd like to introduce myself i 'm gary valenciano and the reason why i wanna do this is because sometimes or most of the time people say you know and now here he is without any further introduction but actually there 's a lot of things i 'd like to share with you i 'd like to give you a little background on who gary valenciano is first of all i 'm uh the sixth of seven in the family there are two boys and five girls uhm i 've been a la sallite since nineteen seventy-one i studied in the states in nineteen seventy-nine and i came back in nineteen eighty and i entered uh la salle greenhills again in nineteen eighty-two i joined the kundirana la salle greenhills choral group and it was the beginning it was the start of a new chapter in my life that has been going on since then nineteen eighty-three i entered de la salle taft and uhm it was also in nineteen eighty-three that i turned professional in my singing career nineteen eighty-three also was the year where i met my wife angeli and uh that 's also another chapter that has been going strong ever since then in nineteen eighty-four i did my first movie and uh which was entitled hotshots and i did my first uhm major concert entitled gary v live at the araneta coliseum and then nineteen eighty-five uh well nineteen eighty-four also introduced reaching out into the airwaves nineteen eighty-five i joined the tokyo music fest and di na natuto came out in nineteen eighty-six paano huwag mo na sanang isipin uh and take me out of the dark uh started being played eighty-seven eto na naman  eighty-eight was a u s tour and a u s album that i recorded eighty-nine take me out of the dark again was uh aired notice 'no from eighty-six to eighty-nine it was only in nineteen eighty-nine that take me out was really played on the airwaves in nineteen ninety uhm the songs look in your eyes and each passing night and songs like that came out and major impact was staged uhm in nineteen ninety-one i had the privilege of performing for the very first time uh at the amphitheater in los angeles i recorded another album this time in japan under toshiba e m i records to be released on june of nineteen ninety-two and you know i can go on you know i 'm telling you all the wonderful things that i 've gone through now some of you may ask how does gary v do it or some of you might have you know why is gary v telling us you know giving us all this information about what he has accomplished well definitely this is not being shared with you to impress you with the things that i 've done because frankly speaking this was not done by me you know this was all just given to me it is my way of revealing to you the secret of my success and maybe impress you with the one who has given me all this and much much more for one who never used to dance or write music or play any instrument you know like me and received you know and yet received all this one cannot help but say to all who wonder and who care to listen that one that the one who takes full credit is christ jesus himself and no other he has been the sustaining force behind all of what you see and hear of me today he is the rock that my family is built on he is the one who has put me and my wife together and the one who will keep us together through all the ups and downs that life has to offer he is the one who has given me my music he is the rhythm of my soul and he is the one who has given me my fans and my friends like you and he is the one who has come not just for people like me but for you as well and i guess this is what you 've always heard of gary v you know uhm uh having this kind of relationship with the lord but i can go on and on and on talking about it but i know that there are questions in some of your minds about my faith about the industry about uh what the future is for gary v about what the future is for the industry and that 's why i 'd like to open up the floor you know for you to ask any question i want you all to treat this like not uy you know we 're getting to meet gary v but  i mean i 've been around for nine years now and i just want you to treat me like the way you treat any friend of yours you know if you have any question just ask i 'm opening up the floor now we 've got enough time and uhm then later on you know uhm if it would be possible i 'd like to you know render you with one number clapping  but before laughter but before that but before that uh i just wanna say one thing uhm you know when i entered show business in nineteen eighty-three there was no expectation of lasting this long in show business because excuse me because to be honest with you i never really used to sing when i used to sing uh in nineteen seventy-nine i used to sing over i mean hindi pa uso ang minus-one when i was in the states and it was a very traumatic experience for me when i lived one year in the states that i got to listen to the kind of music that i believe has molded my music today and i was singing over the voices uhm that was already recorded and so i 'd send it home to my sisters and my father and i 'd say hey listen to my tape and they couldn't hear my voice you know uhm obviously because i was singing i didn't have the technique and the style yet but i came back in nineteen eighty you know and i entered de la salle i mean i entered la salle greenhills kundirana in eighty-two and still you know there was no expectation there was no dream of becoming a singer or a performer there was no idea in my mind there was no there was no uh uh picture of of gary v performing on a stage like one that you 'd see in uh at the ultra or at the araneta coliseum there was none of that and i never used to play keyboards as a matter of fact i still don't know what i play i just play and obviously this is not again 'no this has not come out of my own doing because i don't practice every day i just you know when i when i dance it just comes out with the help of my choreographer from the maneuvers who you all know and these things uh honestly i don't you know when i come out on stage i don't think okay i 'm gonna do this in this part i 'm gonna do this in that part it it just happens and that 's why i cannot contain myself from sharing with you the reason and the secret of my success so if there 's any question that any of you would like to ask you know i 'm i 'm open to any  don't be shy if there 's anyone who 's supposed to be shy it 's supposed to be me 'cause i really don't come up and talk like this not often at least you know but i 'm talking to uh fellow la sallites and for me that 's the hardest crowd to uh relate to i don't know why but i always feel that way  okay okay the question is did i did i ever have any formal voice lessons no i never had any voice uhm uhm professional vocal training all i remember was in the kundirana we 'd rehearse from six to nine every night including exam week and i guess that gave us the not the not the the the technique or anything like that because i think each singer was able to develop his own but because of that training every night from six to nine there were nights i 'd come home i wouldn't have a voice and my my father would be so alarmed what 's happening to you and all that but it helped later on you know now i can really go days on end you know with hardly any rest and yet perform maybe not a hundred percent but i still have the voice here a question was asked  yes laughter  i know you go ahead a question was asked  i 'm sorry you can go ahead you can use the mike student asks  what made me turn to god actually actually there was no intention to look up and to turn to god because there was no need to at that time so i thought this all happened in nineteen eighty-five and in nineteen eighty-five some people consider it to be still my biggest hit 'no uh di na natuto came out that song was played in the airwaves for more than seven months and was on the charts for more than six months and i felt because of all that i had gone through in life prior to this point i felt wow for the first time i did something on my own and really there was no you know it was like i looked up and i said yeah okay i know you 're there but hey i did this on my own so you know you can just leave me now i 'll be okay and if i need you i know you 're there for me it was that kind of a god that i had pictured in my mind someone who i could just run to when i had problems i didn't realize that he was there from the very very beginning even through all the trials now just to give you some trials that i 've gone through  in nineteen seventy-nine like many of the kids today like many of all of you like many of you rather well some of you rather might have family problems and might have homes that are separated that 's exactly what happened to me in seventy-nine it was also in nineteen seventy-nine when i discovered that i had diabetes i came back and in nineteen eighty-one my house in makati burned but that was a blessing in disguise 'cause i moved to san juan and there was a piano there and i again would practice two hours every morning not knowing what i played you know just this sounds good and that sounds good
Philippines	thank you owen that 's a funny name for a for a girl  i 'm not used to using the podium so i hope you don't mind if i just move this aside can i sit down okay uhm first and foremost i 'd like to thank uh the organizers of this activity it 's an alter alternative class program it 's uh interesting to note that uh despite the fact that you have your classes you uh put put aside 'no your regular academic uh requirements at least for an hour and a half in order to come up with discussions on issues that are not necessarily well academically rel you know uh incli uh what do you call it are not necessarily academic in nature i 've always believed that uh you should not let your academics interfere with your education in other words uhm education is not limited to the four walls of your classroom i suppose many of you know this but then we are in another classroom but this time we 'll be we will be discussing the first quarter storm as was requested by the organizers what is the first quarter storm does anybody have an idea it happened some twenty-two years ago most of you were not born yet i was still in i wasn't even in elementary i 'm still young but i 'm not as young as you are so so don't don't think that i belong to the the era of the first quarter storm 'no  no i don't if at all my only recollection of the first quarter storm is that we used to live in u p village and that 's uh very lose to the u p diliman campus and i was playing in our in our garden and all of a sudden i smelled tear gas and we all ran to the house cry we were all crying at least we were four or five because of the tear gas and we were wondering what the hell that was of course nobody told us that uh u p the u p diliman campus was in fact invaded because of the diliman commune anybody familiar with the diliman commune well the students decided to take over the university after a five centavo increase in uh in transport rates were hiked 'no were raised uh were imposed by the government you can imagine how volatile the situation was but that was one part of the first quarter storm what is the first quarter storm well twenty-two years ago at uh this time there were massive mobilization there were several mobilizations 'no massive mobilizations of students and youth marching in the streets calling for radical reforms and changes in our country that was around twenty-two years ago from january to around march wave after wave of student protests engulfed the entire country leaders like edgardo jocson nilo tayag uhm chito santa romana ericson baculinao uh student leaders were actually marching in the streets calling for reforms in the country that was twenty-two years ago some of you are probably asking what so what 'no  so they were marching in the streets and uh that 's good or is it good why discuss the first quarter storm in the first place why are we here discussing it today after twenty-two years well you it will be a surprise to some of you perhaps many of you are also familiar with it and i suppose many will agree when i say that reforms are still very much necessary even up until today the problems of poverty the problems of social inequality the problems of social unrest or the roots of social unrest which were actually the uh reasons for the mobilizations some twenty-two years ago they still exist today except that perhaps there are some uh qualitative changes in terms of population in terms of gravity of the problem or incidence of poverty but the reason why students marched in the streets over two decades ago and the reasons for poverty and hunger and unemployment that that exists today are very much the same 'no   naroroon pa rin   naroon pa rin 'yung usapin ng kagutuman naroon pa rin ang usapin ng kawalan ng hanapbuhay   ngunit 'yung first quarter storm ang namuno nu'n ang mga mag-aaral ang mga estudyante  i suppose none of you will debate with me when i say that our country is in a rut right i mean we have problems right grave problems poverty incidence is seventy percent seven  what does poverty incidence mean what does that mean 'no  you have to earn something like four thousand pesos uh uh monthly and you still belong to the poverty line and the minimum wage is way way below the poverty threshold in other words the workers and the professionals at least as far as minimum wage is concerned will have to work two days in order to be able to feed an average family of six for one day because as far as neda is concerned i think the minimum wage is one hundred uh eighteen uhm right one hundred eighteen during my time five years ago it was only sixty-four 'no  but then neda says that for an average family of six in order to provide for the basic the must basic of needs food shelter clothing he has the family must earn something like two hundred forty to two hundred sixty pesos a mon uh a day so that 's where we are now the uh per capita income of uh the philippines if you are to compare it to other countries in asia ours is something like seven hundred dollars per capita hong kong is something like eleven hundred dollars china is something like uh no i i stand corrected uh taiwan and uh japan japan is something like twenty-three thousand per capita  so you can imagine how 's how far behind we are uhm indonesia is something like five hundred and uh bangkok is something like eleven hundred 'no much higher than four hundred dollars higher than our per capita income and that 's already malaysia malaysia too 'no around thirteen hundred we are lagging far far behind in nineteen sixty-two we were only second to japan in terms of uh development today we 're second to bangladesh in terms of underdevelopment  many of you are perhaps familiar with the power shortage at least in mindanao we 've we read about it the water shortage which we expect in uh the summer months the power rates are being increased  the incidence of violence is also a a a concern perhaps some of you are familiar with c p lopez who was a student here maureen hultman is another uhm leny villa the incidence of violence and the victims of lawlessness and violence in our country on a daily basis kidnapping has been has been uh is already syndicated eldon maguan was shot dead simply because he couldn't back out his car and most of them if you will notice most of the victims are are from our ranks from the youth there is still social unrest very much even in the countryside the insurgency continues to take its heavy toll on our people marag valley for example there are problems in our country there are grave problems in our country and we are in the process of trying to i hope formulate solutions to these problems the i m f world bank continues to burden us with a foreign debt service uh agreement that allows for close to both local and foreign debt close to around forty percent of our national budget goes to debt service both local and foreign but they say that the local debt ballooned because of the need to service our foreign debt so forty percent of your one peso instead of buying food instead of buying medicines instead of buying the necessary needs the necessary the basic needs of our people we have to pay debt service tough luck for those who cannot afford medicines and they happen to be the majority in our country the incidence of poverty when you say poverty incidence there are three factors 'no indicators seventy percent of the of our people live below the poverty line and there are three indicators of what the poverty line is one you can only afford two square meals a day two if you get sick you cannot afford medicines and three two changes of clothing in a week 'no  that uh indic these are indicators of the poverty line and more than half of our population find themselves in such a situation not to mention of course the fact that many of our people the unemployment rate is so high i think the underemployment rate is something like thirty-five percent and the unemployment rate is somewhere between ten to fifteen percent it 's no wonder why most of our people have to go abroad to find work there they end up becoming prostitutes in japan chambermaids in singapore house domestic help in malaysia and contract workers in saudi arabia i mean why is this this is this happens because our economy is unable to provide for necessary employment and the decent wages and hence our people have to go abroad have to be separated from their families and have to be subjected to the most cruel and inhuman conditions in certain areas of course to us the youth what the hell do we care for studying we hope to get a good job especially d l s u if you are a graduate of d l s u it 's you know it 's like a ticket to i don't know where laughter a ticket to a a a good paying job in a multinational corporation we are students we are reviewing we go through our daily work daily homework daily assignments but the situation in the country is there too environment i failed to mention the environment perhaps some of us are familiar with the massive destruction of our forests if we continue to log the way we 're logging today by the year two thousand virgin our virgin forest cover will be gone a friend of mine took a trip to isabela cagayan the cagayan province in isabela province rather from here manila up to isabela is something like eight hours and he counted the number of trucks that were covered with uh what do you call it 'yung canvas 'yung illegal logs for eight hours he counted just one day and that 's the average on a daily basis who can give us a guess as to how many trucks hundred twenty hundred he counted hundred eighty-seven trucks  that 's on a daily basis the movement which i had which was mentioned earlier national movement of young legislators we are a an organization of city municipal and provincial uh elected officials who are all young who are to a certain degree idealistic 'no  isabela our regional assembly in isabela came up with a position for total log ban two days after they received candles telling them not to interfere in the logging that is being undertaken in their province it was a death threat each of them received uh a a candle i don't know how big the candle was but it was a candle but the level of of destruction in our environment is so great that we might end up in an uninhabitable hell in the future the present generation does not really benefit much or will not really be affected much because in fifteen twenty years they will not be here but we will and we will be here inheriting whatever is left of the continuing destruction of our environment the pollution in metro manila is two hundred percent more uh is higher than the acceptable world standards so of course many of us go home in our air-conditioned cars we 're not familiar with the pollution why don't you try it one day  buksan n'yo  and others of course who take the jeep would know this once you get to your house you clean your nose you know you think gosh where did all that black particles come from but that 's pollution for you anyway all these problems we encounter some of us are perhaps more familiar to this pro about these problems than others the question is the first quarter storm was in fact a mobilization of students and youth in order to address societal ills the ills the problems of the country who here would say that our country is is in a heavenly position i i suppose no one but who here is willing to really act on the problems many of us will say as students and i 'm a student too yeah right i 'm a student too i 'm just on leave 'no but i have eighteen units more to go
Philippines	good afternoon to each one of you i 'm so pleased for this occasion that i would be able to share with you some significant findings which i gathered from my visits to different libraries and also from my study that i personally conducted regarding uh a topic which became my interest when i enrolled in neuropsychology under the p h d counseling uhm program of d l s u now this interest in brain research stayed with me until now so much so that i try to devour all those different sources of information that i can take hold of because we know that the brain is the most important perhaps you would say the heart but the most important organ in a person as some doctors and different instruments will be able to sustain life if our heart stops to beat or if our lungs stop to function but let the brain stop for a moment and we will be pronounced clinically dead now teachers have been for several years looking for ways of improving instruction to accelerate learning to make unders to make understanding among the students be as simple as what they want it to be so much so that many researchers have focused on different correlates of academic achievement to mention a few school-related student-related family-related what have you 's only to find out that still our state of education is at a deplorable state in his own words secretary former secretary onofre said there is a seemingly deteriorating quality of education and no amount of changes in the curriculum seem to be able to help improve this deplorable situation and so uh this triggered my curiosity suppose we try to study something that is really directly related to learning and that is the brain that 's the background of the study now brain research actually started one hundred or more years ago however it is a relatively new phenomenon in the philippines so much so that in nineteen ninety carvajal a local educator said brain dominance technology is new in the philippines but nonetheless teachers must be familiar with the research findings regarding the brain because the learning styles of students are dependent to some extent on the kind of processing that their brain does okay however the cost of inviting lecturers who would shed findings and programs anchored on brain research is very prohibitive groups would give as much as okay they will give lectures but it would cost as much as twenty-five thousand for a group of twenty-five people to uh a staggering amount of two thousand pesos per participant as a result only very few schools only the affluent ones are able to go through this training program actually in the philippines the first school in southeast asia is one of the high schools in quezon city exclusive school for boys they had this training on integrative learning which is anchored on brain research and they found out that students are able to learn much more easily than before however i have not known yet any other school that has gone through the same training program okay so with this backdrop let me present my research  uhm perhaps a presentation of the structure of the brain at this point may appear off tangent but it is necessary for me to do so in order to situate my presentation okay now the brain actually is a grayish pink uh object somewhat having the consistency of a porridge hmm and crumpled like a big walnut it weighs not more than thirty pounds but it has a great capacity because that is what it is designed for however a little used brain just like little used muscles will deteriorate so in spite of the size of the brain it has tremendous powers and it has it has to be tapped okay now the most important part regarding the brain insofar as education is concerned will be the different functions that have something to do with learning  and so may i present to you two views of the brain one view is called the triune brain and the other view views it from the viewpoint of a bicameral brain so let 's start with the triune brain  this is called the triune brain because it consists anatomically of three parts  we have the neo-mammalian the neo-mammalian or the new brain or the cortex then we have the paleo-mammalian the one at the middle or the mid-brain  and the reptilian brain or the old brain okay of these three brains the most interesting perhaps to educators will be the neo-mammalian or the cortex because it is the seat of all learning in fact it is the only part of the brain in human beings which differentiate man from animals even the largest of primates the chimpanzees and the gorillas only have as much as less than one third of the neo-cortex that man has now actually the paleo-mammalian is the brain that sends messages to the neo-cortex it serves like a secretary so that it processes first what should be acted upon by neo-cortex and prioritize all incoming sensory stimuli the reptilian brain is the old brain and this is the seat of all uh the basic drives of men hunger okay strong emotions so that when it is electrically charged a person would scratch and bite like an animal that is why perhaps it is not surprising why biting and scratching are common among the young children in the nursery school because perhaps the reptilian brain is still strong in them because of the lack of socialization that is needed to be able to tame these animalistic drives now what is important with the triune brain is that the neo-cortex if stimulated with new stimuli functions more effectively than not now the bicameral view of the brain presents it in terms of consisting of two halves  viewed from the top it is divided into the left hemisphere and the right hemisphere actually this is part of the new brain or the cortex even though they look symmetrically the same as if one is the exact image of the other they perform differently so their functions are asymmetrical however there is communication ongoing between the two halves of the brain so that one knows what is taking place in the other brain and this is made possible by means of a nerve tissue a big bundle of nerve tissues here consisting of more than two hundred million nerve cells that makes communication between the two brains possible now perhaps we would ask why is it that the two brains function differently and how come these differential functioning of the hemispheres of the brain are known so may i trace very briefly the history of how brain dominance as it is called now or brain laterality 'no has been discovered  okay the first insight into the possibility that the brain consists of two different hemispheres each functioning differently uh was done by broca paul broca a french scientist and surgeon who had a patient who lost his ability to talk or to speak because of an injury to the left brain okay when that patient died his brain was operated on and it was observed that there is a defect there has been the injury in one part of the left brain so that made broca think perhaps the left brain is the seat of language and another patient with the same problem died and they also found the same injury in the left brain however this cannot be verified by operating on live people although the brain is not sensitive to pain it is the only organ perhaps aside from the nails and the hair that do not suffer does not suffer pain okay however uh in uhm in one university uh spencer together with his associates tried to perform surgical severing of the brains the two hemispheres of the cortex among cats and then followed by monkeys and they found out through their experiments that the two hemispheres of the brain really function differently now in nineteen cen sixty-one okay uh spencer was able really to perform this kind of operation on a human being the purpose is not actually for the pure sake of experimentation but because the patient is suffering from epilepsy and it was thought that to separate the left hemisphere from the right hemisphere through surgery will prevent the spread of epileptic seizures from one hemisphere to the other okay and there were others other patients with the same condition their brains have to be severed in terms of that hemispheric laterality in order that they could be saved or they could be cured with regard to their illness now these patients now are literally called split-brained patients and the experiments that were done regarding these split-brained patients really confirmed what broca had found earlier or had by in by intuition discovered earlier that the two hemispheres function differently now what were the tasks that were done along this line  one technique that uh was done by sperry and his associates made use of special instrument called tachistoscope in this procedure with the use of the instrument for a brief second of time a visual stimulus is presented to the patient to the split brain patient okay the time has to be that controlled otherwise the left and the right eye will help each other understand what the object is the study is such that the object is presented first to the right or perhaps to the left but it has to be presented only to one visual field of the patient now the anatomy of the person is such that the left brain controls the other side of the body so the left brain controls the right hand the right eye the right the right uh foot and so on and vice versa so that whatever object is flashed to the right visual field of the patient will be projected to the left hemisphere and whatever is projected to the right visual field will be absorbed by the by the left hemisphere now they found out that the visual stimulus that is presented to the right visual field which is projected to the left hemisphere could be named readily by the person the person can tell the name of the object but if that object is presented to the right visual field which is projected to the i mean to the left visual field which is projected to the right hemisphere the person cannot give the name of the object and this is true also for the other patients so they say then the language center must be in the left brain okay however if the object is given to the patient okay without looking at it together with other objects by feeling it with the left hand the person is able to say to uh to select what he sees in the picture from the objects given to him or to her so that means that the left hand which is controlled by the right brain is able to understand visual uh relationships spatial relationships and so they say perhaps the center for visual analysis of relationships reside in the right brain  now that kind of study can only be done for split-brained patients it cannot be done for normal people because normal people still have the corpus callosum that connects the two brains and so they have to verify this among normal populations just to confirm the localization of functions of the brain for this purpose they use what we call the e e g pattern analysis okay or the electro encephalogram pattern analysis by which uh certain mechanisms are attached into the scalp of the person this is registered in the galvanometer pen and then it is printed in a piece of paper in the form of waves okay and revenson identified four different kinds of waves that could be picked up from the electric activity of the brain  these are called the alpha wave the beta the gamma the delta and the theta  this will be of particular interest to educators because one of these waves if developed among the pupils will develop their ability to be creative and intuitive
Philippines	good afternoon to everybody my students and friends  uh allow me to use this microphone because i 'll be reading some notes and be going to the overhead projector to show you some slides  so first of all i 'd like to uh correct that i am a doctor a specialist 'no  so right now the highest educational attainment i got is uh an m s in environmental engineering and also a i 'm a bachelo bachelor of science in chemical engineering graduate not a b s chemistry graduate i 'd like to thank the organizer of this symposium uh which is likas  uh for those who are not familiar this is the lasalista para sa pag-iingat ng kalikasan uh and i 'm very happy that uh they have organized the ecology week to make us aware of uh our role and our responsibility as protector of the environment so i was asked to present a paper or a lecture about air pollution in the urban scene and fortunately when i was given notice about it in the the last week of october i was already preparing a paper for next week uh international conference on environmental protection in big asean cities and uh wha the paper that i will be presenting is a paper entitled air pollution study in metro manila so it was just very timely that i have the paper uh being prepared so i consented on giving this uh lecture to you so some of the data and notes that i 'll be presenting next week will already be given to you in advance okay  so uhm so the topic i prepared for you this afternoon is air pollution-related problems in the urban areas there are a lot of pollution problems we 're experiencing right now but uh the one tasked of me to present to you is on air pollution because there are many forms of environmental degradation 'no and one form is uh air pollution but specifically we 'll be talking about air pollution in the urban scene uh there are so many problems that arise through air pollution like photochemical smog and right now we are experiencing global climatic changes the greenhouse effect which the adviser of englicom already mentioned okay and some other uh related problems will be discussed here  and maybe at the end we can present some solutions and your suggestion will be highly appreciated later on because in next week 's uh international conference there will also be a workshop where maybe some of the suggestions that you will be handing on or recommending today will be incorporated okay  now what is air pollution and what are its effects first the national pollution control commission now called the environment management bureau under the department of environment and natural resources or d e n r defines air pollution as an undesirable change in the physical chemical and or biological characteristics of air which will adversely affect plants animals human beings and even inanimate materials now what is air pollutant it 's also called air contaminant and it is defined as any substance not normally present in air so it 's not normally present in air there are a lot of gases which we will show later normally present in air or it is also defined as these substances measured maybe present in normally in air but their concentration is greater than their normal concentration so they 're also considered a pollutant okay let us take for example carbon dioxide carbon dioxide is normally present in air in a certain normal quantity but right now it has been shown from researches or findings and is already documented that carbon dioxide is increasing at a rate of uh about one to three percent a year and so therefore uh we are already experiencing global climate changes or global warming due to it so we now consider it carbon dioxide as a pollutant because it is now present in the atmosphere greater than its normal concentration now what are the normal substances present in air if we look at table one on a dry basis the composition of clean air is shown is that very clear by expressed in percent by volume we have the second column and in terms of parts per million we have the third column so these are the normal composition of clean air it 's on a dry basis thirty percent of the weight of air is water vapor but this is on a dry basis so let 's take for example carbon dioxide it is normally present at three hundred eighteen p p m but if you exceed that right now it 's about three hundred seventy-five p p m okay it 's already above what is normally present then carbon dioxide in excess is already an air pollutant okay  there are different classifications of air pollutants and later on you will find out that among these there are five major pollutants identified to be ever increasing in an urban area okay and these are carbon monoxide the hydrocarbons the nitrogen oxides the particular matter and sulfur dioxide but table two will show you the different classifications of air pollutants so air pollutant may be classified as inorganic gases organic gases and particulates under the inorganic gases we have the oxide of nitrogen okay and we have typical examples of this pollutant in air also under inorganic we have oxide of sulfur we have sulfur dioxide sulfur trioxide oxide of carbon and other inorganics like hydrogen sulfide hydrogen chloride ammonia and chlorine are also considered to be inorganic gases that are uh considered as pollutants under the main classification of organic gas we have the different hydrocarbons okay we have methane butane etcetera we have the aldihydes and the other organics and last classification fall under particulate matter we have solid particulates in air and we have also liquid particulates a best example of a solid particulate is lead this is one of the related problem right now is the lead accumulation in air we will be discussing that in detail later on there 's also smoke which comes from the tailpipes of our cars considered to be solid particulates and then of course we have the liquid particulates like the acids suspended in air and of course mist spray etcetera so among all these pollutants present in air i mentioned five major uh pollutants that are of concern for us in the urban areas we have sulfur dioxide nitrogen oxide inor uh rather uh carbon monoxide hydrocarbons and particulate matter now since these are ever increasing in the urban area what are its effect on us on animals plants and inanimate objects  carbon monoxide is derived in urban areas from automobile transportation may account to over ninety percent by weight of all carbon monoxide in the air in large cities especially if retail heavy industry is present so we obtain or carbon monoxide in air comes from mostly or mainly from transportation okay carbon monoxide has a bad effect on health it passes through the lungs directly into the blood stream it has a toxic effect caused by the affinity of the hemoglobin in the blood for c o molecule what 's the function of hemoglobin hemoglobin functions to carry oxygen from the lungs to the body tissue so it provides the oxygen to the from the lungs to the body tissue since carbon monoxide combines with the hemoglobin strongly it prevents the carrying of oxygen to the tissues so it is easy therefore to understand why in heavy traffic or congested traffic we experience headaches and dizziness okay especially if our cars are not air-conditioned okay maybe some of you have air-conditioned cars you may not experience this kind of uh symptoms sulfur oxides are primarily sulfur dioxide and sulfur trioxide they are derived mostly from stationary sources like power plants and industries by the burning of fossil fuels sulfur oxide in the atmosphere produce deleterious effect on vegetation materials and man leaves of affected plants show splotted bleaching pattern so the leaves of uh trees and plants changes color it 's being bleached by the presence of sulfur dioxide in the air  also sulfur dioxide dissolves to form sulfuric sulfurous acid sulfur trioxide dissolves to form sulfuric acid you are familiar with these strong acids these suspended acids these are the liquid particulates they are suspended in air are washed down during the first rain when it rains they 're washed down so what will happen it causes damage okay damages to what to properties like metals vegetation and textiles because nylon and other fabrics are easily attacked by these acids these are called acid rains that 's one of the related problem we will also be discussing at the end acid rains can corrode metals attack nylon and other fabrics it affects also plants even limestone and marble are susceptible to acid attack so don't say that uh marble or limestone cannot be corroded okay they are degra degraded okay because of the reaction of these material with acid rains sulfur dioxide acts an irritant and is known to increase symptoms of patients with bronchitis and other lung diseases hydrocarbons are mostly derived from incomplete combustion or partial oxidation of fuel in motor vehicle found in the urban areas so if our engine like what ms chua mentioned in her introduction if we don't tune up our engine so uh oxidation in our engine of the or burning of fuel inside our engine becomes incomplete or partial so if you burn c h c x h y with oxygen some of c x h y remain unreacted so not not all are converted to c o two or c o plus water but some are unreacted c x h y so this is one of the source of uh hydrocarbon in air the incomplete combustion due to ma maybe improper air to fuel ratio tuning or timing of our engine forest and vegetation also emit various hydrocarbon in their normal biological processes okay example are bacterial decomposition of organic matter produces methane gas man also allows hydrocarbon to enter the atmosphere by allowing industrial solvents to evaporate when you are you are putting on your gasoline in your gasoline tank 'no some of the gasoline evaporates so this contributes to air pollution and also the processing and usage of petroleum because of the wide variety of hydrocarbon emitted it is therefore difficult to generalize their effe their effects on man however reactive hydrocarbon plays an important role in smog formation this will also be discussed later on uh also certain hydrocarbon like benzoate pyrene has been linked to cause cancer  particulates are complex acids and liquids found in our atmosphere they are placed in the atmosphere by natural emissions like volcanic eruption or from man-made processes in industries like grinding and spraying fly ash from combustion processes and from automobile of all the toxic metals found in air lead is present in the biggest concentration so we will focus later on on related problem lead on problem of lead accumulation in the air now lead comes from the burning of gasoline where it is added as anti-knock agent so it is an additive in gasoline so when you when they blend the gasoline they put it in the gasoline station they already have lead in it uh because they use it as an anti-knock agent then oxide of nitrogen or nitrogen oxide generally referred to as n o x okay are generated mainly by automobile and the electric power plants the most significant environmental effect of n o x emission is its role in smog formation  nitrogen dioxide and nitric oxide are known to cause fading in acetate cotton and rayon fibers yellowing of white fabrics has been shown to occur in the presence of nitrogen oxide nitric oxide is not an irritant and its main toxic potential results from its oxidation to n o two so what is an irritant is n o two not nitric oxide nitric oxide is n two o
Philippines	well uh good morning everybody i also would like to thank you for the privilege to speak in here even though i was informed only yesterday i really enjoy talking to students about computers that 's why since uh i don't have any commitments at this time i readily accepted the the invitation i really enjoy talking to students well as far as the career opportunities in computer science or computer application to be more specific is concerned well let 's answer first this question let 's go first with the demand 'no maybe you want to ask yourself okay i think uh i understand that you are freshmen and sophomores here so maybe after two or three years will there be a job for me in the computer industry the answer is a definite yes okay as early as as late as nineteen eighty-one the demand for information technology people so i 'm using the word information technology to be more general i 'm not using the word computer science 'no  i 'm using the information technology because uh this is the term we use for people who are in the computer industry so you 're not necessarily it 's not really required that you be a computer science graduate in order to be part of the computer industry as long as you are working with computers you are part of that industry so the demand for information technology specialists or people is placed at about thirty-five thousand 'no  that was in nineteen ninety nineteen ninety-one and at that point it was estimated that less than forty percent of the companies here are computerized so the demand is already thirty-five thousand and yet only forty percent of the of our entire industry is computerized so if you try to place it wherein if uh we place the level of computerization to one hundred percent then probably if there 's a direct relationship between the two the demand would rise up to seventy to eighty thousand professionals now is that number big or small you might think eighty thousand parang napakaliit  maybe by the time i graduate puno na 'yung eighty thousand na 'yun  okay let 's again look at figures let 's just look at la salle probably just the college of computer studies because i don't know the exact population of the other programs with uh major in computer applications so if you look at it the the college of computer studies can only produce about three hundred graduates a year so try to see that with eighty thousand so three hundred out of eighty thousand i think you can compute already the percentage there and la salle is already considered as one of the the biggest school in computer science meaning to say our population 'yung three hundred na 'yon malaki na 'yon  ateneo we accept about uh four hundred freshmen a year ateneo accepts only about one hundred u p about roughly the same figure so if we combine all computer schools 'no there are only a few uh universities and colleges offering computer-related programs probably we 're only producing uh about one thousand that would be an optimistic figure one thousand information technology specialists a year so just think thirty-five and then eighty thousand so definitely by the time you graduate maybe the demand for eighty thousand may not be even filled by twenty-five percent and maybe just perform an experiment just look at maybe on a sunday maybe you buy a newspaper uh then look at the jobs required you will see there uh usually b s in whatever required the age so on and so forth pleasing personality and then at the end computer those with computer background will have an advantage okay so definitely in terms of your question of the demand yes there is that tremendous demand and even up to now we cannot even fill it up and we cannot really expand there has been pressure for the college of computer studies to expand its population but with our limited uh campus size and facilities we cannot do that right now there are about one thousand eight hundred students in our college and we cannot grow uh beyond that unless that we find some other campus to build a new building so your question about the demand yes you are needed now the other question is if i 'm not a computer science graduate can i make it in the field of computers again the answer is yes okay especially in your course uh it 's uh b s math if you choose b s math with computer applications you also have an advantage i myself am not a computer science graduate okay i virtually don't know how to program when i finished my degree in e c e that was well they mentioned already the year that was in eighty-four i 'd like to say eighty-eight or something but uh since they mentioned it during that time when i was taking up my computer courses we had only a small machine a p d p eight which right now i think you can buy a calculator that is much more powerful than that machine and it was considered alrea already during that time a mini-computer 'no  and they were only teaching us basic so if you look at my knowledge when i graduate compared with the knowledge that you will have when you graduate i think you are in a better position than i was when i graduated way back in eighty-four and yet i was able to uh enter this particular field okay because uh comput the the beauty about computers is that you don't need really a b s c s degree in order to succeed in it 'no  people have been studying computers ever since in fact if you look at it the very first computer professionals were not even b s c s graduates because wala pang c s program la salle was the first one to offer a b s c s program and that was in nineteen eighty-one and computers were here as early as the sixties and the seventies so don't have that apprehension that hindi naman ako computer science graduate i am basically a b s math graduate therefore i cannot make it in the industry but like i said you will have several units of computer subjects so you will be in a better position than most students who will be graduating with just a plain degree without any major uh as far as computers are concerned so as far as that question naman is concerned yes you are needed by the industry so don't worry about not being a c s graduate okay so you have already the the only skill really needed okay in computer science is or computer applications or computer industry is logic formulation okay of which you will i think it will be taught to you in one of your programming subjects and uh i 've looked at your curriculum and uh i 've seen that most of the computer foundations are found in your curriculum that means you will have that necessary background in order to enter the information technology field of course i already suggested this last year when i gave the same talk uh if you uh entering as a programmer will be no problem as far as you are concerned because you will be given the fundamental theories in programming but being la sallites i think you are worth more than just being programmers okay the mere fact that you were chosen uh about we accepted about two hundred two thousand uh freshmen all colleges 'no two thousand out of possibly ten to twelve thousand applicants that means you are capable okay of being of being of doing more than just mere programming so the the nice thing about this talk is that i 'm doing it now for freshmen and sophomores so at least you can prepare yourselves 'no  if ever you do decide to take up this major okay i would suggest uhm if you want to raise the level of your computer uh literacy you can also take up some courses that are not offered in your curriculum okay or you cannot you don't really have to go through a formal uh schooling as far as computers is concerned i myself never really enrolled formally in any uh school when i learned everything about computers okay i started my masteral degree in eighty-eight so between nineteen eighty-four and eighty-eight it 's just self-study so you may want you may opt to do that or we have a a program here the impact program it 's an office wherein they 're offering short term courses so for example if uh i i would suggest fields like systems analysis and design okay that is a field that is that is again another area wherein we need a lot of people there so you 're not really when you say systems analysis you 're not really programmers 'no  you just study the system and then develop some sort of algorithms wherein you want to improve the system and then the programmers will just implement your suggestions we need people like this so they have a good course there in systems analysis and design so you may want to especially during your term break 'no uh of course i 'm not suggesting that you be nerds that even your term break would be spent on studying but if you have nothing better to do let 's say on a summer then maybe it 's worth your time if you want to spend okay a little time of your vacation in taking up courses like this at least it will prepare you 'no probably in your third or fourth year you may want to do that 'no uh amidst maybe the difficulties of your thesis you may find some time in undergoing courses like this it will be helpful definitely 'no  the other area that you may want to go through would be uh familiarization with mainframes 'no  we have a mainframe here the forty-three eighty-one although if you look at the trend now in the industry mainframes are sort of like pass&eacute; 'no uh everybody is going into smaller machines let 's say four eighty-six machines and then just connecting them in a network as opposed to the expensive mainframes so your question might be why should i study mainframes 'no  but in the context of the philippine computer industry majority of our the companies here are still using mainframes okay they cannot just junk it and then replace them with newer machines because they already invested millions of pesos so definitely in order for you to succeed in the philippines as far as computer science is concerned then maybe a knowledge or a background in mainframe utilization would be helpful okay so again impact will have well i 'm not from impact so don't think that i 'm commercializing them i 'm just like giving out suggestions 'no  although maybe your organization math circle may come up with an arrangement with computer services center wherein maybe they can come up with uh simple mainframe fami familiariza familiarization seminars okay for you people somewhere in your third or fourth year okay because we have a mainframe here and of course you are free to use it as long as uh the utilization during that time is quite low and of course i would suggest if you have let 's say a personal computer at home then maximize its usa its usage learn computer packages like uh database i would suggest areas in spreadsheets and database management okay there are a lot of programs that uh you can use in order to learn these concepts usually these are not taught in school because well you don't really need a formal subject in order to teach uh how to use a certain computer package you can study this on your own there are a lot of textbooks nowadays you 're lucky textbooks are available locally as far as using computer packages like da d-base four clipper fox base all of these can be used easily don't be scared about the name fox base  it sounds like a zoo 'no  so don't be afraid of the name these are very easy to use and you have alre we have already the literature even in the library we have a good uh collection of computer science books and they 're not just for c s people they 're for everybody okay so you may want to go to the library we have uh we spent we spent a lot of money acquiring these books so for the meantime that 's what you can do in order to prepa prepare yourself for a career in the computer industry so what are the possible jobs available so you know already that there 's a demand so what now can you do in the field of computers well of course the the entry level okay that you may want to come into in a certain company would be a programmer by the way when you see the word wanted data encoder do not apply okay because you might think data encoder sounds complicated it 's like a nice career no okay it 's not okay so let 's get that clear because some people would say okay for a computer uh a person who graduated with a degree relating related to computers the entry level would be a data encoder no okay the data encoder is just there to copy something and type it on a computer that 's everything that you have to know about data encoding
Philippines	 magandang hapon din sa inyo alam n'yo naman kaming mga pulitiko gusto namin ang ini-introduce kami tuwang-tuwa kami diyan pero mabuti na lang maikli ang introduction ni ano  let me tell you however the story of the best introduction ever made of me anywhere in the world i was introduced by gary lising the comedian and this is how he introduced me in rotary he said ladies and gentlemen please i 'm very pleased to welcome the best congressman congressman pa ako noon the best congressman in the philippines today he is probably the best congressman in asia and maybe he is the best congressman in the whole world and then he said someday he will be president of the philippines probably president of asia and maybe of the whole world laughter  and then gary lising said ladies and gentlemen please welcome congressman bagatsing laughter  so 'nung tumindig po ako sabi ko naman sa kanila on behalf of congressman bagatsing i regret to inform you that he cannot come today but he asked me to give his best regards his highest esteem and admiration to the best comedian in the philippines he is probably the best comedian in asia and maybe the whole world mr joey de leon laughter clapping  i want to thank you for the opportunity of explaining the issue on death penalty and talking of opportunities it reminds me of one of the brothers of de la salle you know a long time ago i attended a conference in one of these big hotels and the theme of the conference was written in the wall and it said there are no problems there are only opportunities but one of the de la salle brothers came down complaining and he was saying he was saying to the reception girl i have a problem with my room and the girl pointed to the big sign there are no problems there are only opportunities and the brother said i don't care what you call it but there is a woman in my room and i don't know whether it is a problem or an opportunity laughter  anyway about the death penalty maybe towards the end of our discussion you should give me your feedback on what you think should be done about the death penalty the discussion you see on death penalty is one of those debates where every side is correct it is a debate where you can argue like in the middle ages where they were arguing how many angels can stand on the head of a pin in this debate in my view everybody is correct it becomes therefore a policy choice and that is where judgment and presumably wisdom is called for the debate you may be familiar with is basically of two sides you see we lawyers are very familiar with two sides because that 's what we do for a living presenting one side of case we all know that there are always two sides to the question and the third side is probably correct and that is the determination of the judge but in the policy debate on the death penalty the two dies are presented basically in this manner one and this is supported by the catholic church argues that life is sacred and therefore there is nothing that can be done to take our you must not encourage the taking away of life we must preserve life and protect life because it is unique it is the best creation of the lord and therefore there is no compelling reason for now to take away the life even of criminals this is one position and it is correct it is correct there is nothing more sacred than human life all through eternity every single man and woman in this room was created uniquely there will be nobody else fortunately or unfortunately like you and therefore whatever uniqueness you may have whatever qualities and combinations of talents you may have must be preserved and must be made to bloom there seems to be no compelling reason to take away to snuff out that life assume that there is a criminal assume that the crime committed was heinous by whatever definition of the of the constitution assume it was something that was unconscionable is there good reason to take away human life the side that protects human life insists no because it does not deter there is no reason you must always have hope that that human life will improve itself that that person will improve his spirituality and that person can still contribute something to the rest of humanity the arguments of course in favor of death says it will deter it is a deterrent to crime in other words right now with so many kidnappings with so much crime in the streets with so much killing even by men in uniform there is good reason to put the fear of the lord into the hearts of criminals and therefore we must re-impose the death penalty  in the constitutional commission when they were discussing this it was now congressman teodulo teo uhm natividad who argued for the protection of human life and he said that there is nothing even death does not deter crime and he used the example that has been written about in fact in several articles recently of the middle ages when hanging was the penalty for a crime of pickpockets if you were a pickpocket and you got you got caught and you got convicted then you would be given hanging as the sentence you would be hanged to death during the hangings however it attracted many many people because people like the gruesome people like the spectacle of seeing these persons hanging by the neck and uh moving about until they die and when there were people the pickpockets were very busy picking pockets 'no  and that was the argument he said you see death was the penalty for the crime of picking pockets when the crime was being imposed the pickpockets were very busy and therefore the penalty of death did not deter the pickpockets that argument in many different forms has been uh presented by different people  the senators who believe for instance in fighting uh or using all the resources of government to fight the drug menace insist however that the fear of death will deter and maybe uh that expectation can be reasonably based we do see a lot of disrespect for law we don't see fear of the enforcement of the law and therefore one can argue that if we make the penalty more stringent then the fear that can be instilled in the hearts of the people who are potential criminals may deter them from committing crime fundamentally that is the debate in the senate the report of the committee of joey lina and it was also reported out by the committee on justice which i chair recommended actually death penalty or reclusion perpetua as the penalty for various crimes you may be familiar with why the senate has to or why congress has to come up with a recommendation on penalties for certain crimes the constitution abolished death penalty the philippine constitution of nineteen eighty-seven removed death penalty from the statute books and in lieu thereof said something like except when for compelling reasons congress shall impose death penalty on heinous crimes  the issue therefore became what are the heinous crimes and that is why the solution of both the house of representatives and the senate is to mention the following which shall be considered heinous crimes and therefore they should be subjected to capital punishment except that the definition of the committee on revision of laws of capital punishment only amounts to reclusion perpetua  for those among you who may have some uh nodding acquaintance with penal law reclusion perpetua means thirty years imprisonment there are those who argue that that is a harder penalty and that should be a more fearsome penalty than death because death for whatever it is worth solves all your problems according to rizal death at least gives you rest so maybe death is the excuse uh for some people uh involuntarily terminating their human existence the report of the committee recommends reclusion perpetua or uh life imprisonment up to thirty years you see there is really no life imprisonment even in some instances you may remember having read the graft and corruption cases in the sandiganbayan and they convict uhm only the small ones this guy stole seven seventeen thousand twelve thousand four thousand from the public works so he was convicted with nine hundred years imprisonment because there was three years for seventeen thousand ten years for so many so he had all of nine hundred years on the theory that it 's the first one hundred years that is difficult so nine hundred years but never they never really impose or they never serve nine hundred years there is in the first place the physical limitation of being unable to last for nine hundred years but all these long and lengthy sentences only amount really to thirty years imprisonment the lina report says it is thirty years non-commutable and cannot be shortened and that is the option that the lina committee is recommending the herrera position however and this is shared by many in the senate suggests that we should impose death especially for drug pushers especially for those who commit the heinous crimes of rape with murder and and sev fourteen other crimes that are enumerated in the house of representatives they have enumerated eighteen crimes that can be subjected to death as a penalty the tragedy there is that in the original penal law there were only twelve crimes subjected to death penalty now we are going overboard we are going to the other extreme and we want to impose death practically even on traffic violations and that is wrong during the time of the late lamented president marcos there was a time he raised all the penalties to death  he issued varying degrees in fact uh decrees in the these were the decrees that we brought to the supreme court and we questioned whether they could be issued even by the lawmaker who had no limits to his power we argued that lawmaking has limitations of reason lawmaking has limitations built on nature uh on the law of nature but he issued decrees like eighteen thirty-six and eighteen thirty-seven and one of these decrees increased all the penalties of crimes against public order to death and what were these crimes never mind the great disorder chum uh uhm demonstrations etcetera  but one of the crimes was if you were singing at night in a disorderly fashion that is a crime against public order that is what they called charivari  and under the decrees of marcos charivari would have been subjected to death 'no  i mentioned that because some of you may be fond of singing at night laughter on the belief that you know how to sing and you should appreciate then how fortunate you are that you live under these conditions when the presidential decrees no longer apply now those are the two extremes of the debate in the house of representatives i voted against the imposition of the death penalty precisely because of the belief in human rights and in the value of human life once though in la salle greenhills there was a conference of eight hundred street children these were aged twelve to sixteen street children from cubao street children from quezon city the street children you see is one of the sorriest episodes in the life of the filipino you see the young by nature are protected by their parents or by their ascendants the young have always been protected even the puppies are protected by the bitch there there is no other word for it the kittens are protected by the cats the birds the the chicks of the birds they are protected by their mother bird i don't know what you call them 'no but the young but in the philippines today in cubao alone there are three hundred thousand homeless children their parents are not protecting them if you ever are in the circle theater near the circle theater there is a pizza parlor in one of the corners if you eat in the pizza parlor and you look at the tunnel through which the uh water passes you will see at night probably forty kids age twelve maybe lower sleeping in that small tunnel and it is what they call their home it is therefore against almost uh the law of nature that we have homeless who are so young and have made the street have appropriated the street as their home what was the plea of the children in that conference in la salle greenhills they broke up the eight hundred or so children into i think ten workshops and they invited uh five congressmen in the generic sense there were two congressmen and three senators invited to listen to their reports and every single workshop requested for one thing among others they also asked for schools they asked for homes etcetera  but there was unanimity in the request of one they said could you please impose the death penalty on men in uniform who use us
Philippines	good afternoon uh thank you for being here uh yeah as loy said the title of my sharing is motivational touches in the english classroom  uhm first i 'd just like to make some definitions and one disclaimer okay uh one for motivation uhm by motivation i mean uhm uhm uh the engagement of students in uh in the tasks 'no that are set before them in the classroom  uhm i read this book unfortunately i cannot remember the title uh and the author it 's uh it 's uh it 's one of these american uhm recipe source book things also uhm uh the the writers there said that uh if you have at least ninety percent of your students uhm engaged in whatever you assign them to do that means your your class is motivated 'no  so it seems like that the bottom line for motivation if you see that they 're working that 's it uhm if they 're excited about what they 're doing then that 's the icing on the cake okay uhm now of course motivation can be achieved in many ways no you can get human beings to do to do what you want them to do through many through a whole range of of tactics 'no from torture to pleading it 's not like it 's not you know uh i kind of course i go in somewhere in the middle ground 'no  uhm i can't do this there are people there are i have had teachers who could get us who could motivate us by being strict 'no the the authoritarian way uhm and i 've had teachers who could motivate us by you know the martyr thing sige na naman you know pleading uhm i 'm not comfortable with either uh the authoritarian way is very alien to my personality it i find it tiring so i i rarely get angry because it exhausts me more than it does the students and i don't like to plead because that 's demeaning for a teacher uh i tend to go it 's somewhere the middle ground and the middle ground i choose uhm tends to be on the playful side uhm i don't really know why it 's just that i i 'm happier playing than i am working so i guess i bring the play into my work uhm so the ta the the some of the ac activities i 'll share with you today uh are generally of the playful sort uhm they i 've most of these the the regular connected to to uh classifications 'no regular activities and special activities the regular ones i 've tried i think i 've tried these all here in my class uh in my classes here so and they 've worked 'no  uhm and then the special ones uh those were developed for really special circumstances uhm the there was something i really wanted to achieve that was big and you know i had to do something big uhm i call these touches rather than strategies or you know something big like that they 're just touches because they 're uhm they don't have to be part of a whole uh pedagogical schema 'no to to in order to work they can they 're they 're rather self-contained and uh they can be inserted anywhere within even the tradi uhm so-called traditional type of lesson they can be inserted you know to to break the routine you know or you know you 're just you 're just too tired of doing the same thing you wanna try something different they 're self-contained enough to do that and uh they can be used uhm either as uhm appetizers for a coming lesson or they can be used as enrichment so either way or they can be also the main lesson itself depends on how you process them uhm alright i 'll go into the regular touches first uhm each of these uhm are enough for one la salle class period 'no one hour or one and a half hours 'no  uhm they 're meant uh some of them i have used really as uh as an entire lesson some of them i i used as a uh e to introduce some grammar point or whatever the first one i 'd like to share is the sentence auction i think i have the uhm the sentence auction is an activity i got from uh mario rinvolucri 's uh grammar games  it was published nineteen eighty-four uh this is this is good uh for teaching uh sentence construction uhm for uhm revising erroneous sentences as you can see on the sheet the uhm the sentence auction game the main uh material i mean uh for the sentence auction game is the auction sheet where you have a list of sentences uhm some of them correct but most of them with some kind of error uh could be punctuation spelling grammar uh whatever syntax and then if you see on the right side we have uh a series of blanks under budget and a series of blanks under bought  the idea here is uhm uh you give a copy of the auction sheet to the students uh what i did was i gave them about ten minutes i think to go over the sentences uh we did one to fifteen for one class period that 's as far as we could get so i let them do one to fifteen uhm they have to decide which sentences are right and which sentences are wrong in the auction they are supposed to bid for the sentences that they think are correct i gave them a budget fifteen thousand pesos for this okay so that 's like one thousand pesos per sentence okay so they they so under the budget uh budget uhm column they have to indicate uhm how much they would be willing to spend for whatever sentences they think they wanna buy 'no  how high are they gonna go in the bidding this this is so that they can control their budget 'no  and then later when the when the bidding has has uh uhm commenced uhm well those who who uh who managed to you know the highest bidders uhm can indicate on the bought blank uh how much they actually spent for the sentence 'no  now i play the role of the auctioneer this has to be done very fast because you have to generate the you know the auction excitement okay so uh after the ten minutes are up 'no uhm i tell them okay you 're you 've already got uh i did this uh i did this uh or rather i i let them work in pairs by the way 'no i let them work in pairs so they could you know some discussion going on uhm and i ge i asked the pairs to uhm write a number 'no different number 'no for each of them on uh like one fourth sheet of paper big enough for me to see because when they start bidding and you know i have to know which pair bought which they have to raise their number so it 's just the numbers i write clears throat  so when the bidding starts okay i could go something like uhm uh alright uhm auction has started item up for auction now is the sentence number one  i wanted that you should know what happened sentence in the game  do i hear five hundred pesos for this auction for this sentence do i hear five hundred sen sentence is a genuine antique uhm it was uh last used by louis the fourteenth every word made of solid gold  starts speaking at a faster rate do i hear five hundred five hundred do i hear five hundred and then there 's five hundred fifty over here five hundred do i hear six hundred six hundred six hundred do i six hundred over here do i hear seven hundred seven hundred seven seven hundred over here do i hear a thousand a thousand a thousand and there is one thousand do i hear one thousand five hundred one thousand five hundred nobody says one thousand alright going one one thousand going once going twice and sold for one thousand pesos to pair number eight and then i write it down here okay so sentence number one bought to sold to pair number eight one thousand pesos 'no laughter  it 's tiring laughter  and then right after that i go to alright next item on auction sentence number two  what happen to your sister last night sentence in the game  every word made of jade ming dynasty and so on and so forth so i go on until all the se the fifteen sentences have been bought 'no  uh for the sentences that were not bought i just put an x because i have all the numbers on the board one to fifteen 'no  it 's if nobody wanted it so it 's x 'no  and this is really fun because you know this you know after a while i didn't even have to go into the ming dynasty and louis the fourteenth bit because it was really going fast 'no because the biddings were coming up you know there was even one group that uhm that splurged fourteen thousand pesos on one sentence and it turned out to be wrong laughter  it it was fun 'no  so this went on the the auctioning i think went for uhm thirty minutes uh thereabouts so thirty minutes after after we went through the fifteen sentences i told them okay i 'll let you know now which sentences are correct and i just told them which number 'no  for the fifteen i think there 's only one that 's correct uhm uh what killed whom and when  that 's number three i think that was all that was right if i remember right 'no  so i just told them okay then everything else is wrong and so of course there 's a lot of you know waaahh you know you know i spent too much and so on and then uh but i don't tell them what 's wrong with the other sentences i told them okay go over the sentences the wrong sentences that you bought and then try to figure out what was the error in those sentences and then correct them so that was their seatwork 'no  so each pair yeah after the auction so each pair uh wrote in the corrections to the the the incorrect sentences that they had bought 'no  the others that they didn't buy it 's okay you you don't have to touch that uhm i gave them seatwork points for this you know uh if you bought only the one correct sentence uh if you budgeted only like i looked at their budget list if you budgeted only for the one correct sentence you have five seatwork points uhm and then you know if there 's a corresponding graduated you know you get four seatwork points if you bought that one correct sentence but you have like two or three incorrect along with it 'no and so on so i just clears throat freshmen uh uhm freshmen someone asked a question but inaudible  sometimes well uh dep it would depend on what you mean by disciplinary 'cause this one is really meant to be noisy they 're meant to shout they 're meant to get excited and so of course they were shouting and i had to shout over their it 's under control because they were focused 'no they 're focused on this as in my god were they ever focused you know it was really you know it the the the objective really of this is to get them practically jumping on their seats 'no with with you know the desire to buy this sentence and oh it worked 'no and then afterwards then you know when everything is quiet and they have to do the the you know the correction and all that and then afterwards we process 'no why is it correct uh the sec this was uh the the following session uh that 's when we ano uh i mean we don't have enough we have enough for the auction and the seatwork uh that would take you about an hour and then the following grammar time we went through the sentences okay so i tried this out actually i had thirty but uhm uh i found that uh one session is enough
Philippines	okay so today we will perform qualitative analysis writes on board of elements writes on board  from the title of the experiment you can already predict what sort of tests we will carry out for today so basically we would like to check what elements are present in the given substance in the sample solution okay since we are talking about organic compounds so expect that these compounds contain the element carbon and of course hydrogen but also remember that organic molecules sometimes con  contains uh contain nitrogen sometimes oxygen sometimes the halogens okay so we would like to check whether they are present or not so what you will be given is a sample solution containing all those elements okay so you are given a sample solution containing all those e  elements and then you will test them for the different elements so naturally you will always get positive results so for example if you test the substance for nitrogen you can carry out that particular test observe see what happens in the reaction okay and be how do you call this uh pay particular attention with regards to the formation of precipitates whether there is a change in the color of solution or not whether there are bubbles that form in the reaction and so on and so forth okay so when you test for nitrogen and knowing that your sample solution contains nitrogen then those are the positive results later on you will be given an unknown solution and that unknown solution may contain maybe three maybe four maybe five elements we don't know okay so based on your sample solution containing all the elements you will base the results for the unknown solution is that clear so you have a pa sample solution uh containing all those elements and an unknown you don't know what uh it contains now you have read the procedure any question about that so we will basically just mix uh chemicals reagents and observe what happens afterwards at the end of the experiment i do not expect you to immediately come up with a chemical equation to explain what happened in the test okay you have to do some uh literature search to find out what particular reaction took place uh in a certain test okay so that will be for next meeting but for day for today i will just ask you to come up with the different observations for each test okay some techniques that you should know if you are asked to test for acidity of the solution for example we will use a litmus paper for that and you must observe the proper technique in doing so you do not put the litmus paper inside the test tube for example you don't do that what you need to do is to dip the stirring rod in the solution and touch the litmus paper and see whether there is a color change again if there is a change in the color of the litmus paper from red to blue for example and that the blue litmus paper remains blue then it means that you have a basic solution if for example your red litmus paper becomes how do you call this which one okay and then the red remains red then you have an acidic solution okay now if you will look at our solvents and reagents given here each bottle have its own o has its own dropper okay do not interchange the droppers otherwise some of the reagents will react with one another and it will be contaminated and uh you will always get wrong results okay so be careful about that what else be careful with the sodium metal why sodium metal so extra care in handling sodium metal because it reacts violently with water in other words don't e don't try to touch it because again your your your hands have moisture and that uh it violently reacts with it so be careful with the sodium metal okay any question question clarification about the procedure  walang katanungan ( chuckles) wala meron bang hindi naintindihan malabo sa nabasa nyong procedure wala  okay you may start doing the experiment   missing words slimmers world international at megamall s m megamall right and here

Philippines	we start another week here on in fitness and in health  i hope you enjoyed last week when we had paulo villaruel and cheska laurel teaching us those pilates exercises for this week we 're back here to the house doing practical exercises that you can do with just minimal equipment so for today let 's do some legs if last week it was all about abs and lower back so let 's concentrate on the legs and the arms for this week all you need is a chair so that you can hang on for balance and we 'll start with some lunges okay take your legs apart like this make sure it 's wide okay keep your body nice and erect but 2 words  lean forward a little bit and then you come straight down okay we 've done this before so you know that your knees should not go past your toes this is what i mean this is what we don't want you to do so you don't hurt your knees so take it straight down and then bring it up okay take it down and all the way up now the muscles that are being worked are the muscles of the buttocks and the thighs and it is this leg right here right now that is doing the work the other leg is just following so when you come down it 's just bending also and again down lift up okay let 's just do two more two more one last like that now before we go to the other side we are going to do an exercise right here for the buttocks so you lean forward here okay and you 're just going to bring it back like this so not only the buttocks working but also the back of your thigh the hamstrings very small lifts look at my back it 's not moving and yours shouldn't be moving also so here 's the wrong way you don't want to do this keep this steady here and just lift behind now the leg in front is also doing some work you can feel that in your muscles alright let 's do two more oh and the last okay put that down just rest for a few seconds and now let 's do the other side okay start with that lunge get into a good position if you start here which is very very short here you 'll end up doing that and that 's what 's gonna hurt your knee so take your leg back nicely make sure it 's wide okay remember your back is nice and tall put your knee slightly forward and come straight down now if you want to develop some good balance you can let go of the chair and you can just do this otherwise if you feel like you 're moving around then just put the hand lightly it can be a chair it can be the wall it can even be a desk okay down inhale exhale as you come up down and exhale up that 's when you feel the exertion as you come up do it again and here 's the last great now move slightly forward here put all your weight in that leg and now the buttocks and the hamstrings behind here we go and lift just a small lift keep your mind involved in your exercise squeeze the buttocks even before you lift the leg again if you want some balance you wanna challenge your balance do it this way so you can have your arms here otherwise just hold lightly squeeze remember lower back not moving this is not a very high lift squeeze that you should be able to feel this 'cause i 'm feeling it and one more one more okay so our legs have gotten a good work-out this morning we did the lunges and we also did what 's called a leg lift extension to the back for the buttocks and the hamstrings and tomorrow we 're gonna give you exercises for the arms hope you enjoyed yesterday 's exercises which were all about the legs remember the lunges and that back lift extension but this morning we 're going to shift our focus now to the upper body and specifically we 're gonna be working out on the chest and also the muscle back here which is called the triceps now if you 're using dumbbells at home what i want you to try is to try two dumbbells in each hand for the chest because the chest is a much larger muscle and then use only one dumbbell for the triceps if you 're using water bottles which you filled up with sand my suggestion is the sand does not weigh as much as putting in things like nails or ball bearings which you can buy in the hardware so have several sets of those water bottles some of them with sand so that they will be like the one dumbbell and then some of them with the ball bearings or the nails that will be the equivalent of two dumbbells okay so let 's lie down on our mats now i 'm gonna try it with two dumbbells don't be afraid ladies that you 're going to get your muscles very big because this is only eight pounds on each hand and your chest actually can take quite a bit of weight okay slowly down now make sure that if you 're holding the two dumbbells you 're holding it well so it doesn't fall on your face take it right above your shoulder joint alright now and slowly we 're coming down and then we 're exhaling as we bring it up so inhaling down move nice and slow like this and then squeeze it up the reason i 'm moving slow is so that i 'm giving my muscles a real challenge here because we 're actually only going to be doing eight repetitions that 's the fourth and i can really feel this one not only am i moving slowly but i 've also got the right weight for my chest okay so remember larger muscles require more weight smaller muscles smaller weight alright here comes one this is the last one here exhale up okay let 's do just one more for good measure down and exhale up oh boy it 's really feeling that alright now you 're going to use just one dumbbell so get that dumbbell hold it up here bend the elbow bring it back i 'm going to put my hand here so i hold my arm steady so it doesn't move and could only move from this portion and you take it straight up okay where you put your hand you can actually feel your triceps squeezing and contracting so bring it up you want to straighten the arm but let 's take good care not to over-straighten and lock it like this yeah that 's the one you don't wanna do that 's painful on the joints you want to keep the effort on the muscles and keep your joint safe oh i can feel this one and even if this is just four pounds because we 're doing it slow holding it in the right position we 're really giving that muscle a challenge one more oh and that way now let 's go to the other side take it up again remember position it so that the elbow is facing the ceiling hold it and then straighten now think about your muscle imagine that it is a sponge and every time you contract you squeeze the water out that way you 'll be able to get the full contraction and the full benefit also you don't have to do so many repetitions but you do have to do quality repetition okay again exhaling always on the exertion and squeeze it okay one last to go and word excellent okay let 's put that down now to come up safely from here turn to your side use your hand and slowly up alright so what have we learned today we 've learned today that when you 're trying to work a large muscle like the chest which covers this whole area here you need to have a heavier weight and then when you use the smaller muscle like the one back here a smaller weight so you can't have just one weight for both of those muscles  good morning welcome to an in fitness and in health  morning i 'm tina juan and our guest for this week is christine jacobs-sandejas oh yeah christine is beginning to really like this exactly we keep it simple but we keep it fun okay okay today it 's gonna 1 word

of magnolia butter and the reason we 're doing this is so that may lasa ho itong ating uh pampiprito natin dito as ating pork tenderloin pero hindi ho masusunog dahil mabilis hong masunog ang butter 'no so we 're going to parang temper it by adding something that 's more heat resistant in the form of olive oil now ang gagawin natin dito is we will mix our salt and pepper okay and we will season our pork tenderloin okay season our pork tenderloin ayan tapos baligtarin lang natin  you know meron akong uhm paniniwala dati na ang pork tenderloin 'no especially or pork yung mga  roast pork and everything ay kailangang well done 'no and more often than not totoo ho yun but then when you find out when you know the source of the pork kung nung saan ho nanggaling let 's say alam nyong malinis ang pinaglakihan nung baboy talagang you know in sanitary surroundings and everything then you can cook the pork even medium medium rare may mga kumakain ng mga ganyan 'no pero dito sa pilipinas usually well done  ho natin kinakain yan  but you know the moment you know where the yung  source ng pork e palagay nyo nakikita nyo yung baboy na naliligo malinis po yung pagkapalaki sa baboy then you can have it uh less than well done okay if you 'd like to get more recipes from uh magnolia you may write to them at san miguel food group compound san miguel food group compound eagle corner

going to use this as a coating for our chicken  tapos meron na akong pre-heated oven na  three hundred fifty degrees na naka nag-aantay diyan  okay  ang gagawin natin dito itabi lang natin ng ganyan etong  mixture na ito  and then tapusin natin 'to at medyo hindi pa tunaw itong ating magnolia butter you know you have to get quality butter para maging malinamnam yung ating niluluto and that you can find in magnolia gold okay  pinatay ko na yung apoy ang gagawin natin dito sa ating  chicken wings is we will just coat each piece with the magnolia butter okay ganon lang and then have a baking dish on the side tapos ang gagawin natin dito is this one piece  i- coat lang natin ng ganyan  you know what you do is you compress a little bit para kumapit ho yung breading niyan okay put it in a pan compress that ayan  put it in a pan compress 'no very important ho yun kasi minsan nalalaglag na lang ho yung ating breading 'no  okay ganoon  and we will bake this for about an hour at three hundred fifty degrees okay  halo-halo lang ho lahat yan nang ganyan okay trust me it 's a different kind of preparing chicken wings different way of preparing chicken wings iba malinamnam okay  halo-halo lang ho lahat yun nang ganyan ayan tapos ipasok na natin sa oven okay so there you have it this one is called parmesan chicken wings this one is brought to you by magnolia gold butter i 'll show what the finished product looks like  okay ngayon naman isang recipe that we 're going to make is uh i 'm sure the title rings a bell because we 've done something like this before but this one is different in the sense that we are going to marinate our pork in a dip and fry it as such 'no  this one is called shr pork cutlet with shrimp sauce pork cutlet with shrimp sauce okay we have six pieces of pork cutlets cut into half or pork chops if you want just ordinary pork chops you i prefer if you debone it but you can have it with bone also just cut it in half and then we have some shrimp paste this is  bagoong  three tablespoons of bagoong alamang or shrimp paste you find this in asian groceries these are fermented uh tiny shrimps 'no  and then we have a teaspoon of sugar one teaspoon of sugar a teaspoon of chinese wine one teaspoon of chinese wine or white wine will do one whole egg one whole egg a teaspoon of uh finely chopped shallots one teaspoon of finely chopped shallots one teaspoon of finely chopped garlic also one teaspoon of finely chopped garlic two tablespoons of cornstarch two tablespoons of cornstarch a teaspoon of chili garlic sauce one teaspoon of chili garlic sauce and then we have some cooking oil for frying okay what we will do is we will just mix our cornstarch with our wine and our actually it 's just a ma matter of mixing all these ingredients together well okay i don't know how we will do this it doesn't have that much oh well it will okay and then we add in one whole egg if you have any comments suggestions recipe requests please write us okay wait let me get a wire whisk here blend these ingredients yeah you know the presence of the cornstarch will add crunch to this dish we add in our shallots okay i will not uh i will be makulit about it i 'll remind you again you don't have to just stick to pork chops whatever suits you chicken or veal if you want lamb if you want okay garlic we add in our sugar we add in our shrimp paste and blend all of these together well blend all these together very very well like this okay and we will coat each chop each cutlet with this mixture and let it sit for about i would say about an hour in the refrigerator so that each piece absorbs the flavor that you 're trying to get you know a dish like this requires a lot of rice with rice  masarap po masarap   halo-halo lang ho lahat yan  okay then keep it in the fridge okay now let 's say let 's say this one is nice and marinated already we will start frying okay tingnan natin ito  okay this is going to splatter i 'm sure yeah okay this has to be cooked fully okay  di naputol itong cut na ito  and then like this okay and maybe you can have this with some chili catsup if you want uh thai chili catsup okay look at that some of this sauce you know this shrimp paste is a very popular item in asia okay they have uh different versions of this they they have some that are made out of uh shrimps tiny tiny shrimps some that are made out of fish you know what they do and they ma when they ma  make nampla i visited a place that made nampla  before they get shrimps dump it with plenty plenty of rock salt and let that age for about a year and then the juice of that they would uh extract the juice of that they would make nampla out of that 'no  uh the rock salt will pull out the juices of the from the fish and they would make fish sauce or nampla out of that and then the remaining fish they would grind to make uh what we call bagoong balayan or what uh what 's th i don't know what you call it fish paste or shrimp paste okay so this one all you have to do is just fry it the moment this is done it will be nice and crunchy it is ready to serve pork cutlet with shrimp sauce guaranteed delicious you 'll love this 1 1
Philippines	hello to everybody good morning tita sylvia today we will be preparing a very uhm exciting combination of oriental dish and an italian dish we call it tomato pilaf and uh steamed assorted eggs and we will be using today our national rice cooker yes tita sylvia yes because we believe that  mahirap ngayon ang trabaho we have to we have to get the value for  mo for our money kasi pinaghihirapan natin e dapat  quality appliances like national yes uhm for the pilaf we have actually placed here two cups of soaked  dinorado rice and then we are adding this spaghetti sauce prego yes and three and a half cups water actually when we do two dishes at the same time we saw it best to put more water kasi double double time yung ginagawang trabaho nung liquid so that we are going to steam something else on top okay and then we put this fresh garlic for our tomato pilaf and our beef cubes also to heighten the taste okay yun lang po isasalang na natin itong pan hmmh we turn it on by pushing this button down and naka-  ready na rin ang ating custard steamer so lahat ng egg dito sylvia  nandito itong century egg we just put it here uh-uh and then we put the salted egg yung yolk  nya spread it around lang  and then lalagyan din natin siya ng ground pork  mga one hundred grams lang isang guhit lang po  pero this will be a very high protein dish yes and then this is five eggs na atin nang ini-  scramble then that 's it  i- spread lang natin para ma-  cover siya then we 're ready to cover it with our foil  para siyang leche flan   tita sylvia two-layer din yung foil  para hindi masyadong magtubig  the first layer as turo mo tita nilalagyan natin ng konting  opening para masisilip natin later  tapos nilalagyan ko na lang ng palatandaan tita para  i know where to to open it later on like ginaganyan ko lang para lang kung saan ko siya ili-  lift later on to check then ready na ito to be placed on top of our rice cooker with custard steamer para habang naluluto yung ating  tomato pilaf naluluto din ang ating steamed assorted eggs  ganito na po siya okay very colorful very nutritious high protein dish  hello to our televiewers today tita sylvs we 'll prepare our very special recipe called braised tofu with seafood 'no now our recipe kasi looks complicated 'no  very hard to prepare well actually even our national gas stove guarantees that we will remove all the stress and the hassle in preparing this recipe okay now to start off tita sylvs if may i show you this model the g p two one one m a s is our top-of-the-line 'no  it already has a top plate 'no non-stick  na po ito detachable actually this is also enamel-coated trivet the detachable burner valve and this also the assembly sa ilalim ng ating burner okay yes now tita sylvs also this one 'no  this is the burner top now this one is brass now this doesn't just look elegant and durable well in fact this one gives you thirty percent savings okay  yon also very important feature is the de  rotatable gas inlet pipe now this rotates three hundred-sixty degrees so meaning you don't have to worry kung saan nyo ilalagay ang gas tank na  usually nagiging cause ng leakage  di ba to avoid sunog okay now i can't wait to prepare our braised tofu  okay so let 's turn our 1 word  so you see the concentrated cone-shaped flame 'no  okay so let 's first put in our sesame oil actually tita sylvs madali lang 'to kasi  you saut&eacute; everything 'no  so when it 's hot na you put in the sh  the prawns 1 word then the squid so very fast 'no naririnig nyo na yung the sesame oil is already hot okay then you put in the braised tofu  and we add in my favorite mushroom button mushroom and also the straw mushroom okay the celery just put everything and the chicharo  smells good 'no tita  this one is very expensive ha in the restaurant now what we just put in is salt okay sugar okay pepper  maanghang mas masarap  also the okay the oyster sauce so you just mix everything also we have the gar chili garlic sauce and lastly okay  o we still this is the straw mushroom and of course carrots yes then you can also add already the corn flour tita  dissolved in water  tapos after mixing everything you cover it and let it simmer for two to three minutes then it 's done okay so in no time we 'll have this very delicious braised  tofu with seafoods yes  ogenki de means hello and be happy of course be healthy because with national it 's a new life.  hello to our televiewers yes tita today we will prepare a special recipe called aromatic rice with spicy tomato beef tita   kaya lang before that to our televiewers 'no  i just would like to share that tita sylvia really values time  kami rin po sa national we value especially yung mga working mothers out there 'no we know that it 's really important for them na mag-  to manage their time as a wife as a mother and of course as a professional and that 's also the reason why national  always comes up with kitchen appliances that brings convenience to the homemakers okay so to give you a sample okay today we will prepare aromatic rice using our uh world series rice cooker and spicy tomato beef using our national gas stove we 'll be needing two cups of both plain rice and milagrosa  rice tita yung mabango po yes okay then we 'll be needing seven cups water okay  dito po ihahalo nyo lang ulit lahat ng ingredients  natin ano  then we 'll add in two tablespoon of both garlic flakes at saka yung ating nutmeg crushed powder okay you can buy this in the groceries 'no  then we add in one-fourth teaspoon uh turmeric powder ito po yung to add color and of course yung scent  po ng aroma and of course you just put in bell pepper uh sorry the pepper and of course we 'll be putting in lemon grass mga  two stalks will do  tapos we 'll add in three hundred grams ng  uh chicken breast fillet strips na po yan okay then we just mix it then cover and put it in our rice cooker now tita i was mentioning about world series  now i just would like to share that this rice cooker is being exported not just in the philippines but now as well in fifteen different countries all over the world including japan and u s a okay so we just put this down for rice cooking now if you notice po uh we have a glass cover because this model comes with a top pipe steamer so you can actually steam your ulam siopao or anything while cooking your rice  ayon  so iwan po muna natin ito so we 'll cook this for about thirty minutes then let it simmer for fifteen minutes then it 's done so i was mentioning with power flame burner  yes so dito nyo po makikita yung concentrated cone-shaped flame that it emits 'no through the power flame burner thirty percent savings because of the heat of time that it cuts let 's say if you boil water in seven minutes through this five minutes na lang  so let 's put in our oil okay then let 's stir-fry the garlic okay naririnig mo na po tita mainit-init na 'to 'no so sandaling-sandali lang po  tapos the ginger then we add in three hundred grams of tenderloin cubes na po   tita di ba you always mention that it 's important  na let 's not overcook the meat ano  we put now in two teaspoon of white uh sorry one-half teaspoon of white pepper and the dried chili mas maanghang mas masarap  so let 's put in water tita one hundred m l water and okay let 's add in our tomato okay salt  halo lang po tayo ulit ano  then we add in about two tablespoon tomato paste okay so we 'll just let it simmer for a minute or a minute-and-a-half  tapos we 'll add in our uh one-fourth bar of melt cheese to make it more creamier okay of course after cooking na na nandyan yung  hassle of cleaning so if you see our g p two one one m a s model it already comes with non-stick coating so just use a wet cloth ano  now all the assemblies is also detachable the detachable trivet of course the burner itself is also detachable yes it 's brass yes and also the burner valve is also detachable also very important is the three hundred sixty degrees rotatable inlet pipe that we always mention ano so you don't have to worry where to place your gas tank lalo na pag masikip ang  kitchen  di ba yun po ang nagiging cause palagi ng  leak sa ating gas yon  so we 'll just leave that for two minutes and then it 's done uh yes we put in raisins tita and of course the frozen mixed vegetables pag luto na ito- toss lang natin yan  hello everyone uh i really missed our audience and i really am glad that i 'm back here in your kitchen sylvia and uh for today we 're going to do some uh very authentic uh dish  na yung bang mga turo ng mga lola natin  we will be using uh monterey pata pata sliced  makita mo ang ganda di ba and it looks so clean and uh talagang makita nyo very very lean okay so you know when you buy pata in the meat shop you can specify whether you want it whole for pata tim  or for this particular uh dish if you want it cut up  kasi it 's kind of hard to chop pata  at home because of the bone chips so it 's pre pre-sliced already  dahil meron silang meat saw yeah but you know so we 'll put the vinegar just dump this all together brown sugar garlic wala in any ano in any order  pwede yan   tapos toyo black beans tausi oo tausi and let 's put some chopped peppercorns and some bay leaf okay and of course water para we will boil the  pata in this now if you 're in a hurry there 's no problem you can use a pressure cooker okay lang yun  this takes about an hour or an hour and a half kasi masarap nito yung medyo gelatinous na  so we just put this in the pan all together and then just close this and uh cook it over boiling then simmering until it 's tender so lutuin natin close it para  the heat will be even all throughout and uh also we can put the banana blossom o yung tawag natin usbong ng saging  it gives a sweetish taste  alam mo sylvs sa amerika hit  na hit talaga ang asian dishes yes so here 's our finished product  gusto ko 'to kasi manamis-namis na maalat-alat  see wow look at that  masarap yan sa mainit na kanin wow  you 're gonna be sitting nice and tall i think you need to hold a fitness circle yeah sitting nice and tall think of using your abdominals two lengthen your spine up inhale to prepare when you exhale initiate the movement by curling your tailbone on this scooping the abdominals yes think of your navel touching your spine gonna aim now think of you gonna reach up the navel  think of hugging a beach ball there you go exhale curl in your tailbone on this scoop the abs squeeze the buttocks tight your ribs sliding down to your hip inhale up to the navel crown of the head 1 word </unclear shoulder sliding down relax your shoulder swing  there you go exhale curl your tailbone under scoop the abs connect the ribs yes inhale up the navel scooping the abs there you go yes exhale half roll back we 'll make that more intense and stay there try to squeeze the circle on the full ten on the exhale and nine and eight tighten the abs there you go sink 2 words to back yeah and six and five and four and three and two and one alright there you go yes so what joseph pilates promised in ten sessions you 'll feel different in twenty you 'll look different in thirty sessions you have a new body we teach in 1 word studio in fort bonifacio global city center 
Philippines	during the last uh consecutive weeks we have uh studied the chemical tests related to aldehydes ketones alcohols amines carboxylic acids and i presume and i hope that you have made a comprehensive record in your lab notebook about the observations that you uh uh nah you saw  'no  this afternoon uh we will put to our final test all the things that you have learned i will give you ten uh unknown liquids uhm and by group one group one sample you have to be judicious in their use because it 's a limited amount so uh use only the prescribed amount in your uh um tests last several weeks you will have to identify what uh liquid it is and to give you incentive the first person who can uh submit to me o who can who can tell me the correct identification the first group i will award a ten-point extra bonus 'no  the second place uh will be given a seven-point bonus and the third place a five-point bonus haste make waste if you come to me with the identification and it is wrong i will deduct three points i will deduct that 's why you have to be careful now uh this is this is where the value of your lab notebook comes in if you took if you did the experiment last time and you were helter-skelter with the observation you will spend a lot of time uh identifying these because your observations might be inconclusive anyway all of the reagents uh relevant to the analysis are uh lined-up at the back  mero =beginning of tagalog word for there is/are there are uh amine reagents carboxylic acid reagents alcohol reagents and ketone reagents so i think before you uh embark uh before you embark on the chemical test you have to plan out your strategy 'no how you will go about it perhaps secure four test tubes and then uh among the four sets of reagents uh on hand you choose the surefire method of identifying a ketone a surefire method of identifying an alcohol a surefire method of amines  etcetera so you would be able to identify once and for all that th this is an amine group and then you have to focus on that and then identify whether it 's a primary amine secondary amine tertiary amine you know what i mean okay yes question in tagalog from student, not very audible  you go back student asks question in tagalog, not very audible  ha  well student asks question, not audible uh you you have to get sel-con self-consistent result if one test is positive and then you come to me with the identification i will look for confirmation confirmatory evidence di ba  and uh when you have the confirmatory evidence then you are sure and the chances are you won't be wrong coughs  imagine that uh imagine that you 're a practicing medical doctor and you extracted a liquid from a patient 's uh stomach and this is it and you want to know what the what 's the cause of the death 'no  so you have to identify alright uh i was thinking that the first place uh winner uh we will uh we will put on the victory stand and we will sing the national anthem for him or her but we are all filipinos we 'll be singing one national anthem right  maliban uh apart from the chinese in the group or korean or japanese mayroon bang japanese sa inyo none anyway so uh i need not elaborate on the tests because it can be quite complicated the records in your lab notebook of your observations should be sufficient so uh i will now assign you the compound samples that we have  students speak at same time, inaudible  yeah when your tests when you have when you have performed several confirmatory tests hali beginning of tagalog word for the phrase for example for example you have a liquid you added diphenyl hydrazone and it formed crystals on like in your observation then perhaps what you need to do is repeat it get another drop and then test it it gives then uh what other what other test or ketones do you have so test that also so when those tests are jibing together then that means you have a good uh a reasonable basis for your conclusion okay one test does not constitute a conclusion okay so kumpleto are we complete counts students  nine twelve fifteen we are only nineteen one person missing  ha johnson tan student says something he might arrive he might arrive later anyway i 'll distribute now your unknown sample uh group one  teka muna group one de leon okay so please okay i will give you sample four five okay number five to group one group two group two i 'll give to the group the hardest one okay number ten okay they they 're all the same difficulty 'no  group one number ten uh quiambao quiambao and feig okay who 's your partner uh the uh group seven group seven i 'll give number one ilagan okay group uh ay wait a minute group seven one group five leonor and who 's the partner of leonor natanawan eight okay ano ano ang group mo  number five number eight alright uh number two will be given to group eight eight toledo and sayas okay do not do not use lots amount of it two two will be yours okay offhand i do not know what those chemicals are i do not know i have no complete record i have no uh list from the stock personnel yet i just gave him instructions to make this for me alright uh group six tan and kayla you 're yours is three then number four i will give to group group ten group ten this is co and quiambao uh no no co and panagsagan alright alright by the way if we should finish the identification today in next meeting check-out unless you want to work some more i don't either okay number number nine i 'll give you number six baligtaran  number nine who is your partner romero arriola alright number six you have student asks question, inaudible beg your pardon in your notebook create a next experiment  identification of an unknown write in your notebook the unknown number and then you 'll proceed with analysis alright number seven will have to go to number four who is yeah number seven uh that is chua and san pedro okay do you have yet okay so your group is jimenez three nine okay nine okay okay so please okay you can secure uh one of these uh medicine uh dro  droppers 'no  i think this is for uh putting uh ba uh drops on babies  'no all the way to the stomach 'no  uh one of these and use this only for your sample make sure you do not cross-contaminate your sample with any liquids that makes your reaction or experiment inconclusive 'no  get one each and don't break the tip alright question from student, inaudible  oh yeah and also d </. do not m make sure that you do not touch the liquids on the inside of the rubber it will contaminate your sample okay get one each okay uh all systems are go alright now if you uh if you care you you have to do your work more systematically uh n not just because that i gave you incentives to uh get the first result means that you 'll have to be haphazard alright good luck  okay so for the in order to get the pulse rate okay so this is the machine that we would be using so it 's called the power lab  okay in- advertise pa okay power lab it comes with this software so it 's just linked to a it also comes with a card okay alam nyo ba yung card sa  computer yung di ba may sound card ganyan  video card it it comes with this special card okay called the scassi  card okay i don't have to elaborate what scassi means it 's just um a technical jargon again scassi card ano nga ba yun o mamaya titingnan natin yon nakalimutan ko  okay so this is connected to you have cables here connected to a scassi card sa computer okay so that scassi card is responsible for okay actually processing your signals okay so to get the pulse rate so this is uh this is our sensor okay it 's the sensor that we would be using this is called a finger pulse transducer so another word for sensor is transducer  okay so later on you would place uh one finger the tip of your fingers here okay the middle finger that you would use later on okay so ilalagay nyo siya sa channel one  pakikabit naman sa channel one o  channel one this one okay na naka- lock na   parang oscilloscope just like an oscilloscope ayan okay so once that is uh okay nakakabit na yan so we plu you put this one doon sa middle the tip of your middle finger okay uh put it in this way in such a way that this is nakalagay dito okay hindi doon sa opposite side actually  puede rin sa opposite side but this is mu much convenient way to do okay so once this is all set up uh what you do would be to click this one chart for windows okay on double click so tingnan nyo yan dapat nag-  orange yan okay so that means that the machine and the computer is communicating okay so you would uh have this one when you start it up you 'd have this uh so ang dami di ba so you have a lot of uh windows so we would just close this one 'cause we do not need this one okay so what we would need so you open so open this is an open dialogue box hindi diyan okay so ilagay na punta lang kayo sa  c program files sa a v i instruments this was the company which built that machine  experiment settings okay so these are simply like templates okay  para hindi nyo na kayo mag- adjust ng mga  windows 'no naka-adjust na yang mga windows for different experiments like now we would this is an introductory so pulse rate so we would do this uh next time e c g uh e m g okay e e g okay so we would be doing that okay so we open so we have this so naka set-up  na yung experiment okay so before uh so you maximize this para walang problema  okay ha okay lang yon okay so the first thing that you do so the first thing that so once this is already set up so you choose this one nakalagay  channel one okay so you choose inpunt mispronunciation input input amplifier okay so makikita nyo diyan ano di ba so the range is ten volts so ten volts there negative ten volts at the bottom so what does that mean so napaka so wala kang makita halos  that means that the range is too too large okay  e sabi natin yung mga bioelectric signals they are very very small okay so we adjust this one depende 'to sa tao ha may mga ibang tao malakas yung pulse rate yung amplitude so let 's say ilagay ko siya sa two hundred  masyado pa ring mababa ilagay ko sa one hundred millivolts  mababa pa rin  okay so fifty let 's say ayan okay a few minutes of question and answer in tagalog with students  so let 's uh click o k  so this means that this range actually this uh this process here is just for you to know the correct range okay so yung correct range which in this case is fifty millivolts okay so we click o k   pakita ko sa inyo how you store this data okay so click o k okay and then once you uh na naka- ready na  fifty millivolts so you can start recording kanina hindi pa nagre- record you 're just actually like calibrating your um the range okay so start would mean recording  okay so iyon na yun so let 's record for ilan kaya uh let 's say ten seconds ten seconds o sobra na gawin nating twenty five seconds o twenty seconds na lang  okay so you already have your that 's only only temporary so temporary lang siyang naka- store okay stored in the memory of your computer okay uhm so once you have have you have this now once you have that you can actually save this uh save natin ha file so save as so ilagay natin gawa tayo ng folder for all of you so uh so you place the file name like for example pulse rate okay so you save it in this type of file a v i chart a v i c h t okay uh if you save your file so ito ise- save  nyo rin 'to ha save your file in this format pero syempre  later on we would like to open this this uh the one that you recorded also in excel in word also let 's say uh you want to present that later on okay so later on  pakita ko sa inyo on how to save this uh recorded signal  sa excel sa word also okay brief exchange in tagalog with students  okay so next step so we have this temporarily recorded uh bioelectrical pulse rate so what 's the next step you have to compute for the pulse period okay so you could either move this uh cursor nakita nyo iyong x so place it at the peak nasaan yung peak  o ayan then you get the time in seconds then you move to the next peak which is this one okay so kunyari yan medyo sensitive siya ayan so that 's the time for the next peak so to get the so  yung kailangan mo yung period so you get the time interval so the time that you got a while ago and this one so this one minus this one that is your pulse period but there 's an easier way  kasi medyo mahirap yan kasi tatantyahin mo pa di ba  you could either so let 's just pick so piliin natin itong  portion lang na 'to okay  sobra mali mali  so magtiyaga kayo sa mouse so let 's uh choose this uh itong dalawang peaks  na 'to  we can actually zoom into this peak para mas madali  okay so let 's zoom so you choose this button so that button at the top  itong nasa itaas ha this one nakalagay naman e lalabas naman e  zoom window and then if you want to find the time interval so  lagyan natin ng mark so drag ito  you place it at the this first peak ang hirap ayan nilagyan nyo ng mark then you place this one on the next peak the x ang hirap  okay may sariling utak 'to referring to the mouse . so as you can see there nasaan na yun nandoon e nagtatago  delta okay it 's right over here ay nawala  okay so it 's the the one there yung nandoon nakita nyo  point zero uh teka dito na lang sa remote eto na lang  actually it 's delta t okay delta  t so if you use this mark yung m you have uh you would uh measure at once the time interval delta t so delta t is point ano yun saan na yun so point five seven five and that is your pulse period okay so pulse period okay so from there you get the pulse rate just take the reciprocal okay so ilagay nyo rin na pulse sa  rate pulse per second and pulse per minute before exercise then after this uh after getting your pulse rate uhm before exercise so  mag- bike kayo for lahat kayo   tig-isa lang ito so uh take turns okay  ma- experience nyo rin lahat  okay so while uh one group while one group is busy here the rest of you i want you to think about your project that you would be doing okay

Philippines	 first few words missing nursery of the institute of forest conservation at u p l b and with us is dr jose sarjento of the institute and uh dr sarjento is going to demonstrate to us a very important skill important to our survival  dr sarjento or can i call you joe yeah okay joe we all know that trees are a very important resource and if only each filipino will be able to plant a tree then that would mean about more than sixty million trees now my question is this would it be possible for elementary school children to be involved in tree-planting activities yeah it is very much possible in fact uh tree-planting is fun and it is uh a source of survival it 's a life-supporting activity uh-huh because many people believe that uh only adults should be involved in tree planting and uh if you are saying that even small children can do that would you be kind enough to demonstrate to us the different steps in planting a tree so uhm joe what do we have here are these uh common species that uh you use in your tree planting projects yes uh this one is uh our national tree uh-huh this is we call it narra  yes  terocarpus indicus  uh uhm and the other one this one is a south american tree uh-huh  pina matopilla  uh-huh these are two main reforestation species in the country i see could you please show us the different steps to follow in planting a tree uh this is the first step is to uh select the planting stock  you have to select uh in terms of uh size or in terms of age or in terms of vigor  yes   uh-huh  uh-huh so cough i would like to show to you the different sizes of seedlings  yes  yes for example this is a narra seedling yes another narra seedling uh-huh uh these are three narra seedlings uh-huh uh in in our condition in the philippines since we plant this in the mountain and usually covered with grasses  yes   yes  yes this is the right size of planting material  uh-huh  uh uhm this ranges from ten to twelve months old uh-huh so this is the right size uh uhm so if you plant potted seedlings this is the right size the things to remember are the size correct size and the right age  the size  the right age and also the the health uh i 'd like to show to you uh for instance uh this one this is a narra seedling yes and take note uh that this is damaged uh-huh this is attacked by insect yes yes uh be sure not to plant a seedling which is damaged by insect yeah choose a seedling which is healthy uh-huh okay okay this is a healthy seedling okay joe once we have selected the seedling what do we do next the the the next thing is to prepare for outplanting we have to transfer these in the field yes and uh for potted seedlings we usually place this in a bag uh uhm we have to place this in a bag and avoid having this damaged while transporting this yes now since most of our mountains are already bald and far from the town we have to transport as many seedlings possible in our bag  yes  yes so we usually use uh bare root stock and i would like to show to you later on how are we going to package this  uh huh   to put this in a container so that we could bring as many seedlings in the field  uh huh   uh huh  dr sarjento will now show us how to prepare and pack the seedlings for transport to the planting site okay joe okay  i have here seedlings of mahogany yes and uh this is bare root seedlings uh uhm this is a potted seedling uh uhm and this is uh this is heavy to transport  yes   if you 'd like to transport fifty or one hundred seedlings to the planting site  yes  right but this is lighter because there are no soil uh covering this  uh uhm  uh-huh and i would like to show to you how to prepare this first we 'll start with the root system  we 'll cut the top root  uh-huh  yes okay yes and next is to remove  some of the leaves   some of the leaves so that the transpiration will be minimized  yes  uh uhm okay  we 'll ah reduce this uh-huh and uh once you have reduced this more or less you will have a balanced uh root system on the top  yes   yes  uh-huh okay okay and uh once you have done this we 'll we 'll bundle this and uh this is a bundle of about fifty fifty seedlings of mahogany  yes   uh-huh   yes  yes and cough when you bundle this make sure that the root collar will be at the same level uh-huh okay like this yes uh-huh so the root collar are almost at the same level yes and when you plant make sure that the root system is uh protected by way of keeping it moist uh-huh okay to keep it moist we need a moist retention medium we have here uh clay and we just mix it with water and now we have mud and this will keep the so the root system moist for some time  yes   uh-huh   yes  uh-huh uh-huh so to on  so you cover the root once you have prepared the mud yes we dip this in the mud up to the root collar only  i see  uh-huh because if you dip this deeper up to this portion this will cause the rotting of the stem so make sure that only the root system and once it is uh deep in the in the mud we put this in our banana this is a banana sheet  yes   uh uhm   only the roots   uh-huh  yes cover this like this uh uhm and then we tie this uh uhm elmo kindly could you please help me so that 's another use for the saha  yeah okay take note that these are degradable materials 'no   yes that 's right  plastics are generally non-degradable yes uh-huh so the most important thing is the method and the materials will be environment friendly yes right okay  now we are in the planting site and the first thing to do in when you reach the planting site is to make sure that the site is properly prepared 'no  uh uhm we have cut the grasses weeds and then placed a marker for every planting spot okay uh uhm yes now before we plant i would like to show to you the the seedlings that we have just prepared and transported so you start with the bare root seedling   and uh i will start with the bare root seedling i 'll pick up one this one and i would like to repeat this is the root collar  yes  uh uhm and when we plant this seedling make sure that you plant at this level only when you plant bare root seedling we could use a simple stick  yes  uh uhm or if you have a crowbar we do it like this yeah okay  we we call this as a slip method uh uhm because after removing the the the bar we just insert this and we could just stamp it with your with your uh foot and then put a marker  yes   yes   yes  uh-huh okay what is the correct distance between the seedlings normally the correct distance varies from one meter to two meters  yes  uh-huh it depends on the species uh uhm for narra or mahogany the recommended spacing is two meters by two meters two meters by two meters yeah so it 's rel it 's really a very simple procedure yes yes okay the next thing that i will demonstrate is how to plant a potted seedling okay  now we have have a seedling of narra and take note that we have here uh the the soil covering the root system okay and make sure when you plant this minimize the destruction of the bowl of soil  yes  uh-huh so first we dig the soil yes okay  make sure that the depth of the of the hole is similar to the height or the depth of the root system uh-huh and so we 'll try this like this but of course one important thing to do is to remove the the plastic or the the coverage uh because this is generally non-degradable i see be very careful not to damage the root system  uh-huh   uh-huh okay this is the root collar and this is the whole root system uh uhm put it like this yes and normally we put put word soil uh-huh like this 'no  yes this is usually darker yes put this first uh-huh  and then put the soil okay cover this properly uh uhm make sure that the bowl will not be destroyed or damaged yes yes okay uh-huh  so the planting is finished uh-huh but there is one important thing that we should remember yes we should take good care of this right we don't we don't leave this like this because like a new newborn babe it needs care and protection  yes   that 's right first thing to do is make sure that the weeds will be removed most of the time yes and make sure that if there are insects coming in they should be protected  uh uhm  uh uhm there are now various ways of doing this how to protect this uh-huh but the first thing to do is make sure that the weeds are not covering the plant  i see  uh-huh so joe does it mean that the children would have to come back to the site from time to time  yes  yeah especially during the first three months they should come here every month  yes  uh-huh and they should consider this as a good exercise because tree-planting is fun yes
Philippines	we 're using the chunks in water yung red label natin because the red label is the versatile type of tuna of tuna wherein you can add it to a lot of things 'no  vegetables you can add it to uhm tawag dito to salads to soups just about to any any recipe that you would want to put tuna into so we have a very nice uh bowl here ia- assemble  lang natin yung ating salad yes may custom

our tuna yung tuna natin papatong lang din natin sa ibabaw so we can put that whole can in there we 're using two cans of century tuna just spread that on top and then we can uhm sprinkle it with a little uhm this is coriander leaves 'no chopped dyan lang sa ibabaw  it 's wansoy oo cilantro  iwan tayo ng kaunti while we move to our next procedure sylvs which is preparing our dressing okay so for our dressing we have a bowl here ayan ho meron tayong uhm sour cream  alam mo almost all mexican food they love to put sour cream and lime and avocado litsugas at keso sa kanila  and corn plays a very important uh role kasi di ba they they dance they dance for rain para mag- grow yung  corn nila  then we add a little hot sauce and then meron tayong  cumin yung cumin na nabibili natin dito  ground na  these are actually uh comes from seed 'no and then you toast them maganda nga if you toast them freshly and then you grind grind it na para mas matindi yung flavor but for convenience you can use already the this mayonnaise so imi- mix lang natin until very smooth okay and then we add a little bit of lime juice 'no kung wala silang lime juice they can use calamansi or lemon lemon juice ayan  we can put our dressing on top layer it and then we have avocado  pa sylvs 'no to go on top so well uhm let 's just pour everything there what we 're going to do next is put our avocado wedges on top  panahon ng avocado kaya  but this is actually this is good fat you know avocado is considered a fat but it 's good fat because it 's uhm low cholesterol yes  maganda kung medyo hindi masyadong ripe  yung avocado so it holds better and then we have some uhm cilantro leaves 'no that you can put there eto yun to give it a very fresh look  ayan  there you go our mexican tuna salad from century   pinakbet with century tuna ayan  uh alam mo sylvs the usual traditional  pinakbet na ginagawa natin  but alam mo pag pumunta ka kasi sa ilocos region  ano they put uh bagnet in your  pinakbet oo kaya

crispy tuna na gagawin nating topping for our pinakbet  so yung procedure natin we have two cans of century tuna chunky talaga grabe 'yan and  ang gagawin natin sylvs is uh lalagyan ho natin ng konting asin 'no  and then uhm over here nagpainit tayo ng uhm oil  'no and we 're going to deep fry our tuna hanggang sa maging brown when we deep fry mainit na yung ating cooking oil  kailangan tatakpan natin kasi nga may moisture siya so we will let that fry 'no i- fry lang natin siya hanggang sa maging light brown  yun pag naging light brown siya ganito na yung magiging hitsura niya but we will set that aside this is like it 's crunchy it 's crispy it 's very tasty and then with a little oil  'no the usual procedure lang yung ating bawang 'no 'yan and then we have konting ginger kasi may bagoong isda tayo hindi bagoong alamang which is one kind so pag nag-umpisa na siyang mainit we start adding our next ingredient which is yung ating sibuyas 'no  and then kamatis yung kamatis natin ginawa nating  chunk very chunky yung kamatis para magbigay din siya ng magandang  sauce so yung sabaw about two cups of tomatoes  ayan  so we this is our bagoong isda 'no very very aromatic ito yung magpapalasa   mapapansin mo wala na tayong asin walang vetsin  because this is good enough to taste to ano to flavor your uhm pinakbet 'no  so ilalagay natin yung ating kalabasa so you start with the matitigas first so this is kalabasa  sabay-sabay na natin 'no and then we will just cover it this is our okra 'no ilalagay lang natin diyan sa ibabaw at saka pag naggugulay tayo huwag nating haluin nang haluin  and then this is our uh eggplant na hiniwa natin ng ganito ibinabad lang sa tubig para di mangitim  so tatakpan natin hanggang lumambot siya and cooked half-way well this is about ready already ayan tingnan mo o  very nice you still have the intense green color 'no and then we take it off the heat 'no and then we words  there sa platter natin 'no  so get this ise- serve natin

and the nice thing about it is we 're going to mix it together with cottage cheese 'no  so very uhm high en ito high protein  talaga but first pakita ko lang sylvia  kung how they 're going to uhm deal with their baked potatoes 'no  so you have potatoes na ganito kalalaki 'no this is ideal for baked potatoes  kailangan ii- scrub nila using a vegetable brush 'no wag naman yung gamit na toothbrush vegetable brush ho ano o kaya uh basta any brush na malinis and then really really scrub it 'no   kasi you can eat the skin and it 's very very healthy and then you get a little bit of uhm shortening 'no  shortening kukuha ka lang kayo gayon you have to rub the whole thing so mantikang puti yes so ira- rub  natin yan 'no  and using a foil to keep and lock in the the goodness of your uhm what do you call this of your potatoes 'no iaano natin siya ibabalutin natin 'no  so you seal that 'no  stick it in the oven at three-seventy-five for thirty to forty minutes okay so lalagay natin

sylvs it 's a very very simple procedure 'no  so all we need is uhm yung ating cottage cheese  ilalagay lang natin you strain the excess liquid 'no  lagay nyo lang sa sa strainer para hindi masyadong basa uh pwede rin ang cheddar cheese basta ige-  grate mo lang siya  and then you have a little bit of mayonnaise okay and then and then  itong ating chopped celery yeah this will add crunch and texture into our uhm tuna 'no and then your chunks in water ayan magandang gamitin  red label guaranteed mas maraming laman 'no punung-puno and then onions 'no white onions nice for fish okay and then a squeeze of calamansi or lemon together with 'no  and salt and pepper minix na natin yung salt and pepper natin  so maganda ito kung ichi- chill mo ng konti sa fridge 'no uhm for about twenty minutes but we can a already use it diretso 'no to fill our baked potatoes  ito yung ating baked potatoes habang mainit siya you slit 'no  then you make uh slit like that and then ang gagawin natin ipu- push natin lalo na pag mainit yan you have to push it 'no to give it a really an open look 'no ayan oo  and we will fill it with our tuna ayan so hindi lang  sour cream or butter 'no you can also use century tuna and this is already a complete meal in itself 'no  let 's put that in our you can put parsley 'no you can put chives on top 'no  there you go  we 're going to use of course yung ating bida  the red label which is your tuna in vegetable oil and then of course meron tayong uhm rice stick noodles 'no  and then it 's a very simple step eto na yung ating mga  ingredients what we have to

Philippines	very pleasant afternoon to everyone ladies and gentlemen uh how are you today  fine okay i understand it 's a very exciting week 'no culmina culminating week of your science week is that right yeah first of all can i ask uh are most of you in what what colleges do you come from political science come again engineering liberal arts computer uh-huh commerce anyone from commerce right okay so this is actually a diverse group 'no  so at least i know who i am addressing anyway i 'd like to thank uh bing for that very warm introduction and i 'd like to thank your placement office for accepting our uhm talk for this afternoon so uh i 'm ms gail martinez and uh i am from the cora doloroso espa&ntilde;a branch uh perhaps uh we were thinking of either passing around something but we felt that it 's not necessary like uh you know like a brochure but i 'm sure you 're quite uh knowledgeable about locations you know so our school is located along espa&ntilde;a in front of u s t you heard of u s t so we are just right across the u s t campus on espa&ntilde;a the reason uh we are here uh my companion is actually mr janus ligpit he 's our staff and he 'll be assisting me later but uh the reason why we are here is uh for those of you who have not heard so much of our school is to be able to sort of orient you and enlighten you rather on how personality development can really be a very very basic ingredient in the success of one 's career as well as just day-to-day living 'no  uhm i 'm sure you have a basic understanding of what is personality right can i just ask the lady in stripe red can i ask just because there has to be some participation otherwise you 'd fall asleep so my talk will not just be a lecture it will actually be a demonstration lecture and visual presentation so that you don't knock out on me laughs  so ms lady in red and white you are in college i 'm sure you have gone through how many sixteen years of your you know chuckle  anyway can you possibly tell us uhm in your own words what is personality to you inaudible response  quite right okay uh gentleman in red  mahilig ako sa red ngayon okay i 'd like to just spot pick on people what is personality to you to the lady it 's the totality of a person you inaudible response  self-essence okay so the essence of all your qualities and that comes out in the way you do things so let me just give you a brief summary to capture uh to capsulize the meaning so personality may be defined as the sum total of the quality and characteristics of a person as shown in her manner of walking talking dressing attitude interests and ways of reacting to people and situations that shows your personality as a whole personality is also not just that but uh it can be also the physical emotional intellectual and spiritual dimensions of a person right so it also goes deeper than what people see all of you now are in college i would think most of you are eighteen nineteen twenty years old right did i miss any age did i overshoot underage or what but anyway at this point 'no you are going through a transition from being teenagers to coming into the real world of professionals right you are in prepar preparing yourselves to become professionals in the world as what de la salle the de la salle mission states that you know to come up with whole persons right and to be a whole person it 's not it 's not enough that you are knowledgeable here but your knowledge should also be more complete and whole in the development of your characteristics your personality you may be very good in academics very good but if you 're very well uh weak let 's say so your strong points may be the academic but your weak points are in personal relations and dealings with people uh be they professors or boys and girls or whoever then i wouldn't think you 're successful you are not successful i 'm i have to say this straight to you a successful person according to research in harvard is that eighty-five percent of their success is attributed to their attitude and personality fifteen percent is to their what they know because you may have a lot of things in your head but you don't know how to go about it in life and deal with people you cannot communicate your ideas you just know it here and you just stick to yourself then you are not what you call a whole person and what de la salle wants is a whole person so personality plays an important role i for one am a graduate of de la salle in mass com and psychology but i lived abroad for seven years i worked there and i learned so much about life and ups and downs but because of that learning process i found out that it 's not how much you know but it 's more on your dealings with people but don't take me wrong it 's good to be academically excellent no problem about that no doubt about that but coupled with personality you will make it big out there okay and don't forget him of course 'no okay so uh let us assess now you are teenagers going into your twenties i was once yours at your stage and boy it was really adjustment 'no kasi like i was in a wo girls school all my life then when i got to la salle we were only twenty-five percent female of the whole population  buti you you are now fifty percent of the population or more more 'no okay so you 're very uh blessed with that so i 'd like to demonstrate to you a few things how personality can really help you in your dealings day-to-day it will be a practical thing alright because when you start working ladies and gentlemen it 's good that the interviewer who interviews you on the job sees your academic potentials but when it comes to actual emanation of you know your personality he sees you lacking in some things then he would have to you know uh assess you more if he should choose another one because granted there was a secretary i knew she was good at typing steno computer but she was so quiet and so you know to herself that a new person came in the office who didn't type as fast who didn't steno as fast and who was poor in computer but because she was so lively and very good in communicating she got a job that was she was promoted faster than the secretary with skills that 's just a very solid example alright one of the courses we teach in cora doloroso is i 'll write on the board   savvy skills is for women it can be for men we call it personal development for men but savvy skills deals with a total personality which deals with what poise etiquette what is etiquette manners okay at least that much you can tell me uh personal relations for the ladies make-up and skin care 'cause when you start working you are not to go to the office with a blank face you have to put on something color to look uh professionally groomed so to speak grooming is a very important subject so i used to teach grooming last year to the orient three name of orientation course in la salle 'no okay orient two three okay so grooming uhm entertaining is one of our subjects because you socialize and you have to learn the interactions okay then personal relations even selection of wines is included so that you 're not gonna be caught oh oh i don't know how to select wines oh oh i 'll think i 'll order a coke oh oh uh things like that 'no  so at least you are knowledgeable even if you don't drink you know what i mean you don't drink but you have to order something that sounds alcoholic so you don't look so neneng-neneng you know so for example uhm uh there 's a drink called rum cola  you 've heard that 'no  rum cola there 's rum and there 's cola seventy-five percent of it is rum e coke i 'm sorry one uh twenty-five percent is rum so now you can tell the waiter i 'll order a rum cola but less on the rum or something like that okay so it 's like you 're ordering really an alcoholic drink but you 're removing the rum in turn you have coke right okay so there 's just so much for you to learn in order to be socially adaptable to different people right okay so what else so wine selection can i have a brochure please kasi uh when i face all of you you know i get wow okay so next we have conversational abilities is one of them  kasi it 's good that you can communicate to all levels of people be they managers you know be they drivers or servants or you know uh officemates you know things like that and then culture updates so culture update is more on appreciation of art and music now and the present so you 're not totally out of touch 'no with what 's going on okay then uh poise is one so practically uh ten subject matters so now i am going to demonstrate a little bit naman 'no so a little showmanship of how to walk for the ladies the speaker demonstrates and laughter from audience  okay i told you this is a variety show but the only thing i 'm not going to sing 'no that 's one thing i 'm still practicing so for the ladies how will i do this you know where uhm i would have to walk this way then i 'll just try walking this way uh i don't know how far you can see me the ladies on this side can you see me at this point and the men later on i 'll go to that side as much as possible you could try to stretch your neck down so ladies 'no in general we are very normal amphibians amphibians ba tayo  yeah so when we walk it 's just a normal pacing of walking so i would assume a normal walk for us generally speaking will be like this 'no demonstration okay you may not know it but these are the subtleties of personality development what would be the way how would be the way we teach it at cora doloroso you see this line that line okay the line would indicate that you are to walk in a straight line with one foot in front of the other but don't make it in such a point that you 're like walking on a tight rope on a circus string 'no  no no no that doesn't mean that it means you have an imaginary line wherein your feet are no longer parallel but your feet are going alignment in front of the other now pretend you 're in a palace and you 're walking through the palace floor you know or in a grace or in a park so you would have to walk this way so right left right left and you make a turn turn right left right left and then turn you do it in a way that is smooth 'no   hindi 'yung demonstration c a t na 'yan 'no gano'n audience laughs  what we mean is be very natural so when you start working even now when you 're walking through the campus and the guys are all watching everybody watching you so at least naman you have some kind of gait 'no okay now this is preferable if you wear one inch heels kasi i notice we are now wear most girls are wearing boys' shoes and flat shoes well never the mind as you uh start progressing into the professional world you 'd have to practice wearing heels and we teach you to wear heels in offices whatever offices you go into at least one and a half inches don't wear flats you 'd look like an ordinary clerk you see that is part of personality you wear one and a half okay that 's part of wardrobe okay for the men you don't walk in a straight line okay laughter  men don't walk in a straight line thank goodness otherwise okay you just walk in the normal 'yon okay so boys have no problem so that 's savvy okay next i would like to demonstrate also uh okay how to carry a shoulder bag okay can i borrow a bag please does uh anyone okay you know this is a very practical very practical lecture i don't lecture to make you sleep because that 's not the point of it all but i have to show you techniques to show how important these all are okay let 's say you 're going shopping somewhere or going to a certain place where you know there are lots of uh mandurukot you know kasi we sometimes have to go to places like recto or tondo or divisoria or whatever uh places that you know are where these people abound 'no  so what you do is you place uh well let 's first go to makati okay first i want to show the difference laughter or galleria so for the men no problem because normally you don't carry much like a clutch bag or something is normal 'no  but for the ladies well as usual marami tayong bitbit 'no  okay okay so if possible we could carry a briefcase with all our stuff but for places that are safe no need to fear keep your bag at the side and you just walk demonstration in a swinging manner okay for places that are you know uhm full of uh mandurukots i believe you should place your three fingers okay three fingers at the handle this way and place it right in front of your okay okay lap here okay and then just walk okay now it might make you feel well at least poised ka rin kahit natatakot kang madukutan 'no laughter 
Philippines	if your honors please uh we received at uh one thirty-five uh this afternoon a copy of the comment opposition to motion to quash filed by the prosecution we note in this comment which the prosecution has filed that they do not dispute the facts on the basis of which the motion to quash is predicated i shall therefore no longer deal with the facts and proceed to deal with the arguments the motion to quash uh is based on no less than the constitution itself particularly article eleven entitled accountability of public officers  under article eleven section three subparagraph six the senate shall have the sole power to try and decide all cases of impeachment when is there a case of impeachment there is a case of impeachment when pursuant to section three subparagraph one the house of representatives exercises its exclusive power to initiate a case of impeachment  the senate would have no jurisdiction to deal with a matter of impeachment unless the impeachment case comes to the senate from the house of representatives which under section three subparagraph one has the exclusive power to initiate all cases of impeachment  so now if your honors please i shall deal with the power of the house of representatives the constitution itself provides as to how the house of representatives may exercise its exclusive power to initiate a case of impeachment this is described and provided for in subparagraphs two three and four of section three article eleven let me first deal with our first ground if your honors please that the house of representatives has not initiated a case of impeachment and that the case of impeachment now before the senate was not initiated by the house of representatives as i have stated if your honors please section three paragraph one says the house of representatives  it does not say one-third of the members of the house of representatives it says the house of representatives shall have the exclusive power to initiate all cases of impeachment  the case of impeachment before the senate was not forwarded to the senate by the house of representatives i have looked at transmissions of bills approved by the house of representatives for concurrence of the senate they are sent by the secretary-general and the secretary-general explicitly states in his letter of transmission that he does so upon instruction of the house of representatives the case of impeachment now before the senate if your honors please and we have appended as annex a of our motion to quash the journal of the house of representatives of november thirteen two thousand  the meeting was called to order the national anthem was sung the speaker read a prayer and immediately he made a manifestation the entire manifestation consisting of a reading of the report of the committee on justice to the house on the verified complaint for impeachment against his excellency president joseph ejercito estrada  there were some attempts on the part of members of the house to raise point of order but they were ignored by the speaker he continued uh to read simply the report of the committee on the judiciary and i call your attention particularly to this portion of the report and this is quoted at page six of our motion the second full paragraph and i quote likewise upon motion which was unanimously approved the body resolved to refer to the plenary for further appropriate action the verified complaint and the verified resolutions of endorsement of seventy-seven members of the house filed by them apparently in line with the  2 words etcetera  i emphasize if your honors please that what the committee on the judiciary approved was to refer to the plenary not to the speaker to refer to the plenary for further appropriate action the verified complaint and the verified resolutions of endorsement of course if your honors please at the conclusion of the report it says accordingly the impeachment complaint which shall constitute the articles of impeachment together with the verified resolutions of endorsement are hereby forwarded to the speaker  this obviously your honors please is not a pronouncement of the committee on the judiciary this perhaps was a statement of the chairman of the committee on the judiciary and if you are to read this and relate this to the portions of the report of the judiciary i have read this would mean that the matter is referred to the plenary through the speaker for further appropriate action now after reading the report of the committee on the judiciary speaker villar simply said and this is i 'm reading from the journal  speaker villar thereafter manifested that since the constitution mandates that when at least one-third of all the members of the house files a verified complaint or a resolution of impeachment the same shall constitute the articles of impeachment  and the duty of the house becomes peremptory and ministerial to endorse it to the senate for trial in the same manner as an approved bill accordingly the speaker directed the secretary-general to immediately transmit to the senate the impeachment complaint constituting the articles of impeachment together with the verified resolutions of endorsement   you will note if your honors please that even speaker villar spoke of the duty of the house not the duty of the speaker but the duty of the house whether peremptory whether ministerial or by whatever way you describe it the power and to speaker villar the duty was vested is vested by the constitution in the house of representatives and not in the speaker so then it may be asked but what could the house have done one-third is just a matter of counting numbers there can be no dispute about that perhaps none but even the counting of the number is a responsibility of the house and not a responsibility of the speaker but apart from that and perhaps even more substantial i would concede that speaker villar would have no difficulty counting whether there is one-third but perhaps he would have had trouble determining whether the complaint and the resolutions were verified if these were submitted to the house questions would have been raised as in fact these questions were manifested in a subsequent session of the house of representatives as to the adequacy of the verification which appeared in the resolutions appended to the complaint so it is clear the house took no action on the complaint and the resolutions speaker villar merely acted as a post office transmitting it to the senate but the constitution requires that even if speaker villar were to be a post office the stamp had to be placed there not by speaker villar but by authority of the house of representatives that is our first ground if your honors please that is why it is our submission that the case before the senate is not a case of impeachment over which the senate may exercise jurisdiction simply because it has it did not come to the senate by virtue of the exercise the exclusive the exercise of the exclusive power to impeach of the house of representatives now we now go to the second ground while section three subparagraph one speaks of the house of representatives having the exclusive power to initiate all cases of impeachment subparagraphs two three and four describe how the house of representatives may initiate a case of impeachment it provides ways that is described in subparagraph two and that which is described in subparagraph four it is our submission well that what is before the senate has come purportedly pursuant to section three paragraph four which provides  in case the verified complaint or resolution of impeachment is filed by at least one-third of all the members of the house the same shall constitute the articles of impeachment and trial by the senate shall proceed forthwith proceed  we emphasize if your honors please that firstly the complaint or resolution must be verified and secondly that it must be filed by at least one-third of all the members of the house it 's not disputed that the complaint bef now before the senate was not filed by one-third the number of representatives who endorsed amounted to more than one-third because of resolutions of endorsement which were appended or added to the original endorsers that is after october twelve two thousand the complaint was originally endorsed only by thirty-eight representatives but on november six two thousand the committee on justice took note that there were now seventy-seven representatives so it is not disputed that the complaint was not filed by at least one-third the more important requirement in our view is the requirement that the complaint or resolution be verified it is our submission that this requirement is substantial in nature and may not be dispensed with let us recall that under section three subparagraph two which is another mode of initiating a case of impeachment before the house of representatives not now by at least one-third but possibly by a complaint by a private citizen which is endorsed by any member of the house what is significant up under section three par  subparagraph two is that after the complaint is filed it 's ceasing it is required to be included in the order of business within ten session days and then this is the more important part and referred to the proper committee within three session days thereafter  the committee the constitution provides the committee after hearing and by majority of all its members shall submit its report to the house  etcetera  for what purpose does the committee conduct a hearing well the hul the rules of the house are clear this hearing under its rule three entitled finding a probable cause the hearing is conducted to determine whether there is probable cause evidence is received by the committee for the complainant as well as evidence for the respondent the committee will then determine will then evaluate the evidence and determine whether there is probable cause and after having determined whether there is probable cause the matter is then submitted through a report of the committee to the house for a vote we emphasize this because under subparagraph four where at least one-third of the members of the house file a complaint for impeachment the hearing is dispensed with in other words evidence is not received there is no determination of probable cause but in lieu of that the constitution requires that the complaint be verified why does the constitution consider verification of a complaint by one-third of the members of the house sufficient why does the constitution consider this in lieu of a hearing uh adequate to determine probable cause in our motion we have quoted the provisions of the rules of court which were then enforced in nineteen eighty-seven when the constitution was uh written and ratified verification means taking an oath attesting to the truth of the allegations of the complaint on the basis of one 's own knowledge otherwise stated at least one-third of the members of the house would be saying under oath the allegations of facts of the complaint are true because we know it to be true i would assume therefore i would assume that when one-third of the members of the house say under oath and under pain of perjury that the allegations of the complaint are true that can be accepted in lieu of a hearing let it not be suggested that that would make it difficult for any complaint of imp for impeachment to be passed by the house there is no difficulty because then if not one-third of the members of the house swear under oath that the allegations of the complaint are true of their knowledge then you go to the first method and that is refer the complaint to the committee on the judiciary receive evidence and on the basis of that evidence determine probable cause several seconds pause  i apologize my attention has been called that in the house it is called committee on justice perhaps it is a more appropriate name than judiciary clears throat  now what is the verification we find in the complaint and the resolutions appended to the complaint which is now before the senate the verification reads and i will read the the positive portion  that we have caused the complaint uh that the allegations therein that is in the complaint are true of our own knowledge and belief on the basis of our reading and appreciation of documents and other records pertinent thereto  let me repeat it the allegations are true of our own knowledge and belief but the key clause or the key phrase after that is this on the basis of our reading and appreciation of documents and other records pertinent thereto  so whoever signed the verifications to this complaint as well as the resolution did not say this uh the allegations of facts are true of my knowledge he says they are true because i believe them to be true on the basis of my reading and appreciation of documents and other records pertinent thereto indeed nobody knows what these records and pertinent records are they are not identified this we submit is not a verification of fact when one speaks of verification in law it is verification of facts this is not a verification of fact it is a statement of an opinion because when one says based on my reading and appreciation of documents one makes renders an opinion two persons can easily disagree on one how one appreciates a document and now you are talking of seventy-seven persons or even more each one of them could have had their appreciation of documents and these are documents which we are unable even to verify as to whether those appreciations are reasonable enough for them to be accepted because the documents and the records are not identified so we then have before the senate articles of impeachment on the  ar articles of impeachment on which there has been no finding or warrant of probable cause either by evidence or by the oath of one-third of the members of the house of representatives that being the case if your honors please the complaint before the house cannot qualify under section three subparagraph four of article eleven of the constitution let me suggest if your honors please why the constitution perhaps require this it will be recalled that under the nineteen thirty-five constitution perhaps uh the constitution which we have had which was least exposed to partisan considerations other than perhaps our desire then to become independent under that constitution in order that the house of representatives may impeach an official a vote of two-thirds was required and in order that the senate may convict a three-fourths vote was required this requirement has been relaxed 
Philippines	uhm with the permission of the chief justice distinguished senators we filed our opposition only at about one thirty this afternoon because truth to tell we could not make out what the president 's counsel meant when they filed the motion to quash we felt that they were trying to convert the proceedings into a criminal proceeding by giving it the title of a motion to quash which is  in a criminal proceeding and the senate rules does not have any provision on a motion to dismiss or to quash in for interlocutory motions then there 's rules of court are  suppletory  so i made a telephone inquiry to the president of the senate to ask him what would happen this afternoon and he said you argue the prosecution ar i mean the prosecution will argue the defense will argue so we took it to to mean that there would be a hearing on this motion so we prepared and finalized our motio our opposition mr chief justice our law professors have told us over and over again that the constitution speaks of separation of powers checks and balances and coequality that has been instilled in us the president would want us to destroy that delicate balance in filing this motion to dismiss what is an impeachment process we agree that the house has the exclusive power to initiate impeachment and the senate has the sole power to try and decide impeachment cases so you see immediately the distinction we in the house initiate the senate decides so have we initiated yes and if you look closely at the process there 's the magic number of one-third in both the senate and in the house if we get one-third of the members of the house then that one-third prevails over the other two-thirds that is the beauty of this one-third so let me repeat mr chief justice distinguished members of the senate this is an instance where the one-third prevails over the two-thirds and this is what happened and in the case of the senate one-third plus one can block an impeachment so here 's the magic number of one-third one-third to initiate one-third plus one for the senate to block the impeachment this was placed there for good reason now what happened the fact of the matter is that when this started this was started by forty-one members of the house short of the seventy-three i myself was not a signatory to the original uhm impeachment complaint in my case i wanted steeped in the principle of due process i wanted to know whether there was really grounds to impeach the president in fact if you look at the eleven-member panel here i think half of them were not original signatories along the way this was referred to the committee on justice but before the committee on justice could hear it seventy-seven had signed we reached the magic number of seventy-three and under the constitution once you have seventy-three that impeachment complaint is transmitted to the senate and trial shall start forthwith no ifs no buts when one-third of the membership of the house says we want to impeach the president no one but no one can stop the house the one-third speaks for the house and that is exactly what happened but did we follow the rules yes there was a committee hearing and in that committee hearing  talks to other members of panel alright and in that committee hearing everybody was heard those against impeachment and those pro but faced with seventy-seven signatures the opposition collapsed hmh talks to other members of panel  just can i have just a little moment what 's the pleasure of uh atty arroyo i just want to read here the journal because the president 's counsel have used this as reason the journal of journal of the house of uh november thirteen where it reproduces the action taken by the committee it reads likewise upon motion which was unanimously approved unanimous the body resolved to refer to the plenary for further appropriate action the verified complaint and the verified resolutions of endorsement of seventy-seven members of the house filed by them apparently in line with the essence and spirit of section three subparagraph four of article eleven of the constitution of the philippines and section thirteen of the rules of procedure on impeachment proceedings seventy-seven the committee had no choice the committee by unanimous vote even against those who were against impeachment said refer this to plenary  now what happened mr chief justice on november thirteen the speaker having had the report of the committee incidentally mr chief justice and distinguished members of the senate this was not a committee report mind you this is a report as we understand it in legislation in legislation we submit a committee report but in impeachment it is a mere report we are not guided by the rules on legislation we were guided by the rules on impeachment the house had rules of impeachment in the eighth the ninth the tenth and the present eleventh congress and the reason for that is that impeachment complaints were filed with the house the senate had no impeachment rules for the simple reason that nothing ever reached the senate except this one now just to give our colleagues in the senate an idea about what transpired in the house  when the speaker said that he is transmitting the impeachment complaint endorsed by seventy-seven members to the senate he did so as he puts it his job was ministerial and peremptory and that he transmitted it in line with our own provisions which reads talks to other members of panel our own rules our own rules says our own rule says mr chief justice that a verified complaint-resolution of impeachment filed by at least one-third of all the members of the house shall constitute the articles of impeachment and in this case the verified complaint-resolution shall be endorsed to the senate in the same manner as an approved bill of the house an approved bill of the senate or of the house means that there 's no further thing further action to do and what is an approved bill under the rules of the house here is what is an approved bill section eighty-six the secretary-general without need of an express order shall transmit to the senate for its concurrence all bills and joint or concurrent resolutions approved by the house or the amendments of the house to bills or resolutions of the senate as the case may be  the treatment of an impeachment complaint which has been converted into an articles of eh eh impeachment is treated as an approved bill and being an approved bill no further ceremony is necessary it is administrative in nature and that is exactly what the senate did no uh what the house did now mr chief justice perhaps the question would be would uh is asked did we verify this yes did seventy-seven verify this yes the president 's counsel keeps on repeating and repeating and repeating a verification under the rules of court as understood by the supreme court sir we are not bound by the rules of court the house has its own rules we only listen and obey our own rules and our own rules has its own verification and i will read it it says section thirteen of the rules of impeachment the contents of the verification shall be shall be as follows i quote  we after being sworn in accordance with law depose and state that we are the complainants in the above-entitled complaint-resolution of impeachment that we have caused the said complaint-resolution to be prepared and have read the contents thereof and that the allegations therein are true of our own knowledge and belief on the basis of our reading and appreciation of documents and other recor records pertinent thereto  mr chief justice distinguished senators this is what we did that is the verification and that is in accordance with our own rules and nobody can challenge our own rules not the senate not the supreme court not anyone now what are these rules these rules we have our rules pursuant to the constitution because the constitution says section three subsection eight on impeachment the congress shall promulgate its own rules on impeachment to effectively carry out the purpose of this section  we did just that we have our own rules and our own rules say what i have read and that we followed but the president 's counsel tells us we should follow the rules of court no sir we don't we cannot be bound because insofar as the house is concerned we are supreme within our own sphere so what is the next question on the question of verification and could there be irregularities mr chief justice distinguished senators on the day november thirteen you had your reorganization we had our reorganization right after the articles of impeachment were transmitted to the senate we elected the eleven members of the prosecution team and it 's in the journal the journal that president 's counsel have been reading we used it we will use the same text page four of the journal of november thirteen two thousand  election of house prosecutors on motion of rep apostol there being no objection there being no objection the following members were elected as house prosecutors representatives feliciano belmonte jr sergio a f apostol joker p arroyo raul m gonzales wigberto e ta&ntilde;edo ta&ntilde;ada oscar s moreno oscar s rodriguez salacmid f baterina roan i libarios antonio eduardo b nachura and clavel a martinez  they 're all here no one objected to our election electing the prosecutors is part of the constitutional process of impeachment and that was done no one and not only that the same journal relied upon by the president 's counsel on page five says remarks of rep teodoro at this point rep gilbert c teodoro jr hoped that he had the unanimous concurrence of the members of the majority on the election of eleven members of the house as prosecutors at impeachment trial in the senate subsequently he stated the majority coalition has no objection thereto the the chair noted the same  eleven members were elected as part of the continuation of the impeachment initiation of the impeachment because under the constitution the house prosecutes and we have done it now mr chief justice clears throat we have demonstrated at least that every phase have do we have done it the house has done with meticulous adherence to the constitution and the rules but after the election of the eleven prosecutors what happened there was a reorganization what with the reorganization a new a new speaker and a new majority was formed we asked the question mr speaker and for our colleagues in the senate who are familiar with this the new majority could have questioned the proceedings they did not as a matter of fact they sought they agreed they validated everything made number one they ge gave us an appropriations second the speaker newly-elected speaker swore us in what more does the president 's counsel want every action was ratified by the new majority imagine swearing us in in plenary in the presence of the entire house in fact the pr all the objections of the president must be addressed to the house any remedy in any defect in the proceedings cannot be cured not in the senate not in the supreme court it has to be in the house because we are supreme in our own uh in our own place but what does the president 's counsel want like little babies they want to ask the supreme court the senate to nullify what the house did no sir mr chief justice we have tried to show that there is really nothing wrong with what we did and we in the house are jealous of this out of the seventy-seven has anyone withdrawn his signature no in fact we have one hundred and five we have one hundred and five can we say now that the senate can tell us as the president 's counsel is tr would would like the senate to do no we will tell you what to do you nullify the remedy is in the house if they want to but they cannot in fact they 're now the majority 's now in estoppel they cannot after swearing us in after giving us five million to fund us there 's nothing more that they can do 
Philippines	 the presiding officer calls on the speaker  mr chief justice your your honors please i 've never given much importance to an oath but all of us have taken our oaths our chair congressman belmonte has read the oath but i will read the oath again of the president because it 's only now that i realize what this oath is all about when jos when joseph ejercito estrada took his oath high noon of june thirty nineteen ninety-eight he said i do solemnly swear that i will faithfully and conscientiously fulfill my duties as president of the philippines preserve and defend its constitution execute its laws give justice to every man and consecrate break in recording  in nineteen ninety-eight he promised the province of ilocos sur that he would release the monies that were wilheld withheld by president ramos then on june twenty-seven july twenty-seven nineteen ninety-eight when all of us listened to his state of the nation address he said that the nation is bankrupt  but then here comes governor singson and tells the president mr president could you make good the promise you gave to the people of ilocos sur the president said yes but he gave a condition what was that he said that fifteen percent of all those monies that he would send to ilocos sur should go to him now this was barely a month one and a half months after he took his oath and after he declared that the government was bankrupt but he provided money for ilocos sur so sometime in august he released through the budget two hundred million for ilocos sur  well and good but then comes atong ang presidential adviser and tells the president and tells governor singson the president wants one hundred thirty million of the two hundred million singson asked why he gave only two hundred why should i give one hundred thirty atong ang says that is the partial one hundred thirty you will get some more so it is on that basis that that prosecution will detail how the highest and supposedly the most exalted official of our nation systematically diverted the people 's money to himself and his family and we will show how it was what transpired  and what we will show clearly indicates that the diversion of taxes to the president 's pock pocket was a planned and swiftly executed maneuver in fact the transaction was completed in less than three days three individuals delia rajas eleuterio tan and alma alfaro acted as fronts and dummies they conspired with atong ang who was acting on the president 's behalf to divert to mr estrada one hundred thirty million originally intended to alleviate the plight of tobacco farmers of ilocos sur the manner in which these individuals accomplished was truly ingenious let 's start the first day thursday august twenty-seven nineteen ninety-eight check number zero nine six seven five zero for the amount of one hundred seventy million for the cash advance approved by the provincial board was released to governor singson governor singson authorized members of his staff maricar paz and mari marina atendido to represent him in transactions with the vigan branch of the land bank of the philippines from the one hundred and seventy million forty million went to the curing barn bar supplier while the one hundred thirty legitimate forty million while the one hundred thirty million that atong asked went to the president and his family you may ask why how was this done governor singson instructed the land bank vigan to remit to land bank shaw boulevard fifty million for the account of delia rajas forty million for the account of eleuterio tan forty million for the account of alma alfaro you ask the question how in the world can these private individuals become uh-uh should open accounts of public funds they 're private individuals no connection with the government no connection with the tobacco industry but accounts were opened already on their behalf now with undue haste alma alfaro tried to withdraw the forty million in cash on the same day or on august twenty seven nineteen ninety-eight but since the bank did not have the cash she was advised to go back the following day twenty-eight august alfaro returned on that day and withdrew the forty million in cash at around ten a m remember the forty million that 's already cash on august twenty-eight a friday with extreme haste eleuterio tan withdrew the forty million with indecent haste delia rajas also withdrew the fifty million then with the ninety million forty plus fifty-three cashier 's checks were purchased from land bank shaw boulevard payable to eleuterio tan strange as it may seem on the same day august twenty-eight nineteen ninety-nine another person using the same name eleuterio tan opened a savings account this time with another bank westmont bank mandaluyong branch under savings account number two zero one one zero zero seven seven two dash seven what must be emphasized if your honors please is that these two eleuterio tans had two different faces two different dates of birth two different addresses and two different specimen signatures yet eleuterio tan number two had in his possession the same three cashier 's checks pur purchased by eleuterio tan number one and delia rajas so here is the money trail of what was originally public funds already messed up into private funds the next day saturday and sunday sana no transactions the third working day august thirty-one monday eleuterio tan number two deposited in his westmont bank mandaluyong branch savings account the three cashier 's checks totaling ninety million which came came from eleuterio tan number one the deposit was made at nine fifty-two a m for those around they could see the money trail clearly it 's all there on the same day in an unprecedented banking transaction the three cashier 's checks were encashed and the money was withdrawn from the westmont bank mandaluyong branch these withdrawals were as follows twenty million at twelve thirty-two p m forty million at one fifty-five p m and thirty million at one at two forty-eight p m all in cold cash all in uh two hours after each withdrawal the money in thick bundles of crisp bills was brought to the nearby house of atong ang 's mother in mandaluyong city where governor singson was waiting atong ang had even to involve his mother in this kind of transaction the brazen manner in which the president finally took custody of these public funds shows the depths of shame and disgrace to which that office has fallen the prosecution will prove that from the house of atong ang 's mother governor singson together with the president 's intermediary atong ang brought the crispy bills totaling one hundred thirty million the ninety million withdrawn from westmont bank the forty million earlier drawn by alma alfaro from land bank shaw boulevard directly to the president 's home in one polk street north greenhills at this juncture your honors please this one hundred thirty million is different from what congressman uh apostol said that 's jueteng money this one is tobacco money and these are public funds that 's why the seriousness of this how public funds got into the pocket of the president is something we we would request you to ponder very carefully after all both governor singson and mr ang were close friends of the president and could be trusted to be complicit partners in this transaction governor singson will reveal in detail what happened at the president 's house he will narrate how mr estrada scolded atong ang for giving part of the money to the first lady and presidential son jinggoy estrada governor singson will narrate how the president also berated atong ang for pocketing a portion of the funds for himself without the president 's knowledge and permission governor singson will also tell us that the first lady even expressed her profound thanks to him for the millions of pesos she received governor singson will give us a first account of how public funds intended to alleviate the living conditions of our needy tobacco farmers in ilocos sur instead found their way into the pocket of a greedy president this creative and bald-faced manner of diverting cash shows how the people 's money could be easily stolen it couldn't be done no way unless they 've been under the instruction and under the auspices of the office of the president the amount is just so big and the transaction so fast in three days public funds were converted into private funds in three days they were in from vigan in three days they were in the pocket of the president of the philippines by authorizing the release of public funds with the clear and deliberate intention of ultimately appropriating these amounts for himself the president must account to the people he has sworn to serve and protect he is clearly unfit to lead he must go article two consists of two parts i 'll now proceed to the second part article eleven section seventeen of the nineteen eighty-seven constitution provides that a public officer or employee shall upon assumption of office and as often thereafter as may be required by law submit a declaration under oath of his assets liabilities and net worth all of us here did that all of them did it republic act three zero one nine and six seven one three also require public officers to submit a sworn true and detailed statement of assets and liabilities including a statement of the amounts and sources of his income and financial and business interests on april twenty-nine nineteen ninety-nine and april twenty-eight two thousand president joseph e estrada filed his nineteen ninety-eight and ninety-nine statement of assets and liabilities respectively with disclosing under oath only his wife 's interests and financial connections in three corporations and making it appear that he himself has no interest and financial connection in any company in the course of the impeachment proceeding we will prove him wrong we will provide indisputable evidence that president estrada lied under oath because he deviously concealed his interests and financial connections in the following corporations among others but not limited to break in the recording  st peter st peter holding company dex resources company hady states holdings company verdant resources company f v c now v f c wealthy and development company valhalla resources company gelf real estate and development company j e films and video one corporation erap youth erap youth muslim foundation we will prove that in july nineteen ninety-nine president estrada through presidential counsel edward serap serapio remember if your honors please remember this name because it may keep on recurring it was it was mentioned by uh congressman apostol in the jueteng thing now he is also involved here he is the president 's personal lawyer  serapio caused the incorporation of st peter 's holdings and dex resources for the purpose of acquiring real property now remember this under the articles of incorporation each of these corporations have identical stockholders identical directors identical incorporators all were partners and associates of president estrada 's personal lawyer edward serapio all the companies also had the same office address the law office of edward serapio in addition they have the same authorized capital of one million and a mere paid-up capital of sixty-two thousand five hundred pesos remember this paid-up capital of sixty-two thousand five hundred we shall prove that on october one nineteen ninety-nine jose luis yulo again remember this name a close friend of the president acquired all but four qualifying shares in st peter 's holdings and caused the increase in the paid-up capital of the corporation to two hundred fifty thousand then as evident in a deed of sale dated october one nineteen ninety-nine which we 'll show in the impeachment proceeding st peter 's holdings purchased from vicente and gerardo madrigal a seven thousand one hundred forty-nine square meter property in new manila otherwise known as boracay for eighty-six million now pray tell me how can a corporation with a capital of fifty-two thousand five hundred acquire a property worth eighty-six million by no stretch of imagination can serapio ever say or even jose yulo say that he capitalizes or his corporation has a paid-in capital of sixty-two thousand five hundred and he can buy a property from the madrigals for eighty-six million now we shall also prove that st peter 's holding paid the eighty-six million with a b p i cashier 's check and more which st peter 's holdings purchased using funds from his newly opened account in b p i we shall show that st peter 's account was funded from jose luis yulo 's personal account in b p i and that jose luis yulo 's account personal account in b p i turned was in turn funded with check number zero one one zero seven one four nine five one issued by a person whose signature appears on the screen  we want you to see this signature study very closely you 'll notice look at the lower portion which has an arrow look at the signature examine it carefully it purports then look at the signature of the president in a five hundred peso bill which is on top you need not be an expert to see the similarity the name may be different but there are unmistakable signs that the signature in that check is the signature of the handwriting of the president of the philippines
Philippines	thank you mr chief justice mr chief justice i 'll be very very brief i uh feel when i 'm standing in this chamber this evening that uh i 'm actually facing the bar of history and the bar of public opinion there is a certain amount of tre trepidation in my heart but nonetheless i must perform my duty as i must being a member of this chamber mr president uh mr uh chief justice i 'm not saying at this point that president joseph ejercito estrada is guilty of the charges against him neither am i saying that he is innocent not yet what i 'm saying at this point and this is the only issue before us is that i cannot as a judge perform the function of the house of representatives which has the sole power authority and perer  prerogative to prepare the articles that will impeach and impeach the president if indeed the president of the philippines committed the alleged wrongdoings being imputed to him on the basis of the facts claimed to have been uncovered by the prosecution after the articles of impeachment have been elevated to the senate then let the house of representatives perform its constitutional duty to prepare a new set of article or articles of impeachment to embody the newly discovered acts of alleged wrongdoing to do otherwise mr uh chief justice and ladies and gentlemen of the senate i humbly submit that this senate acting as an impeachment court has no power under the constitution to amend the articles of impeachment before us it cannot constitutionally and validly perform the task lodged solely by the constitution on the house of representatives to do that to do so would be a total travesty of due process and a transgression of elementary fairness you know mr uh chief justice ladies and gentlemen of this chamber we talk of discovering the truth there are people in this chamber who do not know the meaning of truth one time and i 'll tell you this i was charged with a crime that was not even in our statute books rebellion complex with murder and my witness to the fact that i was innocent and even the distinguished member of the senate senator cayetano knows about this and some gentlemen in this chamber know about this my witness was no less than a priest who was saying mass in my house at that very moment when they say that senator gringo honasan then colonel honasan was in my house with one hundred soldiers at that precise moment for which i was framed and jailed with rebellion complex with murder in order to immobilize me and you know what happened to father danilo dagsan the priest he was shipped out of this country by no less than jaime cardinal sin with the connivance and conspiracy of president corazon aquino and this is the opportune time mr president mr chief justice for me to put this in the annals and record of this republic so that future historians will know the entire truth about this thank you  uh thank you mr chief justice the whole country or maybe perhaps even filipinos in other countries are listening to us right now and i wonder how many of them think listening to our colleagues that they are listening to a political rally or they are listening to a legal proceeding because the nature mr chief justice and my dear colleagues of what has been going on in this chamber for the last month and a half has really been a an event uh which has in effect been an arena on two sides on the one hand you have the political arena and amado doronila correctly observed in a recent column of the philippine daily inquirer that those who are opposed to the continued tenure of president joseph ejercito estrada are winning the public opinion battle a very shall we say candid remark because he in effect is saying that what is going on is not really a trial for the impeachment of the president of the philippines but rather an effort to bring down that president not by the constitutional processes that we are actively engaged in but through the bar of public opinion and that perhaps mr president explains why many times in this court there are statements by the prosecution that uh it is making a pro offer it is announcing something that it will do to subpoena the records of citibank because the president his wife the ladies that he is so said to be uh associated with as well as his so-called cronies have accounts in the citibank and immediately the next day almost all the newspapers are headlining president estrada mrs eje loi ejercito estrada  etcetera etcetera have accounts in citibank as if this was gospel truth this is of course the arena of public opinion that is being fed by unsubstantiated loose remarks coming from the prosecution within this chamber we are therefore being used mr president we are being used we are being made puppets in a show to bring about the completion the success of an agenda that is not provided for in the constitution and that is what really is the unfortunate thing of what is going on mr president now mr president in this whole effort members of the senate are attacked by the prosecution there is a scoreboard there right across our very parking lot which ridicules us and of course those who are perceived to be not following the dictates of the mob and mr president we ourselves have turned upon each other and even in the lounge where we have our meriendas you will not you need not be perceptive to see how the groupings of the senators sitting with each other no longer show the old environment of cordiality that was present here  nagkakampo-kampo na tayo dun sa dining room those are the those are the the uh shall we say the heavy burden that we have to bear as the result of what is going on and uh i bewail this because it is unnecessary and it would have been totally different if there had been no  1 word t v cameras in this hall it would have been totally different and this is the result of all these cameras all over cameras peeking on our feet cameras trying to catch us asleep cameras trying to catch us talking to each other as if we were supposed to sit here like stupefied mummies listening to everything that is going on and so mr president tonight we are here voting on a very simple question i mean this is a question that a judge in the lower in the regional trial court rules on every day this is a question that justices of the court of appeals rule on the rules are very simple the rules are very clear the facts are very clear but because there is t v around this has become a big spectacle mr president i would like to say that our vote tonight even if some of us feel that they are casting their vote on the final judgment is not really a vote on a final judgment and the final judgment may or may not follow the result of the voting tonight and if there are those i think it would be appropriate to say who want to make a big issue out of this for their own purposes so be it for me mr president mr chief justice this is just a simple vote on a simple procedural issue that is well lie uh which is well-defined provided for in the rules of evidence and all the rules that we have been following so in conclusion may i say mr president and mr chief justice what is this fuss all about thank you  mr chief justice my colleagues it is quite unfortunate that my good friend senator juan ponce enrile brought up the issue again an incident of history that happened ten years ago i will not deal at length on that point i would rather just let history and our people decide on the action of the players at that time but let me just state that in nineteen ninety i was placed in a situation where i had to defend the existence of a duly-constituted government and therefore i invoked the law and the legal processes in order to protect the duly constituted government i did not take extra-legal measures i invoked a decision or the dissenting opinion in a case decided by the supreme court we followed the law we followed the constitution let the people judge our action in history but having said that mr president mr chief justice let m  uh let me now share my position insofar as this matter at issue uh at hand uh in issue at hand the issue here is whether or not envelope or the contents of envelope number two is covered or covered by the articles of impeachment it is argued that these are not covered by the articles of impeachment and therefore it is immaterial and irrelevant as argued by the prosecution should have been defense as they have done in the past in fact mr chief justice the phrase irrelevant and immaterial would be the most popular phrase these days  pumunta po kayo kahit saang party ang unang sasabihin sa inyo objection your honor on ground that it is irrelevant and immaterial   buong bansa po ay halos abogado na ngunit dito po ngayon ang tanungin natin ito ba'y talaga  irrelevant and immaterial  sa akin po kagalang-galang na chief justice  hindi po ang kagalang-galang na chief justice ay sinabi niya doon sa kanyang extended opinion dated december eighteen  in ordering the opening of the first sealed envelope that the objection based on immateriality would be premature and once the document obtained in connection therewith are formally offered in evidence that is the time when objections on materiality can be should be ruled upon  and therefore this issue has been ruled upon by the chief justice  kaya nga po kangina hinihingi ko kung pupwede ang  chief justice muna ang siyang mag-husga dito po sa ating pinag-uusapan dahil ito po irrelevant and immaterial ay isang patakaran sa husgado at sino po ang mag-huhusga sino po ang most qualified to judge on relevance and materiality it is the chief justice  kaya po aking hiniling kangina kung sana ang chief justice under the rule six of our rules would first decide on this unfortunately that was not possible because of the motion already been filed has this been ruled upon by the chief justice yes because on january ten two thousand by tu by january ten two thousand one by order of the chief justice this document was subpoenaed on june jan january ten two thousand one this su  this chief justice chief justice davide ordered through a subpoena  duces tecum ad testificandum that documents related to savings account number or savings account number zero one six zero six two five o one dash five be produced  bakit po ayaw ng defense panel buksan ang pangalawang envelope  maliwanag po dahil ito po ay pag-aari ni presidente joseph ejercito estrada doon po sa exhibit triple x na siyang isang sulat na ang sabi ni ocampo pinirmahan ni pangulong estrada bilang jose velarde ang nakalagay doon my savings account zero one six zero six two five zero one dash five   yan po ang sinabi ni jose velarde yan po ang sinabi ni pangulong aquino ni pangulong estrada maliwanag po na itong account na ito ay pag-aari ni pangulong estrada inamin po niya yan kaya po ayaw buksan ng depensa yan  grounds of relevance and materiality mr chief justice my colleagues envelope number two is relevant and material in our quest for truth envelope number two is relevant and material for the credibility of this proceeding  e envelope number two is relevant and material for the credibility of this institution envelope number two is relevant and material to the faith of our people in this democracy thank you mr president 
Philippines	mr chief justice, i love a good debate just like the next lawyer but tonight i am tired of all this disputation i am weary i want to go home to the love of my family yet as a trained lawyer and as an advocate and disciple of the rule of law i know that it is my duty to stand up tonight and affirm the fact that a society of love can exist only if it is protected by the rule of law the law is not a litany or a series of technicalities an impression that we might have gathered from what has been said in this hall today the law is the very basis of the social contract that pulls the filipinos together and renders them one nation long long ago the most famous litigant in the entire history of the human race was asked by his judge is it not true that you claim to be the king and the litigant who was not a trained lawyer stared into the face of his tormenter and said what is the truth  for there are many truths there are many realities i stand for the rule of law as i see it according to the light that has given be that has been given to me by my creator no person no group no sector of society has a monopoly of the truth or of the law that is why we must learn to accept each other 's conviction and that is why i intend that together with the rest of my colleagues whom i hope will do likewise i intend to vote out of a sense of the shared destiny of the filipino people  uh mr chief justice mr senate president my distinguished colleagues i was almost disappointed that everything i wanted to say was said in more eloquent terms by the honorable judge senator miriam defensor-santiago but i have very little to add uh mr chief justice to me this is all about the rules and following them the ultimate rule is the philippine constitution when i rose in rebellion against three presidents and what i perceived then to be corrupt and inefficient governments everybody told me that i had violated the constitution and my oath of office as a soldier mr president mr chief justice whether we open the envelope the second envelope or not the truth cannot be suppressed to the filipino people so instead of spending time trying to defend the constitution i think we should all try to follow it first thank you mr chief justice   missing words uhm to appeal to my friends and colleagues in fact maybe if we can dispense with this as soon as possible it is better but it 's in the nature of the impeachment process mr chief justice that passions there are passions and i can see the passion of the prosecution i can see the passion of the defense and sometimes it is uh precisely because there is passion that we as lawyers and we as senators must now rise about above ourselves what is at issue mr chief justice at court is an interlocutory question but what is being judged is not just president estrada we are now putting ourselves before the bar of history we are putting ourselves before the bar of public opinion and our judgment on this interlocutory order can therefore affect not just president estrada but the chamber and this impeachment court i rise consequently mr chief justice to appeal to all of us to try to consider the interests of not only the chamber as a senate not only the chamber as an impeachment court but the interests and responsibility that we owe to all those who sent us here unfortunately there is nobody else being given the assignment to try five sentences in tagalog  if we convict or declare as innocent the respondent president estrada it must be on full transparency seven long sentences in tagalog the fact that we are on trial should make us pause mr chief justice and i hope we can achieve some consensus on some points  kung ano man po ang hatol ng impeachment court  na to finally ma- guilty ma-  innocent ang importante suportahan ng mamamayang pilipino it does not it is not as important that it is guilty  or innocent it must be supported by the filipino people and the republic of the philippines this evening we seem to be about to cross a bridge and i hope mr chief justice that when we cross that we retain the higher credibility of the impeachment court and the impeachment process very long passage around 20 sentences in tagalog  in summary because i have less than two minutes i think if i may appeal to my colleagues we are the ones now being judged it 's the chamber as we vote on this we shall be judged and i hope we and i have the highest regard and whenever i 'm asked by media i keep saying i have the highest expectations from my colleagues and i hope that that expectation will be met and approved and accepted by the filipino people thank you   missing words chief justice that this uh matter before us tonight is the same issue that was before us uh a few weeks ago i believe uh before christmas and that was the subject of an extended order uh by the chief justice by the presiding officer dated december eighteen two thousand and therefore i believe that to be consistent with that ruling then the appropriate thing to do is to allow the opening of the second set of documents mr chief justice our job here is to ferret out the truth the people deserve nothing less than to know the truth  payagan po nating malaman ng taong bayan ang katotohanan sa pagbukas po ng pangalawang documento  thank you mr chief justice  long passage in tagalog and since this is only the opening of the envelope at kailangang malaman ng taong bayan kung anong talagang katotohanan palagay ko mr chief justice we owe it to the nation we owe it to the filipino we owe it to the millions who are now listening to grant this simple request  buksan natin yung sobre upang malaman kung ano talaga ang nakalagay diyan  why is the defense objecting so vigorously  kung natuloy ba 'yung plano na nabulgar dito na si  mr dichaves ang may-ari ng savings account  magkakaroon ba ng objection kagaya ng objection  na hinaharap natin ngayon   palagay ko hindi magkakaroon ng ganoong objection  alam na ng bayan and the people have a right to know we have a right to know and in the name of truth in the name of the filipino in the name of justice i ask this envelope be opened now thank you  uh mr chief justice you know tonight the reputation of the senate as an institution is at stake for the past several weeks starting december seven the practically the whole country has followed the progress of this impeachment trial via television or radio or videotapes later on everybody knows the evidence that has been brought out in this trial whether they were accepted conditionally or absolutely they still know but what is important to this institution mr chief justice is not whether the final verdict of the senators will be to convict or to acquit the president of the republic what is important is that the process was transparent and that the verdict is in keeping with the evidence that has been brought out during this trial  pag overwhelming po ang evidence  e anong magagawa natin maa- acquit ba yan   e magagalit ang taong bayan sa atin   pag kulang naman ang ebidensiya it would be ridiculous for us to convict his excellency the president  hayon po noong december twenty ba ho 'yon binuksan po natin yung envelope number one  ang nakasulat ho diyan jose velarde   wala namang koneksiyon pa kay pangulong erap estrada  ngunit meron hong notation diyan na eto po ang the other half of a combo account at nakasulat po doon yung saving account number ni jose velarde  later on when clarissa ocampo testified that indeed she saw the president of the republic sign jose velarde to five sets of documents the agency agreement or investment management agreement the authorization to debit his savings account the very same numbered savings account that was in the first set of documents that came out of the first envelope delivered here by equitable bank and other documents that was when the connection was made now the senate allowed the opening of the first envelope the senate allowed the testimony of clarissa ocampo and people found clarissa ocampo to be very very credible after all she had no reason to lie  ngayon po dito po sa account that is being hidden inside envelope number two the savings account as asserted earlier by prosecutor joker arroyo contains deposits or will show reported deposits of about three point three billion pesos over a span of twelve months  malamang po nandiyan po yung deposito na galing sa  tobacco fund na sinabi na binanggit ni governor  chavit singson na binigay daw niya kay atong ang at binigay ni atong ang kay joseph estrada   paano natin malalaman 'yon   malamang nandiyan din ho 'yung two hundred million  na binigay po ni ricaforte kay ed serapio at dineposito daw ni ed serapio sa isang equitable bank account same bank as a matter of fact the treasurer of the erap muslim youth foundation is none other than the chairman of the board or then chairman of the board and majority owner george l go so sa ngayon po as a member of this impeachment panel ako po'y nagtataka kung bakit po natatakot ang defense panel na buksan po itong envelope na ito   sapagkat una sa lahat nadinig ko po and i have heard it several times that his excellency the president said i have not committed graft and corruption i have not received a single cent from any source that is illegal and when clarissa ocampo testified i remember the president said  wala akong kinalalaman diyan  so why is the defense panel so afraid to open this on the other hand baka pag buksan 'tong envelope  na ito tapos na yung boksing  and that is where we are tonight so mr chief justice when we took an oath to be members of this impeachment panel we took an oath to render impartial justice as far as i 'm concerned the one on trial here the president of the republic is not really the one on trial it is the senate that is on trial and furthermore the senate has been conducting this impeachment trial to make sure that society can be saved from anybody who would be declared unfit for public office simple question can a president or any official deposit three point three billion pesos in his account and still be fit for public office that 's the question tonight and if we vote not to open envelope two and i know that the contents of envelope two will somehow find its way into the newspapers if not tomorrow then the day after and the whole country will know what is in envelope two then i think the members of this body will only have themselves to blame for trying to make sure that the filipinos lose on a technicality  pag me na- technical ho rito ang taong bayan po na- technical and therefore mr chief justice i move that we open the envelope and even accept on condition in the same manner that we opened the first envelope and we allowed clarissa ocampo to testify so that later on we as members of the impeachment body may decide whether indeed the testimony and the documents were relevant or not thank you mr chief justice 
Philippines	all of these uh issues uh we are to deal with this afternoon uh your honors involve uh the jurisdiction of the senate to try and decide  alleged acts of the respondent not alleged in the articles of impeachment there are subsidiary issues with respect to certain accounts because they are not in the name of the respondent i will deal with them at the end of my arguments i have uh distributed if your honors please uh a a copy of the pertinent portions of article two of the articles of impeachment together with uh a brief statement as to what are the conclusions therein as well as the allegations of fact there are two kinds of assets if your honors please which are involved uh in these uh subpoena duces tecums as well as the second envelope first are the alleged mansions particularly in the case of the second envelope what has been referred to as the boracay mansion the other asset involved are cash assets or their equivalent which are involved in all of the other subpoena duces tecums it first it should be recalled if your honors please that under article eleven of the constitution the house of representatives shall have the sole shall have the exclusive power to initiate all cases of impeachment no other body has that authority not the senate not any other department of government on the other hand the senate has the sole power to try and decide all cases of impeachment a case of impeachment comes before the senate if your honors please in the form of articles of impeachment which are sent to the senate by the house of representatives the power of the senate the sole power of the senate to try and decide a case of impeachment cannot go beyond the allegations in the articles of impeachment issues now before the court revolve on article two at the preliminary conference the first preliminary conference held among the parties it was agreed that under article two the issue would be the following whether on the basis of the facts and i underscore the word  facts alleged therein the president would be guilty of graft and corruption once again i underscore the word facts  let me now invite the members of the court to go through the pertinent provisions uh por uh the pertinent provisions portions of article two copies of which i have distributed it says president estrada violated the constitution and he stands guilty of graft and corruption  those that clause if your honors please is a conclusion of law it is not a statement of fact then it proceeds to state when he participated directly in the real estate business through a family-controlled corporation which constructed thirty-six townhouses in vermont park executive village antipolo city as shown in the p c i j in the article on president estrada 's family and financial interests  that clause is a statement of fact the following paragraph reads he also violated the anti-graft law he is sworn to uphold  that your honors is a conclusion it is not a statement of fact and then it the following follows he filed his statement of assets and liabilities for the year nineteen ninety-nine stating therein that he and his wife and children have business interests in only three corporations  that your honors is a statement of fact following that is the sentence the president by that sworn statement also committed perjury and the offense of unexplained wealth that your honors is a conclusion then what follows is this statement of fact because it says  records show that he and his wife and mistresses and their children have other interests in other companies outside of the three firms listed in his statement of assets open parenthesis annex c zero close parenthesis statement of facts in the last sentence reads and i repeat  records show that he and his wife and mistresses and their children have other interests in other companies outside of the three firms listed in his statement of assets and liabilities parenthesis annex c zero  nothing more your honors so let me start with the easier one cash assets there is nothing in these articles of impeachment which states that the president failed to declare in his statement of assets and liabilities cash assets nor in the second does he in the second sentence do we find any  impli uh any any statement of fact about assets because in the second sentence it simply says records show that he and his wife and mistresses and their children have other interests in other companies outside of the three firms listed in his statement of assets and liabilities  so what is alleged as a factual basis of the assertion that the president violated his sworn statement by committing perjury and the offense of unexplained wealth incidentally there is no such offense as simply limited to the failure to state in his statement of assets and liabilities other that is other interests in other companies outside of the three firms listed in his statement of assets and liabilities as i said insofar as the cash assets there is nothing whatsoever here now it will be noted if your honors please in annex c annex c is a comprehensive list of corporations in which the respondent is supposed to have other interest which interests rather which he did not declare in his statement of assets all in all these corporations number eighty-eight corporations some table two of the president table three guia gomez table four laarni enriquez table five joseph victor ejercito table six selec selected companies of estrada and his families so insofar as corporate interests if your honors please what need to be determined is whether in the case of the second envelope st. peter 's holdings is listed is among these corporations listed in annex c as far as the second envelope is concerned if your honors please  we may assu we may deduce from the application that the intention is to establish that the check which was supposed to have funded the payment for what we call the boracay mansion purchased by st. peter 's holdings was funded in ultimately from savings account o one six zero six two five zero one dash five and that is why what is sought now to be produced is the statement of account for october one to thirty-one nineteen ninety-nine it may be recalled if your honors please that uh when on december fifteen uh december twenty the first envelope was opened it was found that in that envelope there were the applications to open accounts specimen signatures etcetera of account number and uh one one zero two five four nine four da dash five as well as microfilm copy of the equitable bank check numbers those were what were in the first envelope now what is now sought to be produced is the statement of account of a savings account which we assume the prosecution contends will show that the check which was used to fund the price for the payment of the what we call boracay mansion in the name of st. peter 's holdings was funded from this statement from this account savings account so in effect what is now asserted is to prove that the president was the one who acquired the boracay mansion through st. peter 's holdings but as we have stated st. peter 's holdings is not among the corporations listed in annex c there is one other flaw if your honors please after the first envelope was opened which should have been the premise assuming uh my assumptions are correct in regard the second envelope not any of the documents in the first envelope was marked as an exhibit so that if the papers in the first envelope are the predicates for the opening of the second envelope that predicate does not exist because the papers which were found in the second envelope have not been marked as exhibits much less established as belonging to break in tape   missing words the issue of relevancy they go to the issue of jurisdiction whether the jurisdiction of the senate to try and decide this case goes beyond can go beyond the specific factual allegations of the articles of impeachment it is our submission that the senate is without jurisdiction to try and decide any accusation based on any act other than those which are specifically alleged in the articles of impeachment now as to the other subpoenas if your honors please they are accounts even far removed from the account supposedly related to the acquisition of a property by st. peter 's holdings they involve cash assets or their equivalent well perhaps as far as the accounts of president in the name of president estrada and the first lady assuming that cash assets are contemplated are covered by the articles of impeachment we may say they are within the jurisdiction of the court but you have other accounts uh which are the subject of subpoena  duces tecums  some of the subpoenas apply uh for subpoena duces tecum  to be directed to account numbers without any names how can the relevancy the fact that these are within the juris  within covered by the articles of impeachment be determined on the basis of the application similarly you have this kevin garcia jose velarde and other names which are not in the names of the president and not even in the names of laarni guia gomez they cannot be presumptively they cannot be deemed as presumptively belonging to the respondent there is one other noteworthy fact if your honors please regarding these applications for subpoena it will be recalled that uh it was agreed among the parties that when a subpoena duces tecum is applied for the particular check if it be a check which would show the relevancy of the application would be indicated and that beyond that there cannot be a comprehensive or catch-all phrase to cover all documents and records in that account these applications for subpoena duces tecum  have sought to circumvent the agreement that there should be no comprehensive clause in subpoena duces tecums addressed to banks what the prosecution has done is to list everything that one may find in a bank account or ledgers or accounts except that instead of saying that all ledgers all accounts they have now specified this one by one that is why if your honors please the applications for subpoena  duces tecum s have have uh enumerations of documents covering about two pages in single space of documents as a matter of fact if your honors please in the case of the second envelope if assuming the materia assuming that that is within the jurisdiction of the senate what should only the subpoena duces tecum should be limited only to what is necessary to determine whether the check that was drawn on the current account was funded from the savings account it would be inappropriate even assuming that purpose to expose the entire statement of account for that month much less other documents pertaining to that savings account as a matter of fact uh assuming that the court does not sustain us on the jurisdiction issue and that uh the prosecution 's desire is simply to establish that the check was funded from that savings account we would be  abl be willing to stipulate that assuming that that is the purpose so then if your honors please the issue is not really that complicated but it is an issue which we have raised many times in this uh trial unfortunately there has really been no definitive ruling on this perhaps it is time that a ruling be made because what has happened really when the first envelope was opened we raised that issue but then the whole the documents had already been exposed and so we said since the matter has been made practically public uh we agreed not to pursue our motion for reconsideration but reserving our right to object on the matter of materiality or jurisdiction similarly when the clarissa ocampo testimony was made we likewise objected but the testimony was allowed to be given although conditionally given so the issue before the court if your honors please is simply whether the articles of impeachment contain any allegation of fact to show that the act the alleged act of the president in having cash assets or interests in corporations other than those listed in annex c are sufficiently alleged in the articles of impeachment so that the senate would have jurisdiction to try and decide them 
Philippines	mr president may we explain our vote   mga kapatid mga kasamahan mga kababayan noon pong martial law meron kaming isang kaso sa supreme court ng habeas corpus ang habeas corpus po yung nakakulong sinasabing mali ang pagkakulong sa kanya so pakawalan dumating po yung preso nakaposas nakagapos pero sabi ng korte suprema hindi pwedeng nakagapos kung nasa loob na ng korte kaya inalis ang posas inalis po yung posas pero yung preso all through the hearing habang kami'y nag-aargumento yung preso po ganon pa rin para pa ring nakagapos inalis na yung gapos hindi pa rin mahiwalay ang kanyang mga kamay sabi po ng mga psychologists yan ang tinatawag na learned helplessness pag ikaw ay sanay na nakaluhod nakayuko at nakatuwad yun muscles mo po magkaka-arthritis kahit ninanais mong itaas ang iyong ulo nasanay ka nang nakatungo palaging nakatungo nasanay nang nakatuwad palaging nakatuwad nasanay nang nakaluhod komportable na pong nakaluhod  so far the issues i have heard have always stressed one theme the philippines is weak therefore sandal tayo sa pader yun po ang sinabi ng kumpare ko  many others have said we are weak let us seek the protection of the big but who will protect us from the big nobody answered but we are weak the solitary issue then is will this special treatment agreement make us stronger  yun ba ang sinasabi  or will it make us weaker  dito po pag nagpagapos tayo masasanay na naman tayo the special treatment agreement will not make us stronger it will make us weaker and that is why we have insisted we must vote no yes we want to be strong but this special treatment agreement that they call the visiting forces will make us weaker if we follow the logic of those who have said we are weak  maghanap na tayo ng padrino kawawa naman po ang mahihirap kawawa naman yun maliliit pasensiya na kayo maghanap na kayo ng padrino sapagkat hindi n'yo matutulungan ang sarili n'yo  and we cannot accept such a principle that is the result of the colonial experience three hundred fifty years po yun mga haciendero yun mga pare yun mga may lupa sila ang amo lahat ay mga alipin makaalis po sila dumating nadaya pa tayo dumating ang mga amerikano sila din ang amo  later on we elected our leaders and many among our elected leaders felt kami na ang amo we must enjoy all the benefits and that is why we are weak because many among our leaders tell our people you are weak you are weak  pahina ng pahina  and so they become inefficient and when they become inefficient the government becomes weaker and then they say you see we are weak because ninakaw mas mahina na po tayo pinapapahinain ang gobyerno pagkatapos idadahilan upang maghanap ng padrino  that is not what i understand of military courage one of the mysteries i have had to endure all through today and during the debate is how my good noble valiant friends in the military have to sit here and suffer the indignity of being called we are weak  mahina ang military ako'y hindi po naniniwala nakita ko po ito si general mayo andito matapang po 'to  i saw him in bicol i saw him in mindanao and i have seen the valiant people even the enlisted men not being given eight pesos eight pesos  ata noon pag sila'y nasusugatan and they raise money in the families raise money pag nasusugatan because kulang ang badget ng militar  i do not share the sentiments of our colleagues who kept saying here repeatedly that our military are weak i rather share the sentiments of one of our colleagues who in nineteen ninety-one said the military of the philippines is the most experienced we have fought many wars with meager resources and we have experience and we have guile and we can win  yun po ang paniwala ko  but you must first believe in yourself the question this then mr president is how do we become strong well certainly not by an agreement that insults us because when you keep accepting insults you will get used to living without dignity and you cannot be strong  hindi pwedeng nag-ba basketball e kung walang kumpiyansa hindi maka- shoot  pagdating sa free throw tatangu-tango ang kaibigan kong si sonny pagdating sa free throw kung walang kumpiyansa ang lapit-lapit na hindi maka- shoot confidence self belief in self-reliance that is what will make us strong and it can be brought about by education this can be brought about by fighting corruption because if we lose only twenty percent of the national budget on corruption and we can say that we shall have enough money to give bullets and guns to our military it is ideas that make people strong mr president rizal had the answer to our problems unfortunately he seems to have been forgotten altogether it was rizal in el filibusterismo who said  we must win our freedom by deserving it by improving the mind and enhancing the dignity of the individual loving what is just what is good what is great to the point of dying for it  when a people reach these heights god provides the weapons and the idols and the tyrants fall like a house of cards and freedom shines in the first dawn  in another sequel of filibusterismo he says  as long as the filipino people do not have sufficient vigor to proclaim head held high hindi nakayuko and chest bared their right to a life of their own in human society and to guarantee it with their sacrifices with their very blood as long as we see our countrymen feel privately ashamed hearing the growl of their rebelling and protesting conscience while in public they keep silent and even join the oppressor in mocking the oppressed  as long as we see them rotting themselves in their selfishness and praising with forced smiles the most despicable acts begging with their eyes for a share of the booty from those who are powerful why give them independence they can never be independent   at eto pong treaty - ng ito tinatawag kong  special treatment that is exactly what it is doing give us a share of the all powerful the only superpower  mabigyan po naman kami kahit mumog mabigyan kami  we do not deserve to be free when that is the posture that we  al always take even the americans will not respect us the americans were bred on a concept of self-reliance on a philosophy that the human spirit can overcome and that is why they are a great country we do not propose to be great like the united states no within the limits of our geography and our people our people are good our people are talented unfortunately many of our leaders had betrayed our people and maybe now they should reexamine whether this treaty is good for our people or betrays our longings for dignity independence and freedom   ibon man daw pong may layang lumipad ikulong mo't pumipiglas tayo pa kaya nakalaya tayo noong nineteen ninety-one babalik tayo tayo lang ang ibon na babalik sa hawla  rizal also said and this maybe is the saddest testimony that we can hear because this is from the philippines a century hence  i think one hundred six years or one hundred eight years ago and yet it has been unrequited but rizal was optimistic he said the philippines one day will declare herself inevitably and unmistakably independent neither spanish patriotism call it something else nor the appeal of all the little tyrants in the colony nor the love for spain or maybe america of all the filipinos nor the doubtful dismembering of the islands the way they have done in the united nations conference on the law of the sea and internal strife the way they are saying let us seek american help so that we shall have peace and tranquility in the land none of these can go against the law of destiny and that law of destiny eventually will transform physical laws put into action by moral forces it is the moral force of the filipino and his courage mr president that will make us free but this treaty is depriving us of that moral force depriving us of the courage to stand up and try to stand up by ourselves mr president one of our colleagues said we cannot be isolated of course who has said we should be isolated did he name any did any of the oppositors to this special treatment agreement ever said we should isolate no nobody said isolation  we have always stressed that we must preserve our friendships with our asean brothers the a b cs of diplomacy america britain china canada europe japan and the latin american countries with whom we have historical ties these are all sought to be friends  hindi pwedeng kabit ng isa  because how will your other friends feel and that is why mr president the reference to isolation was a bogey man you raise the straw and beat him to death and say see i have won the argument nobody but nobody has talked of isolation as a matter of fact mr president i think the push is towards multilateral arrangements and the secretary here of finan of foreign affairs was even pushing for that because bilateral arrangement mr president between uh the big and the small is disadvantageous to the small and so they say to china malaki ang tsina pilipinas maliit dapat multilateral daw  and yet they do not remember that malaki din ang amerika maliit ang pilipinas  but the americans are saying what is good enough for china put them in a multilateral arrangement is not good enough for them  nakikita nila kausap mong malaki dehado ang maliit kaya naman pinipilit nila na tayo maliit isa-isa lang kausap nila  that is the reality of the situation the agreement mr president truly chains us what is amazing mr president is that even reality could not be considered an argument against this agreement  security nang security noong una noong si blair sa singapore tinamaan ng baltik at tinanggap na sabi'y walang security ay hindi naman daw security pala ang pinag-uusapan dito economics so economics na naman sa economics naman pagbasa mo ng agreement wala naman doon so wala ding economics pero hindi na bale daw hindi na baleng walang security hindi na bale walang economics basta meron tayong kasangga napakasuwerte natin noong sabihin ng mga ibang mga nasa simbahan prostitution daw ay madadagdagan aba hindi raw nadadagdagan daw ang prostitution kung permanent ang bases kung dumadaan-daan lang konti daw ang prostitution para naman silang hindi nakakaalam pag two months kang nasa bapor sa gitna ng pacific ocean pag landing mo sa general santos maghahanap ka ng makakaraos sa iyo yun temporary nakakadaming prostitute sapagkat temporary naku sixteen days lang tayo nasaan ba yung mga pilipinang magaganda  even reality cannot be used as an argument anymore  less daw ang prostitution  noong una binabandila nila v f a two noong basahin ang v f a two at walang mabigay sa pilipinas sila mismo tinago na hindi na binabanggit ang v f a two ang v f a two siguro matatawag v f a torotot  because it was a torotot agreement we got nothing but a bill of rights from the united states but that is already granted to filipinos if you 're in the u s we must vote no mr president because of fidelity to the constitution the constitution in the preamble has glowing words it says we the sovereign filipino people imploring the aid of almighty god in order to build a just and humane society and establish a government that shall embody our ideals and aspirations promote the common good conserve and develop our patrimony and secure to ourselves and our posterity the blessings of independence and democracy under the rule of law in a regime of truth justice freedom love equality and peace do ordain and promulgate this constitution  the preamble does not hold water anymore mr president  hindi na pwedeng we cannot have the blessings of independence sapagkat tayo ay nagpapatali  we cannot have a rule of law sapagkat eto lang ang botong  third reading na hindi naman pinagbotohan ng second reading and yet the rules say you must have second bilang yun parang arithmetic first second and third  kung walang second reading walang  third reading we cannot have the regime of truth because even prostitution  mawawala na daw sapagkat temporary ang daan  mr president we cannot even live up to the preamble we cannot live up to section one of the principles that the philippines is a democratic and republican state because in a republican state there is no law that cannot be modified but now we must add unless of course it is a special treatment agreement with the americans then do not touch it you can touch it later on pag may nakita kang abuso  and that should be modified section two mr president speaks of amity with all nations but now we must se say except china because sila daw ang malaki at kalaban natin  we can no longer say civilian authorities at all times supreme over the military unless we add except u s military authorities they are superior both to the philippine military and the highest government authorities of the philippines because the agreement says so we can no longer say the prime duty of the government is to serve and protect the people because we must add unless there is a certificate of official duty because kung may certificate of official duty  at mabaril ang filipino 't napagkamalian na baboy damo we cannot protect the people and that is why mr president equal protection of the laws is no longer extended to the filipino after if at all after this special treatment agreement becomes law we cannot allow that mr president dylan thomas once in a poem said do not go gentle into that good night  rage rage against the dying of the light  if we were vigorous if we were strenuous in our effort to examine all these special treatment agreements it was because mr president we did not want to go gentle into that good night  papagapos ka pa nga ni wala ka pang reklamo  there 's one other poem i want to narrate to our friends who may be minded to listen but certainly to our people who i 'm sure would want to hear there 's a poem entitled ithaca  it recounts the hometown of ulysses and ulysses had to go home and the poem ithaca says i will paraphrase because i do not have it memorized basically said this when you start your journey to ithaca pray that the road is long full of knowledge full of adventure and said it says do not fear the leslegonians yun po ang mga cannibals nor the angry poseidon yun po ang  god of the undersea nor the one-eyed cyclops it says because you will be protected they will not harm you so long as you have fine feelings and noble thoughts what you must fear the poem says are the leslegonians the poseidons and the cyclops that you carry in your soul what you must fear is the fear that you carry in your heart all the arguments in favor of this agreement this special treatment agreement was premised on that they want us to be afraid and to carry that fear in our hearts it is not the way to become a people with dignity it is not the way to become a people of independence it is not the way to become a people that can look other people in the eyes with equality with pride these are the thoughts i wish to share mr president you can ask permission to clean it up because after speaking for two hours and a half in turno and kontra  we did not have the energy to prepare a prepared speech we vote no mr president to ensure dignity and independence for the filipinos thank you mr president 1
Philippines	  mr president distinguished colleagues coughs permit me to read a letter dated may 12 addressed to me dear senator guingona in the wake of the senate debates concerning the visiting forces agreement i recall that the lead department during its negotiation was the department of foreign affairs the department of national defense and the d o j lent support in relation to their respective areas i was a member of the ad hoc team of prosecutors and lawyers that assisted you then in the study of the d o j position from the inception of the discussion on the proposed v f a you were resolute in finding an agreement that was just and equitable for this reason you stressed to your d o j team and the cabinet and at cabinet meetings the importance of resolving the recipre reciprocity issue if the conclusion of the v f a was to be feasible meaning as a precondition thereto the united states should agree to implement a counterpart reciprocal agreement in favor of the philippines i did not have the chance to be a part of the team that negotiated with the united states as i was appointed to the judiciary the agreement was concluded much later when i which i heard occurred in february nineteen ninety-eight when you and i had already left the department of justice i take this occasion to extend my best wishes sincerely teresita leonardo de castro justice of the sandiganbayan  mr president may i request that this letter the original be uh inserted along with my speech permit me also to reiterate the statement of my friend secretary siazon pursuant to uhrm the testimony during the public hearings on january twenty-six nineteen ninety-nine and i quote your honor just to put the uh issue in correct perse historical perspective the reason why we have a v f a two is when we were negotiating or before we started negotiation negotiating on v f a one because of the advice of the then secretary justice guingona whose advice i respected and shared that we should have some similar treatment for our boys and their families when they go to the united states i made this as a condition to the americans we would now start negotiating on v f a one but later to negotiate on a similar or for some similar treatment v f a two close quote permit me also mr president to read into the records the letter of president ramos dated february uh may fourteen nineteen ninety-nine dear senator guingona tito in the midst of the ongoing debate on the visiting forces agreement let me say that even during the negotiations for the same you already held strong reservations because in your view you wanted a fair and just agreement between the two nations having recommended the scrapping of balikatan  exercises because you believed that no firm legal basis existed therefore regarding the v f a you stood on full reciprocity as a condition and the submission of the same to the senate for concurrence in accordance with the constitution i respect you for your convictions although your position on the v f a may differ from mine nevertheless i continue to hope that you will see the v f a in a better light with best wishes fidel valdes ramos may i ask mr president that this the original of this letter be attached and uh be an integral part of my speech  these documents mr president show my stand on the v f a even during the period of negotiation we stood for a just and fair agreement we stood for reciprocity we stood for submission of the same to the senate for concurrence but the outcome of the negotiations did not result in a just agreement did not entail any reciprocity did not end up in a fair agreement there was v f a two but no reciprocity there was submission to the senate but none to the u s senate i therefore stand more vigorously opposed to this visiting forces agreement today i vote no for historical reasons a century ago emilio aguinaldo relied on the promise of united states consul in hong kong to help gain filipino freedom he virtually invited the first visiting forces of the united states to come to the philippines admiral dewey came and look where it got us we had to fight a war that until now the united states refers to in a cavalier manner as a petty insurgency versus her manifest destiny america gave us many good things she gave us education she taught us the lessons of washington and lincoln and jefferson and gave us back our independence in the wake of war in nineteen forty-six but she also imposed upon us foreign military bases she imposed upon us the parity amendments she imposed upon us the one-sided special economic relation that tied and dominated our economy and military bases for almost fifty years until nineteen ninety-one when we said  no to the base agreement today i cannot but say no again to a visiting forces agreement that may repeat the sad lessons of history i vote no because this agreement violates the equality of persons and nations the activities mentioned in the agreement articles three four five six seven and eight make the united states personnel a special class of persons treated much better than the filipinos in their own land no reciprocity no equality of national and personal rights and therefore i vote  no  i vote no because this agreement was submitted under a wrong provision article seven section twenty-one of the constitution the framers of the nineteen eighty-seven constitution intended to correct a wrong when the united states imposed military bases upon us they virtually mandated the philippine senate to ratify not to ratify without submitting the same to the united states senate so article eighteen section twenty-five of the constitution prohibits the presence of foreign military bases troops or facilities unless an agreement is ratified by the philippine senate and equally recognized as a treaty of the united states in accordance with her constitution this was the intent this was the prohibition this was the remedy to correct a slur poised upon us by the bases treaty why should our senate concur and not the united states senate why should we refrain from following the mandate of our constitution and make the v f a part of the law of the land while the united states considers the same as a mere executive agreement why do we not rectify the wrongs of yesterday by reciprocity there is reference that during our time we issued opinions that temporary visits were not covered by treaties and international agreements these opinions were merely routinary opinions responding to queries by the department of national defense or the department of foreign affairs on specific subjects and following precedents we did issue such opinions but certainly not on an agreement such as the visiting forces agreement because this would entail a temporary permanent permanent temporary agreement that was not envisioned in any of those opinions mr president i vote no because the v f a is imprecise uncertain unclear the agreement speaks of activities but there are no clear definitions of what the activities are do they include deployment of united states forces entries exits of aircrafts repair and maintenance of facilities access arrangements commercial contracts construction of rails and runways rest and recreation establishments of relay stations telecommunications no clear answers no clear definition no limits no certainties it can only lead to disastrous implementation if approved and the agreement does not spell out how many troops may come who where they may visit when it does not say how long military exercises may take when we accept the visitor we usually welcome him into the receiving room but under this agreement the visiting forces may enter the living rooms they may go into the kitchen they may go into the dens and enter every nook and corner of this land and therefore i vote no  i vote no because of the uncertainties of the approving authorities the agreement itself says that the activities must have the approval of the philippines of the philippine government but the same is negated by the fact that there exists a mutual defense board pursuant to the mutual defense treaty that would recommend the activities to carry out security and defense arrangements the framework of the m d t includes activities that carry out effectively the objectives of the security and defense agreements to improve and enhance common defense therefore while the proponents of the v f a contend that the activities will be approved by our government in truth and in fact such claims may yield to the realities of the mu mutual defense board where military activities are to be recommended for decision by the united states and philipp philippine military men for decisions will ultimately be forged by our secretary of foreign affairs and the united states secretary of state decisions mr president affecting the destiny of this nation in the hands of a body infused with foreign counterparts can the filipinos in that body say no when the united states representatives demand can they resist the clout military political economic that dominates such relations can the proposed oversight committee prevent undue acquiescence i vote no mr president because the v f a may not attain the objectives that the sponsors tell us is necessary because it will give life to the m d t it will help modernize our armed forces it will train us with the latest technology all to ensure the safety and security of the nation and the region against inter external attack perhaps but the creeping invasion referred to lies in the spratlys and the united states herself does not recognize the political sovereignty of the philippines over the kalayaans and they have time and again claimed neutrality over the spratly dispute not only between us and china but also amongst the five nations claiming the same the m d t itself limits the united states response to constitutional processes after an unarmed attack on metropolitan philippines under any vessel in pap stutters in the pacific and the spratlys lie outside metropolitan philippines and the pacific this was done in nineteen fifty-one when the united states nor the philippines dreamed of the spratlys talked about the spratlys it was a time when japan gave up any sovereign claims over the spratlys and so therefore all of these considerations together with the global consideration of the huge market of china etcetera make the claim that the united states would go to war for us over the spratlys seem unlikely modernize the armed forces train us teach us the latest technology again perhaps but we had joint military exercises with the united states forces even before and after the world war second we held exercises with them when the bases were here since nineteen forty-seven to nineteen ninety-two we held balikatan exercises with them even after the bases were gone we leave it to the people 's judgment whether or not our armed forces have become modernized because of those exercises whether or not we learned of the latest technologies because even the guns and the tanks and the planes furnished us like the huey helicopters are admittedly hand-me-down equipments destined to limit our progress and keep us attuned to mendicancy mr president we can modernize within our means there are lease purchase arrangements from other countries like israel france russia israel built an army from the ground up many other nations started from poverty and rose because of self-reliance we can have a corps of highly trained professional soldiers let us not be blinded by the fact that just because we are poor we cannot have an efficient armed forces we do not need quantity as much as quality good pilots seasoned seamen trained troops on the ground because as the great dramatist said  the fault dear brutus is not in the stars but in ourselves that we are underlings  let us cast aside this mendicant attitude that we need crutches all the time let us cast aside the perception and the belief that we do not have confidence in ourselves let us cast aside always leaning to mother america we need self-reliance not a gilded cage we need faith not blind adherence to a foreign power that dominated our national life since the turn of the century the united states desires presence in our land because her global strategy is patterned after global presence less bases but more v f a and status of forces agreements less expense but more widespread involvement and her line of containment in our region seems to lie between japan south korea to taiwan we are excluded as a reserve pawn but if china and jap and uh taiwan reunite the line of containment may bring us to the fore and we may repeat the perils of nineteen forty-one and the grim lessons of bataan and corregidor all over again the united states mr president acts for her own interest let us act for our own interest tne united states desires presence in the philippines because she desires to ensure free passage of the sea lanes in south china this coincides with our national interest but the united states desires presence as well because of economic interests in the spratlys for gas and oil and other mineral marine resources which may conflict with our own national interests because the united states herself does not officially recognize our political sovereignty there let us then act for our own not rely on a big brother whose main concern is his own self-interest let us go the diplomatic way let us have our own strategy let us go to the international court and the law of the sea if necessary let us formulate our own and relearn the lessons of history i vote no mr president because of the grievous harm the deaths the deformations the illnesses due to the infusion of toxic wastes which contaminated our land and seas in the past due to the presence of military bases 
Philippines	thank you mr chairman mr chairman uhm may i make comments with respect to ballot boxes from singapore brazil new zealand and italy and more particularly with respect to malaysia and czech republic comments the uh number in words for the votes of candidate gloria macapagal-arroyo was erased replaced with uh new handwriting because all of these contained in the carbon copies are in words likewise the votes for candidate loren legarda the number that is was likewise erased replaced with the uhm the numbers five hundred twenty-one uh mr chairman i would like to place on record that this is a clear case of an erasure in the c o c in fact after it was made because obviously the ink in the c o c copies that is colored blue because it is merely a carbon copy of the first c o c in which the uhm board of canvassers canvassers wrote on however the correction was made individually for each words the names in black may i also make of record mr chairman that unlike the c o c contained in ballot box number twenty-one wherein the alteration or erasure was initialed the altera the erasure and alteration found in the c o c for malaysia was not initialed by anyone  as a third point mr chairman as a final point uhm long clause in tagalog  uhm at the risk of stating it again long clause in tagalog  and having said that mr chairman may i pose a manifestation at the same time inquiry  for the record clause in tagalog senator biazon member of this twenty-two-man committee long clause in tagalog  now since this matter has been raised on several occasions by the lawyers mr chairman uhm senator biazon is not here right now uhm at a proper time may we know from senator biazon what that information is because it might be relevant sa canvassing being conducted by this now on a personal point at this juncture mr chairman again as i said it is only for the record at a proper time may we get a response or reply or clarification from the words  thank you  thank you mr chairman several points mr chairman if i will be given the leeway insofar as  word  first of all for the record according to the face of the c o c the votes obtained by f p j is twenty-four thousand five hundred seventy-four the votes obtained by g m a was twenty-one thousand one hundred eighty-five in other words clause in tagalog and having said that allow me to make my observations mr chairman and the reason why i am making this position  long statement in tagalog  now several times the word disenfranchisement  has been used whenever there is a motion from either the counsel or a member of this committee to set aside a particular c o c mr chairman distinguished members of this committee i think the proper term is defer   clause in tagalog  no one is being disenfranchised in fact we are protecting the right of every voter by ensuring that in the votes they cast in the last elections will be the ones that will be counted next point mr chairman during the deliberations on the rules senator pangilinan the sponsor of the rules said and you can check the records on this matter that the s o v is one of the documents against which we can prove the authenticity and due execution of a particular c o c because it will reveal whether or not the votes stated therein would tally with respect to the tally contained in the c o c uhm thirdly after the rules were adopted and approved this representation mr chairman sought permission from the senate president precisely to point out one fact  long clause in tagalog  at that point mr chairman this representation stood up and asked the chair clause in tagalog  even at that early stage that was thursday last week we made the necessary representations words the record whose records they have in their custody the s o v by precinct clause in tagalog  i do not know mr chairman uhm if not stopped by the house either in joint session or by the joint committee again mr chairman we do not seek to delay or further delay this proceeding in fact that suggestion was made a week ago precisely to avoid this situation now later on after some other comments have been made probably a motion will be made to produce the s o v prior to canvassing this particular c o c  two sentences in tagalog  and mr chairman uhm if i may finally state authenticity  pertains to signatures thumbmarks paper serial number fibers but  due execution means that all of the words  for every single c o c were filled up in accordance with law and the law simply states that clause in tagalog  and the only way to find that out is at the very least clause in tagalog by precinct for this particular c o c for this particular province again mr chairman to reiterate section seventeen of our very own rules state that we should look for erasures or alterations in either the c o c or the s o v by precinct how can we find out if there are erasures or alterations in the s o v by precinct if we cannot even look at it or see it here before us may i reserve my right mr chairman the proper time to seek redress insofar as the production of the s o vs thank you  thank you mr chairman uhm according to congressman abad there is no need for section seventeen to come into operation because there seems to be no erasure or alteration in the c o c however section seventeen is clear if there is no alteration in the c o c or statement of votes by precinct  now i agree with congressman abad indeed there is no alteration or erasure in the statement of votes by precinct because we did not even see it how can i even know if indeed there is an alteration or erasure in the s o v by precinct if we could not even get a good chance to see it  clause in tagalog alteration and erasure in s o v by precinct however mr chairman having said that may i reiterate the words the suggestion earlier made made by senator pimentel and the suggestion of this representation made in plenary long statement in tagalog  may we request for uh the chair to instruct the secretary general to look words to stay open word do not contain s o vs by precinct and for the necessary representations to be made by the chair probably to comelec for them to produce or make available at least those copies so that at a proper time we will not be uh there will be no delay insofar as this particular issue is concerned and as a last point mr chairman i take it from the statements of the honorable word and honorable abad that indeed if there is no doubt as to the number of votes cast for president and vice president there is no need to go down to either the s o v by precinct or  words the election returns without conceding that point mr chairman i will hold them to their word at a proper time thank you  mr speaker mr senate president distinguished colleagues in the house and in the senate allow me to answer these issues raised before us it is sad to note that the joint committee at the very onset was plagued with partisan politics the national board of canvassers should have been non-partisan in carrying out its function of canvassing the votes cast for president and vice-president however unlike in previous years the composition of the joint committee tasked to preliminarily canvass the votes were made to conform to the majority-minority representation in the house and in the senate hence as it turned out six members from the senate appointed to the joint committee were allied with or supported a presidential candidate five others supported another presidential candidate the other presidential candidates have no representation much less a voice in the same in the house of representatives eight members represented a candidate or supported a candidate one represented three candidates however one candidate was not represented at all except through an alternate member  two sentences in tagalog  in all of the decisions not a single decision was made wherein the votes cast went beyond or below the representation of the majority in both the senate and the house  two sentences in tagalog  but at the onset it was created precisely to function in that manner  one long sentence in tagalog  the second issue here we face is the issue or debate between the election returns and the certificates of canvass  one sentence in tagalog  for the longest time mr speaker mr president a lot many members of this august body have been saying that we cannot we are not authorized it is illegal for us to go down to the returns it was only now mr speaker mr president that an admission and a clear admission at that was made that indeed congress could have should have voted in that direction it could have looked at the election returns  five sentences in tagalog  i thank the distinguished sponsors last night for on the record making and giving that admission to lay the issue finally to rest  one sentence in tagalog  simply put the majority voted not to look at the return  three sentences in tagalog  serious allegations of fraud were made by counsels for the various presidential candidates allegations which is unfair to say the least to the candidate accused of fraud and yet the accusation was left alone  two sentences in tagalog  brother eddie villanueva wrote the joint committee and said that he would have wanted at least three c o cs to be opened up for us to be able to look at the election returns  one sentence in tagalog  just one c o c for us to find out two basic facts  three sentences in tagalog  second will it actually take us fourteen years to go down to the returns will it take us six hours as some claim dont take our word for it neither will we take yours  three sentences in tagalog  it was said during the sponsorship speeches given in relation to the majority report that not a single c o c was presented by any of the counsels much less the opposition  three sentences in tagalog  it will be useless to compare our copy of the c o c with the six other copies of the c o c  three sentences in tagalog  mr speaker mr president whenever we asked that we go down to the election returns two-and-a-half sentences in tagalog  mr speaker i listened intently to the speeches and interpellations last night  three sentences in tagalog  mr speaker im of the belief that whenever we see something wrong we should at first sight seek to correct it  four sentences in tagalog  mr speaker it has been said also that we seek to exclude certain certificates of canvass by objecting to it thereby disenfranchising millions of voters or thousands of voters we seek mr speaker mr president not the exclusion of c o cs but rather its deferment to find out the true and actual vote of our people  three sentences in tagalog  we seek not to accuse you as being cheaters rather we seek to fight for the truth by ensuring that indeed you were not cheated in the last elections because mr speaker mr president in the final analysis it is not the candidate who was cheated of these elections it was for all intents and purposes the filipino people and not the candidate in whose favor they voted mr speaker a while ago my good friend digs dilangalen quoted the preamble allow me to seek emphasis by ending my brief sponsorship to the minority report in the reverse by citing the preamble which reads and states within it  we the sovereign filipino people imploring the aid of the almighty god in order to build a just and humane society and establish a government which shall embody our ideals and aspirations promote the common good conserve and develop our patrimony and secure to ourselves and our posterity the blessings of independence and democracy under the rule of law and a regime of truth justice love equality and peace do ordain this constitution  mr speaker mr president in the hierarchy of values the framers of our constitution chose to put primordial among the rest the value of truth over freedom over love over peace over justice and mr speaker mr president that is all that we are asking for distinguished colleagues whether or not watchers signed or did not sign the c o c or the election returns will not and cannot change the truth whether or not you vote for or against the committee report whether or not you vote to look at the election returns it will not change the truth if in a few minutes we vote in favor of a particular candidate it will not change the truth our votes in this hall cannot mr speaker mr president change the truth neither can time change the truth i am for the truth mr speaker mr president because the truth is unbiased the truth as it has been said favors no one this is beyond f p j this is beyond g m a this is beyond any other candidate nor personality because in so far as we are concerned mr speaker we will stand by and will always fight for the truth however lonely that fight may be thank you mr speaker distinguished colleagues  uh mr speaker thank you mr speaker uh mr speaker i believe that uh the suspe uh the adjournment uh of congress as a legislative body does not affect our function to canvass thats why uhm i believe that there is a distinction between the legislative function and uh our mandate to canvass the votes of the president and vice- president if we look at the constitution uh mr speaker that provision to canvass the votes of the president and vice-president is actually under the executive branch of government uh with this uh article seven section four mr speaker so even if we have already adjourned uh congress in its regular session we emanate our power from this constitutional provision that congress is tasked to canvass the votes for the president and vice-president that is why it is in er the this provision the power to canvass is embodied in article seven section four which is actually uh the article for the executive department mr speaker because we are actually doing an administrative function so when we call congress in a joint public session that power mr speaker is derived from uh article seven section four of the constitution and it is not a legislative function it is indeed an executive function thank you mr speaker  thank you mr speaker uh to our uh humble opinion the uh canvass must be an exception to the adjournment sine die  it is an exception because uh otherwise there would be created a uh situation where provisions of the constitution will run athwart each other i say that uh although i would agree that uh a canvass is not a special session it is a uh specific uh act given to congress empowered to congress uh which would be the canvassing body that would proclaim ultimately the president and the vice-president so if we now adjourn uh sine die somehow there would be created a grotesque situation where congress will still be canvassing the votes for the president and the vice-president i would say that if we follow the thirty-day rule of uh adjourning  sine die the general rule is adjournment sine die when there is no presidential or vice-presidential election but when there is a vice preside presidential and vice-presidential election this is going to be an exception and that the adjournment sine die should not uh be declared by congress congress has has uh to still proclaim the president and that if we again adjourn sine die there would be we would endanger that particular uh act of congress to still be existing at the time of the proclamation so i say that this is an exception to the general rule of uh uh the general rule mr speaker 
Philippines	mr chairman mr chairman mr chairman uhm i would like to reiterate uh the statements uh propounded by the honorable uh escudero of sorsogon and uh with due reference also to the statements made by the lawyers uh earlier uh by saying that we would see that the the law word is suddenly word so in that sense the uh support of the statement of the honorable uh congressman from sorsogon i would read the law the last paragraph of section twenty-nine of republic act seventy- one sixty-six republic act seven one six six is an act to provide for the synchronization of the national and local elections and to provide electoral reform that is the title of the law and in section twenty-nine last paragraph if i may read the certificate of canvass prepared by the commission board of canvassers shall be supported by a statement of votes by municipality and the original copy of for the congress shall in addition be supported by statement of votes by precinct as submitted to the provincial board of canvassers by city or municipal board of canvassers  very clear in the law that you see a board of canvassers is mandated to place in this ballot box not only the c o c the municipal uh the s o v by municipality and as well the s o v by precinct it is mandatory unlike the requirement to submit election returns  on site . this one is very specific that it should be included here in this ballot box and therefore this is in line also for the uh word  with section thirty of the law that whenever we discover there are erasures and there are uh alteration we have to refer to these documents and when we discover erasures and uh or alterations in an s o v by precinct if it is not words  so may i may i suggest in the same way as the honorable escudero suggested two days ago that in the meantime we defer this uh ballot uh ballot box uh uh for uh the province of uh quirino while we are producing the uh the s o v after all this will just be uh reported uh in the same way as we have summoned the witnesses for the comelec candidate without delaying let us proceed to the other the other ballot boxes in that way we will be able uh to have an understanding of  word and not necessarily delay this canvassing mr chairman  thank you very much mr speaker mr speaker uh i have been wondering why there shall be an adjournment really uh since uh this has even caused the delay in the in the canvassing we have already made a headway and suddenly surprisingly uh notice were sent to us and for purposes of uh adjournment uh as been uh said as provided in the constitution that mr speaker i dont quite agree that we should adjourn considering the fact that we are also mandated at this instance to do uh the canvassing the constitution does not make any distinction whether we are functioning as a legislative or as a canvassing the uh the word uh the house of representatives is is in session is  to say that there are certain responsibilities there are certain activities that must be performed by congress when it is in in session contrary to when congress is in recess where members of the house are not doing its regular work and canvassing is part of the regular work of congress being enshrined in the constitution now this adjournment by the looks alone of the members uh not in agreement with each other might create a crisis might even uh be raised in the supreme court because we might not be able to proceed mr speaker i m afraid that there must be an or there was a reason why this adjournment is called and i m afraid that with this the agenda is not to continue the canvassing and i m afraid that if we dont continue this canvassing there will be no proclamation especially fernando poe is already leading so therefore i am for the continu continuing of the session and that we will be able to canvass the uh  thank you mr speaker if i may add uh my unsolicited two cents  worth of opinion to this uh proceeding mr speaker if we do adjourn sine die this afternoon we are not adjourning congress we are adjourning the regular session of congress which is provided in section fifteen of article six of the philippine constitution note mr speaker that section fifteen speaks of congress convening once every year on the fourth monday of july for its regular session unless a different date is fixed by law and shall continue to be in session that means in regular session for such number of days as it may determine until thirty days before the opening of the next regular session i agree mr speaker with the honorable flo majority leader that it is not congress that is adjourned when we adjourn our regular session we do not terminate the existence of congress after we adjourn our regular session we can be called to a special session before the termination or the expiration of the term of office of the members of this house on june thirty now when we do meet again in joint public session in order to proclaim the winning presidential and vice-presidential candidate that joint public session mr speaker i submit is in the nature of a special session it is in the nature of a special session that need not be called by the president of the philippines because section four of article seven specifically calls congress precisely to that joint public session for the purpose of canvassing and later proclaiming the president-elect and the vice-president-elect then there should be no controversy it is not mr speaker that congress is schizophrenic that it has multi- personalities even as it does have multi-duties and functions the matter of legislation is taken up in its regular and special sessions the matter of canvass is taken up in this joint public session which uh uh is provided by section fourteen true there are man there are different functions of congress but this does not at all detract from the fact that congress must as a legislative body perform its function and so mr speaker i hope that i have contributed a bit to clarify the matter  thank you mr chairman mr chairman to underscore the fact that congress continues to exist as a body congress may be called to a special session by the president of the philippines if it is called to a special session that is recognition that congress is still existing all the way up to june thirty now is it necessary for the president to call congress to a special session in order that it may sit as a national canvassing board i submit no because the constitution itself in section four of article seven already calls congress to sit as a special session it would be superfluous for us to ask the president of the philippines to call congress to a special session since after all when the president calls congress to a special session it is in order that the congress may take up legislative matters in this particular instance we have the constitution itself calling congress to sit as a national canvassing board independently of any call for a special session by the president thank you mr chairman  uh mr presi mr chairman clears throat i think uh we should distinguish the various rules we have here there can be no question that both the congressmen and the senators all of us here should remain in office up to june thirty so up to june thirty we re still senators we re still congressmen nobody can deprive us of that so as senators and congressmen what will we what are we supposed to do now so much has been uh raised about section fifteen the rule on legislative powers which reads that congress shall convene once every year on the fourth monday of july for its for its regular session unless a different date is fixed by law and etcetera etcetera what s referred to by section fifteen is regular session so under our legislative calendar our regular session ended in i think july uh june june eleven that is our regular session so the question is is congress deprived of other things my respectful submission mr chairman is that no  if you scan the powers of congress you will notice that if the president of the philippines should declare martial law or suspend the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus congress is duty-bound within forty-eight hours to meet to approve or disapprove of the action of the president without need of call in fact and then whatever congress does cannot be changed by the president so that even now if should the president of the philippines suspend the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus or impose martial law we can meet and approve or disapprove what the president has done so with that mr president we have powers continuing powers which cannot be deprived by even an adjournment of congress adjournment is nothing more than adjournment and as i alluded to earlier assuming that there was adjournment that adjournment referred to the regular session but more directly to the point mr president mr chairman in our role as canvassers we should look to section four on the executive department which is the canvassing powers little noticed is this provision the person having the highest number of votes shall be proclaimed elected but in case two or more shall have an equal and highest number of votes one of them shall forthwith be chosen by the vote of uh a majority of all members of both houses of congress voting separately  what does this mean mr chairman it means that should in the remote possibility that there is a tie we are called upon to break the tie as legislators not even as canvassers why because that is a power a sovereign power vested in us to choose or break the tie and the moment we break the tie whoever we favor becomes president of the philippines that is a reserve power so even now should our canvass say that there s a tie we can meet and break the tie i i ve brought two ins uh uh two instances mr uh mr chairman clears throat why the pres why congress has still continuing powers to convene even after the adjournment last june eleven because there are certain powers that we must exercise if the exigencies arise that s why mr chairman all of this all of this uh debate is not really to the point because we have still reserve powers which we ll have to exercise i i so it s my respectful submission mr chairman that uh we continue to have powers we can convene any time up to the end of our terms because our powers are not diminished one whit up to june thirty we are not deprived of anything we only followed the rule of rule uh i mean section fifteen which says that thirty days before the end of session we have to uh uh we have to adjourn but that is refers only to regular session so mr chairman i think we proceed and uh go on on with the canvass because uh uh i dont think that the uh uh assertion that uh we have adjourned uh i think has no uh constitutional leg to stand on thank you mr chairman  mr chairman while i agree with the uh recommendation of senator pimentel that uh following section fifteen and also following the ruling we made on the biliran case that uh those uh missing documents if ever should should should be produced uh within the day that is provided in our rules but at the same time strictly speaking uh uh mr chairman going by the standards that uh is are provided for in section fourteen uh the c o c of capiz uh is is authentic and duly executed and the discrepancy noted on the face of the c o c is not uh the discrepancy that is uh uh described or of  wh in section fourteen cause in section fourteen it says no discrepancy in other authentic copies of uh the certificate of canvass or discrepancy in the votes of or of any candidate in words and figures in the same certificate so strictly speaking we did not go through that exercise in the determination of authenticity and due execution but yun  just for the sake of sat satisfying ourselves about this seeming uh uh inconsistency in the phase we went through that but i dont think that it is necessary in the determination of due execution and authenticity therefore mr speaker i think it is in order for us to proceed with the canvass of uh the uh capiz c o c while at the same time you know uh i as i said that i agree with the recommendation of uh senator pimentel as provided for in section fifteen and as we agreed upon in the uh biliran case mr speaker

workers in government honored guests mga minamahal kong kababayan  in the corridors of power in the palace where i work past presidents of the republic sit in their portraits in judgment of me in this gallery of the highest public servants none sits in sterner judgment than the man who first led me by the hand into the palace as a teenager in that country where a man 's worth was measured by his poverty he was born in a nipa hut into a family that tilled less than a hectare of land after years of hard struggle and brilliant achievement my father took his oath as president of the philippines on ground made hallow by the martyrdom of our national hero a hero whose name he would honor and whose ideals he would pursue indeed in a democracy a man may rise to the nation 's highest service by dint of energy and intelligence alone without regard to wealth and connections of which my father had none it was jose rizal who wrote a life dedicated to a great ideal is useless uh not dedicated to a great ideal is useless a mere pebble in the field that forms no part of an edifice  the words of diosdado macapagal echoed this theme has as he assumed the mantle of national leadership forty years ago no president can build the whole edifice of a nation  all that he is called upon to do is to add a fine stone to that edifice so that those who shall come after him may add other fine stones that will go for a strong and enduring structure  modest words from a modest man who would yet change for all time how a feudal society would come to view a vital institution land reform my countrymen the fine stone i should like to add to the edifice of our nation right above the stone of social justice that my father left behind is a strong republic two essential features mark out a strong republic the first is independence from class and sectoral interests so that it stands for the interests of the people rather than of a powerful minority the second is the capacity represented through strong institutions and a strong bureaucracy to execute good policy and deliver essential services the things that only governments can do the results of these two features good policies and empowered institutions is faster economic development and social reform a strong republic takes care of the people and takes care of their future thus a strong republic is the bedrock of the victory we seek over poverty within the decade during these past eighteen months our efforts to build the strong republic have been difficult with both domestic and global conditions extremely harsh at home the poor were pitted against the rich to further inflame our nation 's social divisions abroad the contracting economies of our main trading partners were further aggravated by the tensions generated by the global war against  terroris terrorism meanwhile one shocking corporate scandal after another severely eroded public faith in the most promising system for conducting economic activity the free market these were the large long-term crises of social justice and the capitalist system itself whose resolution awaits events well beyond one small nation 's ability to influence in the short term but as i report on the state of the nation today i can say this the immediate crises have been resolved this resolution was achieved by focusing on three things first by showing tangible results in the delivery of government services thus in my state of the nation address last year i did something never done before i detailed a long list of measurable targets that would show a government on the move marking progress by swift sure steps despite the turbulent state of domestic and global affairs seven minutes of targets and accomplishments discussed in tagalog interspersed with applause this is just the tip of our accomplishments all in just the first year of the ten-year fight i projected against poverty i am submitting the entire iceberg to congress in a comprehensive performance report for good measure it has been published and nationally circulated these were our commitments we delivered on them a strong republic does what it says it takes care of the people and takes care of their future our second focus to achieve the resolution of the immediate crises was the preservation and defense of the republic against forces that seek to destroy its unity and tear the fabric of its society not least in the name of ideas that history has already passed by the turning points are clear this year may one passed peacefully this year our soldiers rescued gracia burnham and finished off her terrorist captor applause  this year what used to be camp abubakar became an authentic community of new hopes and dreams where our flag flies and our soldiers protect those who have returned to their homes beyond the symbolic significance of these accomplishments we have brought back inter-faith solida solidarity energized by the invaluable initiative of speaker jose de venecia applause and we have sealed peace agreements with the moro islamic liberation front we achieved all of these backed by the valor professionalism and restraint of our soldiers and police i salute our men and women in uniform at the forefront of our republic 's efforts to fight terror and enforce peace the third focus to resolve the crises and build a strong republic was to restore macroeconomic stability and win back investor confidence the linchpin was to control our fiscal deficit if edsa two had not happened the government would simply have gone bankrupt with a deficit of two hundred forty-five billion pesos applause but we controlled the deficit brought it down to a hundred forty-seven billion pesos and against all odds turned our international credit rating from risky to stable   applause  it was hard work here and abroad to rekindle global interest in our country but we did it applause  the adoption of strong administrative measures including fighting smuggling and graft and corruption will enable us to close the gap in our revenue targets for this year the basic macro signs indicate that things are under control inflation is at a low driven down by stable food prices and now by declining power costs applause four sentences comparing prices then and now in tagalog interspersed with applause  interest rates are also at a low and our peso is stable from fifty-six pesos to the dollar it is now a little over fifty pesos applause  internationally the philippines is back on the map we are the third best-performing economy in asia and the best in southeast asia applause  as a result of our decisive action after september eleven the philippines is now a recognized player in world affairs the president of the philippines was the first head of government to emphasize the interconnection between the war against terrorism and the war against poverty now nations large and small embrace this interconnection  applause  we have gained powerful allies in our domestic war against terrorism i am certain that our increased international visibility will continue generating capital inflows for the philippines where we have fallen short of achieving what we intended it has not been from misdirection or a lack of trying after all it has really been only one year and a half in any event i promise to work even harder if that is possible and do even better because i believe that there is always room for improvement i cannot grow taller but i can always get better applause and laughter  my working agenda for the coming year will focus on creating and improving job opportunities citizens with rewarding jobs paying decent wages constitute not just a stone in the edifice but the very foundation of a strong republic we need investments to generate jobs and to draw in investments we will address certain problems in the short term katiwalian  peace and order and the cost of power applause five sentences in tagalog break in recording  but even now i can tell you that our new e-procurement program is saving billions and minimizing anomalies even now i can tell you that the presidential anti-graft commission is doing its best to ensure that good governance is carried out five sentences in tagalog  this is still a continuing effort tax evasion is a white-collar crime and the response is a white-collar response systems improvement audit prosecution smuggling is something else it is done by hoodlums and criminal gangs but the punishment for both must be the same blue-collar time  kalaboso applause  indeed criminal gangs and homegrown terrorists have exploited the poisoned political atmosphere to spread poisons of their own kidnapping gambling drug-dealing rampant smuggling you have seen political will in the harsh interpretation of command responsibility with regard to illegal gambling that draconian application was a dress rehearsal for enforcing command responsibility in the even more difficult challenges of kidnapping drug-dealing and smuggling applause  i am determined to build a strong republic by breaking the back of terrorism and criminality applause  in the year two thousand despite all the rampant efforts of rampant smuggling only sixteen million pesos worth was confiscated but last year in a show of political will my administration seized one point two billion pesos worth of smuggled goods applause  including more than a million bags of smuggled rice as compared to much less than a hundred thousand the year before i congratulated the commissioner of customs but told him also go beyond getting the smuggled goods and get me the big time smugglers  applause  i have instructed the d o j to charge these big-time smugglers not just with smuggling but also with economic sabotage non-bailable capital offense applause  criminal syndicates will be treated as what they are direct threats to national security criminals are criminals whether of the common kind or the kind that will kill in the name of political advocacies they will feel the full brunt of the arsenal of democracy freedom too is entitled to self-defense i have given very clear orders to spare nothing in hunting down kidnappers we will go by scorecards and track progress by counting beans if we have to remember mary grace rosagas of uratex who was kidnapped from u p remember her aunt connie wong who was killed by the kidnappers remember rowena tiu who was kidnapped in la union remember the owner of liana supermarket  re remember the whispers about the kidnapping of a granddaughter of a big banker and the son of a steel magnate we have taken down the syndicates responsible for kidnapping them and fifty-two other victims applause  in the process one hundred seventy kidnappers were either killed or captured the ideal response to kidnapping was in the case of rowena tiu she was rescued in eight days the ransom money recovered and her kidnappers were arrested and are now facing trial that is why hers was the first but the last kidnapping to take place in region one in my administration i want to smash the other twenty-one syndicates in the same way  applause  we are getting a clearer picture of the leadership membership and area of operations of these syndicates i now want their linkages and modus operandi i 'm overseeing how they are being watched tracked and infiltrated we will start with the two biggest syndicates the bocala and fajardo gangs i have challenged the p philippine national police to eliminate them within a year applause  i have told the p n p that they must start with the cleansing of their own ranks you remember the front page photographs of that shootout last saturday in the front seat next to the driver was a p n p a p n p academy graduate but awol from the police force he was the planner and negotiator of that gang the rascals among the police disgrace the uniform and unfortunately paint in the same broad brush the majority who do their duty well i salute the men and women of the police who scorned to be bribed and confiscated five hundred kilograms of shabu in quezon province last year and caught the biggest fish so far in the drug trade i salute the men and women who raided the shabu  factories in batangas zambales san juan varsity hills and other places seizing a total of five billion pesos worth of illegal drugs and laboratory equipment in the largest drug busts ever in our history of crime-fighting  applause  within a month we shall organize the new dangerous drugs board and the philippine drug enforcement agency which congress has just created and i thank senator barbers for sponsoring the bill in the senate applause  with the drug menace now elevated to the level of a national security problem and no longer just a police problem i am instructing the armed forces of the philippines to field military resources for intelligence and to field soldiers in drug raids in support of civilian law enforcement  applause  drug lords will be treated as enemies of the state applause in this war with the drug trade there will be no compromise and no quarter not for fear or favor indeed we are at war at war with the terrorists at war with the kidnappers at war with the drug lords and we are determined to win decisive victories on all fronts applause  the global anti-terrorist coalition is a historical watershed this new global consensus helps us immensely in finally breaking the cycle of terrorism and criminality to that end we shall enhance our strategic relationship with the united states through continuing training exercises to sharpen our  soldiers' capabilities to move and communicate to fix and finish off their targets applause  i am happy to let you know that yesterday we captured the mastermind of the general santos bombings that killed and maimed eighty persons a few months ago applause  this man that we captured yesterday is considered the number one expert terrorist-bomber we cannot afford to lose even a stalemate will be a defeat for what is at stake is our country as a viable proposition in the world economy and we must be viable if we are to win the most fundamental war the war against poverty applause  i ask the newly-elected barangay captains to take an active role in this war to be the frontliners in this fight in your communities and as with war in the past so will it be with this war as commander-in-chief i am taking a direct hand in the war against the enemies of the republic applause  this was how i did it with the abu sayyaf leading to the death of abu sabaya this is how i will do it with the criminal gangs applause   nakasalalay dito ang pamamayani ng ating republika  our strong republic at stake in this war is the very life of society the very possibility of basic rights and liberties which have been under attack for too long the right to work in peace is as basic as the right to life and liberty and when both are in danger their preservation by all lawful means becomes not just a higher right but an overriding duty and that duty i will discharge applause  this is a war we will wage on behalf and with the rage of all the victims those whose businesses were ruined by extortion those held down by poverty in fear those whose lives were snuffed out by addiction and those taken hostage and killed to them i say we shall redeem your pain we shall redeem your loss  applause  i endorse to the collective wisdom of congress with a great sense of urgency a new bill that will strengthen our legal armory in this war the anti-terrorism bill applause  when passed into law this bill will plug the loopholes by which crimes spread and democracy is undermined congress will also note a reallocation of resources in this year 's budget to enhance the republic 's crime-fighting capabilities applause there are a number of other critical bills linked closely to the overall run of social economic and political reform i will hold more meetings with the legislative-executive development advisory council or ledac to push this momentum of reform we must team up as i said last year to enact a law making farm land acceptable as loan collateral in order to remove a big deterrent to investments in agriculture we must pass the special purpose vehicle act in order to encourage asset management companies to put back into productive circulation assets now tied up in problematic loans we must pass a law to give overseas filipinos the right to vote consistent with the constitution applause  we must pass the bill that will give equal respect and recognition to the overseas filipino 's dual citizenship consistent with our national honor applause  these are the least return for the enormous contribution of our overseas filipinos to the national welfare 1
Philippines	 the presiding officer calls on the speaker  your honor the chief justice of the philippines your honor the senate president of the philippines your honors members of the senate esteemed colleagues of the defense friends ladies and gentlemen members of the senate our team of prosecutors will show that during his brief incumbency of barely over two years joseph ejercito estrada has violated the oath previously mentioned by congressman belmonte had violated the law not once not twice but regularly like clockwork the prosecutors will again expose the existence of a criminal syndicate directed from the highest office of the land this is the gangland mob that threatens to rule us this not the parliament of the street is the mob rule the mob rule that will savage our constitution and the very fabric of our society unless we destroy it now before it destroys us i stated that we will expose the existence of the criminal syndicate again i use the word again because fortunately for our panel much of the shocking and sordid details of this story have been unfolded before this very chamber before your honors and our task will be to simply present in proper form the evidence and testimony which the filipino people already know and have already evaluated for themselves and to link up some word sense in our presentation we will therefore focus only on the salient points governor chavit singson will re-affirm before your honors the following facts and events sometime in august nineteen ninety-eight the newly elected president joseph ejercito estrada summoned bong pineda charlie atong ang and governor chavit singson to his polk street residence to discuss jueteng operations in the country on that occasion president estrada prohibited pineda from continuing to deliver jueteng collections to him as the latter was already identified as jueteng lord instead he appointed both ang and governor singson as his national jueteng collectors and delivery men of course we all remember who atong ang is and his association with joseph ejercito estrada barely two months later however after a heated disagreement over the president 's refusal to give in to atong ang 's demand for a share in certain sugar allocations atong ang was stripped by president estrada of his jueteng collection authority this left governor singson as the presidential appointee in charge of these illegal collections the testimony of governor singson will re-affirm that from november nineteen ninety-eight to august two thousand an average of five million pesos usually in crisp one thousand peso bills was hand-delivered by him to president estrada every fifteen days either in his residence at polk street greenhills or in malaca&ntilde;ang or in the house of one of his mistresses guia gomez and for accounting purposes president estrada assigned an auditor in the person of mrs yolanda ricaforte wife of tourism undersecretary orestes ricaforte to monitor and deliver the receipt of the tong collections as well as the disburse disbursement therefrom in a ledger for a period until june nineteen ninety-eight the excess of the jueteng collections after the five million peso for the president has been set aside every fifteen days would be earmarked by governor singson also on the orders of president estrada for the ton construction of the fontainebleau casino in the former clark air base although the true owner of fontainebleau was the president on his instruction the stock holdings was placed in the names of jaime de chavez one of his cronies jesus pineda a schoolmate of his and edmundo silverio a nominee of butch tenorio the president of pagcor acronym for philippine amusement and gaming corporation  the president eventually opted to discontinue the fontainebleau operation in favor of fontana casino where his stakes have been greater and financial rewards higher when it was decided to abort the fontainebleau casino operation mrs ricaforte also took over the duty of preparing the ledger and monitoring the collection and expenses of the jueteng operations including the sensitive task of depositing the presidential share in various accounts  1 word to mrs ricaforte all the accumulated collections from jueteng including future collections so mrs ricaforte opened several separate accounts in different branches of equitable bank where she deposited the collections governor singson will re-affirm that this year two hundred million was withdrawn by mrs ricaforte from the said deposits in equitable bank placed in various interim accounts to cleanse the dirty money before it was placed at the disposal of the lord of all gambling lords the withdrawal of the amount also coincided with the shift of illegal gambling operation from jueteng to a bigger form known as bingo two ball where the stakes are much higher this time using pagcor as front of the grand design to further centralize the rewards of gambling operations  just like in the shift from fontainebleau casino to fontana casino the shift from jueteng to bingo two balls was motivated by the desire of greed for greater greater financial reward the testimony of governor singson will be corroborated by several witnesses including the jueteng collection ledger which mrs ricaforte admits having maintained we will present the checks that governor singson surrendered to mrs ricaforte on instruction of president estrada we will present the branch records of the separate bank accounts that mrs ricaforte opened on orders of president estrada and where she deposited said checks on the succeeding jueteng collections we will present to your honors the checks totaling two hundred million pesos which mrs ricaforte handed over and turned to lawyer by the name of atty edward serapio we will present the testimony of atty serapio at the hearing of the senate blue ribbon committee where he admitted that he indeed was the predi presidential assistant in malaca&ntilde;ang at that time that he was the personal legal adviser of president estrada and of his families that the two hundred million was transferred by him to the funds of the corporation that president estrada ordered him to organize that the officers of this corporation aside from himself was raul de guzman the brother-in-law of the president estrada george go the majority stock holder of equitable bank and the president 's banker and two employees of raul de guzman in u p we will also show the open forum at the meeting of the foreign correspondents association of the philippines or focap where president estrada made admissions corroborative of the accusations of governor chavit chavit singson against him it is certain that the lawyers of the president will tell you that governor singson should not be believed because he has admitted being a co-conspirator in the commission of the crime but in the statement words a co-conspirator should still be accepted even if uncorroborated when it is shown to be sincere in itself because given unhesitantly and in a straightforward manner and is full of details which by their nature could not have been the result of a deliberate afterthought who is saying this this is the pronouncement of our supreme court in the decision where they handed down that decision only recently last august after you have heard him determine on the basis whether governor singson deserves to be believed especially after we shall have presented you the corroborating documentary evidences in support of his testimony governor singson will swear under oath that he personally handed five million pesos to the president every fifteen days commencing the year of nineteen ninety until the beginning of this year once made this is an accusation that nobody except the president can deny it it is a denial that nobody but nobody can make for him under oath for the past month president estrada has gallantly promised time and again on television on radio in the newspaper that when the impeachment trial begins he will face the people and his accusers and answer all charges point by point will the president still do so your honors as we have narrated our evidence will be the testimony of the very person who handed money to the president fifty million five million pesos every fifteen days like clockwork it is a firsthand testimony the rest of his story will be corroborated in other essentials not by other witnesses but by the very statement of the president himself and after we are through with our evidence we have no doubt that you your honors will render a judgment of conviction with a clear conscience thank you very much mr chief justice your honors i am feliciano belmonte jr of the fourth district of quezon city this afternoon we the house prosecutors are tasked to fulfill a duty it is a duty that none of us relish it is painful painful because we will prove to the judges in this procidy proceedings that the faith and trust that we have bestowed on our president had been abused it is a grave duty grave because we are asking the judges that joseph ejercito estrada whom we elected as president be removed from the presidency at once for the sake of the country for the sake of the people it is a burden that the constitution has placed on the shoulders of the prosecutors and it is a duty that we will faithfully fulfill when i make reference to the judges in these impeachment proceedings your honors i am not addressing the senators here assembled alone because it is not only joseph ejercito estrada who has been put on trial here we the prosecutors and the house of congress that we represent this chamber sitting in judgment the judiciary here personified by the chief justice the moral values that we hold dear indeed the entire structure of government and our society all are as much on trial in these proceedings the judges are the people who even now watch our every move and listen intently to our every word it is they your honors whom we the prosecutors also address because it is to them that we all are accountable for what we will do here a forty second translation of previous sentences in filipino  they say that all trials have innocent beginnings a forty-five second speech in filipino  central to the oath taken by joseph ejercito estrada before then chief justice andres narvasa who is now here with us are the phrases to quote to execute its laws and quote to consecrate myself to the service of the nation a forty-five second speech in filipino  the prosecution will show that not only did joseph ejercito estrada not execute the laws he was the first to violate them prosecutors will show that during his brief incumbency of barely over two years joseph ejercito estrada has violated his oath of office had violated the law not once not twice but regularly like clockwork a one minute speech in filipino  behind all this legalese what do these charges mean simply that joseph ejercito estrada has failed the filipino people especially the poor betrayed their hopes and broke their dreams a ten second speech in filipino  and there is nothing mysterious or arcane about this process it is not about lawyers it is not about technicalities common sense in the light of a person 's common experience is enough to appreciate the evidence and to reach a knowledgeable fair and patriotic conclusion i thank you your honors
Philippines	 not beginning of speech it is this experience which gives our gathering and this particular day special meaning for today twenty-five years ago martial law was imposed on this country many would much rather forget that dark period of our nation 's history but should we ever forget we would only expose ourselves and our children and our children 's children anew to its indignity and horror  several sentences in filipino  martial law can we ever forget the megalomaniac regime which plundered our nation can we ever forget the strong-arm meddling in the conduct of business and industry the fawning of cronies and the wannabe cronies the shameless ostentation in malaca&ntilde;ang as the poor mired in misery can we ever forget the terrifying face of our own military turned against us as enemy under military rule there was no freedom of movement those who were critical of the regime were considered subversive they were arrested for preliminary investigation and released a half year later only to be kept on constant surveillance later to be arrested again the people learned to fear their own sisters brothers and friends they feared their own walls their own shadows their own whispered rejection of a regime so ignominious do we not remember trinidad herrera she protested against the inhumane demolition of squatters'  homes in the city she was arrested she was tortured she was but one of the thousands broken by cigarette burns ear-popping water treatment beating strangulation scalding mid-air suspension sexual assault and electric shock do we not remember the routine hamletting the rude zoning the murderous salvaging do we not remember ninoy aquino incarcerated and exiled for his opposition to this regime he was killed in the tarmac that now bears his name he was killed by self-absolutizing power gone paranoid desperate to preserve itself in power you prayed you acted several sentences in filipino  together we pray in our prayer in our recollection of recent history in our recollection of ominous events and confusing public statements we bishops and faithful catholics and protestants believers in god and humanity discovered our common position we were convinced that charter change at this time would be immoral it would be self-serving and benefit primarily those who desired to stay in power beyond constitutional limits it would divide the nation and distract from other pressing national concerns it would expose the constitution to total change without sufficient time for national deliberation convinced of its immorality we bonded in common purpose and common action several sentences in filipino  we are firm in our applause we are firm in our common position we reject an immoral change of charter at this time we reject any and all martial and military options to perpetuate any politician in power we say yes to clean and honest elections  yes to the supremacy of civilian authority over military power  yes to the imperative stability of constitutional order for this gladly we risked our lives for this gladly we would lay down our lives we prayed we acted in the darkness of confusing official statements and contradictory official actions we feared the president of the philippines was not with us we feared he was sadly 1 word from the spirit which bonded us at edsa and unified us in the ratification of the nineteen eighty-seven constitution we feared we have been betrayed in our trust several sentences in filipino interspersed with applause  the president has declared that there will be elections in nineteen ninety-eight applause  he has declared he is not running in nineteen ninety-eight  applause  he has directed his party mates to shelve legislative moves for a constituent assembly applause  he has acknowledged that the people prefer a constitutional convention after the nineteen ninety-eight elections applause   for your information this statement of mine was made eight times laughter because i was watching his changes of mind  laughter hooting applause  this is his last statement i hope he does not change any longer applause  he has declared he wills to do what must be done to ensure that the elections in nineteen ninety-eight be peaceful and honest come june nineteen ninety-eight he will turn over power peacefully to his elected successor  that is why the church is involved in this because if the election is not clean and we touched the basic laws of our constitution there will be animosity in our country and the bishops would not like this to happen therefore we are trying to solve the problems of the country  in the meantime as our president he will provide the leadership necessary to help this nation face the manifold problems which confront it today through our new-found unity and only through our new-found unity he will not be a lame-duck president in thanksgiving we now pray for national reconciliation if in the heat of our passionate love for our country and for our democracy words have been exchanged which have caused undue personal hurt we humbly ask the lord and each affected person including the president for forgiveness applause  we have not campaigned in hate and have not wished to demonize any person but we have acted with burning concern for our freedom convinced that the enemy of humanity the enemy of truth and right is wont to tempt mislead delude and possess fellow human beings into his ends in profound injury of our humanity it is this enemy we have renounced and shall continue to denounce in our sacred duty as pastor let us pray first for our president  i am praying for him almost every day i do not even pray for my mother laughter  let us pray for him sincerely that he as president now feel our respect our love and gratitude for all he has done well for our nation as president we pray that as he now addresses the urgent problems of our suddenly downward economy restores the confidence of our people and friends in our political stability and economic vigor tackles the challenge of the forthcoming el ni&ntilde;o leads us towards clean and honest elections and continues to address the alleviation of poverty that he experience behind him the united strength and energy of the filipino people  several sentences in filipino interspersed with applause  we pray my sisters and brothers for each other that we all be helped to exercise power as christ did the night before he died got up from table removed his garments and taking a towel wrapped it around his waist then he poured water into a basin and began to wash the disciples' feet that was christ 's power let us pray for humility in our service strength in our weakness endurance in our vigilance against all that might harm our country and unity in the shared task we have ahead of us as we have today been willing to risk our lives for freedom and democracy should the common good demand us to sacrifice more of our time our treasure our personal energy or even our lives to preserve the just order and serve the common good we pray and pray intensely that we not be found wanting ... your excellency vice-president gloria macapagal-arroyo mrs corazon aquino former president fidel ramos the members of the clergy the religious sisters the honorable government officials the ever vigilant people 's organizations lab labor leaders my dear brothers and sisters in christ let me begin by expressing my personal gratitude for the recognition given to the filipino people as one of the five freedom awardees of the edsa people power commission former president ramos congressman butz aquino and i received the award on behalf of the filipino people on behalf how beautiful is that phrase my life has always been lived on behalf of i am only here on behalf of the flock entrusted to me by the good shepherd jesus christ i am only here on behalf of you my beloved countrymen because i am your brother and shepherd today i renew my pledge to pray on your behalf so that you and your children 's children may continue to enjoy the blessings we gained in nineteen eighty-six we have all grown in age since nineteen eighty-six some have lost hair or some teeth my knees and my voice are no longer as strong fourteen years ago even if my knees and voice fail i promise never to fail you in fighting for freedom and speaking for justice and truth i 'll be your pastor fighting for freedom to the en last breath of my life up to the last drop of my blood up to the last twinge  of energy in my body applause  our strength is from the lord christ is our peace remembering edsa in the year of jubilee that is what we are asked to do here this afternoon fourteen years have gone by since the hundreds of thousands filled the streets around us how quickly time has gone by how do we remember edsa this year let us and let me reflect on the year of jubilee and draw a few lines from it into our present moment the book of leviticus has described a full jubilee year in these terms during this year of the lord 's favor all fields lie fallow  family members have the right to freedom to freedom family land to redeem family land that had been sold when the family was in dire need all debts are remitted all slaves are set free  the jubilee year calls for a redirection of priorities in favor of the poor christian churches and other bible-based groups have drawn up the agenda for this year summarized for us in the five rs return of the land and other means of production to their original or rightful owners recall of debts unjustly imposed on the poor the release of prisoners those of course who no longer pose a genuine threat to society release too of all those in contemporary sla slave-like conditions rest for the earth and conservation of the natural environment and the restoration of harmony among women and men best in their  rep respective roles rights and equal dignity as pope john paul the second has told us the overall meaning of the jubilee year was to call on the entire community to bring back the original harmony which god gave to his creation a harmony which human sinfulness human greed human blindness had damaged the jubilee year reminds us that we are merely stewards of god 's planning the one world the one single haven we share is not ours it is a gift of god 's love so during the jubilee year we must lift the burdens we have placed on the backs of the poor the oppressed the excluded the weakest and most powerf powerless members of society the jubilee year is meant to be a year of fostering hope so that everyone can share the hope of a new beginning of harmony within humanity and with all of creation a new hope that the grand design of god is still possible of fulfillment within history edsa nineteen eighty-six was in fact a jubilee experience it was a freeing of a nation long shackled by the ruinous dictatorship it was setting the downtrodden free it was giving broken ones new hope the blind new sight it was resurrection for the poor who had been abused tortured salvaged raped plundered slain it was truly good news to the poor it was god answering our prayers our pleas our cries and our tears no one who was here for the jubilation of the night of february twenty-fifth will ever forget the lord has restored our land to us as he had promised we need that experience of jubilee again edsa should not be reduced to an event in history when a people toppled a dictator it is rather a story of one entire nation winning the pursuit of peace through peaceful means edsa gave us hope unfortunately when we the so-called heroes of edsa were already in power we we sort of enjoyed the power and played blind to the abuses of the post-edsa years edsa changed the personalities in nineteen eighty-six but this corrupt system did not change when the victims of the dictatorship took on positions of power in government we started to keep quiet in the face of abuses because we were now the beneficiaries of the political favors the poor of nineteen eighty-six are still poor  natapos na kayo kami naman  it makes us and it makes me very sad to say this but humbly we accept that it is true edsa is about change but not simply a change of persons but a change within each person so that society can change we do not want remembering edsa this year to be an empty ceremony just show and speak the jubilee year reminds us that god 's plan for human society calls for us to try to construct here in our country some true anticipation of the world of freedom and justice solidarity and peace which is god 's kingdom for us at bottom that is what edsa was about that is what edsa must be about now to us all jesus addresses his mission statement to bring good news to the poor in an extraordinary way in this year of jubilee our present government was elected on the strength of that promise it would work for the poor let the resolve we bring home thus this edsa assembly this year

Philippines	 the presiding officer calls on the speaker mr chief justice your honors twenty-nine months ago president joseph ejercito estrada right hand raised left hand in the bible took an oath the sacred vow before god and country i do solemnly swear that i will faithfully and conscientiously fulfill my duties as president of the philippines preserve and defend its constitution and consecrate myself to the service of the nation so help me god  your honors joseph ejercito estrada willfully cons consciously and maliciously violated that sacred oath by his acts of committing bribery graft and corruption in all its forms betrayed public trust and culpably violated the constitution i have been assigned together with congressman oscar rodriguez to prove that respondent president joseph ejercito estrada betrayed public trust today mr chief justice distinguished judges in this impeachment tribunal we write history  last november twenty-eight when this august body made a resounding denial of the defense motion to quash a significant page in history was written expectations and hopes of our people were raised to the skies but it is in this trial where we will write whether or not in a thousand years the senate will have its finest hour during these historic eventful days the senate will have the singular privilege never tested in our nation 's history which hopefully future generations of filipinos will read with pride that during the eleventh congress the senate in fulfillment of const constitutional duty rose to the occasion and guided only by duty and conscience and the truth left partisan loyalties behind in the side against the president your honors permit me to say that none of us in this hallowed hall relish the task before us but we did not choose to be involved in such reckless and word misconduct as president joseph ejercito estrada is accused it is thus a duty be it painful one that i speak to your honors to find judgment against the president indeed the impact to the constitution must be felt that if the president commits any or all of the cited charges against him the constitution and our people must be served hence we are today to do our respective duties we to present the case against the president and you to rule under your best lights  your honors by voting these articles of impeachment the house of representatives is not attempting to raise the standard of ethical conduct to perfection for our political leadership nay for all of us such person does not walk the earth today even after jesus christ redeemed mankind from original sin everyone can sin but when the constitution provided for impeachment as a mode of removal of the president it is our bounden duty to prove the president guilty and your honors to uphold that guilt as evidence will show indeed the impeachment since the days of the english kings and ministers has been called the most powerful weapon in the political armory short of civil war it played a continuing role in the struggles between king and parliament that resulted in the formation of the unwritten english constitution in this respect impeachment was one of the tools used by the english parliament to create more responsive and responsible government and to redress imbalances when these occur in our jurisdiction we borrowed from the u s constitution with some minor modifications are impeachment grounds  in the u s the framers sought to create a responsible though strong executive they hoped in the words of ellwoods gerry of massachusetts that the maxim would never be adopted that the chief executive could never be wrong no man is above the law and no man is below it nor do we ask any man 's permission when we require him to bring it obedience to to the law is demanded thus the maxim ignorance alleges non facit excusam  in the case at bar the president took a solemn oath before god and country to uphold the law and preserve and defend the constitution section one article eleven of the constitution states that public office is a public trust public officers and employees must at all times be accountable to the people serve them with utmost responsibility integrity loyalty and efficiency act with patriotism and justice and lead modest lives in many decisions of the supreme court it has been ruled that any government office is a trust for it is created for the sole purpose of effecting the end for which government has been instituted which is for the common good and not for the profit honor or private interest of any man family or class of being kin  jurisprudence adds that a public official employed therefore occupies a very delicate position which exacts from him certain standards which are not demanded from or required of ordinary citizens he 's truly the servant of the people and as such he is enjoined to serve his office with the highest degree of responsibility integrity loyalty and efficiency and at all times be accountable to the people mr chief justice your honors we will prove to you by competent credible and relevant evidence that president joseph ejercito estrada is guilty of betrayal of public trust  in fact words has opined that betrayal of public trust covers any violation of oath of office involving loss in popular support even if the violation will not amount to a punishable offense  its inclusion is more a reaction to past experience than an exercise in logic it was the consen consensus in the constitutional commission that culpable violation of the constitution as the main ground for impeachment would hardly prosper in congress even against an unpopular president this new ground betrayal of public trust serves to stress the desirableness of having a president who truly regards public office as a public trust how has president joseph ejercito estrada spent the fund of public trust who benefited and who was deprived your honors we ask you to decide this case on the bases of law and the evidence we ask you not to be swayed by the pomp and the power of the office or the political interests involved but to look at the evidence that will be presented and the magnitude of the betrayal in the public trust the violation is very clear the evidence overwhelming in fact consistent corroborated and more than substantial the defense constantly harps on the fact that the defendant is an elected public official or vox populi in vox dei   but mr senate mr chief justice your honors so did all the dictators of the world the voice of the people is the voice of god yes but that voice is also spoken in the constitution the constitution is the expression of the people 's sovereign will the constitution lays down the framework of government the powers of the president the different branches of government and the limitations thereto and what is important the principles of accountability mandate and accountability power and public trust what the people make and elect they can unmake and remove through impeachment in conviction for the elected legislators in the mechanism set forth in the constitution the constitution is supreme and the people 's voice sovereign mr chief justice your honors the procs the prosecution shall show that president joseph ejercito estrada has not cherished the public trust he squandered it for his benefit and for the benefit of his cronies and kin president joseph ejercito estrada has placed public interests private interests above the interests of the public in violation of that oath of office we will present overwhelming detailed and corroborated evidence that on september six nineteen ninety-nine president joseph ejercito estrada has ordered a quasi-judicial agency insulated by law from political pressure and influence not to perform its function in accordance with the law of its creation he issued the directive to the securities and exchange commission not to allow an independent department of that body to conduct investigations without the prior clearance of the commission en banc   for what ulterior purpose and for whose benefit this directive was issued was made apparent by subsequent events president joseph ejercito estrada 's crony businessman dante tan became owner of controlling stocks of a corporation called b w resources corporation at the time when the shares of stock in the said company was undergoing a price surge never before seen in the history of the philippine stock market on january nineteen ninety-nine the price of b w shares was about two pesos per share by october ten nineteen ninety-nine the price surged to a high one hundred seven pesos per share when dante tan first bought b w shares in nineteen ninety-eight its price was only eighty centavos per share b w shares rose from the sixteenth most heavily traded stock in the philippine stock exchange in january nineteen ninety-nine to the number one among the top twenty companies by june with a total value turnover of seven billion one hundred thirty-nine million nine hundred seventy-two thousand one hundred seventy-five pesos later the philippine stock exchange would report that dante tan earned a profit of some eight hundred twenty million pesos during the period from january to may nineteen ninety-nine alone the total value turnover of b w shares in october was twenty-one billion six hundred ninety million one hundred seventy-five thousand and seven hundred twenty-five pesos record that will never likely be surpassed decades into the future after october ten nineteen ninety-nine the prices of b w shares underwent an abrupt and ignominious fall last one week from october ten b w shares had plunged to as low as twenty-two pesos per share and now very much lower these dramatic events pertaining to trading of b w shares in the philippine stock exchange alarmed responsible officials of that body as well as the securities and exchange commission which oversees the former both bodies undertook their investigations which necessarily inquired on whether the meteoric rise and sudden fall in the prices of the shares was a natural occurrence dictated by market forces or was the result of illegal schemes or manipulation while these investigations were being carried out by these agencies and in relation to the very subject of such investigation president joseph ejercito estrada made several questionable phone calls to the heads of both agencies and made representations in favor of his crony dante tan through less than subtle suggestions the president applied pressure on the chiefs of the p s e and the sec to shield mr dante tan from any unfavorable findings that these agencies may come up with the president would constantly remind his officers that mr dante tan was a friend is my friend the president clearly interfered with the discharge of the duties of these officials by suggesting by ordering that mr dante tan be exonerated even as the investigations had yet to be finished we have evidence to show your honors that the president ordered the president of the stock exchange that before the report of each investigation would be submitted to the board of governors the same should first be submitted to him and we have proof to show that indeed the president of the stock exchange and the head of the investigating agency were called to malaca&ntilde;ang to present the advance report of that investigation when the investigations were concluded the reports had one clear conclusion all evidence that the p s e and sec gathered had pointed to the culpability of mr dante tan for price manipulation and insider trading president joseph ejercito estrada said dante tan was a victim the evidence said dante tan was the culprit the investigators found that illegal transactions involving dante tan were committed not once not twice not thrice but hundreds and thousands of times in myriad forms and ways it is in the interest of the public to bring dante tan to court and make him face the rigors of trial the president showed interest in dante tan 's immediate exoneration and obstructed the course of justice why  did he have as evidence seems to suggest more than friendship with mr dante tan but has pecuniary interests in b w shares which went beyond mere cronyism the prosecution will show that the president 's interference did impair the course of justice despite the fact that the evidence against dante tan surfaced in the report it would be noted that both the p s e and the sec reports were partially incomplete in the sense that the reports didn't cover all individuals and persons who had been involved in illegal transactions or benefited therefrom the president 's obstruction of justice prospered because he succeeded in cutting short the investigations in striking fear in sec and p s e officials he succeeded in confining the reports to incomplete results he succeeded in having possible damning evidence against the president mistress guia gomez his favorite son j v ejercito and his other friends and relatives obstructed the denials of officials willing under the awesome demonstration of coercive power weighed at a time when the president appeared omnipotent hardly qualifies as evidence of lack of pressure mr chief justice and honorable judges it must be remembered that many traders in the stock market are small businessmen and ordinary people in a country where majority of the people live in abject poverty while a small middle class struggle to survive allowing the few to amass billions of pesos in profits through manipulat manipulative schemes further widens the disparities the few rich and the many poor and the middle class 1 word  the facts we will prove before your honors pertaining to president joseph estrada 's interference in the affairs of the stock market do not even come close to the gravity and extent of the issues being raised by the workers and peasants and the protesters outside these halls price manipulations and insider trading fraud seem sophisticated and technical when compared with joblessness hunger and displacement from farmlands all concrete symptoms of a deep crisis that the president exacerbates by staying in office and imposing himself upon a people who has withdrawn confidence in his administration and policies and what is worst your honors there now appears substantive proof that respondent president joseph ejercito estrada did not only pressure the sec and the p s e to clear his crony dante tan but violated his own memorandum to government financial institutions not to approve or release loan applications in excess of fifty million without his without his prior imprimatur  but in what appears like a manifest behest loan of six hundred million pesos p n b then government-controlled granted b w resource this ho huge six hundred million loan on collaterals of almost now practically valueless b w shares in a tagaytay property said to be valued at not for a few millions of pesos
Philippines	may it please the honorable chief justice and the honorable members of the impeachment tribunal i will take only five minutes or so simply to draw attention to certain legal propositions which i take to be relevant to the controversy at bar and certain political dimensions attending the same and i will do this by way of laying the predicate for the presentation in chief of former solicitor-general mendoza my esteemed colleague many of us here present will doubtless recall the story of a man of ancient rome named julius caesar whom the masses admired and wanted to be the head of their nation he was assassinated by a group of plotters who considered him unfit to rule those plotters by spreading rumor and gossip had poisoned the minds of the people against him they said julius caesar was ambitious avaricious corrupt and they enlisted the aid of well-meaning citizens like the noble-minded brutus who was deluded into believing the sly insinuations of the plotters and had thus come to think that caesar was indeed unfit to rule and so julius caesar was slain caesar 's friend mark antony having learned of the conspiracy and how easily the people had been made to believe the lies and innuendoes of the conspirators was moved to cry out as he mourned caesar 's death oh judgment thou art fled to brutish beasts and men have lost their reason today two thousand years after that tragic event we take part in these impeachment proceedings to pass judgment on another leader joseph ejercito estrada a man also admired by his countrymen who had elected him by an overwhelming majority to the highest office of the land we are here to determine whether he should continue to lead the nation as its president but unlike in julius caesar 's case we are assured that in this forum judgment will not flee to brutish beasts and reason will not be lost but will attend every aspect and incident of these proceedings for in the many centuries that have passed from julius caesar 's time to ours principles and tenets have developed and come to be engraved in every enlightened society foremost among which is that the guilt or innocence of a person accused of some wrong shall be determined not by passion or prejudice nor hearsay or rumor but by such evidence as the universal experience of mankind accepts as satisfactory proof of facts presented in accordance with procedures that best conduce to full and free ventilation of a controversy and ultimately to a fair and honest judgment it is our good fortune that in the course of time and in the full fruition of human wisdom definite rules and standards for conducting trials and hearings as well as for determining all questions of evidence including questions of its materiality relevancy competency have been formulated and met with general acceptance in democratic states and that these specific norms have been adopted in our country it is our good fortune that this country of ours is governed by a constitution and a set of laws that guarantee to every person the fundamental right to due process and other inviolable human rights and otherwise command full commitment to the rule of law it is in light of these familiar norms and precepts which we are certain this honorable impeachment tribunal will uphold and apply that the respondent the president of the philippines now confidently faces his accusers by your leave and with many thanks for your kind attention i now ask my colleague atty estelito p mendoza to outline the case for the respondent  mr president my fellow senators prime minister indira gandhi of india once said you cannot shake hands with clenched fist  the issue of the v f a or the visiting forces agreement boils down to whether it is in our country 's interest to continue its good working relations with the united states on the matter of defense and security how each of us will cast our vote will send a clear signal whether or not we as a people have set aside and put behind us the emotions and hurt that were felt during the nineteen ninety-one military bases debates are we now ready with maturity objectivity to address our present and future security needs as a democratic society in partnership with another democratic society decision-making involves more than the inputs of the debates we have gone through though they have helped us gain viable knowledge from my experience and profound colleagues as elected officials seek the opinion of the people whom we respect and we serve more often the inclination of society would be a good basis to start the process decision-making requires a broader perspective that is why we had the plaza miranda during the nineteen fifties that is why we have the respected social weather stations surveys and other polling groups of our generation to enable us to listen to and appreciate social and political issues  vox populi vox dei  our democratic society dictates that the voice of our people the silent majority the average filipino the ordinary juan should serve as the light that would guide our path in arriving at a decision such as this a recent survey by the s w s gives us some enlightenment on the real sentiments of our fellow filipinos according to the survey conducted from march one to nineteen this year more than half or fifty percent fifty-six percent of the respondents strongly feel that the mutual defense treaty of nineteen fifty-one with the united states is still appropriate furthermore eighty percent of the pro-mutual defense treaty respondents approved of the visits of the american forces to the philippines for joint military exercises these statistics indicate that the v f a has gained more popular support since it became a vital national security issue in the light of recent regional security concerns our country has been host to a number of similar although low profile visits by armed forces personnel of other countries especially those of our asean friends we have not heard any objections to such visits but now that the president president estrada and his administration seek senate approval for such a simple request to strengthen our external defense we hear many oppositions we find nothing wrong with this as it is the democratic way and freedom of expression truly works well in our society the american society is not a stranger to us filipinos i do not wish to delve into the issue of how and why almost two point five million filipinos have migrated to north america during the greater part of this waning century nor should i again state that our country tops all other asian countries in the number of immigrants to the u s every year may i digress briefly to read into the record that in our own country in our trade and commerce that the philippines benefits from trade with the united states let me read into the record also that the u s is the  philippines' top export market in nineteen ninety-eight last year the u s bought thirty-four percent of the total philippine exports to the whole globe more than double what japan bought from us with japan 's share at fifteen percent or less than half for nineteen ninety-eight the philippine surplus with the u s totaled five point two billion dollars that 's the trade surplus that means in our favor that 's much higher than in nineteen ninety-seven surplus of three billion dollars this demonstrates that the philippines continues to be a very successful competitor in the world 's most competitive market and that is the united states the five point two billion dollars trade deficit the u s had with the philippines in nineteen ninety-eight is our thirteenth largest bilateral trade deficit up from sixteenth in nineteen ninety-seven by comparison the u s deficit with malaysia ranked number eight thailand number nine and indonesia number eleven the philippines ranks in fourteenth place as a supplier of u s imports ahead of hong kong indonesia brazil and all european countries except germany the united kingdom italy and france philippine exports to the u s are growing much faster than philippine exports to japan in nineteen ninety-eight philippine exports to the u s were up over sixteen percent compared to the same period in nineteen ninety-seven by contrast exports to japan from the philippines were up only three percent as against sixteen percent to the u s high tariffs in japan are barriers to important philippine exports such as fish and forest products let me also mr president read to the record of filipinos who have made a successful entry into u s politics of course among these we know that the nephew of our colleague here senator tito guingona michael guingona was mayor of daly city i think until last year i think michael guingona was born in the philippines grew up in the philippines and went to the u s and became mayor of daly city the  pinoy town in uh outside of san francisco then we had the governor benjamin cayetano of hawaii the state senator robert bunda state legislator of hawaii and then lorraine inouye state legislator of hawaii then we have the state representatives john amores he must be from zambales state legislator of werst west virginia david valderama of maryland vilma viloria of washington ron menor of hawaii and some others pete fajardo mayor of carlson city california henry manayan mayor milpitas california teresita santiago must be a niece of uh miriam defensor-santiago of delano california joventino fajardo glendale heights illinois and various city councilors i 'm mentioning these mr president because it shows you what kind of society the united states is it is a society of immigrants it allows even foreign-born but already u s citizens to run for public office and this doesn't happen here also mr president in terms of manufacturing in the philippines there is a report by the american chamber of commerce as of nineteen ninety-seven the multinational companies contributed one hundred sixty-four billion pesos to the philippine economy and had forty-five thousand three hundred eighty-four employees each with an average annual income of three hundred seventy thousand pesos now of course these are just words you can say but what is the problem of the country mr president it 's economic there are so many poor people in this country maybe that 's why people are going all over the place and just doing their demo because they have nothing better to do but we cannot hold that against them it 's part of democracy the bangko sentral ng pilipinas reported that u s based filipinos continue to remit annually the largest amount of dollars from overseas helping to prop up our gross national product to respectable levels in global trade as i mentioned earlier we continue to ship thirty-four percent of our exports to america our fellow filipinos have likewise found their place in the united states armed forces there are currently ten thousand filipinos in the armed forces of the united states and right here in our own country seven thousand filipino u s veterans have retired in their own old country in the field of higher education many of elec of our elected and appointed officials received their training in that country of many opportunities despite occasional strains and stresses mr president which after all are present in all basic relationships our two countries continue to manage good working relations with each other why then can't we keep a positive attitude and confidence in our own future why do we choose to nurture our imaginary fears and pessimisms let us give our officials in the executive department headed by our president and the cabinet the opportunity to protect and preserve the sovereignty of our people i know all of them will rise to this great challenge alliances and strategic partnerships are the way to go as we enter the new century countries that reject this policy will be the have-nots of the twenty-first century and finally mr president i vote strongly yes  for the approval of the v f a knowing that a strong regional alliance with other democratic countries anchored on interdependence will signal our firm determination to preserve peace and security in our region thank you  mabuhay ang ating bayan

applause  today i fulfill my constitutional mandate to address congress on the first day of its regular session by tradition i am to dwell on the state of the nation let me start with a sincere apology to all those who expected or wished to see me fail i 'm sorry to disappoint them applause  i am pleased to report that our nation is rising growing and strengthening this is in contrast to the situation i described to you last year and which i vowed to reverse several sentences in filipino  last year when i first addressed this august body our nation was in an economic crisis today we are out of it last year i told you that our aim was to help the country escape the recession we did it in nineteen ninety-eight most of our asian neighbors sank into recession in contrast our country managed a modest but positive growth of one-tenth of one percent in our gross national product however our gross domestic product dipped by one-half percent or points or zero point five during the year in the first quarter of this year our g n p abruptly surged upward by two percent and our g d p by one point two percent last year we were struggling to keep ourselves from sinking today we are sailing towards the high seas again it is time once more to pay tribute to a special class of filipinos our overseas workers they as a group kept our g n p growth at positive rates even during the worst of times they continue to be our economic saviors last year i expressed my hope of keeping inflation at a single-digit rate we did it in nineteen ninety-eight the inflation rate was at a full-year  av average of nine point seven percent it improved further to a six-month average of eight point four percent in the first half of nineteen ninety-nine in june alone inflation was down to five point eight percent inflation is a vicious enemy of the poor last year i said that without undermining the independence of the  bangko sentral ng pilipinas we would support the lowering of interest rates we did it in the past twelve-months period alone the benchmark ninety-one day treasury-bill rate dropped steeply from fourteen point nine percent on the first auction on july six nineteen ninety-eight to eight point four percent last monday this is its lowest level in more than twelve years bank lending rates have also dropped to pre-crisis levels last year i lamented the devaluation of the peso as imposing burdens on our people i inferred that we should strengthen our currency we did it at the beginning of nineteen ninety-eight the peso plunged to an all time low of forty-five pesos and forty-two centavos to one dollar at the beginning of my administration it was at forty-two pesos and four centavos since then the peso has strengthened dramatically it has stabilized within a range of thirty-seven to thirty-nine to the dollar this was achieved largely by leaving the market alone and the market responded with a show of confidence it sent billions of dollars of loans investments and exports orders to the philippines the bangko sentral intervened only occasionally to prevent wild swings and to forestall speculative attacks not to set the trends of or levels of the exchange rate last year i committed to more effective and efficient tax collection we did it despite the ravages of the asian crisis on tax collections total revenues amounted to four hundred sixty-two billion in nineteen ninety-eight of which tax revenues constituted four hundred sixteen billion or four billion pesos higher than in nineteen ninety-seven for the first ti for the first four months of nineteen ninety uh nine nineteen ninety-nine b i r collection reached one hundred twenty-six billion or three point two percent higher than in nineteen ninety-eight custom collections amounted to twenty-three point one billion pesos and non-tax revenue fourteen point one billion pesos this does not mean that we are happy with our tax re  rep effort we need to improve not only our collection performance but the tax structure itself and hence our existing tax laws last year we found the government in a deeper fiscal hole than the public had been made to believe we committed to reduce the government deficit this time we didn't do it it is not that we failed we deliberately shifted shifted course at a time when the economy was threatened by recession uh the administration has decided on a twenty-five percent across-the-board forced savings on the expenditures of the government this was like administering the medicine for high blood pressure to a patient with low blood pressure  lalong lulubha ang pasyente dahil baka mamatay nang di pa oras  that is why my favorite doctor the first lady always makes sure that my blood pressure is normal especially when i 'm reading the newspapers we scrapped the forced cutbacks and did exactly the opposite we not only ensured that public services would continue at adequate levels we also engaged in various pump-priming our aim was not to save but to spend this was to counteract the slowdown in private consumption and investment expenditures in other words to raise the country 's declining blood pressure rather than let it sink further our logic was simple a time of growth and threats of inflation calls for balanced budgets or surpluses to prevent further inflation but a time of recession and deflation calls for budget de  deficits to jump-start a recovery thus towards the end of nineteen ninety-eight we increased the budget deficit to fifty billion or one point eight percent of the g n p for the first time and for the first five months of nineteen ninety-nine we incurred as planned a deficit of forty-five point three billion pesos still within the nineteen ninety-nine program deficit of sixty-eight point four billion pesos or two point two percent of target g n p for the next two years we intend to reduce our deficit to one point one percent and zero point four percent of g n p and eventually attain a balanced budget in the year two thousand two and surpluses thereafter in other words i will not end my term with a deficit applause one problem we faced was how to finance the deficit borrowing locally would have raised interest rates at a time when we wanted them to go down borrowing abroad was too costly monetary expansion would have triggered inflation and a run on the peso foreign exchange controls were untenable raising taxes or cutting government expenditures would have led to a deep recession it seemed like there was no way out but we found one anyway substantial funds were located right under our noses the foreign currency deposit u units or f c d us so we borrowed from them on a short term basis at relatively low cost as a result we brought down interest rates we brought down the inflation rate and we strengthened the peso experts say these all cannot happen at the same time because they are inconsistent with one another but we did it and we emerged out of the regional crisis ahead of most our of our neighbors i narrate all these inside stories to make a point those who make a career and a business out of hitting me are saying that the improvement in the country 's economic performance was due to pure luck to good weather or to anything but erap the president 's nickname four sentences in filipino  our recovery was due to the innovative way we analyzed situations and made bold decisions our success was the result of effective governance it was a matter of having the right policies being supported by competent and dedicated cabinet members respecting the freedom of the market managing and budgeting our resource ces right and acting quickly before the danger grew out or the opportunity disappear as a prominent filipino economist dr ber bernardo villegas recently wrote and i quote the economic team of the present administration during its first year has been superior in cohesiveness effectiveness and clarity in purpose when compared to the equivalent teams during the first years of the previous administrations   with due respect to the president ramos i didn't say this  president estrada 's first economic team is among the best in asia  effective governance by a team-powered administration also explains the rapid recovery of the country 's international credit standing and i assure you that you know the definition of a banker he is a person who lends you his umbrella when it stops raining credit markets are even more jittery so when the global market gobbles up one point two billion worth of repub worth of the republic of the philippines global bonds for budget support from the first ca country to float such an issue after the asian crisis and when the market buys up the four hundred million dollars of bangko sentral bonds issued for reserve management purposes and when the eurobond flotation of the national government raises three hundred eighty-three million dollars obviously the world believes that in the philippines it has stopped raining we are getting a shower of umbrellas this is not to mention the billions of dollars of inflows in medium and long term loans from bilateral sources banks and financial institutions from the world bank and the asian development bank from japan 's export-import bank and overseas economic cooperation fund and from the monetary fund among others three sentences on lower unemployment figures in filipino interspersed with applause  in the meantime our exports are zooming up at double-digit rates our balance of current accounts are in surplus and our gross international reserves are at all-time high currently amounting to fourteen billion u s dollars with all these developments it is no wonder that in the space of only one year the other asian countries and indeed much of the world have come to recognize the presidency of the philippines as among the leaders of the region this is indeed a long way from the skepticism that greet  greeted this presidency when it began in apec in asean and in other regional international forums the current leadership of the philippines enjoys a high level of respect our international prestige is on the rise the dramatic rebound in the stock market is a strong indication of confidence and the people according to the latest surveys give the president a seventy-seven point six percent approval rating the heads of the i m f and the world bank also have a have had good words to say mr james wolfenson president of the world bank said and i quote  what is clear is the philippine situation is vastly different from korea thailand and indonesia  i think you all know you are weakened far less than anyone else in the region with the exception of singapore end of quote and mr michel camdessus managing director of the i m f said he considered the philippines as a model for countries in the asean region only last thursday the i m f executive board completed the fourth review under our standby arrangement this will now allow us to draw about two hundred fourteen million dollars which will further increase our gross international reserves the i m f executive directors also praised the bangko sentral headed by governor gabriel singson for the successful implementation of monetary policy through the turbulence of the past two years it is ironic that while foreign experts and the foreign press have good reviews of our performance and while investors pour money into our economy some quarters in our local media are undermining confidence in our country

excellencies of the diplomatic corps fellow workers in government honored guests minamahal kong mga kababayan  in march nineteen seventy-three six months after the declaration of martial law ninoy aquino was taken blindfolded from fort bonifacio and brought to a place he did not know  he was stripped naked and thrown into a cell his only human contact was a jailer the immediate prospect in such a place was a midnight execution in front of a grave dug by himself  the purpose was as clear as it was diabolical it was not to kill him yet but to break him first and with him break the compelling proof that men can stand up to a dictatorship he came close to giving up he told me he slipped in and out of despair but a power that must have been god held him together he remembered the words of the epistle god chose the weak to confound the strong  on the third anniversary of his incarceration in laur the recollection of his pain gave birth to a poem of hope this is the poem he wrote i am burning the candle of my life in the dark with no one to benefit from the light  the candle slowly melts away soon its wick will be burned out and the light is gone if someone will only gather the melted wax reshape it give it a new wick for another fleeting moment my candle can once again light the dark be of service one more time and then goodbye  this is the anguish of good men that the good they do will come to nothing that pains suffered in obscurity or sacrifices made away from the sight of men amount to the same and mock the man or woman who bears them mr senate president mr speaker members of the congress distinguished guests my countrymen that is not true  none of the good that we do is ever lost not even the light in an empty room is wasted from ninoy 's burnt-out candle and thousands like it in cells throughout the garrison state we gathered the melted wax and made more candles to burn not as long in such loneliness but much more brightly altogether as to banish the darkness and light us to a new day you might ask when will the president stop invoking ninoy 's name my answer is when the president stands here other than by ninoy 's grace and not while gratitude is nourished by memory not while we acknowledge that it was his sacrifice that gave us back our freedom and restored the freely elected office whose incumbent must stand every year in this place five years have passed my term is ending and so is yours as we came so should we go with grateful acknowledgment to the man who made it possible for us to be here a man who discovered hope in the starkest despair and has something yet to teach a country facing adversity again it would be foolish to ignore what is staring us in the face our march of progress brought us far but such misfortunes have come upon us as to make us feel that we are not much farther from where we started the eruption of mount pinatubo is the biggest in this century abroad its effect is so far-reaching as to lower the temperature of the earth at home it is so devastating it knocked off eighty thousand productive hectares from our agriculture and destroyed the commerce of at least three provinces hundreds of thousands were driven from their homes and livelihoods and thrown on the kindness of relatives and countrymen and on the solicitude of the state it was an event so powerful it wiped out the largest military base in the pacific and changed the nature of our relationship with an old ally in the wake of the volcanic eruption more has been revealed about that relationship than was covered by its ash  before pinatubo there was the typhoon that cut a wide swath of destruction across the southern regions and before that was the killer quake that cut off the northern parts of the country destroying billions of pesos in infrastructure causing the loss of billions more in foregone economic activities it leveled the city of pines and buried children in the rubble of yet another city but those natural calamities were preceded by another entirely the work of human hands the massive december nineteen eighty-nine military revolt that cut short a second economic recovery after the dislocation caused by the earlier august nineteen eighty-seven coup attempt that one strangled the powerful rebound of the philippine economy after the edsa revolution  i mention these calamities not to excuse the perceived shortcomings of my administration nor to brag about my indestructibility i mention them so that we know where we are and why we are here and the exact requirements of the task to build up this country yet again i mention them because i will compare them with what we had and lost and then i will ask was it all in vain and i will answer it was not no more than a hero 's life is wasted  by nineteen eighty-five the economy had contracted considerably its rate of growth had been negative for two consecutive years the country was at a standstill as if waiting only for the last rites to be performed by nineteen eighty-six we had turned the economy around in less than a year we improved on that performance the year after the rate of unemployment was reduced the volume of new investments significantly increased new industrial projects were introduced  hitherto idle industrial capacity was fully utilized the foundation of new regional industrial zones was laid public infrastructure and services strained under the load of expanding economic activity  i mention this not to offset the shortcomings of the present with the achievements of the past i mention it to show what can be done in such a short time and how much improvement was made from conditions far worse than what we have today the dictator 's apologies notwithstanding that the country is worse off now than when he and his wife were stealing the country blind this progress was cut off by the august eighty-seven coup attempt but the economy quickly rallied and in two years recovered a great deal of the ground we had lost we were on the verge of a second take-off when the december nineteen eighty-nine coup broke out it drained the last drop of confidence in our future from all but the hardiest spirits and shattered our image abroad  still we persevered achieving gains that admittedly continue to fall short of the galloping needs of a fast growing population but real gains nonetheless improved health care increased housing and one of the proudest achievements we share with the legislature free secondary education six hundred sixty-thousand youth immediately availed themselves of it another two hundred thousand private school students received scholarship grants under another recent law eighty thousand new classrooms have been built the first preparation of the nation for the future of economic competition which will take place in the highly educated minds of the youth we have made the first serious effort to arrest environmental degradation already so far advanced in the previous regime that it set up an agency that did nothing about it anyway we have pushed agrarian reform beyond the point of no return almost completing its coverage of rice and corn its extension to other agricultural activities is proceeding at a pace consistent with our resolve to achieve for the farmer the prosperity promised by agrarian reform and not just its bare legal implementation indeed we started to make up our losses and kept on going through the gulf crisis which doubled the price of energy and introduced the element of a tremendous uncertainty not only about our economy but that of the world as well you might ask having lost so much so easily what was the worth of all that effort with such reversals of fortune is progress for our country a hope in vain paul says that suffering produces perseverance perseverance character and character hope the good we do is never lost some of it remains if not in material goods then in a deeper experience a more practiced hand and a spirit made stronger by that which failed to break it stronger to meet greater challenges ahead but in one thing we grew from strength to strength in the enlargement of our democratic space and the strengthening of our democracy every calamity tested the capacity of democracy to absorb distress find relief and meet the absolute necessities of the people without the least curtailment of freedom or compromise of rights against our economic gains that are ever hostages to fortune stands one steadfast unalloyed achievement our democracy destined i believe to outlive our problems and deck with the graces of liberty the material progress of our future that achievement is better seen from the disinterested distance of foreign admirers than from the myopic view of those at home who wish to destroy it applause  it is an achievement entirely in our power to preserve and enhance visitors from the new germany asked me what things strengthen democracy economic progress naturally i said but the attainment of that depends on external factors more than on the will of a developing country but there is a way to strengthen democracy that is within any country 's reach that is through the empowerment of the people this is obvious to a government like ours that came to power by its means as well as to a people like the germans who attained complete freedom in the same way but empowering the people means more than just giving them elections every three years it means enlarging their contact with government beyond elections to its daily workings so that the vast resources of one support the initiatives of the other and the policies of government are refined by the insights of the people  translation of previous sentence in filipino ngunit ang pagkaloob ng kapangyarihan sa mamamayan ay nangangahulugan hindi lamang ng pagdaraos ng halalan tuwing ikatlong taon  kailangang pagyamanin ang kanilang pagkakadiit sa pamahalaan sa araw-araw na gawain ng pamahalaan upang ang malawak na kayamanan ng isa ay makatulong sa mga pagkukusa ng kabila at ang mga patakaran ng pamahalaan ay paglinangin ng mga mamamayan  by these means the lives of the people shall be constantly improved and the people themselves empowered by the habit of directing their own government the constant revision of flawed policies and the wider application of good ones are possible only by bringing together the people and the government people empowerment through people 's organizations n g os foundations and cooperatives is the surest means we know to make government mirror the aspirations of the people applause  in the past the idea was to give the people just enough power to elect their mistakes and suffer the consequences until the next elections elections were a safety valve we want elections to be just one of other more effective means to bring the people into government and government to the people to make it truly a participatory democracy this is the only way to end the character of total war that elections have assumed where the aim is the division of spoils and the victims are not just the losers but those who voted for them too such elections are like russian roulette where your chances are five to one your life will not improve and one to five you will blow out your brains participatory democracy will end the practice of punishing provinces and municipalities for the wrong vote in the last poll it will separate elections where the people vote for their favorites from the provision of public service which every filipino has a right to expect from the government regardless how he voted  this administration has made large steps in that direction to the disappointment of those who marched with me against the marcos regime my administration has plowed resources into regions and provinces where i was cheated in the snap elections the politics of revenge has had its day the organized applause the organized participation of the people in daily government may provide the stabilizing element that government has always lacked  policies have radically changed with each administration yet the basic needs of its unchanging constituencies have not been met  less bureaucracy for business more public services and infrastructure support for agriculture and industry an economic safety net for the common man  the active participation of the people in government will lend proper direction and continuity to policy  this is what i wish for most that after me the continuity of our work is not broken so that things well-done shall be completed and the same mistakes avoided
Philippines	 beginning of the speaker 's speech was delivered in filipino beloved countrymen and countrywomen our dear friends this commemoration carries greater significance than those of earlier years and over the next three hundred sixty-five days we shall focus our attention on preparing for the celebration of our first centennial of independence our choice of the theme for this year 's commemoration is most fitting diwang pilipino isaisip isapuso isagawa  for truly this is the time when we filipinos in thought in heart and in action must relive the national spirit that made us free  let us all take encouragement as we embark on this year-long undertaking our nation is secure our nation is stable and our nation is competitive  for five long years we have given our best to the challenges before us in order this time for our hearts and minds our 1 word  and energies have been collectively directed toward the singular objective of raising our nation from the pits of crises and stagnation to the threshold of sustained progress and we have not been denied our country is at peace not only with other nations but within our own national community which once was fragmented by rebellion and insurgency our democracy is stable with our constitution fully reigning over our national life and our democratic institutions fully functioning  our social reforms to guarantee the the delivery of our people 's basic needs are being implemented and our economy is growing achieving a level of productivity unprecedented in our history in all our recent labors and struggles one thing above all has stood out and that is the fact that working together and with democracy as our standard we filipinos can move our nation forward  we will not be where we are today but for the faith and spirit that since june twelve eighteen ninety-eight has fortified us in trials and crises that sometimes seem overwhelming that faith and spirit first found its voice in dr jose rizal who gave his life on these grounds for believing that filipinos could be a nation in their own right that faith or spirit was forged on the anvil of revolution by andres bonifacio whose centennial we mark this year and that faith and spirit proclaimed itself to the world in kawit cavite ninety-nine years ago when president emilio aguinaldo raised the flag of our republic around these great events and personages at the turn of the nineteenth century the story of our people before and since has always turned our independence proclamation in eighteen ninety-eight crowned our people 's unceasing struggle since the time of lapu-lapu and soliman to be free and sovereign in our own land and it claimed for all filipino generations since the challenge of building recovering defending and strengthening the filipino nation in the web of history all our struggles aspirations and achievements as a people come together and they lay claim to our memories as we prepare to mark our first centennial as a republic and approach a new century of challenge let us therefore gather our energies together to ensure the successful commemoration of our first centennial it demands the collective participation of all our people every group every sector every community every creed every family and every citizen who constitute our nation  thank you mr president mr president distinguished ladies and gentlemen of the senate my countrymen mr president uh almost eight years ago i stood before this august chamber armed with all the courage and fervor i could summon and boldly shouted no a thousand no to the extension of the united states military bases in the philippines the crucial issue at that time was whether to terminate the presence of american military basing facilities in the country or not today mr president once again we are confronted with yet another vital issue of similar import and that is whether or not the senate should give its concurrence to the visiting forces agreement and this time mr president i rise in this great and important forum of our people to proclaim before the entire nation yes a thousand yes to the visiting forces agreement between our country and the united states of america mr president i realize the seeming contradiction between my position now and my position then in nineteen ninety-one out of personal conviction i completely aligned myself with those who opposed the extension of american military presence in the country i was totally convinced and committed to vote against it as i finally did and i gave you my assurance mr president that if any attempt should be made to revive the presence of foreign military bases in the country i would be the first to firmly stand again amongst those who would oppose such a venture with the same passion and conviction today however i 've aligned myself with those who are supporting the approval of the visiting forces agreement which will in effect allow again the entry of american troops in the country and like before i am as equally convinced and committed to vote in favor of our concurrence as i do now because of this mr president i deem it my duty to give a candid explanation to our people who gave me the mandate the honor and the privilege to serve them in this chamber i owe it to them most especially and to history as well to re  render a clear and faithful account of why i have taken such seemingly diametrically opposing positions on so important and critical national issues of our time as the total removal of american forces from the philippines on the one hand and our concurrence to the on the visiting forces agreement on the other but let me digress briefly at this juncture mr president and relate to you the general impression i gathered during several hearings and deliberations on the mis measure under consideration although our proceedings were conducted under an atmosphere of guarded civility the discussions were in many instances marred by some degree of asperity and animosity there were if you will still recall angry diatribes and outbursts in and out of the areas where we held our hearings even our recent debates in this hall were not spared in addition the arguments of those who appeared to offer their opposition and pardon me for saying this were boringly and tiresomely repetitious and highly emotional and if i may add garnished with a generous proportion of bias and prejudice what struck me most as significant however mr president was the sectoral composition and arguments of those who appear to oppose the visiting forces agreement they were in many respects identical to the sectoral composition and arguments of those who previously stood against the extension of the united states military bases in fact i got the impression that there was hardly anything new that was added under the sun it was to me no more than a deja vu of nineteen ninety-one the same banners the same streamers the same propaganda tactics the same stereotyped speeches the same anti-american slogans the same anti-imperialism 1 word the same invectives the same clenched fists were all too evident to be seen and heard and so since the similarity of the opposition in both cases was quite obvious mr president i deemed it worthless to further dwell on that and so i will therefore simply confine my narration to the arguments presented by the two sides of the debate in nineteen ninety-one to show how closely alike they were to the arguments now being heard in connection with the visiting forces agreement you will recall mr president that the anti-american bases groups argued then that never again should foreign military bases troops or facilities be allowed in our country that our national sovereignty and self-respect required no less than the total dismantling and removal of all vestiges of our colonial past that the existence in our land of american military bases and their component troops and facilities would unnecessarily involve us in international conflicts that were not of our own making or liking that such military bases troops and facilities were really not meant to promote our national security but were intended instead to advance the defense strategy and economic power of the united states of america and that they would serve more as a potent magnet for offensive military action that would endanger the safety of our country and possibly expose our people to a very grave risk if not actual disaster and ruin and that instead of casting aside the historic opportunity presented to us at that time to be truly independent and self-reliant republic we should seize and use it to attain our complete freedom so that we could shape our own future and chart our own foreign policy unencumbered by any demeaning burden on our dignity and honor as a nation you will also recall mr president on the other hand that the advocates of continued american military presence in the in our country especially in clark and subic insisted that american military bases troops and facilities were good for our country that we really needed them for our defense and security that their presence would enhance the prestige of our country and would moreover preserve and provide jobs for our countrymen that they would assure the rapid development and improvement of our military capability that they would effectively maintain the balance of power in the southeast asian region and that they would serve as a strong and dependable deterrent against any predatory nation that might have any ill-conceived design to harm us you will perhaps recall remember too mr president that in nineteen ninety-one i was the lone fiscalizer in the senate against the administration of then president corazon c aquino and at the same time the minority floor leader of this chamber and because of my unique role then as the only remaining elected opposition senator of the republic and because especially of my intimate knowledge and assessment of our national condition at that time i unconditionally and without any hesitation supported the total removal of all american bases from the country i also fully concurred with the anti-american bases groups then that those military bases established in nineteen forty-seven initially and primarily to serve the united states' interests and to project her military power abroad they were not at all intended for or involved in the security of the philippines in fact the united states according to the common understanding at that time had no obligation whatsoever under the military bases agreement to defend us against any foreign military invader except when her own military bases were themselves the object of attack it was only later on that those military bases were somehow linked to our national security because of the mutual defense treaty concluded in nineteen fifty-one which forged and established our defense alliance with the united states of america and those military bases were conveniently used by the united states in fulfilling her obligation to us under the mutual defense treaty in legal norm therefore those military bases had nothing to do in creating the military alliance between the two countries today mr president in voting as i do now in favor of our concurrence to the visiting forces agreement i am more persuaded and impelled now than i was in nineteen ninety-one by the same consideration of national security for the country perhaps because of my pol because my political role has changed from what it had been in nineteen ninety-one since i 'm now a member of the ruling coalition in this chamber there is reason to think that i will simply follow the dictates of the ruling majority and vote in favor of our concurrence for no other consideration and reason than pure political expediency mr president that i will never do if i were to simply vote in favor of this important measure on the basis of a mere of mere political alignment that to me would be tantamount to a betrayal of my sworn obligation as an elected senator of the republic having been one of the so-called magnificent twelve  that voted in nineteen ninety-one for the removal of american military bases i cannot and will not just disregard or sweep aside the collective best interests of this nation neither will i allow myself mr president to be swayed by the almost irresistible appeal of esteemed friends and professional colleagues nor to be intimidated frightened or pressured by the strident clamor the blandishment and arrogant threats of noisy boisterous groups that stand opposed to the visiting forces agreement no matter how popular their position or how serious their threats may be without carefully scrutinizing the material and relevant national interest involved of course mr president as a human being if i were principally moved by a purely selfish motive if i were only concerned with my own political interest or personal well-being that would have been the most facile  the most logical the most rewarding and the safest course of action for me to have taken but then again had i done that had i acted otherwise than to determine carefully for myself the most sensible and advantageous course of action the country should follow in the wake of her present circumstance it would have been a faithless discharge of my duty as a senator 
Philippines	mr president there are perhaps as many ways to look at the v f a as there are observers and critics and there are equally numerous issues that can be brought and discussed in order to form an opinion either favoring or rejecting this agreement there will be no end to the debates but by the end of the day we need to make a choice and as is true on any other issue we need to decide no matter how difficult the choices may be and act in accordance with our conscience and what we believe is to our national interest mr president no one i repeat no one has a monopoly of patriotism i cast my vote in favor of the visiting forces agreement ratification in the senate i do so with much confidence and optimism that the greatest interests of the filipino people shall have been served when this treaty finally comes into force my vote favoring the ratification of the v f a is anchored on two fundamental concerns one the need to strengthen our defense capability and two the legal and constitutional issues which if adequately understood by everyone would expose and erase the false fears peddled about by the v  about the v f a by its opponents mr president to begin with the v f a merely operationalizes previous agreements forged between the philippines and the united states under the mutual defense treaty under article two of the mutual defense treaty both parties had agreed to separately and jointly by self-help and mutual aid maintain and develop their individual and collective capacity to resist armed attack but these being short on the de on the details of how to go about developing such capacity to resist armed attack article three of the same treaty broadly mandates the foreign ministers of both parties or their deputies to consult from time to time regarding the treaty 's implementation mr president there is a diversity of possibilities that are heavily hinged on the v f a 's ratification or rejection not the least of which is the promotion and preservation of the country 's economic security this stems from the fact that the bulk of the philippines'  trade and economic ties with other countries is carried out in the vast expanse of the south china sea for instance mr president data reveal that about forty percent of our exports which are shipped to the different parts of asia is almost wholly transported through the south china sea and surrounding seas another twenty-five percent of our exports to europe is likewise shipped through routes along or traversing this sea on top of that more than ninety percent of our oil supply from major trading partners is also transported through the south china sea trade in this region and beyond may even be expected to expand on account of globalization and the increasing economic interdependence of nations yet the threats to regional security and stability remain mr president the still-unsettled question of sovereignty overs over the spratlys for instance is continually seen as a potential flashpoint of conflict it has to be emphasized that despite the growing importance of the south china sea to us there appears to be no way or no means for us to actually defend or enforce our interest therein no less than our own defense department has admitted the painful if not so surprising fact that our country is militarily weak and extremely vulnerable to the external threats and that it neither has the mean it neither has to the means nor it neither has the means nor the influence to deter those who would take our patrimony and cut away our sovereignty in front of our very eyes mr president it will not be often that an opportunity to strengthen our capability to enforce our common interest with the united states will present itself the v f a is one such opportunity we cannot afford to miss for without the visiting forces agreement any thought of arming ourselves in defense of our interests or to deter aggression will be meaningless on the other hand through the visiting forces agreement we shall have the practical means to one improve the capability of our armed forces two strengthen our national defense strategy three stren strengthen regional stability and our relations with the united states in all important dimensions security trade foreign policy environmental protection and resource preservation having thus said let me just enter into the records my position on the various contin contentious issues raised by those opposing the visiting forces agreement particularly the constitutional and legal points my vote in favor of the visiting forces agreement carries with it the submission that there are no constitutional or legal infirmities one the v f a need not go through the ratification process under article eighteen section twenty-five of the constitution an examination of the records of the constitutional commission reveals that temporary placement of troops in philippine territory as that contemplated under the v f a need not go through the special procedural requirement under article eighteen section twenty-five clearly mr president the intent of the framers of our constitution is that the placement or stationing of such foreign forces and installation in the country must be made with some degree of permanency and let me quote the records of the constitutional convention volume four page seven hundred eighty-two to seven hundred eighty-three  long quotation  mr president this view is in fact supported by the opinion number thirty-four series of nineteen ninety-seven of the department of justice the opinion reads in part quote this department has consistently ruled that the aforementioned uh aforequoted e  constitutional provision disallows the establishment of foreign military bases and the facilities for stationing of foreign troops similar to the u s military presence in the philippines under the r p - u s military bases agreement of nineteen forty-seven as amended and that it prohibits the presence of alien military units in the country which is characterized by some degree of permanency and magnitude unless the conditions set forth in the constitution are met additional quoted sentences  since the visiting forces agreement pertains to and provides only for brief and temporary visits of u s troops in the philippines the agreement may be thus ratified on the basis of article seven section twenty-one of the constitution which sets no treaty or international agreement shall be valid and effective unless concurred in by at least two-thirds of all the members of the senate under article six section twenty-one second mr president even if it be conceived that the v f a is within the ambit of article eighteen section twenty-five the agreement would still be constitutional and a binding agreement the premise of those who argue for the submission under article eighteen is that the v f a would be unconstitutional in the absence of advice and consent by the u s senate which they believe is not forthcoming in view of the united states government 's pronouncement to that effect thus there being no such ratification by the u s senate it is argued by the critics that the v f a cannot be considered as to have been duly recognized by the united states government mr president the argument carries with it the implication that our constitutional requirements be complied with by a sovereign equal this cannot be so mr president as articulated by two distwinguis distinguished members of the constitutional commission ratification may be effected in accordance with the laws of such other contracting state allow me to quote therefore the exchange between commissioners maombong and bernas found in volume four of the records of the constitutional commission page seven hundred eighty-two quoted exchange  clearly then mr president the recognition by the other contracting state shall be in accordance with its own constitutional or municipal laws this is necessarily so since under international law a state cannot impose its own municipal requirements on another state three on criminal jurisdiction i submit that the visiting forces agreement provisions governing criminal jurisdiction add nothing more to what the philippines already adheres to under generally accepted principles of international law which by explicit constitutional affirmation is made part of the law of the land the v f a provisions on criminal jurisdiction derogate philippine sovereignty no more than the country 's adherence to a host of other treaties and to the generally accepted principles of international law particularly on the aspect of sovereign immunity let me quote an authority on this point long quotation from a foreign author  mr president the grant of sovereign immunity is made more explicit in the case of foreign troops it has been ruled by our supreme court in the case of beyer versus tison g r number l dash two four two nine four may three nineteen seventy four long quotation  mr president nonetheless our supreme court was quick to add that such principle shall yield to treaty stipulations the v f a therefore mr president shall limit the applicability and extent of the doctrine by allowing exercise of jurisdiction by the philippines on certain offenses or class of offenses concededly there are certain types of offenses which the philippines by its own accord has agreed to a restriction to its sovereign right of jurisdiction under the doctrine of 1 or 2 words  limitation thus the v f a may have diminished philippine jurisdiction in some aspects however it cannot be said that the jurisdiction of the philippines has altogether disappeared as it is made to appear the only class of offenses which the philippines under the v f a has no jurisdiction are those relating to the security of the united states and those punishable solely under the laws of the united states in all other offenses the philippines has either exclusive primary or concurrent jurisdiction the fact that the philippines has jurisdiction in all offenses punishable under its laws negates the claim that the v f a grants immunity to u s personnel or accords them special or preferential treatment four it is a distortion to claim that the r p - u s v f a has provisions inferior to those appearing in similar agreements of the united states with other countries let me just cite the provision on waiver of jurisdiction as an example the u s agreements with japan south korea australia and nato uniformly provide that quote the authorities of the state having the primary right shall give sympathetic consideration to a request from the authorities of the other state for a waiver of its right in cases where the where that other state considers such a waiver to be of particular importance  close quote in diplomatic parlance mr president this sympathetic consideration clause calls for automatic waiver the r p negotiators thus resisted this language both parties settled instead on the following philippine authorities will waive their primary right to exercise jurisdiction in ca  except in cases of particular importance to the philippines end of quote we will note mr president that the broad formulation of the exception clause practically nullifies the mandatory meaning if any was intended that can be given to the use of the words will waive the u s er israeli agreement states quote israel will waive its primary right to exercise over a members of the force except in cases where the authorities of israel after special consideration determine that its interests acquire require the exercise of israeli jurisdiction  end of quote and with spain quote spanish authorities except in cases of particular importance to them will exercise their right to waive their primary ju jurisdiction upon the request of u s authorities  end of quote the language of the r p - u s v f a provision mr president on waiver of jurisdiction is for all purposes the same as that of spain and similar to that of israel in providing for a broad exceptional clause to the waiver of jurisdiction and these are better than the automatic waiver clause contained in the agreements with japan south korea australia and nato the u s agreements with egypt honduras and the netherlands also contain the phrase will waive except in cases of particular importance or exceptional importance  five it is argued that the v f a provisions on criminal jurisdiction is in usurpation usurpation of the judicial power to promulgate rules of court procedure particularly in allowing the united states military commander to have custody of the offending u s personnel pending investigation or trial before philippine authorities mr president the v f a does not provide for a different procedure for the custody and prosecution of u s military personnel before the philippine courts it does not mr president in any manner modify the existing rules of criminal procedure nor does it provide for a new procedure governing such subjects it is in fact consistent with and cognizant of the rules promulgated by the supreme court six the release of accused pending trial is not purely a judicial matter this issue has been raised in relation to the provision allowing custody by u s military commanders mr president the custody and detention of accused pending trial is a matter not within the exclusive domain of the judiciary particularly the supreme court the constitution and the rules of court provide quote all persons except those charged with offenses punishable by reclusion perpetua with evidence of 2 words shall before conviction be bailable by sufficient sureties or be released on recognizance as may be provided by law that is under article three section thirteen whenever allowed pursuant to law the rules of court provide or these rules the court may release a person in the custody in custody on his own recognizance or that of a responsible person clearly therefore mr president the release of the accused on recognizance is made pursuant to law and not under the rules of court alone it is submitted that the v f a provision allowing custody of u s military personnel accused in our jurisdiction to u s military authorities is constitutionally and legally allowed there can be no doubt that u s military authorities can qualify as the responsible person under whom the custody of the accused may be reposed.  1
Philippines	with the permission of uh the president i would like to uh explain my vote  mr president last monday i delivered the invocation on behalf of the senate and in that i asked the good lord through his son jesus christ to provide us the way mga daan at paraan para tayo ay makapaghusga ng v f a sa tama at sa ikaliligaya ng ating bayang pilipinas  mr president i begin by asking why not today the senate of the eleventh congress is being called upon to concur or not to concur in the ratification of the visiting forces agreement v f a between the united states and the republic of the philippines to be sure friends and foes of the v f a from the clergy to the ordinary citizen have given me counsel and advice i received letters telegrams and telephone calls from so many i wish to place on record mr president that i appreciate all these advice and views solicited and otherwise given as they were to assist me in evaluating the pros and cons of the v f a i cannot thank them enough for their concern but at the end of the day mr president the ball remains with me so to speak because the occasion calls for each of the senator to make a personal judgment consequently for those whose views and opinions i cannot accommodate for the reasons i would later on explain i wish to thank them again for enriching my perspectives i only hope that they will treat this matter as a case of clashing opposing opinions and not a repudiation of their position  walang personalan trabaho po lang ito  mr president the solemn occasion today is not only to decide the fate of the v f a but to do honor to the filipino people who put me here let me assure therefore one and all that my decision is based on what i personally believe in and what is best for the country and the filipinos the sponsors of the v f a have valiantly defended the provisions of the v f a against the legal political and moral assaults by those who in good faith oppose and or express reservation to the v f a they have replied with utmost sincerity and forthrightness to the many questions that have been raised they have rebutted with logic sometimes evasive and convoluted but most of the time rational and candid every argument raised against the v f a for sure there are various important concerns which my colleagues have articulated and raised sometimes with utmost passion and with great personal convictions concerns such as whether the v f a is a treaty or an international agreement or a mere executive agreement whether the applicable constitutional provision is section twenty-five article eighteen or section twenty-one article seven whether the v f a would violate the nuclear-free provision of section eight article two of the constitution whether americans will automatically come to the aid of the philippines if any of our claimed territory is subjected to armed attack by foreign forces whether more security and military assistance would be forthcoming whether more economic support and more u s investment would come to the philippines and finally whether the philippines has surrendered once again its criminal jurisdiction over offenses committed in the philippines by u s military personnels mr president i share all these concerns but some of these concerns cannot be resolved in this chamber with finality as they involve legal and constitutional issues in due time i 'm sure mr president the supreme court will be called upon to rule on the validity of these legal propositions after all as u s chief justice charles evans hughes observed and i quote we are under a constitution but the constitution is what the judges say it is unquote until the supreme court shall have ruled otherwise mr president i subscribe to the legal proposition that the v f a is an international agreement and that the applicable provision of the constitution is section twenty-one article eight article seven this view is not without legal basis since the other uh provision section twenty-five article eighteen obviously referred to the then-existing nineteen forty-seven military bases agreement between the united states and the philippines a state of fact that was not lost in the minds of the commissioners that drafted the nineteen eighty-seven constitution thus i read section twenty-five article eighteen as providing a constitutional guideline on the process of how the nineteen forty-seven military bases agreement were to be renewed as it turned out mr president this chamber terminated the m b a and correctly so if i may add see debates record of the constitutional commission page six hundred sixty-three i also believe that the v f a does not authorize any u s bases facility or troops to be permanently maintained in the philippines no legal gobbledygook or language engineering would justify such an interpretation of the provisions of the v f a i further believe mr president that the one-year deadline to terminate judicial proceedings against american personnel is more a challenge to improve our delivery of justice system in this country than a legal burden imposed by the v f a with respect to other concerns which are basically political social and economic in character whether for instance america will provide more military assistance whether more economic support and investment would come from america etcetera i firmly believe that this is a question of faith and trust faith that america will indeed deliver what it promises and trust that our national leaders will see to it that these promises are fulfilled mr president for me the most important aspect of the v f a is the question on jurisdiction over offenses committed by u s personnel against filipinos in our land the question has both legal and moral dimensions given our past experience when the military bases agreement was still extant it is on this issue that my position has been focused and which would determine my vote the v f a for sure contains both exclusive and concurrent jurisdiction over offenses committed by u s military personnel in the philippines with respect to exclusive jurisdiction the language is too clear and categorical to merit further comments suffice it to say mr president that exclusive jurisdiction over certain crimes committed by u s personnel goes in a way in favor of the philippines in certain cases and in favor of the u s in others here mr president the scale of justice to my view is evenly balanced additionally off-duty offenses regardless of the gravity that are committed by u s military personnel on liberty or on pass are without any doubt exclusively belong to philippine jurisdiction here happily both the u s and the philippines agree paragraph three subparagraph one point two joint report number forty-three of the committee on foreign relations and committee on national defense and security page nine it is however in the category of concurrent and primary jurisdiction that i have great reservations mr president there are two vital points that concerns me first is the exception to the primary jurisdiction of the philippines under three b two even though the philippines has primary jurisdiction the same may be lost if the offenses arise out of any act or omission done in the performance of official duty  once the military commander issue a duty certificate the same has the effect of automatically divesting philippine jurisdiction over the offenses committed by u s personnel in violation of philippine laws this obnoxious provision is found in the defunct military bases agreement and was the source of intense irritants between the philippines and the u s governments i hope to god that the philippine government has learned from the past and would now see to it that this provision is not abused by the u s military commanders one way mr president of preventing such abuse is to define the meaning of official duty which incidentally is not defined in the v f a this representation mr president will recall offered and the sponsors accepted the following definition of official duty  and i quote the term official duty is understood to be any duty or service required or authorized to be done by statute regulation the order of a superior or military usage  official duty is not meant and i would like to emphasize is not meant to include all acts by an individual during the period during which he is on duty but is meant to apply only to acts which are required or authorized to be done as a function of that duty which the individual is performing  thus in the joint report happily the sponsor correctly stated that crimes such as rape murder and similar heinous crimes cannot and should not be included as having been performed in official duty this definition was formally accepted as an amendment to resolution four four three to wit whereas in order to ensure that not all offenses by u s personnel arising out of any act or omission done in the performance of official duty will not automatically be covered by a duty certificate to be issued by the u s military commanders under paragraph e article five the term official duty as used in this paragraph is hereby defined as follows again the definition  the term official duty is understood to be any duty or service required or authorized to be done by statute regulation the order of a superior or military usage  official duty is not meant to include all acts by an individual during the period while he is on duty but is meant to apply only to acts which are required or authorized to be done as a function of that duty which the individual is performing unquote from this definition mr president which as embodied in resolution four four three the validity or efficacy of the duty certificate to be issued by the u s military commanders will be measured and if found wanting by the philippine authorities should be rejected without hesitation and equivocation given the dark history of the duty certificate like the hated  cedula under spain the new circumstances upon which the v f a will be operable that is absence of permanent u s military bases facilities and troops in the philippines the new breed of national regional and local 1 word leaders and finally the assertiveness and vigilance of the n g os and the students and the other sectors i have no doubt that the past would never be resurrected nor replicated in the use of duty certificate by u s military commanders i certainly would not allow it mr president it behooves therefore the concerned philippine authorities not to take the words of the u s military commanders at face value they should be vigilant and strict to the point of being  makulit = be naggers and matigas = being forceful or firm in asserting resolution four four three as well as the definition of official duty and evaluating the circumstances and facts that have given rise to the issuance of the duty certificate in case of doubt mr president the duty certificate once issued should be reviewed and if found against the definition of official duty should be rejected happily the sponsors agreed to this approach second is the language used why is the v f a couched in a language distinctly different from other similar instruments with respect to concurrent and primary jurisdiction more specifically i refer to the question of what appears to be an automatic waiver of philippine jurisdiction pursuant to paragraph three d article five which states and i quote recognizing the responsibility of the united states military authorities to maintain good order and discipline among their forces philippine authorities will upon request by the united states waive their primary right to exercise jurisdiction except in cases of particular importance to the philippines  if the government of the philippines determines that the case is of particular importance it shall communicate such determination to the united states authorities within twenty days after the philippine authorities received the united request  yet on identical situation mr president america agreed to a much different nay apparently more liberal language with respect to her agreements with other countries for instance the agreement with japan on the same situation states and i quote if the state having the primary right decides not to exercise jurisdiction it shall notify the authorities of the other state as soon as practicable  the authorities of the state having the primary right shall give sympathetic consideration to a request from the authorities of the other state for a waiver of its right in cases where that order other state considers such a waiver to be of particular importance article seventeen paragraph thirty-six of the agreement between japan and the united states similarly mr president the agreement with south ame south korea australia and the nato countries to mention just a few contain the same language as japan instead of automatic waiver the  sympathetic consideration are the passwords in these countries with respect to waiver of primary jurisdiction mr president the phrase sympathetic consideration  does not convey to me as the same as automatic waiver  found in the v f a yet during the several public hearings we were told that the particular v f a language is no different in import than those found in agreements with japan south korea australia and the nato countries because the v f a provides an escape clause for the philippines where it can always deny the request of waiver of jurisdiction over cases which are of particular importance to the philippines if indeed the import of the language quote sympathetic consideration unquote is similar to quote automatic waiver unquote why did our negotiator not insist on the former in fact in the defunct military bases agreement  sympathetic consideration was the language used in the agreement paragraph three c article thirteen are our negotiator less tenacious than their counterpart from the other countries or do they really believe that despite the difference in the nomenclature the meaning is the same if the language in section three d mr president is left by itself without any amendment of the v f a or subsequent clarificatory and binding undertaken undertaking from the concerned philippine authorities from the executive department then it is obvious that there is indeed a difference and that such difference places the philippines in unequal footing with america that situation is nakakahiya = shameful  and definitely unacceptable to me mr president i cannot overemphasize my personal concern on the subject of fair and equal administration of justice because i see a great number of filipinos being deprived of elementary due process and justice it is bad enough mr president that at the hands of a fellow  pinoy another pinoy becomes a victim of injustice it is worst and unforgivable if a pinoy will suffer injustice at the hands of a foreigner in cases involving crimes committed in the philippines 
Philippines	uh mr president uh honorable colleagues today the senate is blessed with this historical moment faced again with responsibility and opportunity to be able to choose in these times of widespread discord and national prerogative that has a concrete bearing on how we can preserve our sovereignty and the security of every filipino reflected in this document are workable solutions providing for the very existence of our republic in a world besotted with conflict rage and insecurities this document will not only be the source of foreign policy direction the republic or this administration has to take but it will without doubt confer us the necessary framework to prevail over waves of changes that will engulf the unwitting and the ill-prepared this document has been the source of bitter exchanges personal attacks and harsh pronouncements within this hallowed chamber and even out in the street the other parliament every channel has been opened so that clashing viewpoints would be heard not only in the exercise of the inherent and constitutionally guaranteed right to freedom of expression the state maintains open channels because it seeks the wisdom from what is spoken not just from the bombast we all let it loose so each one every senator casting a vote the citizen ventilating concerns can find the appropriate care and define the balance of national interest and foreign policy initiatives on what could be the end of the post cold war years in a republican state international agreements are appropriately subjected to intense debate because these cannot and should not be crafted on the basis of the whims of the executive the r p visiting forces agreement is not just simply about military exercises nor of nuclear weapons nor of ugly americans or of prostitutes neither merely of ravaged environments and menace of drugs and disease it is all this and more the resulting interplay of economic politico-military and socio-cultural forces in a new global dynamic shall determine how the v f a and those who shall father it are branded or remembered irrelevant or relevant subservient or nationalist the debates have all prepared us for this task and warned us enough how to bear the consanses consequences of our vote words  and immediately and far-off into the future although they had the chance in nineteen eighty-six the framers of our constitution did not reject american presence outright the framers of our constitution sought a balance of patriotism and pragmatism consciously they so worded foreign policy and the transitory provisions to the nineteen eighty-seven constitution to allow us to savor the challenge of this historic vote they did not find wisdom in taking away the options of the executive towards enhancing national security and assuring peace with our shores within our shores the senate on the other hand also found enough reason to wait out to wait it out for four years in nineteen ninety-one the senate did not extend the bases' stay they plainly let the r p - u s sem um m b a lapse when the last ships of americans and their dependents left eight years ago the people in the senate these same hallowed ch chambers left one of the foundations of future filipino-american relations the mutual defense treaty intact unchanged unchallenged but today more than ever we know and feel it in our guts that we need a new framework to put more meaning and muscle to commitments under the r p - u s mutual defense treaty a treaty that we did not abrogate a treaty which the people rejoiced the ejection of the american bases did not press to abrogate even with three changing of the guards in congress i believe the decision made today should be based on the most important factor national security defined correctly and in the long term external defense and the protection of territorial boundaries not only not only external defense and protection of the territorial boundaries but also increasingly of economic security in a world directed towards globalization where peace assures us and our neighbors equitable use of resources in the region as human contact across oceans reach new levels and frequencies just recently unimaginable we now realize that we are interconnected not only in the physical sense but in the plane of changing international morality played out in interregional and global engagements foreign relation initiatives must reflect the correct appraisal of the values of alliances it is easy to claim that one is against war and easier still to invoke the constitution which renounces war as an instrument of national policy however i believe no responsible leader can play blind to real and potential threats to peace equality justice freedom cooperation and amity with all nations it is not enough to denounce aggressors and it is fatal to be an island by itself we should not be trapped in the web of insecurities ab attributed to being neutral neither should we couch as to throw ourselves into the camp of the bigger bully as if wishing that another holocaust will break up we have to wield foreign relations instrument to reap the benefits of a security continuum which allow us to struggle should be juggle  arrangements and employ initiatives ranging from one that is entirely neutral to that of dependence to a superior power depending on the need of the times we have to take a calculated pace in this security continuum basic to finding the reasons to confront options in this security continuum is having the courage to face new and emerging configurations of the new global dynamic and after a continuing assessment of the new global dynamic to slowly but surely enter multilateral and bilateral arrangements geared towards self-reliance i understand why others find comfort in old patterns characterized mainly by unequal ties betwan between the philippines and the united states and as breaking away much later there too was comfort in the belief that the u s what that this threshold of declining influence in the initial embarrassments and the very vivid images of its pull-out from vietnam handling of this whole hostage situation in iran and its being booted out from the philippines the image of the u s on the brink of collapse was reassuring the favorite line was that the u s enjoying a peak would soon in a rage bring down itself and its allies in a war of its own undoing likewise the u s s r 's grip of its satellite was slowly slipping after it went into a wave of changes. the rising nationalism of u s s r 's component republics led to the formal internment in nineteen ninety-two of an ailing soviet empire the end of the post cold war was carved deeply into men 's minds when the one raging symbol of the cold war the berlin wall was pick-axed and bulldozed in eight in nineteen eighty-nine the mad men 's game of the arms race was gone the cold war was over and mr president we pretended being secure within our shores we lulled in the feeling we that had an even chance of having peace after breaking the suffocating yoke of a former colonizer and its only rival splinter a period of disengagements the integration reassertion of political and cultural independence erasing old spheres of influence of the great powers characterized what we commonly term the post cold war world this was a unique period in modern history no big war was dividing the world the various causes were fought by swift troop attacks including government-funded mercenaries and terrorists that stretch of time so the great powers waging battles that were still about controlling continents without the use of the giant talents of armies which constituted the panorama of the two world wars this period showed the enlargement of the the demec democratic world in the u s efforts in panama the break-up of the soviet empire and china 's political reforms the two germanys reunited while other eur european republics splintered into smaller nations the soviets rev uh withdrew from cuba middle east conflicts simmered to the accord between israel and palestinian liberation organization and in the meantime mr president that democratic space expanded in turkey and other eurasian states the manifestations that this period will not hold and was only temporary was present but we failed to read through the fine print muddled as we are and merely stared at the unfolding of the tapestry of global events the post cold war world was headed to a conclusion kosovo may just have done it i subscribe to the analysis that we are coasting through to the conclusion of an interregnum a gap between two tempests the crumbling of the berlin wall and madeleine 's war a lot of us gathered here missed the interregnum unbeknownst to us we also just managed to exist in a superficial peace without exerting any efforts to craft a comprehensive foreign policy relevant to the security of the filipinos' future the importance of the crumbling of the berlin wall in geopolitics was lost on us as the aquino administration used it only to shame local insurgents if not for the large army of filipino workers the government would have also looked the other way when iraq 's ins expansionist wars in the nineties had to be stopped by united nations-sanctioned desert shield and its bombardment in desert storm these two events should have signaled the aquino cabinet to immediately craft and strategize on an independent foreign policy then we would have had the opportunity to that should be thus  nullify the old valid charge of the great nationalist claro m recto that the philippines has a mendicant foreign policy this also explains why we are lost with the impact of the realignments in the post cold war world the government missed the signals that was alerting us to the possibility that the superficial peace being savored will be broken the wars in far-off shores are impacting on us while swelling wars inside our neighbors' yar yards are threatening whatever was holding peace until nineteen ninety-eight the united states the only remaining super power had worried about serbia iraq and north korea currently it is forced to reckon with the strength of russia france japan and china russia is now in the process of reu reunification with the fragment of its old soviet empire in nineteen ninety-eight russia found a center of gravity in anti-americanism sparked by the unannounced u s bombing of iraq driving a wedge into the russian psyche that power to spoil u s actions had slipped away powerlessness was the russians' collective shame because the returns were never realized the in-flow of american investments and loans had drastically constricted therefore it sought a reattachment with china a renewed alliance with china will counter aggressive u s pressures to acquire increasingly russian economic cooperation the u s now has to consider france after its effort exhibited in iraq it may be the u s forces that are leading nato forces but it does not monopolize the directions and the ultimate conclusion of the serbian drama japan poses another challenge to the u s despite clearly securing its sovereign through american military presence its independent assessment of the north korean threat already felt in pentagon meanwhile china let cannot let its economy weaken or be artificially propped up it wants to emerge to be a stabilizing factor the most conservative of u s policy makers appreciating the global aspiration for peace reflect this in their recommendations as follows safeguard u s national security through a non-proliferation policy on nuclear weapons prevent a major power threat to europe east asia or the persian gulf through a u s permanent power position in the pacific maintain access to foreign trade through nafta and actively seek open markets to benefit american consumers and exporters protect americans against threats to their lives and well-being by decisive action against terrorists and international crime syndicates maintain access to resources the most strategic of which is foreign oil which supplies half of american needs i find the enumeration very revealing mr president they are all realizable only if a peace holds mr president who would have thought that the giant responsible for decades of anti-capitalist propaganda and one of the foremost critic of the western money economy would one day hold a free-market superpower america perplexed at the power of its own currency who would dared should be would have dared imagine the western currency speculators included that china could hold by its pocket an america fearing the slightest movement of the u n china underwent two massive disarmaments and later switched from an old-time preparedness against a large-scale war of aggression to peacetime construction its defense budget is minuscule compared to the other great powers mr president worldwide it is cooperating in the u n and in other multilateral initiatives designed to control the spread of nuclear weapons prevent arms race in outer space destroy biological weapons suspend export of anti-personnel landmines and reduce the forces in border and on non-first use of nuclear weapons china has also agreed with neighbors to refrain from staging military exercises directing against the other and restrictsi restrictions military exercises as to scale area and the number of such military exercises despise should be despite its multilateral peace efforts china is still feared mr president some persist in fanning the fear of a chinese invasion and to a certain extent it is indeed worrisome that there exists such a big army without a declared enemy and moreover construction of structures and occupation of certain areas without agreements fuel doubts and apprehensions while fighting off u s rebuke of its human rights record china was taking in the lessons so magnified in its decision to preserve hong kong the crown jewel of mercantilism at as the port of global trade china understands the strategic value of not waging a war that will dissipitate dissipate its resources for it is to construct ports or deploy troops in overseas bases would detract from its benign deportment that it had painstakingly sustained through extreme self-restraint in addition the feared asian giant is as much threatened by factors of instability if we can only care to read through its defense strategy with regards to china mr president i believe that foremost in the u s priority is its economic potential as when the u s sent its straight-shooting albright to join its trade secretary to propound america 's interest it is one it is but one example that the u s itself took cognizance that an engagement or any ari any rising rivalry with china would have to be waged sustained and resolved within economic terms and not in a fiery war now mr president should we be afraid of china today a search for relevant foreign relations initiatives i reiterate my belief that while conflicts have ceased to be waged on ideological grounds we need to forge security alliances the new global dynamic is anchored on the protection of national interests of great powers such as those of japan china russia and some other european states 
Philippines	mr president esteemed colleagues this is a privileged moment for me to make history today together with all of you as we cast our vote in what could either be the most glorious or the most ignominious way to welcome the millennium this is also a moment of truth for me a golden opportunity to finally bare my innermost thoughts and feelings indeed my very soul on an issue whose resolution will mark a turning point in the destiny of our nation arriving at a final decision did not come easy for me it was something i carefully deliberated on earnestly prayed over argued and discussed vigorously and even persistently debated over with those whose wisdom and counsel i value most i have been warned cajoled pressured to take the beaten path to follow the majority as nothing i could say or do can alter the equation indeed the weight of my resolve bears heavily upon me for going against the grain i am disregarding the earnest pleas and advice of family and friends including that of my beloved husband tony all of whom i dearly love honor and respect as i cast my vote today mr president i ask for their understanding and compassion for i must vote the way my conscience dictates only then can i be worthy of my truly mandated task  mula nang ako ay pumalaot sa larangan ng pulitika naging panuntunan ko na na isaalang-aalang ang kapakanan ng inang bayan higit pa po sa sarili  i could not see how i can be true to myself or to anyone especially to the filipino people who have placed their trust in me if i could not be true to myself the die is cast mr president and on this blessed day at five thirteen i declare that i cannot in conscience give my concurrence to senate resolution four four three mr president i vote a resounding no to the visiting forces agreement  no to an agreement that is lamentably unconstitutional no to a grossly flawed ominously vague and decidedly one-sided agreement i vote no mr president to the visiting forces agreement because i believe it is unfair and oppressive to the filipino people  hindi po ako sumasang-ayon sa isang kasunduang mapang-api makapagpapahamak at walang idudulot na kabutihan sa sambayanang pilipino my vote mr president is a vote for national sovereignty that can neither be waived nor compromised in order to give preferential treatment to foreign troops or subordinated to any claim of national security or political exigency my vote is a vote for the constitution and its unequivocal mandate for a nuclear-free country my vote is a vote for the environment an area of deep abiding and personal concern so that we may avoid reliving the tragedy of the past military bases which left behind a scourge of toxic contaminants that has bred disease and death in many communities in the former base lands mr president let us get it straight i am not against the americans i am not even against a visiting forces agreement but i am mr president and have always been strongly against the way this treaty is presently drafted and worded i believe mr president that this document is onerous and fatally deficient in providing adequate protection for our own national interest mr president i may not possess the legal brilliance of many of our distinguished colleagues nor am i gifted with the advantage of age and political experience but this i know mr president that the agreement violates the philippine constitution both in letter and in spirit therefore i cannot find honor in something that makes a farce of all that we have been taught about the universal standards of fairness justice law and equality to borrow the words of one of the magnificent twelve who described the rejected bases pact of nineteen ninety-one it is indeed a masterpiece of vagueness as if it were a virtue to confuse our people i humbly urge my senior colleagues to work for the renegotiation of a new agreement for bilateral defense cooperation one where the provisions are unmistakably fair clear and binding for both parties this we should do not only so that we may abide by our own constitution and our laws but more significantly so that we can keep our dignity and self-respect as a people we must not repeat the mistakes of the past we must not allow any more of our women to be raped filipinos whom they denigratingly called scavengers to be used as human targets by servicemen who have gone scot-free and what about the many abandoned amerasian children they all cry out for justice  huwag po tayong magbingi-bingihan huwag po tayong magbulag-bulagan  let us also not forget that until now the united states whose military forces have been described by newsweek as the most pervasive and the most protected polluter has ignored its legal and international obligations to clean up the toxic waste which it has left behind in its former military bases the destructive and debilitating toxic situation in clark and subic must not must never be replicated in other areas of the philippines the renewed onslaught of war games threaten to leave behind a trail of similar devastation in our forests and mountains in our beaches and wetlands i have been mr president to some of the thirty sites identified by various studies as heavily contaminated i saw hapless children born with missing fingers and deformed bodies and young lives slowly and painfully being consumed by cancer i heard their mothers cry and plead for deliverance from this harrowing nightmare the residents of these communities live each day struggling to survive against the very elements that they need to exist the water they drink the air they breathe the land where they grow their crops and where their homes are built the sight the sound and the stench of death and disease hang heavily upon them and all we can do to assuage their grief is to demand that the u s be made to take responsibility for its actions and make reparation under the polluter must pay principle after today mr president i will continue to take up the cudgels to press for the clean-up of the former military bases months ago i have written sen john sheffield the head of the u s senate environment committee about the problems and i received a reply last april twelve that they will study the matter i trust that even after my adverse vote the u s will keep its doors open when we present our case to them i believe that true friendship does not hinge on a piece of paper but upon the recognition of mutual rights and obligations this necessarily includes a shared concern for the environment and for the sanctity of human life mr president i have great faith in the united states of america and its people bound by a history of shared ideals and aspirations i am confident that we can come to a mutual understanding and a resolution of our differences i believe we can achieve national security with the united states under an atmosphere of mutual respect and cooperation we should have a partnership between equals not an alliance of subservience we need a treaty of cooperation not a pact of subjugation as a student of national security mr president i realize how fragile peace is and how ambition can transcend national borders to provoke conflict but the v f a is not the solution to our external security problem the solution lies in diplomacy not in rattling sabers and precipitating aggression the era is past when national security and stability can simply be defined as involving freedom from war or securing the national territory from external aggression national security and stability must now be based on the resolution of basic social economic and political problems that breed poverty inequity and injustice mr president the greatest battle we have to fight now is not outside our shores but deep within us our greatest enemy is a defeatist view that has kept us hostage in our own fears when will we overcome this culture of mendicancy that allows the dumping of obsolete and expensive war materiel in our country simply because we have lost the will to provide for ourselves the last eight years di disproved our fears we have seen that for as long as we have faith in the capacity and resilience of our people we can be equal to the challenge of growth we have also proven that we can prosper better in freedom and independence a proud nation that forges onward without the yoke of servility and stand boldly for the rights and welfare of its citizens mr president there is life after the bases just as we should realize that the commonality of interests between the philippines and the united states did not cease with the removal of the military bases in nineteen ninety-one in fact three years after the pull-out the u s remains to be our major export market even as our own armed forces continues to purchase armaments and receive training from america mr president it is barely a year since our nation celebrated one hundred years of freedom as a republic shall we destroy that spirit and purpose of the centennial by beginning a new century a new millennium with a vote that would negate the ideals of freedom and independence which we gained at the cost of the lives of our valiant forebears history mr president would be unforgiving  huwag po nating sayangin ang kasarinlan na pinagbuwisan ng buhay ng ating mga magigiting na ninuno  as the youngest senator in this august body i speak for the youth as i cast my vote today this vote is their vote mr president we the youth vote for honor and self-respect we vote to live in dignity and freedom we vote to assert our right to a sovereign future therefore mr president we vote no a million times no to this visiting forces agreement today as we cast our vote let us take time to remember with pride the heroic rejection by the philippine senate of the onerous u s military bases agreement in nineteen ninety-one and on this day let us relive that glorious moment in our history as we proudly confirm our independence as a nation mr president our vote is no   maraming salamat po at mabuhay ang sambayanang pilipino     mr president on several occasions in the past i have uh voted on issues presented before the senate guided only by the principle that i vote freely and rationally according to my conscience and the public interest last i voted years back for the re-imposition of the of the death penalty and i voted for the rejection of the uruguay round on the general agreement on tariff and trade i was with the majority in the former and i was with the minority in the latter today i cast my vote on a matter of importance to our people guided only by conscience reason and the public interest  with the indulgence of my colleagues mr president allow me to explain my vote the issue at hand may be likened to the question of whether or not we want a certain group to come and visit us the door keeper is the senate and the home owner of course is the filipino people whether the door keeper in the exercise of delegated authority from the home owner opens or shuts the door proves only one thing that it has power over the entry of the visitor it is therefore wrong to say that to allow the visitor to come in is a surrender of power and in case the visitor proves herself himself not a pleasant one she can always be asked to leave as she did once leave in nineteen ninety-one  itong visitor na ito'y sumusunod  but the big picture is that this is really a tale of two visits  'yung isa ay kumakatok at nagpapaalam pumasok 'yung isa naman nakapasok na sa ating bakuran nagtayo na ng kanyang kabahayan at nag-aalok pang bumisita tayo sa kanilang itinayong bahayan ang sabi pa nila kung gusto nating makibahagi sa anumang kayamanan ng kalikasang matatagpuan doon ay maaari naman daw tayong bumisita kung maari nga lang huwag daw nating papapasukin yung kumakatok na kagalit nila  one visitor is knocking on our door while the other an intruder actually had entered and built a shanty within our compound without knocking at the door of the senate this shanty grew into a structure of strong materials worse that intruder had claimed the lot as his own and says we must not allow the visitor knocking on our door to enter and i am disheartened that those who oppose the entry of the visitor knocking at our door do not raise even a small squeak against the sly incursion of the intruder worse the communist national democratic front finds an uncommon ally in the leadership of the catholic church are the people at our gates the national democratic front and the catholic church exercising selective nationalism why do they not demonstrate in front of the chinese embassy in the philippines against this intrusion why is the catholic church following the line of the national democratic front do their leaders not see anything wrong from the activities of the chinese in the mischief reef  they have even raised issues on would-be prostitution but i wonder why they have never raised the issues or raised against prostitution in binondo bocaue culi-culi 1 word  mr president the visiting forces agreement is about giving filipino soldiers and civilians not only the requisite military training for the defense of the country but also cooperation in relief and rescue operations and environmental protection and other developmental programs in times of peace then the question arises why should we train with the united states  e bakit diyan sa mga kano  the truth mr president is obvious they have the equipment the latest technology and they are willing to train us others may have the equipment but they belong to the other side of the ideological spectrum we don't expect to be trained by our enemies some young filipinos say we must not enter into such an agreement but i dare say that millions of our youth in the schools and at their homes think otherwise for any miscalculation on our part will put their lives on the line in spite of the high tech nature of the wars of tomorrow the dying still has to be suffered by the young soldiers of the republic we cannot be sitting ducks of future invaders we must defend ourselves if we do not train with new technology now we cannot play a significant role in our country 's defense the art of warfare has changed from david 's sling shot to the laser-guided intelligent bombs that can hit targets as small as a golf ball anywhere in the world in spite of our intense nationalism and pride as a people we must wake up to the reality of our lack of adequate military equipment the filipino people in my humble perception mr president are predominantly in favor of a military alliance with the united states for the simple reason that in spite of our differences we are not prepared to defend ourselves in case of external aggression and i always worry about external aggression especially about this intruder visitor every time i read the book of revelations chapters sixteen to twenty mr president let us look to the future with hope rather than look back in fear of what have gone wrong with our relations with the united states the filipino veterans are for v f a because they have seen the high cost of human lives and property for unpreparedness during the second world war when we lost one million lives and lived through hell for three years the filipino soldiers are for v f a because as we debate here in the senate they are out there in the hills and mountains fighting and dying for us against communist groups who are at times better equipped and trained than our very own warriors the silent but no less patriotic filipino youth are for v f a as they go about their daily task of studying in our schools for their own future the ruling class of the catholic church in the philippines the catholic bishops conference in the philippines is against v f a but the catholic masa the el shaddai  whose economic class mirrors that of our filipino soldiers are in favor of v f a the ordinary filipino soldier wishes to ally with the forces of democracy in this part of the world mr president we can choose to be romantic and claim we need no training or joint exercises with the americans  e kanino tayo makikipag-training ano huwag na lang tayong mag-training para e talagang para tayong nakatihaya sa kalaban e nagbago na ho ang mundo mr president pati china nga nagbago na rin ng pananaw e yun po yung mcdonalds eh gusting-gusto na ho sa bejing ang lakas ng benta ang communist vietnam ay umaakit na ng foreign investment samantalang tayo nakakulong pa sa lumang kaisipan ng komunismo yung mga debateng ginagamit na narinig natin sabi nga ni senator john osme&ntilde;a ay dadagdagan ko mga lumang tugtugin na kumita na mr president  to be anti-american does not necessarily mean being pro-filipino i choose to be pro-filipino even it if it means training for the defense of this country with an american the late communist leader deng zhao ping said i don't care the color of the cat for as long as it catches mice for me i do not care with whom we train for as long as we defend our country mr president i cast the sixteenth affirmative vote for the v f a
Philippines	mr president on a speck of land in the blue waters of the mediterranean in the greek island of corfu lies the grave of a young man and on his headstone is carved the epitaph i want nothing i fear nothing i am free  and when i was in the military stockade of the dictator where i spent almost five years of my life exacerbated by having to listen day in and day out on radio and television to pompous and pontificating propagandists spew forth lie after lie half truth after half truth phrases like sa ikauunlad ng bayan disiplina ang kailangan or there is not a single political prisoner in this country i found courage and inspiration from the words of the great mahatma gandhi who said the first condition of freedom is freedom from fear  and it was only then and when i was able to inten internalize this dictum that i began to realize that prison bars do not enslave a man it is his fears that do man 's most basic instinct is the instinct for survival and corollary to that man 's greatest fear is the fear of destruction of death thus it became my personal program to face the issue of dying and the fear of death first i came to acknowledge that life is a matter of trade-offs and that there were certain things in life which are so unendurable unbearable that death or the risk of dying would be preferable the immortal ninoy aquino was able to capsulize this powerful feeling in a single sentence when he declared i would rather die on my feet like a man than continue to live on bended knees like a slave and it was this precept which spurred my cellmate geny and i to go on a hunger strike in november nineteen seventy-four to demand the release of political prisoners and when one thousand and twenty-four detainees were given their release on december fourth geny and i broke our fast the hunger strike lasted for ten days and it was this belief this passion to be free that on september thirty nineteen seventy-seven gave us the courage to risk death and undertake a daring escape from the maximum security unit of fort bonifacio mr president during the past several months the filipino people have been bombarded with half truths and outrageous lies wittingly or unwittingly by pro-v f a propagandists quarter page ads in news dailies had been paid by whose monies we still do not know to instill fear in the filipino people that the nation now faces the immediate threat of an invasion by chinese hordes from the mainland as proof they cited the construction of a small unsightly building on a tiny atoll one hundred and thirty-five miles from the shores of palawan a building that is so small that it would be unable to contain a garrison of more than fifty soldiers in cramped fashion the presence of a tiny chinese garrison on mischief reef combined with the passage by the national people 's congress of a law declaring that the entire south china sea belongs to china has been utilized with a limited amount of success i must admit to cause a number of filipinos to support the return of american soldiers modified by the vague and nebulous adjective  visiting forces  the visiting forces agreement is necessary the proponents say to operationalize the mutual defense treaty of nineteen fifty-one they insist that our soldiers need to be trained by american soldiers in the use of the latest state-of-the-art weaponry as if the philippines could afford to buy destroyers and frigates and submarines and laser-guided bombs delivered by f eighteen hornets or f sixteen falcons p three orion planes anti-submarine patrol helicopters tomahawk cruise missiles hawkeye missiles and much much less an intercontinental ballistic missile or maybe a fourth-hand aircraft carrier because this is what it will take to stop a chinese invasion or even neutralize them in the spratlys roughly i estimate in my amateur defense way one hundred billion u s dollars it is like your neighbor teaching you how to drive a ferrari but when you go home you have no ferrari in your garage to drive the proponents have continuously and loudly alleged that the presence of the chinese on mischief reef constitutes a clear and present danger to the free and unhampered passage of commercial ships in the area and to the security of the east asian region even while the u s assistant secretary of state for east asian and pacific affairs otherwise known as america 's point man in asia mr stanley roth declared in davo switzerland only last february nineteen ninety-nine that and i quote mr roth it is important not to overstate the situation referring to the spratlys dispute between manila and beijing while at the same time not to underestimate the need to get some resolution  there has been a lot of publicity recently which might suggest that freedom of navigation is at risk because of new construction by chinese at mischief reef in fact the building is in no way a fundamental threat to security   and i repeat mr roth said this the building on mischief reef is in fact no way a fundamental threat to security  the fact is that the united states navy transits the region all the time it is disappointing that china chose to build he said  it appears to be at odds with commitments they have given the philippines previously and certainly with a notion of resolving by peaceful means the many disputed claims  the proponents of the v f a have continuously pounded away at us their belief that the mutual defense treaty must now be strengthened by the approval of the v f a in order to provide our country with the security shield that will protect us from china in spite of the fact that the mutual defense treaty does not repeat not contain an automatic retaliatory clause in case the philippines is attacked that it is in fact an empty promise which american propagandists have used to their advantage for forty-eight years to gain concessions from the filipinos indeed only last week the pentagon 's equivalent of assistant secretary roth break in recording the commander-in-chief of all u s armed forces in the pacific better known as cincpac admiral dennis blair declared in singapore that the v f a and i quote in his thinking it is not a security guarantee or a big signal on the issues mentioned i have repeatedly maintained that the proponents of the v f a have been making promises on behalf of the americans and have been exaggerating the danger posed by a tiny chinese garrison at mischief reef or by the commitment of the united states to come to the defense of our country if and when attacked it would seem to me and to many that if the proponents of the v f a utilized these arguments in america they would be laughed out of the united states senate the officials of various departments who testified during the hearings have maintained that because the philippines has not had to invoke the mutual defense treaty in the past is proof enough that the m d t has been effective and one official even said that even if the philippines is able to bluff the chinese that the possibility alone i 'm not talking about probability but possibility alone that the u s might might come to our assistance because of the fact that we have the m d t should be enough to deter the chinese from engaging in more aggressive actions in the spratlys well the candid comments of admiral blair threw off any pretense of u s intentions although ambassador hubbard was quick to deny that uhm that admiral blair did not say what admiral blair indeed said and how else do we did we expect ambassador hubbard to react admiral blair up to now has not corrected his statement last week in my turno en contra i like the small boy in the hans christian andersen tale declared the emperor has no clothes today as i listen to the various explanations of votes by our distinguished colleagues i could not but come to the conclusion that the chinese know we are bluffing that we know that the chinese know we are bluffing but that we hope that the filipino people do not know that the chinese know that we are bluffing about the m d t but as a philosopher once said in war truth is the first casualty and since the proponents of the v f a have engendered in our people the fear of impending war with china all logic reason common sense and balanced judgment have been thrown out the window the problem i have always maintained is not whether we should operationalize the m d t but whether america has a real commitment to our defense the problem also is whether v f a costs too much in terms of our national dignity and honor the debate is not over the need to maintain security alliances with friendly countries like the united states or australia or the united kingdom or france or canada but to maintain such alliances while maintaining our self-respect it is the responsibility of the senate comprised of only twenty-three men and women elected at large to play a countervailing role to the executive department in matters of treaties it is our role to play the bad cop to the executive 's good cop i possess some amount of sympathy for the members of the executive department who have been bullied by almighty america into ratifying such a one-sided agreement the pressure must have been tremendous our pending structural adjustment loans from the world bank the approvals of the i m f for our financial plans loans from the asian development bank our sugar and garment quotas must have been bashed over the heads of our leaders and as lyndon baines johnson so aptly described his philosophy if you 've got them by the balls their minds and hearts will follow  and i guess our decision is now limited to two options to either have our balls fondled by the americans or crushed by the chinese but as the revered nationalist and former light of the senate jose w diokno once asked if we have to give up our virtue can we not at least check if their dollar is counterfeit i had also asked the senate not as an eleventh hour excuse to derail the v f a but to protect our children in pampanga and zambales our distinguished colleague the senator from batangas and antique has already articulated the heartaches and the miseries that toxic and hazardous wastes have caused are causing and will continue to cause poor families most of them already victims of mount pinatubo 's lahar over twenty thousand families have lived in the cabcom  evacuation center for an average of one to four years and considerable harm from toxic and hazardous wastes had been done to them especially to pregnant women the americans did not even inform the philippine authorities of potential risk of water contem contamination if they had only warned us many deaths could have been prevented and so many lives would not have been destroyed because we would not have allowed the evacuees to occupy that particular area in clark earlier the distinguished senator from laguna from cagayan i 'm sorry repeated the final lines of our national anthem and perhaps in honor of all past present and future victims of toxic wastes especially the innocent children we should rephrase our anthem silang mamatay nang dahil sa kano  in concurring in the ratification of the v f a we are waiving the rights of our children to a happy and healthy life in the future the senate can still prevent this by using the v f a to get the united states of america to own up to their moral responsibility to make things right and to prevent more children being born mentally retarded with physical deformities with cancer leading to a life of misery and a painful death let not the u s continue to bluff us into believing that trade and investment will suffer if the v f a is not concurred in by the senate it was after the bases were closed in nineteen ninety-two that investments in our country grew by leaps and bounds nobody in the senate has so far disputed those statistics the american businessman my friends like any investor will go anywhere where he can make a profit regardless of what his government policies are in america my friends it is the businessmen and not the politicians who dictate policy i have read much researched much studied much analyzed much in preparing for the v f a debates i have tried to perform my duty as a senator of the republic as god gives me the light to see that duty i wish to express my appreciation to the leadership of this chamber who have conducted proceedings with fairness dignity and decorum and also to the distinguished sponsors and co-sponsor who have been kind patient and understanding i 've been privileged to interact with all of you but i must vote no to a one-sided agreement that is an insult to our national honor and which will remove from us the one single trump card that will save thousands of children in pampanga and zambales as a statesman once said i would rather lose in a cause that i know someday will triumph than to triumph in a cause that i know someday will fail  it is obvious to us that the concurrence of the senate in the ratification of the v f a is inevitable and if we were to take the path of least resistance we may perhaps follow the advice of a former secretary of foreign affairs who said  if rape is inevitable relax and enjoy it  but mr president the senate has no right to make that answer on behalf of filipino women and children and i shall not relax and enjoy i shall continue to fight for our people especially women and children for the right to live lives of dignity and good health if not happiness the scottish philosopher thomas carlyle was once asked by one of his students if you could encapsulate the wisdom of the ages in one sentence how would that sentence read  carlyle thought for a few minutes and he answered i cannot give it to you in one sentence but i can give it to you in four and they are one whom the gods wish to destroy they first make mad two the bee pollinizes the flower that it steals the honey from three the wheels of justice grind exceedingly slow but they grind exceedingly fine and four it is only when it gets dark enough that you can see the stars  and at this beginning of another benighted period in our country 's history i shall take time from now on to peer up into the heavens to look at the stars because to me they are the filipino children thank you mr president 
Philippines	thank you mr president mr president we gather here today in search of peace security and welfare of the filipino people they elected us to this august chamber to discharge our constitutional duties one of the most important of which is to ratify or reject treaties or international agreements that have vital influence in their lives and fortune mr president and distinguished colleagues outside this hall are rallies demonstrations and loud protests of our people holding divergent views seeking to sway our decision in a democratic institution like ours we encourage them to do so because the people must be free to choose their own future without fear or favor without dictation or domination without suppression or subversion but guided by our obligation to secure their safety freedom and progress as divine providence gives us to see the light we cast our vote today in accordance with our conscience unafraid of the indictment of posterity let history be the final judge of our deeds we are called upon to accept or reject senate resolution number four four three under committee report number forty-two which declares its concurrence on the visiting forces agreement between the government of the philippines and the government of the united states it must be pointed out that we have an existing mutual defense treaty with the united states signed in nineteen fifty-one we could have renounced it after the senate rejected the proposed treaty of friendship economic cooperation and security with the united states in nineteen ninety-one but we did not because that was not our intention despite the bases pull-out we chose to keep the m d t because the need to maintain the security alliances with the most powerful nation in the world must remain in the present circumstances prudence dictates that we give substance and effect to the r p - u s mutual defense treaty through the concurrence of the senate in the visiting forces agreement the v f a is not crafted to recolonize the philippines or to resurrect the foreign bases that we had discarded voting for it does not mean a surrender of our sovereignty it simply permits the short troop visits upon approval by our government for purposes of joint military exercises to ensure our security relationship under the aforesaid treaty to ordinary citizens this gey this gathering may have little or no real impact on their daily struggle for their survival yet in the life of our beloved nation today 's event holds surpassing meaning and unprecedented significance destined to etch in our country 's history mr president distinguished colleagues in the senate i stand here today on behalf of seventy million filipinos whose future depends on the security of our shores and the sustenance of their livelihood i come here today to cast my vote a vote that embraces the lesson of history and takes careful consideration of learned opinions of legal and political experts on this agreement requiring our sound judgment we are at a time of relative peace we are not a country at war but we should not let this lull us into a false sense of security because the string that holds this peace is weak for while we are peace-loving people willing to go the extra mile for peace there are also those willing to go the extra mile to disturb that peace the greatest threat to this fragile state of security in fact lies in slumber only a few hundred nautical miles away from our shores mr president today we make another hard and momentous decision for our people one that seeks to guarantee that peace continue to reign a peace that is crucial in sustaining our gains as a nation and leading us toward the next millennium where we can match stride with most prosperous economies and countries of the world deciding the fate of the visiting forces agreement i believe is a choice between preserving that peace or treading the path toward a future of uncertainty people say that our decision today would either set us back to the time when we were ruled by foreign colonizers or affirm the independence we have achieved when the last warship in subic bay the helicopter carrier  bella wood sailed out of philippine waters it is the obligation of the senate according to the critics of the v f a to preserve the gains we have achieved in nineteen ninety-one when we threw the military bases out of the country and finally ended the last form of foreign domination in our country mr president i am all for keeping and fighting for independence and sovereignty a brief look of history would show that my family had been deeply involved in the elusive quest for freedom from foreign rule my grandfather fought the americans during the philippine war for independence the centennial of which we are celebrating this year my father was a delegate during the passage of the hare-hawes-cutting law and the tydings-mcduffie law which paved the way for philippine independence from the united states my brother ninoy who was erroneously tagged as an amboy by his detractors maintained his position for philippine sovereignty although the  u the united states provided him refuge from the dictator another brother butz as a senator cast his vote against the continued stay of the u s bases in nineteen ninety-one despite the pro-bases stand taken by our sister-in-law the former president now it is my turn to make a choice mr president every generation must write a new kind of history times have changed today 's challenges are different they are of a broader kind they are of a global nature the choice i am about to make and the circumstances that surround it differ from those on which the members of my family based their option but we are one in principle we are entering a new millennium when there is a great economic competition fueled by the dizzying pace of technological advances but with progress comes more threats to our national security these threats have to be confronted now not with a narrow nationalism but with a broader perspective of cooperation and mutual support this is where alliances treaties and agreements like the v f a will come in but before we talk about what the v f a can do for us it is necessary first to discuss what it cannot do the v f a alone cannot provide us military dominance the v f a alone cannot bring us economic progress and more importantly the v f a alone cannot prevent any foreign act of aggression regional security will largely depend on the number of bilateral alliances and agreements the u s presence in the asia pacific is anchored on treaties and security agreements with countries like the philippines thailand singapore indonesia malaysia and brunei with similar arrangement on the status of forces one thing is certain mr president we need friends we need allies with friends and allies we can collectively guarantee our regional security and stability not many will agree with the idea of a superpower like the united states extending its reaches in our region i am one of those who believe that our security as a nation our sovereignty should be defended and upheld by the filipino people neither through the might of a superpower nor the cover of a military alliance mr president i realize that we are fifteen years and several billions of pesos away from becoming truly able to defend our borders and protect our people from external aggression we lack the time and resources to assure our people that we can uphold our sovereignty in the complex environment that exists today and it is our responsibility to make sure that our people be provided the means to make to have a secure future that is why i have opened my mind to forging military alliances with the united states it is in the larger context of peace that we have to ratify this agreement the r p - u s mutual defense treaty is an ef is an effective deterrent against ambitious neighboring countries every potential aggressor is put on notice that any aggression against the philippines may result in armed confrontation with the united states our respective forces armed forces should be given the opportunity to train together so that there should should be should there  be exigencies they can effectively work together as one fighting unit that is what the v f a seeks to accomplish we share with the americans a passion for democracy and human rights we fought side by side with them when our freedom was threatened during world war two the senate has put in place enough safeguards that would allay fears and abuses are bound to take place one of which is the creation of legislative oversight committee that would monitor and oversee this its implementation we have fo poured our undivided attention and spent urgent critical deliberation on the v f a two years were spent by the government of the philippines and the government of the united states in negotiating the v f a let us give the agreement a chance and let us give the filipino people a rare opportunity to pre to prove their capability to uphold this treaty while the agreement took such a long time to study and prepare we also recognize that the v f a is not permanent when we are ready we can do away with it and when that time comes i will be one of those cheering at this great achievement of our people of taking complete control of our security fears have been raised mr president over the possible resurgence of prostitution rings with the ratification of the v f a nothing ranks higher in my consideration of the v f a that may  should be than my concern for the fate of the women when we rejected the u s bases treaty in nineteen ninety-one it was a rejection of the commodification of our women in angeles and olongapo ratifying the v f a does not mean that we are allowing our women to be exposed against the same humiliating vi vices i say ratify the v f a and pass senate bill number fifteen sixty-two or the anti- prostitution act that proposed measure would decriminalize the prostitute and would penalize the reason for the crime the pimp and the buyer pass this bill into law and enforce so whoever engages the services of prostitutes be they filipino american or any other nationality will be prosecuted and charged accordingly rejecting the v f a will not solve our country 's problem on prostitution whether the v f a is here or not we will we still have to work very hard to provide a solution to this moral and social problem mr president and my dear colleagues i would like to make an appeal a rejection of the v f a would not give the country the respect it wants from other independent nations rejecting the v f a would be an act of cowardice and fear a fear of the past and a fear of the unknown rejection would be a silent admission that we are still unable to stand on equal footing with other independent countries such as the united states mr president the time has come to show to the whole world that we can hold our own in the community of nations now is the time to prove that we can see eye to eye with other countries match them stride for stride we determine our own destiny we can only be dominated if we choose to be dominated in nineteen eighty-six we as a people rose against the domination of an oppressive government and despotic ruler in nineteen ninety-one we again as a people decided against the continued stay of the u s bases in the country in nineteen ninety-six we collectively rallied against any form of charter change that would bring the country back to the throes of dictatorial rule and only last year through our votes we reaffirmed our commitment to democracy and put in place a government truly representative of the people 's will a government which truly is our own in closing mr president the v f a will not eliminate conflicts it will not put an end to war it will not secure freedom for all but i cast my vote in favor of senate resolution four four three concurring in the agreement between the governments of the philippines and the united states regarding the treatment of u s armed forces visiting the philippines i cast my vote in favor of v f a because it will help preserve peace and the peace that we seek does not rest in treaties and agreements or charters and covenants alone it is the peace that lies also in the hearts and minds of the filipino people let us therefore ask them to fully support and totally commit to preserve our peace and freedom to assure a stable and bright future  mabuhay ang pilipinas  thank you mr president 1
Philippines	allow me first to place on record my observations and remarks made earlier by a colleague that the blame for the sad state of the armed forces should be laid at the door of the presidency of corazon c aquino allegedly for giving low priority to their funding requirements i find that conclusion of my dear friend without merit for two reasons one when mrs aquino assumed the presidency the national treasury had been looted blind and number two the repeated coup attempts by a significant segment of the armed forces were hardly conducive to enlarging their share of the national budget in fact mr president if blame is to be laid on anyone 's shoulder i would say that it should be placed on those who had run of the military establishment for so long but had not been able to enhance its capability for one reason or another as a fighting force for the security of the nation mr president voting on the v f a is one of the most difficult decisions of my life as a public servant in nineteen ninety-one i was a member of the senate along with senator teofisto guingona senator juan ponce enrile and senator uh john osme&ntilde;a and uh we were faced with a proposal to renew the term of the u s military bases in the country sixteen votes were needed to approve a the proposal eight votes were needed to reject it mr president when i rose to cast my no vote mine was the eighth negative vote that irrevocably sealed the doom of the proposed renewal of the bases agreement i had cast that negative vote with no doubts no qualms of conscience no second thoughts about the rightness of my vote i then believe as i do now that the u s bases had to go in the event mr president i believe that history has vindicated our decision to ask the u s bases to leave i had voted no despite the repeated requests of a dear friend and a political ally the then president corazon c aquino with whom i had the privilege of working for the restoration of our people 's freedoms not only when she was already installed as president of the republic but even during the dark days of martial rule in our country today as a senator i am called upon to decide whether or not our country should have a visiting forces agreement with the united states of america and this time another dear friend and political ally no less than the incumbent president joseph ejercito estrada asked that i agree with the ratification of that agreement how i wish mr president i could decide the issue today as easily as i did the proposal of the renewal of the u s bases in nineteen ninety-one the issue now as i see it however is not a choice between black or white as was the proposal to retain or reject the u s military bases in nineteen ninety-one the issue now is whether or not we allow the friendly military forces of the united states of america which happens to be the only remaining superpower in the world to visit our country and do military exercises with our armed forces in an an attempt in an attempt to be dispassionate about the issue i have asked myself a two-pronged question one why does the united states want a v f a with us and number two why do our leaders want to have a v f a with the united states number one on the u s motives mr president as u s motives go i venture the following observations first the need for access the u s is by universal admission the only superpower in the world today flowing from that pre-eminent status the united states by auto-appointment now performs global police work with the deferential acquiescence of the rest of the world as the world 's de facto policeman for instance the united states believes that iraq 's saddam hussein is not doing right to his people and so it bombs iraq imposes no fly zones in iraqi air space and shoots down any plane that dares to defy its rule the u s does not like what the drug lords in colombia are doing and so it backs up the anti-drug war in the country that has neutralized not only the drug lords but also some political opponents of president cesar  gavria trujillo the united states does not like what slobodan milosevic ethnic cleansing in kosovo and so it bombs the daylights out of belgrade and other cities of yugoslavia what i 'm trying to say mr president is that since the united states is now the only superpower in the world it looks like it it can do whatever it wants to do in the name of humanitarian intervention or to create a new world order according to its image and likeness nonetheless i think mr president that the united states is es  essentially a democratic country and therefore it wants to ground its police actions on agreements and treaties that are enforceable or justifiable under the law of nations enforceable agreements or treaties on visiting on u s visiting forces are important to the u s so that any challenge to united states'  interest in any region could be met under a legal cover and from the vantage point of a territory close to the challenger and far away from mainland u s a hence i am made to understand that now the united states has v f as with seventy-seven countries around the globe in addition to eighteen military alliances of various sorts that makes mr president ninety-five countries out of a total one hundred eighty-seven united nation members roughly over one half mr president of the world has become integral parts of what somebody has called the shifting plates of armor of the united states  with the v f as in its pocket mr president the united states may then legitimately oversee the activities of the world north to south east to west and do police work in this or that country and in this or that region so that they do not conflict with or do damage to u s interests as george and meredith freedman have said the american navy mr president goes where it wants and does what it wants and the american troops land in eurasia and brush aside enemy armies and they intervene in latin america at will for reasons as trivial as arresting drug dealers of particular relevance to us mr president in connection with the v f a discussion are the sea lanes within or the air spaces above the countries of southeast asia and other asian countries free access to these sea lanes is consider considered of strategic importance to the u s because it is through these sea lanes that vessels ply their cargo especially oil to fuel the economic demands of japan europe and even of the united states free access to the air spaces is likewise of vital importance because u s war planes that sail along the sea routes of southeast asia to their ultimate destinations elsewhere will need the protection of the united states air force the world view of the united states therefore mr president dictates that the united states armed forces need to oversee and police what the nations of the world do in order to ensure the unhampered transaction of global business of which the united states is the main exponent and principal beneficiary in a word the name of the game of united states business as it has always been for the business of the dominant powers of europe or asia is free access to the resources of the world the continued dominion of the domin dominant powers for prolonged periods over the subjugated states that was fueled by their free access to the resources of the enslaved countries has been euphemistically called various names in honor of the dominant powers at different stages of world history the romans called it pax romana great britain called it pax britannica hitler called it  lebenstraum japan would have called it pax nipponica although in fact they opted to call the organization the so-called greater east asia co-prosperity sphere now because of the undu undisputed military and economic supremacy of the u s some american drumbeaters apparently want to call it pax americana  now mr president there is nothing wrong intrinsically with getting access to the resources of any country anywhere in the world to promote business there is nothing wrong for the u s to consider business as its main business but for the united states to draw other countries into its embrace as a spider lures a fly into its parlor is a cause for legitimate concern for the latter an extensive discussion of this issue may however carry us too far a field suffice it to say at this point that gaining access to the resources of the world for the sake of the united states or its allies'  business is not trouble-free it causes friction especially when the u s has to use muscle to ease the flow of business through what the c i a calls choke points or places where shipping may be interdicted by unfriendly forces according to the c i a mr president these include the choke points include the bering strait panama canal luzon strait and the singapore strait with the luzon strait being categorized by the c i a as a possible choke point it stands to reason that the united states will want to ensure that a choking of ship passage will not happen at that point but since there are no longer any u s military bases here from which u s forces could pry open any choking of the free passage of vessels at the luzon strait the ramos administration formulated with the americans the so-called visiting forces agreement which in turn the estrada administration has submitted to the senate for concurrence what does all of this discussion mean mr president it can be the meaning can be capsulized in this phrase  preventing the rise of rogue nations  while it is true mr president that the right of innocent passage of ships and air ships of friendly nations is guaranteed under international law i think the united states out of extreme caution as old man cicero would say  ex abundante cautela wants to plug all loopholes the united states knows that as of today in the year of our lord nineteen hundred ninety-nine nearly every country in this region wants to be its friend some out of lapdog loyalties most others out of pragmatic considerations yet nobody can foresee what the future will bring a new hegemon or a rogue nation may rise to challenge the predominance of the united states and get out of its sphere of influence in fact china mr president in the aftermath of the bombing of its embassy in belgrade by nato planes recently and for historical reasons perhaps is already acting up calling the u s a global bully that wants to heighten conflicts in many parts of the world instead of resorting to diplomacy to end them i do not think mr president that the united states wants to be caught off-guard when a rogue nation may want to strike an independent course of action for itself in any region or in the world the united states mr president would most likely want to prevent that eventuality from ever taking place and what better way to attain that purpose than by cementing friendly relations with the military of any country which as everybody knows is always a force to reckon with especially in developing countries like ours i suggest mr president that the v f a will certainly achieve that objective for the u s under the terms of the v f a the united states forces will come a-visiting not to hobnob with civilian functionaries or even to do a quickie with prostitutes as the silly-minded would want to emphasize as if there will be no prostitution if american soldiers do not visit here nonetheless the american forces will come primarily to exercise with their comrades-at-arms our own soldiers who wearing similar uniforms would take orders in english of course from u s military commanders and test new u s arrangements armaments and experiment with new tactics and new straged strategies defined by u s war experts in furnish fairness mr president let it be said that the military in our country since the administration of the former president fidel v ramos has largely kept to the barracks by that i mean the military did not mount coup attempts against the ramos administration that had become rather endemic to the cory aquino presidency but i am not too sure for how long for even now as we talk the police which used to be an agent of the military has been quiescent and restive under the prodding of some disgruntled police officers 1
Philippines	thank you i vote yes on the v f a and in order to explain my vote i beg permission to place the v f a in the context of contemporary international relations present global context the current generation is about to enter not only a new century but also a new millennium this is a very rare occasion and no generation will experience such a moment again until after a thousand years shall have passed since this is a symbolic moment i humbly submit that this is a propitious time for the senate to pause and reflect on the v f a in the context of the global condition in nineteen ninety-one the philippine senate voted against the extension of the r p - u s military bases agreement from that time in the space of eight years a new world order has emerged the new global power structure is no longer bipolar with the u s and the u s s r as the two poles instead the global power structure is now multipolar with the added multiple poles of china japan western europe eastern europe and developing world states the paradigm shift from bipolarity to multipolarity has several consequences one is that the u s and the soviet union are now unable to control their formal allies the philippines through the association of southeast asian nations or asean can formulate its own policies and even use collective power to influence the policies of the u s the philippines on occasion could even chart our own policies with little regard for the decisions of the u s against this backdrop of international change the flow of events is no longer predictable and it is no longer valid to think of the philippines vis-a-vis the u s in cold war terms or to use the self-conscious vocabulary of vituperation to describe the relationship of the two countries the reordering of international relations is accelerated by the emergence of new actors on the international stage the first generation of actors were states the second generation of actors today consists of multinational corporations when the u s military bases were here multinational corporations or m n cs were viewed as tools of capitalist expansion and exploitation but today third world states including the philippines have come to regard m n cs as potential providers of needed investment capital and technology other new actors include international governmental organizations and non-governmental organizations as a modest observer of our senate debates on the v f a i was sometimes left with the impression that the arguments back and forth would have been best appreciated in a bipolar world that was based on the old east-west conflict but the bipolar world has already been consigned to the dustbin of history we now realize that in nineteen ninety-one when the senate voted although the berlin wall had fallen the meaning of the end of the cold war was still unknown to the members of the senate at that time today based on the historical time line we have begun to realize the meaning of the end of the cold war for by nineteen ninety-one what had been the single state of yugoslavia had become five new states which are now the theater of a bloody clash of cultures by nineteen ninety-two the soviet union had disappeared replaced by fifteen new states of which eleven joined the so-called commonwealth of independent states with no soviet union there is no more cold war and without a cold war the philippines is no longer in danger of being manipulated into the status of a client state the philippines is now a free agent and our break in recording  which can only be those that are self-imposed thus the world of the erstwhile military bases agreement is far different from our present world of the visiting forces agreement our world is much more complicated and uncertain the united states itself is searching for its role in the post cold war world it is true that the u s remains the world 's unrivalled military superpower but at the same time the u s has the world 's largest economic debt and suffers from serious domestic problems the world of the v f a is a changed world western europe is forging a single economic market m n cs are investing in the former soviet union eastern europe and china the flash points of the world continue to breed civil wars national liberation conflict and ethnic warfare fundamentalist islam insists on its own unique world rejecting both communism and western solutions to social problems here in asia developing world states including the philippines struggle to recover from the asian economic crisis within this kaleidoscopic universe when we vote on the v f a we do so against the background of a contest for leadership of asia between china and japan fought on the battleground of economic growth on the one hand japan is the greatest commercial empire on earth and the second most important power in the world if the u s refuses to maintain substantial forces in the east asian region japan will take a larger defense role on the other hand china looks to become the world 's largest economy by the year twenty twenty a generation from now parts of china will be richer than europe or north america today but because it is too divided it is not likely to achieve superpower status by twenty twenty in any event during the next century that starts next year the rest of the world will be frightened of china hence a benign u s standing alone can no longer guarantee the security of the east asian region instead the security of our region will be determined by the relationship between japan and china during this process the philippine outlook should be shaped not by cold war templates but by our experience as a state of the developing world also known as the third world the south or the less developed countries i refer to the philippine experience of a colonial past sharply opposed social and economic classes and economic underdevelopment and poverty we need to recognize that because of the experience we in the philippines tend to view the industrialized market economies of the u s as both the cause and the perpetrator of our poverty we also tend to feel that the current international system relegates us to a permanently inferior position but this self-knowledge should not remain a bitter element of our foreign policy rather self-knowledge should teach us to be a conscious actor in international politics concept of national interest one of the easiest things to do is to say that voting on the v f a should be determined by national interest but quote national interest unquote is a concept that has no universal meaning the best that political science can do is to provide an enumeration of the criteria for national interest these criteria include economics ideology power military security and advantage morality and legality cultural affinity or even race and ethnic issues thus national interest could be defined on the basis of either objective or subjective factors objective factors include economic strength military capability and the size of the resource base subjective factors include morality legality or ideology whether the v f a will promote philippine national interest depends upon whether the person defining national interest gives preference to objective or subjective gain however it is also widely accepted that there are three basic fundamental interests physical survival including territorial integrity economic well-being and national self-determination at any rate it is an accepted principle of political science that national interest is not so much a constant set of national objectives as it is a changing approximation of what the leaders of a country view as important when the senate votes on the v f a we the senators are actually defining the national interest like the concept of national interest the concept of national security is also undergoing metamorphosis in the contemporary international system the term quote  national security unquote is no longer commonly defined as military defense it now includes broad-based policies to improve the standards of the population in education health society and the environment in the post cold war era economic prosperity and welfare concerns have become more important as national goals accordingly economics is now described as quote the continuation of power by other means unquote admittedly security dilemmas and territorial disputes persist in the developing parts of the globe such as ours asia pacific currently represents a zone of turmoil in contrast to the zone of peace in the developed world not only the philippines but also other asian states most notably japan are apprehensive over the recent arms build-up by china as well as the china claim to the spratlys six states including the philippines claim the spratlys some sixty rocky atolls in the south china sea because they are believed to contain as much as one trillion u s dollars in oil and gas deposits as the spratly example shows geo-politics as the world has known it since nineteen forty-five is dead the newly defined battle ground is geo-economics because of the rise of regional trading blocks such as apec or even the proposed afta we in the philippines might find that if our country is not a member of a team we will not be able to sit at the table it is possible that the new international economic order a reordering of the trilogy of aid trade and foreign investment is now dead the new imperialists are not necessarily the developed states like the u s or u k but lending organizations like the world bank and the international monetary fund the philippines as a middle power the philippines is categorized as a middle power  which is defined as a state which cannot afford the large and flexible force structures of the major powers but which has attained a credible minimum level of defense self-sufficiency naturally as a middle power we should seek to enhance our security but while we seek to strengthen our capacity to defend ourselves from being drawn into armed conflicts we do not have the financial means to increase our defense self-reliance hence our only available option is to participate in collective or cooperative security arrangements with other powers the mutual defense treaty is a collective security arrangement because it proposes a collective response to aggression by contrast the v f a is a cooperative security arrangement because it involves bilateral confidence building and capability strengthening our government pursues this strategy as dictated by the configuration of the international system and by the level and immediacy of perceived danger it should be accepted that the philippines is not as far advanced in the nation-building process as other states in the region such as australia and new zealand this explains why philippine national security encompasses both domestic stability and international security while our national security has come to be synonymous with economic security our country is also concerned about secessionism and the disintegrating effects of ethnic religious or class tension accordingly we should not overlook the problem of internal stability the need to maintain domestic security in our country is a powerful factor in the foreign and defense policy calculations of the estrada administration during the present situation the philippines as a middle power is compelled to adopt the common strategy followed all over the world for reducing our vulnerabilities this strategy is to augment our military power not just by building up our own capabilities but by enlisting the aid of a major power which major power should be our formal ally following the advice of thucydides after his study of the peloponnesian war we should look for an ally with whom we share a common threat according to thucydides mutual fear is the most solid basis upon which to organize an alliance our present ally is the u s are there compelling arguments for discarding this ally i have heard none that would be logical in a post cold war world the r p - u s mutual defense treaty is already in place it provides for the cases federis  meaning the situation in which mutual commitments are to become operational the cases federis is set out in article four quote each party recognizes that an armed attack in the pacific area on either of the parties would be dangerous to its own peace and safety and declares that it would act to meet the common dangers in accordance with its constitutional processes unquote thus the cases federis is very precise there has to be an armed attack by contrast the ensuing commitment is vague the u s will act in accordance with its constitution some quarters think this commitment is too vague and would prefer what is called a hair trigger clause meaning an automatic commitment to military action 1
Philippines	your eminence alfonso cardinal lopez trujillo papal legate for the fourth world meeting of families your eminence jaime cardinal sin archbishop of manila your eminences members of the college of cardinals your excellency archbishop antonio franco our apostolic nuncio your excellencies the most reverend archbishops and bishops reverend sisters and brothers the delegations from the various countries of the world and the forty-two babies officially registered in this world meeting of families my brothers and sisters in the lord good morning audience replies good morning  when our holy father announced that the world meeting of families will be held in the philippines the bishops conference of the philippines said it is very difficult so we passed on the job to archbishop to the archbishop of manila cardinal sin who performs miracles we begin the fourth world meeting of families with the celebration of the holy eucharist the sacrament of love that jesus left for us his family of faith the household of god the family of god how profoundly meaningful and immeasurably without price is god 's gift of the eucharist for us and for every family let us reflect briefly on the eucharist and the family the eucharist tells us what kind of love god has for us and how we in turn must love one another the cross of jesus and the holy eucharist are the ultimate symbols of authentic love for on the cross jesus himself fulfills the word he had declared to his disciples there is no greater love than this for one to lay down his life for a friend his body broken on the cross his blood being poured out as an offering to god his father for the sake of all jesus demonstrates the nature and extent of his love completely unconditional utterly sacrificial totally self-giving it is from the cross my brothers and sisters that a new people of god a new family of faith was born born in the pangs of the passion and death of jesus born in god 's incomparable love the promise in jeremiah the prophet that we read this morning of a new covenant and a new law written in the hearts of god of god 's people is fulfilled at the last supper jesus gives a new commandment love one another as i have loved you so you also should love one another our second liturgical reading from the first letter of john adds if we love one another god remains in us the blood that jesus shared with his apostles at the last supper is the seal of a new and everlasting covenant every time then that we celebrate the eucharist we also celebrate the new covenant and our birthday as god 's people god 's own family and if the commandment of love is at the heart of the new family of god we did not wonder that the ri at the rite of holy matrimony with which a new family a new human family begins the new husband is reminded of the words of jesus and later the words of saint paul to love his wife as christ loves his church today 's gospel reading is the beautiful story of the boy jesus in the temple it tells us what it is to be a family of love in the story mary and joseph bring their son of twelve years old on the regular pilgrimage to jerusalem on the feast of the passover the same feast that jesus would trans later transform into the new passover of the family of god the mystery of his passion death and resurrection the cross and the eucharist and in jerusalem mary and joseph leave jesus to follow devotedly and faithfully the religious traditions of israel traditions that they had taught him at home traditions of believing of praying and of worshiping at the end of the celebration mary and joseph discover that jesus is not with them they search for him with great concern and anxiety but with the intuition of parents who know the hopes and dreams of their son they go back to the temple and there they see the young son astounding the teachers of the law with his intelligent answers and questions to the concern of his beloved mother jesus lovingly and respectfully responds why were you looking for me did you not know that i must be in my father 's house did you not know that i must be about my father 's work in his heart jesus hears the call of god to go beyond his home beyond his village in nazareth but now he must yet return home with his parents mary and joseph saint luke sums up the life of jesus with mary and joseph very simply jesus was obedient to them obedient to their teachings break in recording  the love and life of jesus revolved most obviously around mary and joseph but most of all his love and life was centered on god it was also true for mary and joseph life in the holy family is a lesson for every family in every family life must be a life of love shared generously to overflowing love that is finally expressed in service life in the family must be centered on god this is the secret of advancing in wisdom and grace before god and man and this too is the key to confronting the many challenges families of the world face today from the very beginning then my brothers and sisters the family as founded on the totally self-sacrificing love of god is fundamental good news for the third millennium but today you and i know that the family is facing the grave challenge of a materialistic and secularist culture that is bringing bringing in a new morality with no religious foundation and this emerging global culture attacks fundamental scriptural and ecclesial teachings and the very nature of life nature of death love and marriage men women and children it is a challenge that the world has never known before because especially because it is so quickly disseminated through the tools of social communication in the multicultural and multireligious asian environment where the church is a tiny minority of less than two percent and in a democratic social order such as the philippines sometimes the church seems to be but one feeble prophetic voice against many contrary voices even more strident and sometimes better heard than that of the church we hope therefore that the fourth world meeting of families will inspire encourage and strengthen the filipino family and the asian family we in the philippines we are a poor country but rich indeed in religious faith but sadly however we sometimes tend to separate faith from life and that is why at the beginning of the third millennium in january two thousand one the church in the philippines has deliberately chosen the filipino catholic family as the focal point of evangelization concretely this pastoral thrust of the church in the philippines means that all diocesan and parochial pastoral programs of evangelization will be directed toward the renewal of the family in this way the filipino catholic family as the domestic church will become an evangelized and evangelizing cell of basic ecclesial communities of covenant communities village chapels and parishes all over the philippines at this point then my brothers and sisters may i express some hopes not only for filipino catholic families but also for all the families of our world hope with me we hope that the fourth world meeting of families will deepen strengthen and quicken the faith of every family help transform every family into a faith that into a family of faith that loves shares and serves a faith that does justice we hope that every family would be a true sanctuary of love and life ever alert and committed to defending and promoting human life in that seamless continuum that god created it to have from the very beginning we hope that all families would be totally imbued with the values of the gospel and of the kingdom of god so as to be a powerful gospel leaven in society we hope that every catholic family would be a school of faith of love and prayer guiding the hearts of parents and their children to holiness in the kingdom of god and to participation in the whole mission of the church we hope that every catholic family would be a fertile seed bed of vocation not only to a socially transformational lay state but also to the priestly and religious life while renewed in its sense of mission to its milieu even extending its missionary concern ad jentes ad dextero and ad vitam  and finally we pray that the fourth world meeting of families would assist the church in the philippines to realize these hopes it is in this light my brothers and sisters that we filipinos are truly honored and privileged to be the first asian host of the firth fourth world meeting of families we are deeply thankful to our holy father pope john paul the second and to his personal special legate his eminence alfonso cardinal lopez trujillo and to them both mabuhay  our country is one that is wonderfully devoted to our blessed mother mary whom we invoke in the litany as the queen of the family and we beg today our mother and queen to be with us to intercede for us and keep us united with her son my brothers and sisters in the one family of god the world over with the joy and peace of our lord jesus and in behalf of the more than one hundred bishops of the philippines break in recording and into the one break in recording heart of the filipino family break in recording mabuhay 
Philippines	 first section of speech omitted because it had too many quotations i propose to cluster the rights enumerated in  familiaris consortio under these headings first the right to a family 's integrity and be respected in its freedoms second the right of the family to receive its share of socio-economic benefits and third the right of the family to pass on its faith and its values to the next generation family integrity the rights of a family are directed principally at its integrity the importance of the integrity of a family is emphasized in the catechism for filipino catholics which teaches as follows open quote  actually our christian families like the church itself in some real way share in the communion of persons and love of the blessed trinity  for in the mutual sharing of thoughts affections and in all their ups and downs christian families are actively creative like the father in offering prayers and sacrifices to god they share in jesus the incarnate son 's own prayer and redemptive sacrifice finally christian families form a community of interpersonal love by being inspired and strengthened by the indwelling holy spirit hardly anything nobler can be said of the catholic family than that in a privileged manner it not only resembles but shares in the communion of the triune god  but a multitude of factors and circumstances threaten to destroy the integrity of the family one example is a slavish attachment to communication media children today rush home from school not to the loving embrace of their parents who may still be at work anyway but to some cartoon show i tremble at the thought that children will soon know t v characters better than their parents laughter  indeed applause; station break; break in recording  and then there is the internet where a wealth of knowledge useful to any family is sabotaged by silent threats there are child molesters who choose their targets through the internet there is also the threat of child pornography hate websites that encourage the use of violence against certain groups of people and other materials that contradict what the pope calls wholesome recreation that fosters family values we also note that a growing number of filipinos and of citizens of underdeveloped countries go to other countries to find work the intention of course is noble to provide for their families better through more lucrative employment than can be offered by their economically beleaguered countries the costs however are indisputably high sometimes the spouses of overseas workers or the workers themselves abandon their marital vows perhaps out of loneliness even when spouses remain true to each other their children may become distant as they grow up without the attention of either or both parents in all these cases there is a violation of what the holy father calls the right to the intimacy of conjugal and family life and the right to the stability of the bond of marriage and such violation arises from the breach of another of the family 's right that is to have adequate means to support a family there is also the unspeakable evil of sexual crimes occurring within the family rape is evil in itself but incestuous rape is even more dehumanizing sexual crimes in the family are alarmingly becoming common we can attribute this trend to evil influences in the mass media or to the breaking of families for economic or emotional reasons regardless of the reason however these crimes are a great injustice to all families and they must be stopped we must however shun the error of seeing the state as the principal threat to the family while it is regrettable that the policies of some states have not always been helpful to the family the fact remains that some of the most serious transgri transgressions of the rights of the family are perpetrated by members of the family themselves as the family struggles for justice it must then struggle with its members so they become in the first instance champions of and not obstacles to justice for the family the state does its part in the family 's struggle for integrity its struggle for justice i am proud that the constitution of the philippines is one of few basic legal documents with express provision on the family section twelve of article two thereof or the declaration of principles and state policies solemnly announces this state policy open quote  the state recognizes the sanctity of family life and shall protect and strengthen the life of the mother and the life of the unborn from conception  the natural and primary right and duty of parents in the rearing of the youth for civic efficiency and the development of character shall receive the support of the government close quote  it also devotes for the family one separate article this is article fifteen i have yet to see another constitution from among civilized nations which enshrines a separate article on the family in many respects section twelve of article two of our constitution is consonant with fundamental catholic teachings on the family it is a fundamental norm in construing the provisions of a constitution that every term is accorded significance and that the constitution uses sanctity i stress sanctity  is both philosophically and legally significant then it suggests an order higher than the merely legal to which the family must be referred it enshrines the principle of subsidiarity because the family is guaranteed protection as an open quote autonomous social institution close quote with the result that matters within the purveyance of the family shall not be arrogated by the state itself every filipino family should be particularly proud of the fact that the constitution goes so far in protecting the integrity of the human family and in upholding the sanctity of human life the natural and primary right and duty of parents to rear the youth imposes on the state an obligation to distribute the benefits and resources of the nation to enable the parents to exercise this primary right and duty then we have section one of article fifteen which provides as follows the state recognizes the filipino family as the foundation of the nation close quote accordingly it shall strengthen its solidi solidarity and actively promote its total development section three thereof enumerates these rights of the filipino family one the right of spouses to found a family in accordance with the religious convictions and the demands of responsible parenthood two the right of children to assistance including proper care and nutrition and special protection from all forms of neglect abuse cruelty exploitation and other conditions prejudicial to their development three the right of the family to a family living wage and income and four the right of families or family associations to participate in the planning and implementation of policies and programs that affect them  i will now take up socio-economic benefits the discussions i just made on the rights of the family and the duty of the state to protect and enhance these rights illustrate the demands of distributive justice that the family must receive its share of the benefits and the protection as well as the guarantee of the freedoms it can rightly claim the church has very often been chided for being blissfully ignorant of the travails of many a present-day family of being naive about the social and economic forces that strain its resiliency very often these criticisms come in the wake of the church insistence on its moral teaching especially on the regulation of births and contraceptive practices while in a democracy the beliefs of all and the rights of all to act as they believe provided these do not contravene the rights of others will for all time be upheld it is my position both as a minister of the law and a son of the church that holy mother church serves humanity best when she faithfully and unhesatingly mispronunciation of unhesitatingly  teaches as she should teach opportune et importune in season and out of season applause  the church knows the travails of families in gaudium et spes the second vatican council observes open quote the economic social psychological social and civil climate of today has a severely disturbing effect on family life  there are also the serious and aram alarming problems arising in many parts of the world as a result of population expansion on all of these counts an anguish of conscience is being generated an anguish of conscience is being generated close quote  consequently the same council summarizes the obligations of the state in this regard and the demands of justice towards the family i quote civil authority should consider it a sacred duty to acknowledge the true nature of marriage and the family to protect and foster them to safeguard public morality and promote domestic prosperity  the rights of parents to procreate and educate children in the family must be safeguarded there should also be welfare legislation and provision of various kinds for the made for the protection and assistance of those who unfortunately have been deprived of the benefits of family life  hence the philippines has definitely gone a long way in providing socio-economic benefits to the family there are as well non-governmental organizations which unceasingly work for the welfare of the family needless to say the failure of the state to comply with its obligations to the family or to promote and enhance its rights and provide it socio-economic benefits justly due it would be an act of injustice to the family faith and values the second plenary council of the philippines identifies the christian family as a open quote a worker of renewal close quote it teaches and i quote the family is meant by god to be the first school of discipleship where the parents are the first catechists of their children and where all the members mutually evangelize each other  it is also the first school of evangelization where the members learn to share with others the grace and light of christ close quote article one of the family code of the philippines makes it clear that the provisions of the family code as well as of other laws on the family are designed principally to safeguard marriage as open quote the foundation of the family and an inviolable social institution close quote article one hundred forty-nine of the same code describes the family as open quote a basic social institution which public policy cherishes and protects close quote the legal consequence of this esteem is also made clear open quote  family relations are governed by law and no custom practice or agreement destructive of the family shall be recognized or given effect  close quote this then is the underlying ethos of philippine family law protecting the family through the institutions of law and the mechanisms of the justice system while the philippines like other democracies believes in the separation of church and state our political legal and jurisprudential tradition have never read this constitutional principle of separation as establishing a secularist an atheistic or an agnostic state when article twen two hundred twenty of our family code recites the rights and duties of parents toward their children it is almost as if one were reading from a classic treatise of moral theology these rights and duties under the family code are as follows  one to keep them in their company to support educate and instruct them by right precept and good example and to provide for their upbringing in keeping with their means two to give them love and affection advice and counsel companionship and understanding three to provide them with moral and spiritual guidance inculcate in them honesty integrity self-discipline self-reliance industry and thrift stimulate their interest in civil affairs and inspire them in compliance with the duties of citizenship  thus does the state manifest that it is its concern that children receive moral and spiritual guidance from their parents clearly we in the philippines must struggle as all of you must in your own countries break in recording to our visitors with the delicate balance between a healthy pluralism and the consecration to values and virtues that foster the flourishing of the human heart and spirit it will remain a state responsibility to shield the youth from pernicious influences this is why we have harsh laws penalizing the peddling and use of dangerous drugs and substances this also explains why the exploitation of children in different forms is a crime in this jurisdiction even when or especially when perpetrated by the children 's parents in keeping with the treaty obligations of the republic of the philippines under the convention of the rights of the child the legislature enacted republic act seventy-six ten and amendatory laws that protect the child from all forms of exploitation and abuse and that endeavor to keep the child within the protective embrace of the family but likewise amp  amply providing for those unfortunate situations where children are victims of dysfunctional families exercising its rule-making power vested in it by the constitution the supreme court of the philippines has promulgated special rules to protect the child the rule for the examination of the child witness the rule for juveniles in conflict with the law and the rule for the commitment of children while awaiting the organization of family courts already created by law and recognizing that family and domestic problems cannot and should not be dealt with in the same way as ordinary matters of litigation the supreme court has designated many courts throughout the country to sit as family courts i can assure you that the philippines supreme court has been and will always be on the side of the family in its struggle for justice  applause  i cannot help but voice the concern that many families have abdicated the privilege of passing on cherished values to the next generation laws alone will not guarantee that our children and their children will live their lives by the values that have guided and molded their forebears the family 's struggle for justice will also take then the form of a struggle for its members to be what god and human society call them to be bearers of the values of future generations foremost of these values is pakikipagkapwa tao  which is definitely more than just amiability or affability it is true concern empathy and charity for others it is being a neighbor to others as the gospel uses the descriptive  neighbor stress neighbor especially to the poor and the weak it is in the family where the concept of human rights must first make sense and this means that every member must deal with the other with a sincere regard and genuine respect for elemental human rights it is the family that must teach the young the precious lesson that the greatest privilege one can ever enjoy is that of standing from the table shedding off one 's finery and stooping to wash the feet of one 's brothers and sisters this is love beyond measure when the family is thus faithful to its calling true to its vocation it becomes the frontier for the world 's struggle for justice and its members the agents and the prophets of the often unarticulated cry for justice the greatest tribute that can be given to such a family is for all to be able to say of it see how they love one another  after all it was thus that the master the christ wished his disciples to be known thus every family must grow on the foundations of love and be nourished by love 
Philippines	mr president distinguished colleagues of the senate i vote for concurrence and may i explain my vote mr president in this chamber i was among the first if not indeed the very first to announce support for the r p - u s visiting forces agreement this is a matter of record and it was long before i had been asked to co-sponsor this resolution of concurrence i have not always been an advocate mr president reading the text for the first time and reading it as a stand-alone document without reference to anything else i felt the agreement would be easier to attack than to defend and the opposition tried to prove it one had to read the visiting forces agreement within the context of our r p - u s mutual defense treaty and the vast net of security treaties between the united states and its allies including seventy-seven status of forces agreements in order to see its real meaning purpose and usefulness that did not require revealed knowledge only a less disinterested view of our security and the larger security environment of the asia pacific since then i have had the opportunity of reaffirming my support for the agreement and sharing some of the insults and abuse heaped upon its supporters by its most rabid opponents mr president distinguished colleagues as we concur in this agreement i wish to make of record my sincere appreciation and thanks to the chairs of the committees on foreign relations and national defense and security for asking me to share the burden of moving this measure on the floor the honor was unexpected unsought and undeserved but i was more than pleased to accept the challenge i hope i have not been unhelpful in trying to make our people see why we need the v f a as much as the united states and the asia pacific region need it why it will do us more good than harm and why concurrence is the right thing to do for this senate but i have said enough and our people have heard enough from me on this subject i will not tax their patience or their good will by repeating what i said earlier in the debates or by adding another ten thousand words we need sixteen votes to concur in this agreement that number has just been reached the vote i cast is the seventeenth vote in favor of this agreement all that is needed now is for the chair after the next speaker to gavel the end of the voting and to declare that the senate has concurred in the agreement and our government can then inform the united states government that it has completed the constitutional process required for the visiting forces agreement to come into force and effect mr president vanity may tempt us to call this a resounding victory for our side or cause that would be exceedingly self-congratulatory self-indulgent and over-simplistic and i would not walk into it for me this is a victory for the entire senate and for the entire country regardless of what position everyone took during the debate it is a victory for the democratic process specifically it is a victory for the joint committees for steering the measure patiently on the floor after months of study public hearings and committee debates it 's a victory for the majority of the senate for standing by the agreement despite all types of pressure including warnings of death and damnation from the most unlikely sources it 's a victory for the majority of our people for expressing themselves clearly and soberly through countless resolutions in support of the agreement it 's a victory for the opposition in the senate for examining every provision phrase and particle of the agreement for any possible imperfection blemish or defect despite their lack of numbers they used every parliamentary and legal device in a brave if unsuccessful effort to stop the clock sway the senate thwart concurrence they lost in that bid but they won our admiration for giving it their best shot up to the very end and it is a victory for the motley opposition in the street for waging a spirited campaign despite the odds some of their more exuberant numbers managed to interrupt our proceedings and managed to explode a few pill boxes or fire crackers some of them resorted to the return of political graffiti on the streets but all that has added vibrance and vigor to the debate and we are none the worse for it our only regret my only regret mr president is that while we sought support for the v f a for reasons of national security and external defense we saw some of our dearest friends trying to mobilize the church or being mobilized by some people in the name of the church against the agreement for reasons that had nothing to do at all with the ministry or practice of their faith which unhappily happens to be ours as well even as we vote this political mobilization is going on outside in a last-minute effort to sway the senate to reject the agreement these are brothers and sisters of ours in the faith for whom we have nothing but love and respect with them i have been pleased to be associated on many great moral issues with them i have prayed fasted and marched for some great cause with them i would march to the very ends of the earth for any of the great moral and religious issues and causes that bind us in one communion and one church but this time we stand unhappily on opposite sides we driven by principle public duty and conscience and they invoking a special if not exclusive use of a faith that is common to most of us on both sides of the debate for reasons of prud prudence mr president i have tried not to talk about this at all during the debates but a couple of days ago i received on the telephone an unexpected and most unusual request it was a stranger who called friendly and respectful yes but a stranger nevertheless and with a deep anguish in her voice she said  kit huwag mong pabayaan ang ating simbahan huwag mo siyang tatalikdan ikaw ang aming pag-asa at inaasahan sa senado mas mahalaga ba sa 'yo si erap at ang v f a kaysa ating cardinal at mga kapatid mong katoliko  it is one of the saddest and most difficult conversations i 've ever had in my entire life and i didn't quite know what to say i tried to explain that my catholic faith which is more important to me than my public office or anything else in my life had absolutely nothing to do with my position on the visiting forces agreement or on any other non-moral non-ethical and non-religious issue which i have had to deal with and that i was supporting the visiting forces agreement only according to my best lights as god has given me the light to see what is best for our country and people in the area of national security and external defense neither was my position a result of my having made a choice between my support for president joseph ejercito estrada and my loyalty to my bishop his eminence jaime cardinal sin that is a completely absurd and unexistent choice one has nothing to do with the other one does not cancel the other out the v f a as i have just said is not a moral ethical or religious matter and my desire to help president estrada succeed despite my being a member of a different political party and despite my previous criticisms of him before he became president does not in any way alter or diminish my love respect and best wishes for the good health and good humor of his eminence the cardinal archbishop of manila whose loyal parishioner i am in all my public life mr president i have always kept a strict distinction between my personal and professional interests and those of the nation i have never confused one with the other and i have never put my interests above those of the nation in the case of the visiting forces agreement i have no personal interests at all it is all for the nation which deserves a future infinitely better and brighter than what would otherwise be possible where we to leave it solely in the hands of those who would have us standing naked in the wind without anything at all to protect us against the storm as a roman catholic i have always known the distinction between the clergy and religious on the one hand and the laity on the other between church authority and personal freedom again i have never confused one with the other i have some close personal associations and friendships with many priests and bishops of long standing but i have always behaved as a layman aware of the rights and duties of a layman and with no ambitions of ever becoming a cleric or of ever behaving like one i go to a priest as often as i can for my sins but never for counsel on anything political for i do not believe it is right or just or even in good taste or good form for an elected official or anyone at all to ask a priest whether or not he should run for this office or that vote for this candidate or that to support or oppose this treaty resolution or bill all this i tried to explain to our good sister on the telephone but nothing i said seemed to make an impression our conversation had become a dialogue of the deaf to everything i said she answered with something that sounded like a buddhist chant makisama ka makiisa ka  she seemed more determined than the duke of norfolk trying to compel thomas more in robert bolt 's play a man for all seasons to give his assent to the king 's marriage since all the other great men of england had already given theirs do we remember that scene says norfolk but dammit thomas look at those names  you know those men can't you do what i did and come with us for fellowship  and thomas answers and when we stand before god and you ascend to paradise for doing according to your conscience and i 'm damned for not doing according to mine will you come with me for fellowship  like everyone else in this chamber mr president i am a citizen in the service of the state but i am first and above all a man a man who for all his sins tries to practice his faith and serve his church as best he can as i aspire not so much to have a good name in history as to have a place in eternity face to face with our god i would not for anything in the world put my politics above my faith i would not use my faith in the service of my politics for i know that while i belong to my faith and to my church my faith and my church do not belong to me as material possessions to be used for any reason whatsoever and i would be pained as i am pained now to see any brother or sister of mine in the faith use that same faith or the church or for any personal or political purpose and in such facile manner in my own small way mr president i have fought every attempt on the part of the state for state authorities to propose their own religion or their own morality in order to encroach into the rights of the church  in the past in the past this went by the name of caesaro popism  a word that combines the words caesar and  pope to designate a phenomenon or a time when the emperor also tried to act as pope it will continue to be known as such until we give it a new name in my own small way i have denounced this evil wherever i 've seen it and i 'll continue to do so for as long as i live but i do not believe i can in good conscience oppose and denounce the slightest hint of caesaro popism wherever and whenever it appears while accepting by default the opposite disorder arising from a sad and mistaken desire on the part of some of our dearest friends to pronounce a church position on a morally neutral ethically neutral and religiously neutral document the visiting forces agreement is a technical document it seeks to provide a legal mechanism to facilitate the visit of u s forces for purposes and activities previously approved by the philippine government in the spirit of the nineteen fifty-one mutual defense treaty between our two countries 1
Philippines	the topic that was assigned to me to reflect upon is  the christian family and the paschal mystery  wow a heavy topic and the official program of the congress adds a subtitle to the topic and i think it is equally important because it indicates how we should address the topic and the subtitle is dialogue and the spirituality of the cross  so we shall reflect on the christian family as a community formed in dialogue and how the paschal mystery is the driving spiritual force of any genuine dialogue so my reflection will consist of three parts the first part addresses the question what is the paschal mystery and what is dialogue then i move to the second part the paschal mystery as dialogue par excellence and the final portion is a reflection on the family and the spirituality of the paschal mystery so the first part what is the paschal mystery what is dialogue in the second letter of saint paul to the corinthians he says that every christian or disciple of jesus must carry in his or her body the death of jesus so that the life of jesus may also be manifested a christian therefore is one who bears in his or her person and life the mark of the paschal mystery the mark of jesus 's death and rising to new life and let us be reminded it is not a physical mark like the color of the hair or like the mole that i have here on my chin it is a spiritual mark it is a spiritual principle that defines a whole way of being human and of living in the world and if it is true that the christian lives by the power of the paschal mystery i think we can say also that it applies to every community that claims and wants to be christian including the family a christian family must live by the mark and the power of the paschal mystery of jesus but then we ask what precisely is the paschal mystery now many theologians pastors and spiritual writers through the ages have given us valuable insights into the paschal mystery but for our purposes i would like to present the paschal mystery as god 's desire coming from pure love to gift the world with fullness of life let me repeat the paschal mystery as god 's desire coming from pure love to gift the world with fullness of life and this gift of life is offered through the crucified jesus who is raised back to life life freely and lovingly given in death brings forth new and abundant life for the world i repeat life freely and lovingly given in death brings forth new and abundant life for the world and if we notice the paschal mystery described the way i just described it follows the very movement of love an offering of life so that others may have life i don't know what you think but i think this is an acceptable understanding of the paschal mystery what do you think  pwede na ba ahh pwede na audience laughs  okay so we shall use this particular though limited understanding to reflect on dialogue within the christian family so now let us inquire about dialogue now again so many philosophers psychologists and spiritual guides have explored the reality of dialogue but for this conference my working description of  dialogue is a mutuality of interiority it is an exchange of what is most intimate between two or more persons so dialogue happens when the gift of self freely shared is freely received and results in an equal gifting of self so if you notice again the movement of dialogue is the same movement of love so i will try to demonstrate now how in the paschal mystery the so-called drama of jesus 's cross and resurrection we find a supreme form of dialogue in the supreme manifestation of love i move now to my second part the paschal mystery as dialogue par excellence and here i invite everyone to meditate i will dwell on three aspects of the paschal mystery interpreted from the perspective of dialogue first of all the paschal mystery is about jesus 's eternal love towards the father a love that enables him to engage in a dialogue with the father characterized by availability a dialogue of availability the father has a dream for the world it is the dream of a lover it is a plan to bring life and love to every creature so that all may be united to god and to each other let us imagine the divine dream as love flowing from the very heart of god and it reaches every creature it is love flowing from the heart of god to every corner of the world to every moment of history to every stratum of human life to every thought of the mind to every beat of the heart to every tear of a poor person to every burden of a parent to every smile of a child imagine love becoming everything in everything and for this love god did not spare the only son but gave him up for us all but let us not think that god the father coerced first the son the way an abuser handles a victim no jesus makes himself available to abba for the fulfillment of the father 's dream jesus himself says that no one takes his life away from him but he lays it down freely this is jesus 's obedience that comes from a heart that truly loves the father is fascinated by the father and the father 's plan of love so for the father and for the plan of the father jesus makes himself unconditionally free and at the disposal of the mission given to him by the father from the incarnation up to the resurrection jesus surrenders himself fully to the rule guidance and prompting of the holy spirit of mission so that as the son he could be one with the flow of the father 's love for the world and humanity this dialogue of availability this being at the disposal of the fulfillment of the father 's will was maintained by jesus even when he could hardly see the very meaning of his mission do you remember his agony in the garden there the meaning of his mission becomes dark escapes his grasp he is thrown into confusion loneliness and aloneness and in a pathetic way jesus begs his disciples to stay with him to assure his confused soul with their presence he was inviting them to dialogue but they failed but at that point when all meaning seems to have disappeared what keeps jesus going is his option in favor of the fulfillment of the will of the father it is simply love that enables him to persevere even where meaningfulness is elusive and on the cross where the father seems to have abandoned him jesus in turn abandons his spirit to the father even in the silence of the father jesus continues his dialogue of total availability all for love all for mission some of you might say maybe at that point in jesus 's life he was probably engaging in a monologue rather than a dialogue the father was silent and the disciples could not care less huh but for jesus the cross was not a monologue but a dialogue with the father waiting for fulfillment in jesus 's cross we realize that dialogue is never interrupted where there is love where there is love there is no end to dialogue secondly the paschal mystery manifests also jesus 's love for humanity that takes the form of a dialogue of solidarity with and compassion for erring sinners a dialogue of solidarity with and compassion for erring sinners yes it is true the paschal mystery speaks of jesus 's love and availability towards the father but on the other hand it is also jesus 's active gift of life for us sinful humanity in the gospel of saint john it is said having loved his own who were in the world he loved them to the end  it is as much obedience to the father as love for us that impels jesus to suffer and die on the cross this love for humanity takes concrete form in the son of god 's humility his voluntary decision to empty himself of the glory and splendor of his divine state in order to share in humanity 's condition break in recording which is the apex of human aloneness furthermore as though this act of humility were not enough the son of god even chooses to die not in the intensive care unit of some fancy hospital but he chose to die humiliated on a cross all through self-emptying there is a preference for defenselessness as the way of establishing a dialogue of solidarity with human beings he empties himself totally in order to give himself totally the more complete the self-emptying is the more complete is the self-giving indeed self-emptying is the other name of self-giving by this dialogue jesus no longer distances his condition and destiny from those of sinners he freely embraces the horror the loneliness and the poverty that we human beings know only too well because of our sin without him committing sin for our sake god made him who knew no sin to be sin  so this is another aspect of the dialogue of solidarity namely compassion by solidarity he who has no sin becomes a co-sufferer of sinners compassion drives him to go to the place of the dead not as someone alive but as someone who has died the paschal mystery tells us how much jesus loves us in freely embracing the suffering that is ours due to sin our sinfulness blocks us from dialoguing with jesus but he pursues the dialogue by suffering our suffering crying out our cries dying our death for jesus the cross was not a monologue but a dialogue with us waiting for fulfillment in jesus 's cross we learn that dialogue cannot be interrupted where there is solidarity and compassion and finally the paschal mystery is completed in the resurrection and glorification of the crucified jesus the father receives jesus 's life offered on the cross resulting in the father 's sharing of that life to the world as the fullness of life in the resurrection the father and son engage in a dialogue of mutual acceptance which leads to their dialogue of sharing of life too with the world by the outpouring of the holy spirit so the death of jesus did not end on the cross it ended in his return to the father in order to live fully and eternally in the father 's presence and love the glorification of jesus signifies the father 's break in recording offered by the son on the cross in the resurrection the father affirms the son who on the cross felt abandoned and neglected in the resurrection the father justifies the life of jesus that was rejected by sinners in the resurrection the father proclaims to the world this is my son the resurrection is as it were the stage on which the father presents to the world jesus as the only begotten son the resurrection is the father giving to jesus the name above every other name and so the resurrection also reveals the face of god as a father after all he did not abandon his son so the dialogue of availability of the son on the cross has finally received a response from the father a response of acceptance in the resurrection and this consummated dialogue and mutual res acceptance brought forth the outpouring of the spirit to us the same spirit who led jesus to mission will now be given to us so that we could dialogue with god through the holy spirit many men and women will know jesus will receive jesus will follow jesus and be united with the father being able to cry out abba the way jesus does the three aspects of dialogue in the paschal mystery the dialogue of availability the dialogue of solidarity and compassion the dialogue of mutual acceptance and sharing of life finally the christian family and the spirituality of the paschal mystery let us now apply the three aspects of the fa paschal mystery that we have singled out to the family as a community of dialogue and let their spirituality be that of the paschal mystery first and here i am calling on families that have come from different parts of the world to be here let me propose these ideas first a christian family must bear the mark of jesus 's dialogue of availability i believe that members of families desire profoundly to be available to each other am i right in saying that crowd replies yes  do parents really like to be available to their children  clapping  i believe that i believe i believe that that is what everyone in the family desires to be available to each one i believe that even if people in our time have the habit of saying mind your own business even if that is our habit i know deep down we still want to be available but we have to admit that caught up in our own battles concerns advancement we see painfully the spirit of dialogue and availability being sacrificed in in society and even within families 1
Philippines	thank you clapping  dean violeta vicente the college of business and economics atty jose dy chairman commercial law department de la salle faculty members officers and members of ley la salle and guests i 'd like to thank atty emmanuel sales your faculty adviser for his kind and generous introduction the introduction was so well researched that it can only emanate from an associate justice of the supreme court laughter  well uh next time he files a petition i will remember the counsel for the petitioner atty emmanuel sales laughter clapping  well my friends i also recall having appeared before your dean in nineteen eighty-nine and i had difficulty articulating my remarks at that time in nineteen eighty-nine in cebu at the cebu plaza  it was a picpa national convention and there was an overflowing crowd at the main ballroom of the cebu plaza and uh i had a hard time articulating and making myself understood because aside from the fact that the audience was fanning itself i also had to make do with the sound system that was barely heard by the audience because there was then a brownout in cebu as it usually does 'no  well my friends it is indeed a pleasure to speak before a select assembly of fellow la sallites i say fellow la sallites because during last saturday 's commencement exercises i was conferred an honorary doctorate in management by your i mean our university which according to brother president rafael donato made me an instant la salle alumnus at the outset i wish to commend and congratulate the officers and members of the ley la salle for organizing and spearheading the ongoing fora which focus attention and elicit discussion on timely and paramount issues of the day i also wish to thank them for selecting a subject of vital concern to the nation and which i must admit is a topic close to my heart the administration of justice in the philippines indeed the continuing dynamism of avenues of information and dialogue between the judiciary and our people is imperative if we are to sustain the momentum of reforms we have initiated in the past five years our people must be made more aware of our resolve to bring to them a judicial system that effectively functions to safeguard their rights so that they may find enough reason to keep faith in our system of justice we must keep that faith alive for without it the very survival of the democratic institutions we have tried to rebuild in the aftermath of the former regime may be irreversibly prejudiced in this spirit let me then bring you closer to the arena of the philippine judiciary i shall endeavor to guide you through the terrain of reforms we have explored in the past few years of my incumbency as principal steward of our judicial system through the years the integrity of our judicial system as the haven of truth and the bulwark of equality before the law has been persistently questioned our people increasingly confounded by laws they cannot seem to comprehend and court procedures that are as fearfully incomprehensible are unable to know how to protect the rights and liberties worse the high cost of legal assistance and litigation the tortuously slow pace of court proceedings and the reality of corruption that has placed price tags on rights and liberties have further exacerbated our people 's alienation and sense of mistrust in our judicial system a people bereft of faith in the reality of truth justice and equality in society is like a dagger poised to strike at the very heart of our democracy we had to reverse the tide of cynicism alienation and distrust towards this end a blueprint for judicial reform was born our end goal an independent moral and efficient judiciary i have brought the message of the philippine judicial reform to every available forum here and abroad as my time and schedule permit in all my appearances in various parts of the country before lawyers judges and government organizations i have tried to impress the urgency of these reforms allow me to share with you some of the recurring questions asked in these fora as a springboard of my discussion on the extent of reforms we have so far been able to initiate what measures have been adopted to ensure that only qualified persons of proven integrity and competence are chosen as judges in our courts we have fully activated the judicial and bar council a constitutionally mandated body composed of members of the judiciary and selected members of the bar to screen prospective appointees to judicial positions aside from extensive investigation and appraisal of qualifications the council publishes the list of nominees to enable any citizen to question the fitness of those whose names are included in the list so if you feel a person is incompetent if you feel a person is dishonest or does not have does not possess integrity then feel free to object to his nomination by writing the judicial and bar council thereafter the council draws up at least three names for each judicial office for submission to the president whose choice is limited to the list submitted not only does the council ensure that only those who are qualified are to be appointed the council also ensures that the process of judicial appointment is insulated from the vagaries of political pressure and patronage given the risk and paucity of remuneration for judicial officers what have we done to attract the best and the brightest into the judiciary for your information the lowest paid justices of the supreme court in asia-pacific region we just learned about it last week when we were in perth western australia are the members of the indian supreme court they receive only three hundred u s dollars a month three hundred which is even lower than our municipal trial court judge but the highest paid supreme court associate justice in the asia-pacific region are the justices of singapore and they receive twenty-five thousand u s dollars per month plus a brand new mercedes benz plus the use of a government house plus free light wa water etcetera etcetera  see so and yet in spite of that not very many are attracted to join the judiciary because they make more money in the practice of law there are multitudes of qualified members of the bar who are sincerely committed to dedicate their talents to the judiciary but to fortify that commitment so that they can make the final leap into our court system there is the guarantee of security of tenure the constitution proscribes the martial law practice of reorganizing the judiciary as it was done during the marcos administration in a manner that prejudices the security of tenure of judges in addition we have also rationalized existing pay scales although we are still lagging behind all the many countries in the asia-pacific re region in addition we have also rationalized our existing pay scales and benefits so as to assure prospective judges of adequate remuneration beyond these considerations are the irrevocable lures of rendering meaningful public service as well as the dignity and respectability that come with the position of a judicial officer assuming we ap we appoint qualified judges to the bench how do we guarantee that they will perform creditably and efficiently with regard to newly appointed judges the supreme court conducts an orientation program composed of various seminars to des designed to equip new judges with court administration and decision writing skills as regards our existing crop of trial judges we have instituted a judicial career development program to update their knowledge of the law and upgrade their case and court management skills parallel to our programs to enforce and instruct our judges is a continuing effort at sustaining the highest level of judicial discipline to this end the supreme court promulgated a code of judicial conduct which sets a framework of ethical standards that must be set by members of the judiciary yet in this arena public support and the support of lawyers groups is vital if we are to completely eradicate misfits in the judiciary from nineteen eighty-three to nineteen eighty-five before we joined the court while there was still an authoritarian government no r t c judge was dismissed from the service by way of administrative proceedings although many were eased out by way of reorganization since nineteen eighty-six when i joined the court thirty-four judges were admonished and warned nine judges have been reprimanded twenty-six imposed a fine one suspended and twelve dismissed from the service as for erring lawyers we have instituted a more systematic grievance procedure through appropriate amendments to the rules of court the new grievance procedure allows for erring lawyers to be investigated and disciplined by their peers in the integrated bar who after all are in a better position to assess the veracity of complaints against their fellow lawyers in addition to and with the purpose of narrowing down the latitude of temptations for unscrupulous and irresponsible conduct the supreme court implemented a program for periodic visitation and performance evaluation of judges tasked to administer the court performance monitoring system is the judicial planning and development implementing office headed by a former member of the board of trustees of de la salle university justice cecilia mu&ntilde;oz-palma now while we punish the erring judges we also reward the good ones those who perform excellently we commend them and at the same time we give them awards by way of this judicial excellence award you know last june eleven we gave six judges special awards as outstanding judges three of them regional trial court judges and the other three metropolitan and municipal court trial court judges aside from the awards and plaques that they received they we gave them fifty thousand pesos each in other words if you are a good judge and you are chosen an outstanding judge on a yearly basis you will receive a cash prize of fifty thousand pesos not given by the government or by the judicial funds but by the judicial excellence foundation but easily the most critical arena of concern is the problem of court delay and pathetically clogged court dockets we have been asked frequently what we have done to remedy these perennial afflictions of the judiciary all right first let us talk about the supreme court because you know after i assumed as chief justice the complaint of many is chief my case has been pending for so many years until now it has not been resolved can we not speed up the judicial process so we had to look for ways and means to speed up the judicial process well one possible explanation is there are just too many cases with a fast-growing population and not enough judges for the purpose it would be just well nigh impossible to dispose of these cases speedily as they come in fast well anyway we have adopted certain reforms but first with respect to the supreme court for so many years the number of cases filed with the supreme court exceeded the number of cases disposed of by the supreme court so that every year the backlog kept on mounting ha at an alarming proportion as in a time will come when so many cases will be pending for ten or so years and they will not be disposed of so we had to redouble our efforts we had to engage the services of more researchers we had to adopt measures like memorandum decisions in other words don't make your decisions too long although that is the defect of many each justice feels that every decision should be a magnum opus  it should not be that way uh a memo decision briefly a few pages would suffice as long as you state the facts the issues involved what is the law applicable and then the ruling of the court so working speedily and uh every day i used to hear the complaint of my associate justices but never mind if they are complaining anyway their production improved and in nineteen eighty-nine for the first time after so many years we were able to turn the tide and for the first time the number of cases filed was below the number of cases disposed of in other words more cases were disposed of than the number of cases filed this is the exact figure in nineteen eighty-nine the supreme court received five thousand four hundred ninety-four cases or an average of four hundred fifty-seven docketed per month then you divide that among fifteen justices
Philippines	my professor pastor uh brother gregory my colleagues in the history department and other departments who are represented here oh i 'm sorry dean uh presentacion gabriel uh dear students i would like to talk about manila as a microcosm of philippine history the things i 'm going to say might not be really new to some of you but uh what i intend to do is to telescope this in one continuous narrative today greater manila also known as metro manila or the national capital region comprises the four cities of manila quezon caloocan and pasay and the thirteen municipalities of muntinlupa para&ntilde;aque makati las pi&ntilde;as pateros taguig mandaluyong pasig san juan marikina malabon navotas and valenzuela it is a sprawling metropolis which according to the nineteen-ninety national census has an aggregate population of seven point eight million which is the th which is thirteen percent of the total philippine estimated population of uh sixty point five million  ranked the world 's twenty-third largest city in nineteen eighty-five manila by the year two thousand is projected to have eleven point one million population thus becoming the sixteenth in ranking outgrowing such megalopolises as los angeles london moscow and others even today manila has a bigger population than countries such as kuwait bayra bahrain el salvador ireland and new zealand among many others as one of the great metropolises of the world metro manila shares the comforts and amenities of modern-day living within its confines are a world class cultural center complex well-planned and luxurious subdivisions of the rich architecturally impressive high rise condominium office and residential buildings spanking hotels antiseptic hospitals with the latest in equipment and highly trained personnel theaters museums art galleries and modernistic shopping centers after years of dictatorship it now boasts of a democratic system of government at times seemingly confused and directionless and one of the freest if licentious presses of the world alas manila also shares the common problems of huge cities like river land and air pollution impossible traffic jams mass unemployment festering slums smelly and dirty children roaming city streets and alleys male female and child prostitution and a crime rate which however is not much more than that of chicago and new york manila had in the past witnessed historical developments that had made imprints and its emergence growth and development which have cast and will long continue to cast their shadow for many more years to come manila had for instance witnessed the arrival of the spanish dutch american and japanese invaders who came trampling its sacred shores the dutch never made a permanent inroad in manila  after many attempts they retreated to nearby present-day indonesia which they also dominated for hundreds of years nor did the british or the japanese whose occupation of manila lasted no more than a few years but the spaniards remained and ruled the philippines for over three hundred years from fifteen sixty-five to eighteen ninety-eight and med made manila the religious military political cultural economic and business center of the whole archipelago the americans who followed the spaniards ruled the philippines for over forty years nine eighteen ninety-eight nineteen forty-five also made manila the center of the philippine of philippine life its political military educational cultural and business machinery centered in the city the very early origins of manila are however buried in the misty and remote past the early filipino settlements long before the foreign invaders came were found along seacoasts the banks of rivers and lakes not only did these give food for the populace and later irrigation for the agricultural lands they also provided the needed transport from one pre-colonial village to the other and thus facilitated the exchange of persons goods and ideas the early settlement of what is now known as maynila as manila was established along the pasig river manila maynila to the south facing manila bay and to the north tondo closely close-by were the villages which eventually became the towns forming later the arrabales of the city since time immemorial manila because of its strategic location was post to early chinese japanese arab and southeast asians by chance who came in search of the of its products and bartered their own before words galleon trade between the philippines and mexico which sustained the spanish colonial rule was centered in manila manila also saw the establishment of the early factories in the country the cigar and cigarette factories during the spanish colonial regime were tourist attractions and today all types of factories appliances food processing garment automotive and chemical industries among many others are found in the metro manila area from metro manila american japanese chinese taiwanese and korean multinational companies direct their nationwide activities many of the pre-colonial chinese and japanese traders opted to stay and married native women and thus enriching the early filipino racial strains and for that matter the emergent filipino culture even before the intrusion of the chinese and japanese manila had already developed its own culture its political structures however however basic and simple they might have been it evolved its early arts and lifestyle its religious beliefs its own economy its social classes and immediately prior to the spanish occupation in eight in the fifteen seventies even began to evolve the beginnings of the institution of royalty which at that time had already been aligned and related to the royal house of borneo such culture and lifestyle would be further enriched by the cultures of the other nations which came to the country so that today filipino culture is a mixture of an indigenous malay substratum with the various layers of chinese indian muslim spanish mexican american and to a very minor extent even japanese culture such influences may perhaps best be discerned in the racial stock which resulted from the various contacts with other peoples so that today hardly is there a filipino much less a manile&ntilde;o who has no mixed blood running in his veins and possibly in manila more than in any other part of the archipelago is this more evident i think we just look at each other to realize what i mean to say indeed today in spite of the outward veneer of what appears to be a dominant american influence like american music movies t v programs and the popular arts junk fast foods hamburgers even american lingo the deeper and the more perpa pervasive influence is hispanic the catholic religion and its deep influence in cultural in culture and lifestyle is a heritage from spain that the philippines and manila for that matter shares with the other latin american countries and cities of spanish origin while manila as it is very apparent from the outside shares some characteristic architectural similarities of the old churches and cathedrals ancient public and private edifices and indeed certain similarities in their social classes the peninsulares the creonos creo&ntilde;os the mestizo groups and native indigenous indian population manila has certain characteristics which differentiates it from spanish american cities like buenos aires lima or mexico city this is of course understandable inasmuch as while manila shares with these cities spanish colonial rule for hundreds of years differences in geography and later day historical developments have made such differences imperative manila for instance because of its peculiar relation to the outside world had had much more contacts with other nations that had than had the cities mentioned above as a result the population of manila had had much more varied racial mixing than that of the spanish-american cities the historical development of the philippines and manila is also something else except for puerto rico which like the philippines passed on to american rule after years of spanish rule none of the south and central and even north american countries passed on to other to another foreign rule after the spanish colonial experience these countries became independent soon after their wars of independence against spain located at practically the center of the philippine archipelago manila has provided the vortex towards which the country 's population gravitated  it is thus it thus became the political center of the country  hardly had the last smoke of the battle between the spanish invaders and the native defenders of maynila and tondo cleared when the spanish authorities established the amenities of an iberian city the city of manila had formed was formally established in june fourteen fifteen seventy-one with its own ayuntamiento city hall and its own cabildo and later its ro royal audiencia the supreme court which also took over the reins of government when the governors-general resigned died or were incapacitated and its city council whose members conducted the day-by-day affairs of the city over and above this officialdom was the governor-general the captain-general or the adelantado a special honorific title given only to miguel lopez de legaspi the founder of the spanish city of manila who in effect was the highest government official and political leader of the colony legaspi as it turned out led the troops in the pacification campaigns not only in the outlying areas close to manila but also in the whole island of luzon eminently aided by his grandson juan de salcedo his appointment as adelantado of course as well as those of the higher ranking officials of manila came from the spanish king his successors would also best be known as captains-general or governors-general who were the highest officials in the country as a result of the great distance which separated manila from the iberian metropolis and from the vice-royalty of new spain or mexico under which it was ruled for quite some time and the other spanish colonies the spanish governor-general in manila embodied in his person powers other than political as representative of the spanish king in this the farthest outpost of the vast spanish empire he also had military diplomatic even religious powers the spanish governor general who held office in manila also commanded the spanish army in the islands as commander-in-chief he planned military campaigns and came out with strategies to quell local uprisings and repel the attacks of foreign invaders like the dutch and the chinese and local enemies like the muslims from southern philippines who sporadically attacked the christian filipino settlements along the coastal regions and now with religious powers he would send missionaries to ne nearby china and japan not only as missionaries but even as diplomats who had ambassadorial ranks to establish relations with these countries the spanish governor-general thus presided over the affairs of the colony like him other ranking officials of invading troops like the latter day americans and the japanese would also reside in manila initially with great military powers attached to their ranks and only later when these had more or less been established to obtain formerly established political structures and appoint civil and military officials who would help them rule the colony manila under the spaniards and to a certain extent under the americans but even more so the spaniards maintained a strict code regarding the social mixing of the various groups in the colony  as in the other parts of the spanish empire the peninsular spaniards occupied the highest rung of the colonial social ladder from their ranks came the military political religious leadership of the colony next in rank in the were the philippine-born spaniards or the creoles who were considered the original filipinos or filipinos espa&ntilde;oles who while having spanish blood on both sides of their ancestry were considered lower in rank than the peninsulars and therefore could not assume the highest offices of the colonial administration spanish and chinese mestizos born of spanish and chinese fathers as the case may be and of native or of mestizo mothers had higher social status than the mass of indigenous malay natives or the indios  by the eight eighteen seventies however when the three priests burgos gomez and zamora who were executed allegedly for their complicity in the so-called cavite mutiny of eight eighteen seventy-two the various sectors of philippine society had begun to view themselves as filipinos and begun to weld themselves together as a group distinct and apart from spanish peninsulares  this welding together of these filipino groups and the awareness of a common destiny was made more apparent during the propaganda movements when creoles spanish and chinese mestizos and local natives the indios pooled together their resources to advance the filipino cause in madrid and in other european capitals like london and paris and in nearby hong kong well a few of these propagandists like marcelo del pilar and the pardo de tavera brothers were already young professionals at the time most of propagandists like rizal jose maria panganiban an were young men studying in spain they maintained links with their countrymen in the philippines mainly with those living in manila many came from the land-owning and the merchant class as a result of the opening of the philippines to foreign trade in the nineteenth century and the cultivation of export crops like sugar manila hemp indigo and to a very minor extent coffee this flo this class formed by rich creole and mestizo families not only built substantial so-called earthquake baroque houses found in manila and could afford the amenities of contemporary living such as carriages imported from austria furniture and chan chandeliers pianos harps and other prestige symbols from abroad not to say books and newspapers some of which were proscribed by the colonial regime for the subversive ideas that they were supposed to contain
Philippines	 maraming maraming salamat po't maraming salamat po't magandang umaga sa inyong lahat  uh in behalf of the department of environment and natural resources it is a gle great pleasure to be here with you today especially since i 'm among the youth the very people who will inherit this land this planet from our generation and the people responsible for humankind 's ecological future it was the mistaken notion molded by an education of the past era that has led us to the problems which we face today in environment this mistaken notion that man can subjugate nature and his environment has led us to the destruction of our forests the pollution of our air and our waterways and the general despoliation of the natural quality of life on earth one of the most revealing lessons learned during the past two decades of environmental awakening in the philippines is that the maintenance of the earth 's delicate balance by the prophylactics of pollution control and other ecological mitigation measures cannot ensure environmental harmony there is now a compelling need to overhaul existing concepts of development with its traditionally exclusive focus on economic principles and political economy of natural resources and marry marry these concepts with the imperatives of nature and the environment the evidence of our failed delusions is all around us the disappearance of our once lush forests has resulted in floods or on the other extreme a soon to be expected drought again because of such phenomena we have seen the destruction of our crop lands and the attendant problems such as famine and greater poverty  pollution on the other hand has killed many of our rivers and streams in metro manila all of our rivers are biologically dead destroying our fishpond habitats and aiding the multiplication of disease vectors air pollution and this you see very often has likewise thickened the atmosphere of our urban centers creating the health problems previously thought of to exist only in highly industrialized countries  the main causes of deforestation alone are socially and economically rooted the demographics of the uplands have changed tremendously from those of a quarter of a century ago due to the migration of marginalized lowlanders to the last frontiers of the uplands many of these lowlanders were forced to migrate to the uplands because of low farm incomes caused by inappropriate food pricing policies increasing costs of farm inputs and by the diminished soil fertility then too we should not forget the social conditions caused by a deeply rooted feudalism whose grip continues its hold in our rural areas to this very day the flight of these hapless farmers to the uplands has swelled the numbers of uplanders all over the country to as many as eighteen million filipinos imagine that eighteen million filipinos in the uplands that 's the forests and the mountains and they have put an equivalent and even growing pressure on the fragile upland ecosystem imagine the kind of pressure that eighteen million filipinos will bring to our uplands for housing and infrastructure for firewood for slash-and-burn agriculture and of course the lure to participate in the profitable illegal logging activities this has in turn created more problems for the lowlands resulting in floods and siltation which has robbed our croplands of their vitality thus exacerbating the already marginalized small farmers this situation has only encouraged more migration either to the uplands or to the already crowded urban areas and even to the even more fragile coastal areas thus a vicious cycle of poverty and degradation has been created feeding into itself and locked in place by social inequity and injustice and yet we suffer all of these things without the material progress achieved in the developed quote unquote west but only with the poverty that the depleted and despoiled natural resource base brings quite obviously the answer to this vicious cycle is a systemic one solutions that will drive wedges that will break this cycle we have found out that traditional concepts of economic growth of development at all cost caused environmental degradation however this unbridled pursuit of progress has for many developing countries including the philippines resulted in quite the opposite where the degraded environment in turn causes poverty resulting in an ever descending cycle of penury and ultimately death the perceived solution is the concept of sustainable development which calls for use of natural resources for development in such a way that the current generations will not foreclose or preclude the use by future generations of the same resources harvesting only the increment without touching the base expending only the interest without touching the capital in the face of these the government has gradually integrated this concept into pertinent policies affecting the environment through the philippine strategy for sustainable development sustainable development stresses the need to view environmental protection and economic growth as mutually compatible and in third world countries mutually reinforcing even inextricably linked  this implies that the growth objectives should be compatible not only to the needs of society for greater equity and social justice but also to the natural dynamics and carrying capacity of the earth 's ecosystem following the p s s d therefore government and society are called upon to look back to the root cause of this problem which among others is the inequity that continues to fan discontent in the rural areas there are three root causes of environmental degradation that we have found one is great overpopulation and continuing increase in population second is the pervasive poverty of our people and third most important and systemic difficulty is the lack of social equity  the uh concepts like land reform rural industrialization agricultural pricing policies that are not biased towards the wants only of the urban population should therefore be pursued you have to remember that whenever you in the urban areas req require demand for lower prices of rice for example you rob the marginalized farmers in the uplands and in the rural areas of due profit  so we say that in rural development that could help seventy percent of our population catch up with the opportunities and resources available to their luckier urban brethren should be made a reality and to those already in the uplands we should offer opportunities that will make them realize that planting trees and nurturing forests are more rewarding both in the short and the long term than cutting them down we need to show these upland farmers that the opportunities they have come to look for in the forests in the mountains in the uplands can only be obtained if the forests are still there for the last four years this has been the crux of our department 's policies and programs for the uplands to offer security of tenure and better livelihood in exchange for security of forests such programs for example as the national forestation program where large swaths of denuded forests are being planted are now being used in order to contract families who are in the uplands marginalized families who would otherwise not have any income contracted out in order to plant trees for the government and get paid for it so that we no longer wait for the trickle-down effect of the economy but we insist that at the very first instance the profit and the benefit of the economy should go directly to the upland farmers the integrated social forestry program for example we have eighteen million filipinos who are potential kaingeros in the forests in the integrated social forestry program this calls for granting every family in the uplands who are now squatters or considered squatters 'cause they do not have uh rights or access to that land would be given three hectares or thereabouts for twenty-five years renewable for another twenty-five years so they could plant a little fo vegetable or whatever they want in return they should keep the forest intact at least the forest within their three hectares and the community forestry program this is the most important program we are going into because this would transfer large areas twenty thousand ten thousand hectares of forest land from the private sector uh usually the timber license agreement holder or the t l a holder now considered the loggers they are called from the loggers to be transferred to the community who are really better protectors of the forest it is hoped that with the communi community forestry program the farmers would understand that if they keep the forests intact they will be the ones to be able to extract rather than the foreigners or the rich people from manila and the other urban areas so that they will be reinforced they will be given incentive to really protect the forest because nobody else can protect it government cannot protect it government does not have money therefore these programs have been revitalized and implemented complementarily in order to help the uplanders fulfill their dreams of land to till of a place to live in livelihood through reforestation and future opportunities through small scale logging and agro-forest and agro-forestry activities as i said wedges to break the vicious cycle but still this is not enough as we have said again before the greater changes lie in structural solutions these are the better 1 word that we must take now or forever resign ourselves to an impoverished and despoiled country this requires changing attitudes about wealth about development and even about day-to-day habits in other words moving towards sustainable development as a way of life though interventions can begin today toward reforming our lifestyles and our conventions complete transformation to sustainable development can only be realistically achieved during the next generation this is the reason why we always take time out to talk to the youth for it is your generation which will complete this transformation it is your ideas your concepts of equity and justice your concern for the poor your concern for the environment your selflessness rather than selfishness and your untiring efforts upon which a new order a sustainable society can and will be built seek the truths now for we of the older generation shall soon hand over the baton to the next generation who will lead us hopefully to a bright prosperous and environmentally secure future thank you and good day  thank you uh allan for that wonderful introduction mr rex villareal president of uh words who invited me and the officers of the la salle 's business management society  good afternoon fellow la sallites and friends i 'm back here in our campus after a long absence and i 'm happy to be back i have come this afternoon upon the invitation of some of the de la salle leaders to have an exchange of views to de la salle community and i am looking forward to our discussion i welcome this opportunity to have this dialogue with you i have come to realize that the learning process never ends and so i have come today not only to be able to present some of my views on matters which affect all of us but also to listen and learn from each and everyone of you i hope you will make this brief visit a fruitful one by your active participation in the open forum which should follow my very brief remarks de la salle will always hold pleasant memories for me coughing  this is where i grew up and was the scene of my formative years but i did not join you today to talk about the good old days nor dwell in the past i came to talk a little about our future as a people and as a nation there are few unaware that these are not the best of times for virtually every filipino the country remains poor as ever three out of four filipinos are living below or close to the poverty line crisis confronts our people in virtually every aspect of their existence whether it be economic political or social even college graduates are no longer assured of jobs once they are through with their studies tens of thousands of our professionals now have to seek employment abroad in order to be assured of a decent life the prospects for our economy are not nearly as bright as they used to be philippine business would have to contend with the shortages of money energy and credit in the meantime the labor force would have to grapple with less employment opportunities and high prices which erode the meager savings of our people and yet despite the many problems we face as a people i have not yet given up on this country i am still hopeful that we can carve out for ourselves a better future and a brighter tomorrow but we must get our act together as a people i urge you the students of de la salle to be more aware of our national situation and to be more involved in our efforts to set things right in this country it is our obligation yours and mine to do what we can to get this country back on its feet i am sure you realize you belong to a privileged class for indeed you do belong to a privileged class everyone who gets a chance to have a college education and graduates belongs to an increasingly small minority i am told that only eighteen percent of those who enter grade school finally finish college that is a drop-out rate of eighty-two percent a statistic that we must attempt to change if we have to have the people to manage our growth or uh our growth and development in the future but along with this privilege comes responsibility because you belong to this group which is better educated and possesses the skills which will prove valuable to philippine society you must therefore be prepared to take on greater burdens among the many things we must do as a people in order to move ahead i believe the most important among them would be to focus on three things first we must try to focus our energies and our resources bringing about the recovery in our economy our people need jobs government needs more revenues students like you and the fresh graduates need more opportunities and avenues for 1 word  our people must be productive rather than idle the way to our survival is creation of new and more than second we need reforms in our government reforms that would reduce corruption reforms that could assure the people particularly those who have less in life that basic services would be available to everybody without fear or favor reforms that would make government and public officials more responsive to the needs of every citizen and finally we need leadership we need leaders who could organize our people motivate and inspire them to take on the burdens of rebuilding this nation leaders who could form governments which in turn could impose order and restore stability so that we could live peaceful and eventually prosperous lives politics has become too important to be left to politicians alone all of us must now be involved our prospects for the future are at stake i wish to remind you that your destiny is really in your hands two out of every three filipino voters come from the ages of eighteen to thirty-nine it is you who will determine who will be our leaders in nineteen ninety-two it is through your activism that a new era in philippine politics could come about so be conscious of your role be aware of what you can do as a group and be reminded of your responsibility not only to yourselves and to your parents but of your higher responsibility to this nation i have already taken up some of your time  let us now proceed to the real substance of my visit let us begin our dialogue and i will be privileged to hear your views and to answer your questions all i can say is i will try to answer your questions as frankly as i can as a friend and not as a politician thank you fellow la sallites
Philippines	the title of my lecture is jose rizal 's philosophy of religion or the religious debate between rizal and fr pastels we can distinguish the philosophy of religion from theology or what i will call theology proper according to william and mabel sahakian philosophy of religion is the study on the basis of reason nature or scientific facts of the existence and nature of god the existence and nature of the soul the question of immortality and the question of natural evils  closely related to the last are the issues on miracles and the validity of prayers these are the dominant topics of this branch of philosophy the philosophy of religion is otherwise called natural theology or general theology theology proper on the other hand studies god on the basis of the existence of holy books like the koran or the bible it is otherwise called dogmatic theology revealed theology or special theology in the case of christianity theology the theology deals with subjects like christology the study of jesus as the christ sotereology the study of salvation of the soul and eschatology the study of the end of the world among others these two types of theology do not necessarily conflict with each other because philosophy can be the handmaiden of theology philosophy or reason can help explain or enlighten the dogmas of religion where on occasion the possibility of a conflict looms then the parting of the ways may arise a number of thinkers have decided to become agnostics like bert bertrand russell or atheists like rudolf carnap the other possible way is simply to abandon reason when the conflict becomes imminent the basic assumption here is that god can be known only if he reveals himself to man through some divinely inspired individuals who thereby penned down these divine revelations reason can help in making the revelations understandable to the man on the street but reason is not entitled to contradict them since they are assumed infallible otherwise reason has to be discarded and in all likelihood that part of the revelation where reason fails to elaborate may be considered a mystery saint thomas aguinas differentiates the objects of reason and of faith in the natural world it is impossible to know and to believe a thing at the same time the object of the intellect is knowable while the object of faith is unknowable the purpose of this paper is to examine critically the religious philosophy of jose rizal as he expresses them in his correspondence with fr pablo pastels these are the mature religious ideas of rizal the correspondence consists of eight letters four each by rizal and pastels it began in september eighteen ninety-two just a few months after rizal was banished to dapitan on seven july eighteen ninety-two by this time most of rizal 's major and minor works had already been published the exchange of letters necessarily touched on some philosophical and theological issues because it is the correspondence between a philosopher rizal and a theologian fr pastels rizal has written a number of works which contain religious ideas it is a subject of controversy as to whether he believes in all or simply in just a few of them most of these religious views are ex expressed through rizal 's characters in novels or dialogues some of them were written with a presupposed contextual background and they may not truly reflect rizal 's own religious convictions eugene hazel enumerates the works which contain rizal 's religious thoughts noli me tangere el filibusterismo rizal 's annotations of antonio de morga 's sucesos de las islas filipinas the vision of friar rodriguez the open letter entitled my young country women of malolos the satire by telephone the philippines a century hence the indolence of the filipinos the state of religiosity in the philippines friars and filipinos one unfinished novel rizal 's letters to pablo pastels and some religious thoughts and other miscellaneous writings and correspondence including my last farewell fr pablo pastels is a jesuit priest who was the former director of the congregation of interns which rizal once headed at the ateneo municipal  he was interested in the reconversion of rizal to the catholic faith since he believed that the latter went astray not only politically but also religiously because of self-love which in the context appears to mean false pride in a letter to fr antonio obach the parish missionary to of dapitan fr pastels requested the latter to tell rizal to stop being silly by looking at things through the prism of his own judgment and self-love since no one is judge in his own case rizal wrote the first letter on one september eighteen ninety-two to fr pastels explaining that god has given man reason and self-esteem and it must be for some purpose it would be impractical to look at things according to rizal or all his affairs through the prisms of others since there are as many prisms as there are individuals and it would be difficult to know which to choose moreover to look at things through the prisms of others would offend god because this is tantamount to scorning the most precious gifts which he has given to man when god endowed man a mind of his own he meant it to be used properly god did not wish that one who has less brains should think like the one who has more and vice versa in the same way that no one should digest with the stomach of another with respect to self-love or self-esteem rizal says he has prayed that god should dispossess him of it but god has preserved it knowing all the while what is best for each man self-love when tempered by reason can be used as a guide for man 's perfection and integrity we since it saves him from many perverse and vile acts when he has forgotten the precepts he has learned or imbibed rizal considers man as a masterpiece of creation so perfect in his nature that to deprive him of his component parts like reason and self-love would disfigure him and make him miserable rizal informs fr pastels that he sometimes prays but when he prays he does not ask for anything since he believes he has everything whatever happens to him is god 's will and so he does not he does this or that as guided by his conscience because after all god will invariably have his own will fulfilled fr pastels laments in his first reply dated twelve october eighteen ninety-two that a young man like rizal did not decide to take better causes than the one that led to his misfortune all because of excessive self-love or a misunderstood feeling of personal dignity it was german protestantism that separated rizal from the catholic faith and french freemasonry that goaded him to filibusterism  noli me tangere is the result of the first captivity while el filibusterismo the result of the second captivity one whose mind has been obstructed and corrupted by erroneous principles and unruly affections cannot be guided by the light of his own judgment and conscience according to fr pastels the lamp of this light is unreliable and no matter how wise a man be he cannot be so wise as not to need the help of another 's knowledge it is therefore necessary to be guided by the lamp of others so to abide by the criterion or to abide by the criterion and judgment of others it is not it is a natural lamp the knowledge of which is derived from right reason nevertheless according to fr pastels we need another lamp a supernatural one that will point to us the rocks of this life and the port of salvation the rest of the reply is an incursion into a discussion of theology proper which is supposed to be a rebuttal of rizal 's first captivity fr pastels explains the nature of revealed knowledge as inspired by the holy spirit he argues that even if faith exceeds reason there cannot exist between them a true opposition because god endows the human soul with the light of reason since god cannot deny faith and reason then the truth of reason cannot contradict the truth of faith if there is an apparent contradiction it is either the dogmas of faith have not been properly understood or the ravings of opinion are unworthily considered as axioms of reason fr pastels promises to offer a rebuttal and the future of the second captivity that is rizal 's separatist ideas rizal 's second letter of eleven november eighteen ninety-two argues that although there are better causes his cause is good and sufficient for him he is not sorry for the humbleness of his cause the poverty of the rewards it offers and the little talent that god has given him to serve his cause but god cannot err cannot err in his acts he ordains them and he knows that the future what the future will bring besides rizal says he does not aspire to eternal fame or to eternal renown rizal bewails the fact that fr pastels believes in everything he hears without investigating it first rizal read german books but to presume germans had inspired him is to betray ignorance about the german people their character and their occupations only one-fourth of noli me tangere was written in germany one-half in madrid and the other fourth in paris no german had heard of his book before it was published he was certainly influenced by the cool cool german environment and the free industrious studious and well-administered german populace full of confidence in its future and master of its destiny rizal denies being a protestant he respects religious ideas but does not consider religion as the science of conveniences or an art of enjoying life had he accepted protestantism he would now be rich free and full of honors instead of being a poor deportee the reference clearly points to the wealthy bowsted family of france whose daughter nellie was willing to marry rizal only if rizal would embrace protestantism rizal did have conversations with a german protestant minister at odenvoldt for a period of three months but the discussion was dispassionate and completely free and there was a priest who joined their discussion once a month rizal concluded two things one an idea sincerely conceived and practiced no matter how opposite it is to one 's own convictions deserves a deep respect and two religions no matter what they may be should never make men enemies but brothers and good brothers the minister and the priest individually did his duty and left to god the judgment who of them interpreted his will correctly truth may be polarized or obstructed and distorted when it enters one understanding reason can be mistaken and can be limited nevertheless according to rizal it is only reason that can correct its own mistakes reason alone can rise a after such falls that are rather unavoidable in its long pilgrimage on earth no doubt far superior to human reason is the supernatural or divine light but who can justly claim that he is the reflector of that light all religions pretend to possess the truth moreover says rizal truth is seen from different angles and therefore religious moral and political truths are complex and must be studied piecemeal nobody has the right to judge the beliefs of others using his own beliefs as norm or criteria rizal promises fr pastels that he will elaborate and explain why his religious views are different in his next mail if the latter is interested regarding separatist ideas rizal asked fr pastels who told you that my country 's welfare which is all that i seek can be attained only through separation  in his second reply dated eight octo december eighteen ninety-two fr pastels expresses his interest in rizal 's religious views but insists that the latter 's twofold conclusion at odenvoldt is completely protestant because it is the consecration of man 's personal judgment fr pastels criticizes the german priest as a simpleton ignorant and mu and must have lost the catholic common sense because the difference between catholics and protestants is not a matter of opinion but a matter of faith he likewise criticizes reason without being illumined by faith as dangerous sin it is since it is subject to the caprices of the mad woman of the house called lady imagination the aberrations and misdeeds of independent reason can only be corrected by reason itself illumined by faith it is this alone that can save true knowledge and true religion true religion cannot tolerate these errors for as christ christ says who is not with me is against me  fr pastels is glad that rizal believes in one personal god creator and lord who throws worlds into space endowed with reason and has given every individual man this tiny spark we call understanding he congratulates himself that rizal for believing in one god creator and lord of everything created was not a partisan to the to cartesianism and its offsprings that is to say to materialism idealism and pantheism in philosophy to liberalism in politics to deism rationalism incredulity and indif indifferentism in religion to romanticism and naturalism in literature and fine arts and to positivism and egoism in domestic civil and social economy but does rizal admit the divinity of jesus christ and the divine institution of his church to rizal 's query as to who is the true reflector of god 's light fr pastels answers that it is jesus christ who by virtue of his human nature is the legitimate reflector and by virtue of his divine nature is the light itself the splendor of his eternal father what follows in the reply is the discussion of the holy trinity and the miracles performed by jesus christ to prove his divine mission
Philippines	thank you very much you know the topic that uh i was given to lecture on is something that uh has been very intriguing to a lot of people because we tend to found uh institutions some of us have founded institutions and so did john baptist de la salle but i think there is a difference between what he did and what others do and i think the basic difference lies in the acts of the apostles when gamaliel was quoted to have said when the new group called christians were uhm influencing the lives of a lot of people and the enemies of christianity were trying to to kill the movement and gamaliel said if this is the work of god it will stand if it is not it will founder  and i think that 's very significant because the key sentence there is if it is the work of god  if it is the work of man it will probably be seen as the work of man  so we 're saying uh founder siya  but if it is the work of god it is god that is glorified and it is in that context that i have uh looked at this topic that i will share with you this afternoon and i 'm also looking at the very specific areas of the founder and i call these his trials and tribulations  because some of us suffer because of our own doing others suffer because of god  and my sub-sub-topic is the stresses that john baptist de la salle had to go through there have been many things said about the founder and those of you who have been following the signum fidei lecture series eve and even further back like the presentations of brother miguel campos can already be considered quite conversant with the life of this great but humble man he is the source of our inspiration and his life is worthy of emulation it is quite certain that he was of good breeding since both his parents belonged to the noble class and to the aristocracy although brother luke salm claims the family belonged to the upper wealthy bourgeoisie class we can surmise then he was brought up according to the demands of his class and was considered well-bred a well-bred person does not easily succumb to complaining or to whining is usually reserved is not loud and does not go for grandiosity today we might describe such a person as one possessing a quiet competent quality we can further surmise that john was not used to suffering nor to deprivation nor to scandal when john took on the responsibility of the christian schools and the training of the teachers he did not have any inkling at all of the consequences of his decision as he had said one thing led to another and providence had many surprises pleasant and unpleasant in store for him i would like to dwell then on an area which i consider a necessary component when one accepts the friendship of jesus it is a common complaint among those who are close to jesus that he is a difficult pill to swallow jesus exacts a lot from his followers and a lot more from his close friends saint teresa of avila in a moment of exasperation and great suffer suffering was reported to have uttered if this is the way you treat your friends she was referring to jesus she said no wonder you have so few of them i have gone over the several bibliographies of the founder and i found the work is yours the life of saint john baptist de la salle which is by brother luke salm to be the most appropriate for this lecture the trials and tribulations of the founder are manifested in critical incidents of his life and deal with practically every aspect of his work his relationship with his family with his peers with his teachers with the local church the local clergy with the bishops and with his own brothers and community i shall deal with each of these aspects and give examples of the difficulties that were encountered by john his health and he was also accident-prone de la salle 's health was to a large extent good there are no evidence in any extant document that would indicate otherwise however due to accidents and severe living conditions he suffered much from injuries previously sustained and from prolonged exposure to the elements in one trip coming back from the country de la salle came close to losing his life he was caught in a blinding snowstorm and fell into a ditch the more he struggled to free himself the deeper he sank into the mire close to exhaustion and about to lose consciousness he made one desperate he made one desperate effort and was finally able to free himself as a result of this experience he suffered a rupture and this rupture would recur from time to time with great pain when it recurred though it was an opportunity for de la salle instead of complaining to thank the lord for saving his life another example was when he crossed the tuileries garden in paris he stumbled and fell his knee which had already been cut open to drain an inflamed swelling was pierced through by a concealed spike in the gateway he fainted on the spot according to the account the bystanders at first thought he was drunk and ignored him and it was with tremendous effort that de la salle was able to reach the door of a community house and fell unconscious in the arms of a brother who opened the door he was prone to attacks of rheumatism which at times were so acute and so painful that he thought he might die the prevalent remedy was as painful as the disease the remedy was one would be stretched over a grill beneath which were medicinal herbs steaming over burning coals there was even an incident which if not for the serious consequence would have been very funny a young brother trying to be helpful pulled back a chair as de la salle was about to sit down the founder lost his balance and fell on his face this opened a gash in his head and later caused pain in his ear he even remarked as he was suffering one headache after another that he felt as if his head were split in two another area where where the founder suffered was the area of deceit and i call this estafa  de la salle suffered through a number of court cases that dealt with estafa  in one instance he agreed to form a partnership with a young man named clement who was going to provide the building for his school he his work was expanding and so he tried to to look for somebody who might join him in putting up a building and he was one man who said okay i will help you this young man clement was going to inherit a large amount of money and property but since he was not yet twenty-five years old which is the legal age in france at that time for this kind of transaction it was his lawyer who negotiated with de la salle regarding this particular property de la salle advanced the money of over five thousand livre which was quite considerable at that time so he advanced it when clement came into money and into age he reneged reimbursing the founder and to add insult to injury he insisted that the house was his because clement had influential contacts both in the church and in the government he sued and de la salle was cited to appear in court to answer to charges of suborning a minor for the purpose of extorting money from him de la salle remember was the victim and he was the one sued he also had conflicts with pastors and bishops again not of his own doing de la salle himself a member of the clergy always showed deference to pastors and to members of the hierarchy however this was taken for weakness and he was abused by some of these men who did not return the respect the founder had for them the matter of the habit was a source of difficulty with father baudrand habit meaning the brothers had a peculiar habit because de la salle wanted the brothers to look very different from the clergy at that time well this father baudrand did not like the habit that was designed by de la salle for his brothers he thought it was too probinsyano and he wanted the brothers to dress a little bit more fashionable and de la salle insisted that the habit spelled the identity of the brothers and no change should be allowed besides it was not the intention of de la salle to be a diocesan congregation and insisted on the autonomy of the community the consequence of this was that he made a number of enemies and some brothers even left him siding with the pastors the pastor that had a long struggle with de la salle was father de la chetardie who thought that the founder was no longer fit to be a superior he wrote a long memorandum to a cardinal named noailles describing dissension among the brothers and that many were disillusioned with their vocation in other words father de la chetardie concocted stories to make sure that in the eyes of the hierarchy the cardinal and the bishops that de la salle was no longer worthy to be the head of the congregation that he founded  another group that did not like de la salle was a group called the writing masters the writing masters were the prevailing teachers at that time they were basically teaching writing to a lot of the richer uh members of the community and when de la salle established his schools a number of the students of the writing masters asked to be admitted to the schools of de la salle not only were they better but they were free and because of the success of the christian schools as they were called then and because of the many of the pupils of the writing masters were transferring en masse to the brothers de la salle was once again the focus of attack from this group in one incident as a result of the influence of the writing masters with the police two officers of the court accompanied by a sergeant-at-arms appeared at the school on february seven seventeen oh four took an inventory of all the school furnishings desks chairs pens ink wells and put them under seal for safekeeping pending the judgment of the court they were eventually confiscated group of men just entered the classroom and the school building and took everything that was not nailed in another instance sensing the rift between de la salle and the pastors the writing masters aligned themselves with father de la chetardie and together they were able to get an edict from the diocesan chancery forbidding de la salle to teach to engage or assign other teachers in paris without the express permission of the diocesan supervisor of schools who was also not very sympathetic to de la salle and his group at the time when this happened the diocesan supervisor was father de la chetardie he had problems with his own family de la salle was barely twenty-one when his father and mother died just months apart being the eldest he had to assume the responsibility to manage his parents' holdings and to take care of his four brothers and two sisters he was also at that time studying towards the priesthood although it entered his mind that god might have been giving a sign of another vocation he continued on with his seminary and academic training although he would not have been faulted if he took these events as signs from god that he was not meant to be a priest can you imagine today if any young man was studying at the seminary or studying to be a brother and both his parents die and he becomes the manager of a vast holdings would you think that he would continue to study for the priesthood or he would continue to stay in the novitiate  a practical mind would say god is telling me that this priesthood this vocation to the religious life is not mine  in the case of john baptist de la salle he pursued his vocation  in cases like this when there was a dilemma and he was not sure what god wanted him wanted of him de la salle undertook counsel from close friends known for holiness and deep spirituality
Philippines	 applause thank you thank you very much secretary filemon dr filemon uriarte jr our secretary of the department of science and technology the president of the national academy of science and technology dr perla santos-ocampo his excellency william charles waters new zealand ambassador to the philippines senior economic adviser mr jaime augusto zobel deputy director and general general manager of national economic and development authority mr rafael lotilla our very distinguished guests national artist for rural sociology dr gelia castillo president of the ateneo de manila university reverend fr bienvenido nebres former congressman dondon bagatsing this conference foreign speakers and guests led by mr jucom park president korean institute of science and technology my other co-workers in government other distinguished guests friends ladies and gentlemen at the outset i would like to congratulate the department of science and technology for successfully organizing this timely conference and spearheading the promotion of a knowledge economy in the country this initiative comes at a time when globalization is integrating the world 's countries together when the international economic order is evolving into a highly integrated and electronically dynamic system and when information can be accessed in all corners of the globe at the click of a mouse indeed the world today is rapidly moving towards a new economy a knowledge economy it is therefore not surprising that the publication the economist has asked in big bold letters on its cover who owns the know knowledge economy it however provided the answer nobody owns it everybody benefits from it and the world becomes richer this can be illustrated with a simple example when i share a piece of cake with you you gain the cake and i lose it but when i share my knowledge with you you gain it but i do not lose it in fact both of us may even gain more knowledge from the exchange knowledge is essential for our development and in a knowledge economy it is the generation and use of knowledge that assume the significant contribution in the creation of wealth and i in the alleviation of poverty in its recent report the world bank emphasized that if we want to live better tomorrow than today if we want to raise our living standards as a household or as a country we must do more than simply transform more resources for resources are scare scarce we must use those resources in ways that generate even higher returns to our efforts and investments one of the most important enabling tools for the development of a knowledge economy is information and communications technology or i c t of the many technologies that are currently being developed and utilized i believe i c t will be the single most important technology that will bring about a knowledge economy the reason for this is that i c t is an enabling technology like electricity which is also an enabling technology the impact on the economy is not so much in its production though this can also be significant but in its widespread use and application just as the development of electricity developments in i c t bring about new markets new products and new services these in turn bring with them new sources of revenues that contribute to economic growth personal computers have grown threefold between nineteen ninety-two and nineteen ninety-seven to one hundred twenty million and are increasingly linking the world in nineteen ninety-three there were about two million internet hosts worldwide in nineteen ninety-nine this has increased exponentially to nearly forty-five million the internet 's explosive growth is making possible many economic opportunities which just a few years ago were inconceivable in nineteen ninety-seven the worldwide market for i c t amounted to one point eight trillion or approximately six percent of the world g d p this is forty percent higher than the level in nineteen ninety-two it grew by about twenty-seven percent annually between ninety-two and ninety-seven more than five times the rate of global economic growth for a country like the philippines it is clear that a knowledge-based development can and should be pursued the philippines is an excellent position to harness the potentials of a knowledge economy we are a small country prone to natural disasters whose land areas amounts to less than that of malaysia thailand or indonesia and which is spread over seven thousand islands making the transport of goods very challenging our greatest asset therefore is not land or natural resources our greatest asset is our people who are imbued with a culture of education and a love for learning we have been bless blessed with a large number of highly trained and highly trainable people and since knowledge rests on people we have the basic ingredient on which to build a k economy this is further confirmed by the performance of the i c t industry in the country in recent years in the hardware sector our semi-conductor and electronics industry has been growing at the rate of thirty percent to forty percent per annum since nineteen ninety-three products worth nearly twenty billion dollars constituted seventy-two percent of our total exports in nineteen ninety-eight exports rose to twenty-five billion dollars in nineteen ninety-nine and is expected to grow to over forty-seven billion dollars in year two thousand four the five hundred twelve companies involved in the industry have a total investment of over seven billion dollars and employ over two hundred eighty thousand skilled and semi-skilled workers this same trend is mirrored in the software network sectors of the i c t industry in the philippines many companies have established back-office operations in the philippines america online for instance operated a customer e-mail response system at clark field some six hundred filipinos manning workstations in the philippines answer e-mails for a o l from all over the globe on a twenty-four hour basis in short we are in a position to capitalize on our strengths and pursue a knowledge-based development and so far the demand from the i c t industry has fueled in however it is equally clear that we must do more these same global i c t trends are calling us to be proactive or otherwise lose our competitive advantage and be further left behind in view of the tremendous opportunities and vast potentials offered by i c t and other knowledge-based industries we have adopted a key development strategy the transformation of the country into a knowledge center in asia by the first decade of the twenty-first century the strategy calls for the exploitation of our potentials as a nation to become a major regional hub for research and development for knowledge-based technologies and as a major production platform for i t based products and services through executive num number or through executive order number one two five which i issued last july nineteen nineteen ninety-nine i have endorsed the national information technology plan for the twenty-first century or i t twenty-one as our plan of action to guide our efforts in harnessing informations and communications technology for our global competitiveness i t twenty-one clearly sets our vision of becoming a knowledge center in asia by the first decade of this century but from the time we have promulgated i t twenty-one so much has changed and new developments have evolved that is why i am now directing the national information technology council to review the plan in the light of these changes and new developments i would especially want to see the wider and more effective use of i c t in government particularly in ensuring faster delivery of public services as well as transparency in government operations and transactions for us to be able to partake of the many opportunities offered by the knowledge economy we have to build on our own strengths and overcome our weaknesses and the opportunities are manifold substantial and increasing spending worldwide particularly in asia we see a fast-growing global market and the philippines is poised to claim a bigger share of this global market hence i have directed the department of trade and industry and the department of science and technology to work together to make sure our country 's actions are demand-driven strategic coordinated and dynamic the d t i under the stewardship of secretary mar roxas has taken a number of bold steps to keep our industries competitively linked to the global market generate global demand for our i c t and services and help prepare our people for the jobs of tomorrow first and most importantly i have directed secretary roxas to consolidate the number of dispersed e commerce efforts of the national government under a reactivated and expanded e commerce promotion council of which he is chair foremost on their agenda is to fulfill their mandate to formulate and coordinate the implementation of a national program and strategy for the promotion of e commerce in the philippines i expect secretary roxas to submit this plan by the end of june even as this consolidation effort is taking place however immediate concerns cannot be put on hold thus we have updated investment policies and undertaken promotional activities in order to keep the philippines as the preferred location for i t related and enabled services given the present competition for investments we must ensure that we maintain our attract attractiveness as an investment site or run the risk of being overlooked or sidelined by investors among the initiatives are first the development of i t parks i have approved three so far namely the eastwood cyber park in quezon city the northgate cyber park zone in alabang and the fort bonifacio silicon alley i t park in fort bonifacio taguig where competitive fiscal and non-fiscal incentives are offered a software development park has also been established at the subic economic zone and the ayala group has announced the proposed development of an i t park in cebu second the explicit inclusion of professional i t services in the investment priority plan for fiscal year two thousand this means that i t related activities will enjoy prime incentives from the board of investments third the launching of a series of focused i t investment missions to to the united states korea japan europe and australia which will promote the philippines as the i t service hub in asia secretary roxas is in fact in the united states for this very purpose and is scheduled to meet with a number of potential investors locators and out sources fourth the creation of an i c t innovation and development fund to provide venture capital for i c t business start-ups and support for i c t research the national development corporation under the d t d t i has already identified i t as a priority and is exploring mechanisms to reach tech techno-entrepreneurs finally i t related activities have been highlighted under the proposed amendments to the omnibus incentives act our legislators anti anticipate that these amendments will take effect by the third quarter of this year and will feature a number of non-fiscal incentives to match if not surpass that offered by others in the region so on this note i am happy to announce that the legal framework for our country 's participation in electronic commerce is also around the corner with the passage in the senate of the e commerce bill the bill defines our policies on electronic transactions and will enable us to participate actively in this global trend for trade and commerce i would like to thank senators ramon magsaysay blas ople juan flavier and vicente sotto for co-authoring this bill a national program for strategy for the promotion of e-commerce and a knowledge economy is premised on the capability to acquire and adopt global knowledge while creating knowledge locally the implementation of a rational technology policy which can integrate human and technological capabilities in productive ways is indispensable we will need to invest heavily in human capital in innovation and more importantly in enabling technologies that facilitate the transfer of knowledge the department of science and technology under the leadership of secretary filemon uriarte jr is at the forefront of this effort
Philippines	good morning  uh we would like to thank the organizers for inviting us professor karaan and myself uh to present a paper at this conference uh we were a bit hesitant about accepting the invitation since we really had not done any in-depth study of philippine english in the classroom in the manner of the gonzalez alberca and llamzon studies but since the paper expected of us was supposed to be on how the policy on the use of english in education is actually being applied in our schools at the present time uh we felt that we could very well talk on that so at the outset we would like to let you know that our paper is not a definitive cat categorical presentation of philippine english in the classroom and in the playground rather it is more of a mos a collage of concerns of english teachers  after six years of elementary schooling the filipino student would have had approximately three thousand two hundred forty hours of instruction in english that is about one thousand eighty hours learning english as a second language and two thousand one hundred sixty hours learning science and mathematics with uh english used as medium of instruction he would have had about five hundred four hours of english as a second language and one thousand eight hours of science and mathematics in english in the secondary level or a total of one thousand five hundred twelve hours uh four thousand seven hundred fifty-two hours of english in ten years time that is if neither the student nor the teacher gets absent and if neither code-mixes or if there are no suspension of classes due to typhoons fiestas floods or sports activities considering that english is learned as a second language almost exclusively in school with only the teacher as the provider of both oral and uh written input sometimes incomprehensible and the textbooks the only print material readily available it should be of no wonder that most filipino users of english are proficient in the formal style or what can be called textbook english  gonzalez and alberca in their book studies on philippine english nineteen seventy-eight observed that philippine english of the mass media at least for casual and formal styles seems to be by-and-large textbookish written philippine english follows a classroom uh register classrooms a composition style prevalent in philippine classrooms spoken english is close to textbook english the prevalence of spelling pronunciation is very evident likewise philippine literature in english reflects a classroom register a factor which may have contributed to this classroom english phenomenon is the curriculum development process in the philippine educational system at least in the lower levels of schooling curriculum development for the elementary and secondary levels is centralized in specific offices in the bureau of elementary education and in the bureau of secondary education of the department of education culture and sports there was a time when institutions of higher learning were designated uhm curriculum development centers the philippine normal university was designated curriculum development center for english and filipino one of its tasks was to develop the elementary and secondary level textbooks and teachers' manuals in english and filipino these materials were to be used in all schools nationwide in nineteen eighty-three the b e e or bureau of elementary education implemented the new elementary school curriculum or n e s c minimum learning competencies for english and for all other subjects in each grade level were identified a document titled minimum learning competencies was printed and issued to all elementary school teachers in the country the m l c was used as the basis for classroom instruction achievement assessment and textbook development in nineteen eighty-nine the new elementary school curriculum was implemented in the secondary schools this time desired learning competencies for english and for all the other subjects were identified a document titled desired learning competencies was printed and copies issued to all secondary teachers nationwide and used for the same purposes as the m l c today those who go to the public schools from batanes to tawi-tawi use the same textbooks the proded or program for decentralized educational development textbook uh development uh the proded textbooks for the elementary level and the s e d p uh textbooks for the secondary level s e d p stands for secondary education development program the earlier generation of filipinos used correct english uh grades one to six for language and spelling philippine readers for reading during the postwar years philippine language series in the nineteen fifties the bo the books developed by the phi philippine center for language study or the p c l s books during the audio-lingual era in the philippines and the edpitaf books in the late nineteen seventies while privately-owned publishing houses produce textbooks for use by private schools these books are nonetheless m l c based or d l c based with additional concepts and tasks which supposedly make the books more difficult than the proded or s e d p books this is based on the perception that private school pupils are intellectually able and can therefore cope with more difficult material the avowed goal of english language instruction in philippine schools is the development of communicative competence the term has become a catch word especially among textbook writers majority claim that their books develop communicative competence but fail to adequately explain or operationalize the construct for purposes of this conference and this paper we look at english in the philippine classroom as uh a basilect basilect uh mesolect ac acrolect continuum we go by the definitions suggested by the conference organizers basilect or basilect is the low form of the language usually existing only in the spoken form and clearly not regarded as proper english acrolect is the high form the prestigious form of english spoken or written which is thought of as appropriate for formal contexts mesolect is the intervening form the basilect to acrolect continuum has been regarded by many second language acquisition researchers as corresponding in many respects to the route followed by second language learners they have hypothesized that l two learners progress along an interlanguage curriculum uh continuum that series of interlocking systems which corder nineteen sixty-seven called the learner 's built-in syllabus interlanguage also refers to the structured system which the learner constructs at any given stage selinker nineteen seventy-two noted that many l two learners perhaps as many as ninety-five percent do not acquire competence in the target language they do not reach the end of the interlanguage curri uh continuum he refe uh they stop learning when their interlanguage contains at least some rules different from those of the target language system he referred to this as fossilization  fossilization occurs in most language learners and cannot be remedied by further instruction you may recall that braj kachru uh considers interlanguage a myth  offhand we can say that uh basilect mesolect and acrolect or the low and high varieties are found in philippine classrooms in the speech and writing of students teachers supervisors and administrators at the elementary secondary and tertiary levels in other words many school people like students may be construed as still progressing along the interlanguage continuum their speech and writing probably basilectal many others like teachers and supervisors and administrators may have already reached a post-basilectal or near-acrolectal or acrolectal stage that is they have reached points somewhere near the end of the interlanguage cur continuum other may others may have reached a point where both uh right and wrong forms have already fossilized in this presentation we have restricted ourselves to acrolectal philippine english as suggested by the conference organizers we have further restricted ourselves to written english we have hypothesized that besides professional books and magazines what may also be considered acrolectal written philippine english in the classroom is the teachers' manuals the writers and editors of these publications are assumed to have acquired a high level of proficiency in english and are specialists in language education therefore they could be expected to be models and provide models of what is acceptable and prestigious english in the classroom in order to test our hypothesis we decided to do a limited content analysis of a number of teachers' manuals we did not discount the possibility that unusual lexical and syntactic usage referred to as distinctive features of philippine english by gonzalez and alberca may surface in the instructional materials to be examined if they do their presence may be explained in several ways one that the forms are acceptable and have become part of acrolectal philippine english two that the writers and or editors committed performance errors  or three that the writers and or editors committed competence errors we decided to focus our analysis on written english in the classroom simply because it is rather difficult to identify the models of spoken classroom acrolect unlike gonzalez and alberca we hesitate to consider the influential and the elite in the higher echelons of philippine of the philippine educational system as the models for either careful or casual spoken english having achieved something in the profession is not always a qualification for being a model of spoken classroom acrolect a set of criteria other than that used by gonzalez and alberca in their analysis of spoken english of the mass media may have to be developed  besides the analysis of teachers' manuals that we did we 'll also present to you uh our textbook analysis done by some graduate students and uh some uh summaries of studies done by uhm some wri also by some uh uh grad teachers may we now present the re the results of our analysis of teachers' manuals we analyzed eight teachers' manuals written by thirteen textbook writers the main purpose of a teachers' manual is to guide the teacher use the pupils' textbook hence there is an extensive use of imperatives that is why some editors have commented that teachers' manuals are too preachy interrogatives come in the form of exact questions to be asked of the students but embedded in the imperative sentences the explanatory notes or background information for teachers very often are couched in the declarative sentences our analysis of the teachers' manuals revealed that majority of the distinctive features of written english as identified by gonzalez and alberca uh were also present in written classroom english here are some examples numerous examples given; they have been omitted from this text   these data can be quite disconcerning disconcerting to many e s l e f l teachers specialists and also to linguists  now uhm in some instances they can be magnanimous and consider the constructions to be errors of performance  nonetheless it cannot be denied that there are there are many which may be considered errors of competence that these are wrong forms or that these uh are wrong forms which have fossilized in the idiolect of the writer or they can say that or have the constructions become acceptable so that the editors pass them off as correct  at this point probably murcia and freeman 's comment can be illuminating long quotation   rather than pass judgments on these in constructions and wring our hands in dismay and lament over the sorry state of english in philippine classrooms or accept the forms as they are and wait until they become part of acrolectal philippine english implications for textbook development grammar instruction and lexicography can be drawn and probably also on the editorial standards of our local publishing houses  now uh what how about our high school students what are they capable of doing in the language  pe&ntilde;aranda conducted a study to determine the syntactic complexity of the editorials feature stories and essays written by staff members of the school papers of several secondary schools in the city of manila  for this purpose she used minimal terminable units or t units but limited herself to structures which resulted from sentence-embedding transform transformations  she fond found out that as the students advanced in years the staff members used uh they also used more sentence-embedded structures and more adjectival than nominal and adverbial sentence-embedded structures  she also found out that length and number of t units advanced correspondingly with advance in year level  she surmised that on the basis of the stati statistical predominance of sentence-embedded adjectivals the students had already mastered the use of simple adjective modifiers and that they could handle restrictive clauses of -phrases and some prepositional phrase post-modifiers relatively relatively well  it should be noted however that the compositions examined were written by a select group  a similar study was conducted earlier by mendiola in fact she 's uh here right now  she analyzed the constituents of noun phrase and verb phrase constructions the kinds of sentence patterns the kinds of sentences according to clause structures and the kinds of subordinate clauses used by one hundred fifty grade four five and six pupils  she also used t units as a measure of syntactic complexity  mendiola found out that the length of t units increased significantly with advance in grade level  the grade five and six pupils produced more structu structurally complex structures than grade four pupils and the pupils used adverbial clauses more frequently followed by nominal and adjectival clauses  the foregoing findings bode well for our young learners  we take it as a signal that they are capable of acquiring a high level of proficiency of in english of course under appropriate circumstances
Philippines	 dr foronda dean bautista mr uh bascara mr hila uh dr palma uh dean uh gabriel uh dr churchill colleagues fellow students friends ladies and gentlemen good morning i have the honor and pleasure to have this chance of meeting you today at the opening of the lecture series of the department of history of de la salle university in honor of dr marcelino m foronda jr whom i consider as the father of oral and local history in the philippines and who is at the same time the incumbent director of de la salle university local and oral history center at the outset i would like to congratulate uh dr foronda on the occasion of his birthday and uh on the occasion of his uh having been awarded uh the most outstanding uh college teacher of the year by the metropank metrobank foundation i also would like to warmly congratulate uh de la salle university for setting up its uh local and oral history center designed to uh promote the study of the various aspects of philippine history and culture as well as to link up filipino scholars who are interested in the promotion of scholarship on philippine local and oral history  in your academic and scholarly pursuits in this center you are expected to arrive at the truth of local historical reality and contribute toward the cultural advance of the people of this country indeed as you move toward the fulfillment of your task in this center you must carry a tremendous burden i am aware that the promotion of the study of local and oral history is ever expanding in order to achieve a full understanding of the human experience of the filipino people even if your focus is just on the promotion of the study of the local human experience of the filipino people as indeed the center is all about there is a great variety of subject matter and themes within each of these subjects and themes laden with their own complexities and emotional overtones to compound the situation there is a babel of filipino tongues to contend with  remarkably the center is making progress and its faculty an and staff are moving forward and i congratulate you for the progress and the advances you have made as this lecture series and the previous local and oral history conferences you have organized uh prove  dr foronda just uh mentioned to me a few seconds ago that there 's going to be another local and oral history conference which will be held under the auspices of the center uh some time during the early part of october on october seven if i 'm not mistaken  this progress and advance is good for the life of the mind and for filipino historical scholarship this is because as you progress and advance in your promotion of the study of the local human experience of the filipino people you enable scholars to absorb in their minds new and additional information data and interpretations which when shared with the general public will free us from will free us and the people of the philippines from ignorance and mi misconceptions about our past the faculty and staff of de la salle university in the field of history are competent persons committed to the promotion of the study of the local and oral history of the filipinos therefore nothing is really unfamiliar to you insofar as the human experience of the filipino is concerned though you may be unhappy with much that has been wrought by us as a people and as human beings as true intellectuals committed to the search for truth you cannot afford to shy away from the study of anything associated with the filipino human experience i realize therefore that you still need a lot of things to cover in your research agenda filipino historians today already take for granted the value of local history for purposes of acquiring a true understanding of philippine civilization there is a widespread acceptance by scholars in the historical profession both here and abroad regarding the primary importance of local history in enabling us to portray reality accurately and interestingly  the speaker is speaking extemporaneously at this point i 'd like to give uh two examples uh to illus to illustrate uh the virtue of uh local history as uh widely accepted by scholars both in the philippines and abroad for example uh in uh the book uh written by uh jose maria sison entitled uh philippine society and revolution there is uh a conclusion made or one of the conclusions made by the author pertains to the feudal situation in the philippines uh uh what he tries to do actually is to uh apply the concept of feudalism to the philippine situation based on uh logical inference and based on uh intuition and onta oftentimes based on uh rhetoric but without being based on empirical uh data or scientific evidence and uh and actually as a result of this uh uh there is a popular notion among uh many filipinos about the fact that the situation in the philippines during the nineteenth century for example and even during the twentieth century can be characterized as feudal or semi-feudal however uh two american uh two foreign scholars for example uh jonathan and fast have written uh a book entitled uh roots of dependency and uh on the basis of their study of the forces that were operating in the philippines during the nineteenth century and during the uh twentieth century with focus on the development of the sugar industry and the haciendas in negros which is one of the local areas here in the philippines uh uh jonathan and fast in their book the roots of dependency have arrived at the conclusion that the situation in the philippines was far from feudal or semi-feudal rather uh there was actually uh capitalism that was operating although of course the capitalist system or the capitalist forces that were operating were exploitative insofar as native labor was concerned and uh the the finding of jonathan and fast uh is a uh negation in effect of the simplistic conclusion arrived at by jose maria sison in his uh book uh philippine society and revolution another example that i can give uh pertains to bicol and uh the book uh pertaining to bicol actually uh was written by another foreign scholar his name is norman g owen he has written a book entitled uh uh the uh abaca industry in in bicol and prosperity without progress or words to that effect and uh and uh in effect uh his conclusion is that uh in bicol as a result of the uh linking up of uh the abaca plantations that were for that were uh formed and uh established and which were linked up with the international uh capitalist markets in uh other countries or abroad a measure of uh prosperity was enjoyed by the people of uh the bicol peninsula in contrast to the usual sweeping or facile generalization that uh colonialism uh was uh detrimental to the welfare of the people of uh all parts of the philippines but in the specific case of bicol uh norman owen actually found out that uh there was prosperity and that uh to a large extent colonialism was responsible in promoting this prosperity and that uh there was uh satisfaction on the part of uh the uh people of bicol with regard to the existence of the colonial system as they knew it uh in the bicol peninsula because of the opportunity that this gave them to link up with the capitalist markets for purposes of exporting their products their product namely abaca which was uh in great demand in the foreign market so these two examples uh that i 've given you illustrate uh the primary virtue of uh of of local history for purposes of uh of uh looking at uh specific regions or looking at particular areas in order to uh understand the underlying detail and the underlying uh reality uh taking place uh within uh these specific areas or localities and oftentimes we see that uh the reality that we find out in the local areas that we study and that we subject to local historical scholarship the reality is in contrast to the oftentimes facile generalizations made in uh national histories this is because uh from the point of view of scholars advocating local history uh local history itself represents a grassroots approach that emphasizes the vital human quality of the past the way people lived felt thought and what their experiences are as a product of their feelings and thoughts  local history has been accepted as a good way of exploring the realities of human life at the grassroots and thus gives the discipline of history a socio-behavioral dimension the spread of local history represents the major development in philippine historiography during the past generation this is not to say that there was no local history before the war there was local history in the pre-war period but it spread in the post-war period and especially within the past twenty years or so was phenomenal based on my observation of philippine historiography the spread of local history took place because of the influence of what is known as the new history on filipino scholars new history emerged because of the realization by scholars that things must be looked up in the round the advocates of new history reacted against the dominance in past historiography of historians who stressed political history however the new historians who distinguish themselves as economic or social historians as seen apart from political historians insisted that the political facts habitually included within the historian 's purview told only part of the story and were themselves not to be fully understood in the absence of economic and social facts the advocates of new history equip themselves with intellectual and methodolo methodological tools drawn from the social sciences as well as from the humanities but mainly from the former they are committed to studying history from the bottom up rather than from the top down so that in effect this represents a major shift in focus from top level history to the grassroots approach they are interested in studying the grassroots of civilization and in the process they inevitably face the question of how the masses had lived and thought and reacted in the past this new breed of historians in the philippines for example had begun to realize that whereas they had considerable information about manila-based rulers and how they had exercised their power they the new historians had little or none about the people in the countryside and how they responded moreover there was recognition that previous historians had known something about the literary and artistic highlights going on in manila but little of the mass culture from where these highlights stood out in other words very little was known about the manner of living and the processes of change going on which affected the multitudes out in the villages and towns of the philippines it was recognized that the values and experiences of the villagers and townspeople were at variance with those of the dominant elites based in manila thus this led to the increasing emphasis by filipino historians in the study of local history and this further led to the founding of the national conference of national conference on local history in nineteen seventy-eight in which dr foronda dr churchill dr samuel k tan dr resill b mojaris dr mamitua d saber and the late professor alfredo t tiamson played a significant and leading role this annual conference has since then become the foremost venue or forum for the presentation of the latest trends and findings in philippine local history after the first conference that took place in nineteen seventy-eight in cagayan de oro a conference took place in uh dumaguete city in nineteen seventy-nine in bacolod in nineteen eighty in cebu city in nineteen eighty-one in iligan city in nineteen eighty-two in quezon city in nineteen eighty-four in surigao city in nineteen eighty-five in general santos city in nineteen eighty-seven in butuan city in nineteen eighty-eight again in general santos in nineteen eighty-nine and uh last year nineteen ninety uh it was held in naga city and this year it 's going to be held in marawi city with the papers generated by this important scholarly gathering published in the journal of history of the philippine national historical society  the institutionalization of the local and oral history center at de la salle university is further proof that local history is here to stay this is complemented by the establishment and existence in different parts of the philippines of such regional study centers like the center for northern luzon studies at saint mary 's college in bayombong nueva ecija the center for leyte samar studies at divine word university in tacloban city the center for negrense studies at the university of saint la salle in bacolod city the cebuano studies center at the university of san carlos in cebu city the center for western visayan studies at u p visayas in iloilo city the research institute for mindanao culture at xavier university in cagayan de oro city and the ethnic samal studies center at mindanao state university in tawi-tawi not to mention the cordillera studies center in u p baguio and uh the uh sharif kabungsuan cultural and studies center in cotabato city with regard to oral history oral literature and popular literature i can say that they are useful in shedding valuable light on the values attitudes and experiences of the non-literate many or the inarticulate and sem semi-literate masses of filipino society as well as on the processes of social change affecting them within the context of the agrarian tradition of the philippines one cannot be content interpreting past change only from the evidence of official records written by the dominant elites in politics and in the economy the oral and popular literature of the people will surely give illumination to the lives and activities of what we call the common tao or juan de la cruz  and uh let me cite the oral history project uh headed by dr foronda himself under the auspices of de la salle university uh towards the furtherance of uh of oral history not only as a methodology but as a component uh towards uh shedding valuable light on how we as a people uh live uh in our uh daily existence  the field or discipline of anthropology in particular will be will be and in fact is most useful to the filipino historian in his quest for a better understanding of the oral and popular literature of the philippines for purposes of illuminating the life and experiences of the masses this is because the anthropologists do not generally have pre-conceptions about the societies they seek to study and because they view the culture of a society as an integral whole useful to the local and oral historian in his quest for an understanding of the grassroots of filipino civilization is folklore as a source of social history this is because in folklore we see the people as human beings and we see them being both the historians as well as the history in which they tell their own story in their own words history and folklore are inextricably bound because they do not simply have a common ground but they are actually one and the same ground through this interrelationship we are able to gain insight into the emotions and consciousness of the people and communities we are studying we also go to the roots and sources of society in which the people are living at the same time this interdisciplinary mode of analysis that local and or oral history engenders does not deflect us from the day-to-day needs of the people of the philippines we know that resources are scarce which means that local historians must likewise be devoting their attention to environmental change and to such questions like do they still see their forebears as still in possession of their forest lands or are they finding them displaced and is is there anything being done in other words we who are engaged in local and oral history while we should value and support our traditions and heritage as a people must not lose sight of the fact that the philippines has serious socio-economic political and environmental problems and therefore we must also devote our attention towards doing scientific and empirical research within the framework of local and oral history research that will have results which can serve as inputs toward the formulation of new policies including alternative policies that will bring greater benefit end of tape 
Philippines	 applause thank you very much secretary romulo secretary camacho and the other philippine participants in this consultative group meeting mr pooley and the other members of the o d a community friends from pampanga ladies and gentlemen i would like to welcome the representatives of the international donor community our partners in development to the philippines and to this conference we are honored to host this meeting the philippines that is for the second time thank you for your support and enduring faith in our country when i became president last year i said that we want to win the battle against poverty within the decade our vision of eradicating poverty within the decade is anchored on a comprehensive medium-term philippine development plan this plan revolves around four major components the first is an economic philosophy of free enterprise appropriate to the twenty-first century we believe that this philosophy will create more jobs in the sectors and areas that count most to ease the burden of the poor the second component is a modernized agricultural sector founded on social equity this will bring economic development to the rural areas where most of the poor live the third component is a social bias toward the disadvantaged to balance our economic development plan this will bring immediate relief to the longest-sufferers in the fringes of society the fourth component is to raise the moral standards of government and society we started implementing our development plan even before the document was printed we have been guided by real visible and measurable targets most of which are contained in my first state of the nation address before congress last year allow me to mention a few accomplishments economic growth last year created more than two million jobs reducing both unemployment and underemployment and exceeding the targets in our plan while the economies of most of our neighbors suffered declines last year as mentioned by mr pooley ours posted a three point four percent growth in g d p and a three point seven percent growth in g n p our g d p growth surpassed all expectations including our own we actually posted one of the highest output growth rates in east and southeast asia inflation was contained at six point one percent last year very close to the lower end of our target and inflation for february this year was at three point four percent the lowest in two years interest rates have gone down to their lowest in fifteen years and they can be expected to trigger an increase in economic activities the peso has also stabilized relative to the dollar the budget deficit was limited to a hundred forty-seven billion pesos while pursuing our priorities and without sacrificing our core values which include job creation agricultural modernization housing and education our message is clear government will keep the deficit within reasonable range i targeted twenty billion pesos a year for the implementation of the agriculture and fisheries modernization act but in actuality more than twenty-eight billion has been spent so far i targeted security of land tenure to a hundred fifty thousand urban poor families and a hundred thousand rural farming families and they have already been granted that more than thirty-four thousand low-salaried workers have already been given financial assistance for their housing needs we have already identified the more than one thousand six hundred barangays where we will construct school buildings so that all barangays will have a school by twenty oh four we have exceeded our target for health insurance coverage for the urban poor by more than eighty-five percent we have moved towards greater transparency in awarding contracts these have to be bidded out rather than negotiated we have computerized the bidding in public works we have exceeded the target set for the number of agencies to be registered under the electronic procurement system  the result from all these honest and faster contract awards we have infused in government to a great degree common sense discipline and accountability in management and public service civil society is in loop private sector groups have set up procurement ma watch which has been sanctioned to check the integrity of government purchases the report card survey project periodically measures public attitudes toward the delivery of services tax watch monitors the internal revenue service the volunteers against crime and corruption monitor the transactions of the department of public works and highways we have stabilized the domestic political situation while continuing to mop up residual problems of law and order we are putting in an additional two hundred million pesos into an effort to bolster our capability against kidnapping we will set up more operational teams exclusively focused on this threat we shall back up these teams with better surveillance equipment some sectors are trying to create an impression quite erroneous that the government is being wishy-washy in dealing with the political posturings of former president estrada who is under trial by the graft court i want to firmly dispel any impression that the government is engaged in any strategy of appeasement or compromise on this matter while i have said that the decision on any pending issue before the court is up to the court to decide this does not mean that the executive will take a passive stance against any attempt to deliberately undermine the court subvert allegiance to it or impede its rightful duties my duty as president is to defend the constitution and this extends to the defense of the great powers of government the executive judiciary and the legislature we will not stand by while any or all of these institutions are under threat the judiciary in particular has ample means to ward off nuisances and legalistic posturings but when there is a brazen attempt to destroy the credibility and functionality of any court of justice this calls for the concerted action by all institutions of democratic government and for that matter all the citizens of the democratic system both the supreme court and the leaders of the legislature have called upon the former president to confine his cause or struggle within the ambit of the court i have joined them in this call the presidency will not stand aside in the face of insidious machinations to take the struggle out of the courtroom and try to evolve it into a conspiracy to foment public disorder and undermine the people 's allegiance to the constitution and the system of justice the defense of the constitution and the rule of law are non-negotiable these cannot be the stuff of popularity or partisan contests all subterranean conspiracies shall stand down or face the full retribution of constitutional authority on the other horizon the decisiveness by which we shall continue to enforce the rule of law is only matched by our consistency and unswerving determination to keep the economy on track we have much much more to do to enable the poor to catch up the wealth gap must be closed growth statistics are meaningless to the jobless low inflation is irrelevant to the penniless a reduced budget deficit cannot be an argument to butter up the morale of hungry people with this pressing concern in mind we chose matapat na pamamahala tugon sa kahirapan or winning the war against poverty through good governance as the theme of this year 's consultati consultative group meeting as it was the theme of our edsa anniversary celebrations  matapat na pamamahala is loosely translated as good governance but it means much more it means caring being accountable and being open and transparent it connotes loyalty honesty and being true to one 's office  matapat na pamamahala is the key to the door of broader prosperity without it even the best-laid development plan is doomed to fail but with matapat na pamamahala government will devote its entire being spirit and resource to deliver the poor from the clutches of poverty we have no illusions about the gigantic challenge ahead all leaders from three continents i have consulted over the past year are one in saying that resolving poverty needs the combined resources of the entire planet to succeed it needs the combined efforts of all the well-meaning governments and institutions of the world and it brooks no delay a global alliance can be forged to wage war against poverty and we should forge this alliance just as we forged an alliance against the scourge of terrorism i thank you all for being there to help us as we navigated our economy from troubled seas to calmer waters last year i trust that you will continue to be by our side as we proceed our country through buffeting storms and uncertainties that have that cha have characterized the world economy we have used the official development assistance your governments and institutions have extended to help effect key reforms and to finance the budget deficit and major infrastructure and human development investments in all these i assure you that we are spending on the right things and living within our means we are unlocking key bottlenecks that have hampered the use of o d a in the past year this is what i did when i was at the helm of the department of social welfare and development before i became president and this is what i am doing now for the entire government we are integrating process and action more sharply we are meeting with project managers as often as we can we are monitoring their prompt implementation of our decisions and we are working under concrete time frames of compliance we need more legislation to unlock some bottlenecks we will continue to work with congress to clear the track forward all systems are moving forward we know where we are headed and we are trying to mark the milestones as we painstakingly traverse them our vehicle is in good running condition and judging from what mr pooley said in his welcoming remarks i hope you believe that we have a competent driver behind the steering wheel applause  but we need all the extra fuel we can stock to go the full distance applause  i trust that you will continue to extend us the much needed assistance the extra fuel for the journey 's continuity so that we can reach our goal of poverty-free philippines and contribute to a poverty-free world within the decade on this note let me thank you once again for the privilege of welcome you welcoming you  mabuhay and we may we all meet success in this meeting thank you applause 
Philippines	 tagapangulo angel alcala chairman of the commission on higher education i 'll also greet the uh distinguished personalities with me at this stage the minister of education and manpower development of the kingdom of lusaka minister uh lanola reverend father salazar chairman of the resolutions committee and president of the cocopea and commissioner uh mona valisno chairperson of this world congress nineteen ninety-seven the uh honorable members of the philippine senate and the the house of representatives our congressmen and the congressmen and congresswomen of this world congress of nineteen ninety-seven applause your excellencies of the diplomatic corps and international organizations and other co-workers in the government other special guests mga kababayan at mga kapatid ladies and gentlemen first of all let me assure you that my speech will not be as long as the manila declaration laughter  having just returned from a hectic series of visits to the united kingdom oman and greece all in just nine days it truly is an energizing event to be in this distinguished company back here at home in the philippines  in fact i still have the dust of the acropolis in my shoes because i came directly from word but one thing i learned from our short visit to greece the cradle of democracy and the home of ancient civilization which still influences us to this day word higher education we must make sure that education does not go to our heads but to our minds di ko yata naintindihan yun 'a laughter   translating education is okay  this gathering of many of the world 's leading educators and human resource development executives both in the public and in the private sector is indeed a great honor for us  your dialogues discussions papers resolutions and declarations reflect the anticipation of the global community of a new era of greater interaction cooperation and benefit among the eminent personalities and academic institutions represented here and on a larger scale the various stakeholders in the worldwide knowledge society including the children after us our common quest for peace and prosperity has been accelerated by the advancement of telecommunications linking communities across the globe and overcoming the economic and cultural barriers among and between peoples the world over such a form of networking my dear friends among human societies has made possible the greater integration of knowledge and the exchange of cultural and technological information enabling people to make better decisions from a wider range of options our shared aspirations for a better world have led to the development of new modes of cooperation not only among governments but also among subcultures within our societies international networks have become significant not only for the exchange of information but more so as mechanisms for cooperat cooperative action and policy formulation and advocacy  we 're seeing the opportunities for subcultures and remote communities to learn and act across traditional national and ethnic boundaries these networks represent the strength of hitherto unconnected communities asserting now the right to participate in policy decisions affecting their futures all over the world these opportunities have become challenges in many forms and they have manifested themselves in the hard decisions that lie before our educators and educational managers  words teachers for example have been called upon to be more efficient more relevant more forward-looking and more learner-focused at the same time we need to deal with such issues as sustainable development quality and excellence equal opportunity human rights integration of technology and the cultural content of learning as evidenced by uh your reports and your compendiums which i received by fax even while i was abroad there is a growing universal concern that higher education has found it harder to keep its traditional position at the forefront of human resource and national development higher education in most countries including the philippines is in some kind of crisis and this has been brought about by the rapid increases in enrollment and the declining capacity of governments to sustain budgetary support to higher educational institutions education is clearly under pressure to respond to changing global economic and social conditions it has had to reengineer and take advantage of information technology to globalize and decentralize in the same manner that corporations have to do indeed as some experts suggest transnational education may be the logical outcome of as well as a primary factor in the intensification of global interconnectedness furthermore education should increasingly be viewed as a commodity to be shaped according to consumer demand this perception of education as a market product or service provider creates a new focus on the requirements of the students and the job market thus enabling students' preferences to be embedded into the learning environment and given top priority under this scenario educators just like businessmen need to be more flexible and overcome the structural rigidities of traditional institutions for teachers as well as learners this raises important and fundamental questions challenges and choices for instance what is education about how is it best delivered and by whom and who pays the bills and how can they be reduced without sacrificing quality this international congress must address these three questions alongside such vital issues as assuring excellence and quality the roles of universities and colleges in the twenty first century new leadership roles cost effective resource management borderless learning mechanisms application of multimedia technologies modalities of financing higher education institutions internationalization of higher education and mutual recognition and comparability of credentials governments all over the world have adjusted with varying degrees of commitment to the challenge of survival and relevance of higher education institutions and are doing what they can to provide sustain if not increase support these are solid steps forward but we all need to do more recent and comprehensive studies suggest that if higher education has to rethink its mission then it must be with the social environment defined by political democratization economic globalization regional trade agreements social and regional polarization discrimination of various social groups and cultural fragmentation we are all urged to review and to reform existing structures and practices in higher education where necessary accepting the challenge of sustainable development for example will imply that higher education institutions must reexamine their relationships to the economy and to social realities their organizational structures and their funding and spending modalities developing countries in particular face the dual challenges of improving their human resources and reducing poverty levels in this context higher education and research are seen as extremely important factors in development policy higher education and human resources development in the asia pacific for the twenty-first century are critical concerns which were addressed not too long ago by leaders of eighteen member economies in the asia pacific region during the apec summit hosted by the philippines last november nineteen ninety-six at that historic gathering the leaders renewed their commitment to enriching the lives and to improving the standards of living of all citizens in the asia pacific region on a sustainable basis and this world congress brings the effort yet another step forward in the asia pacific governments have supported the closer integration of education research and development and information technology and the strategies that go with it with the requirements of the globalizing economy many southeast asian countries have indicated in concrete terms the levels of investment they are willing to commit to these activities we can anticipate that before the century turns massive new investments shall have been made in enriching and sharpening our people 's skills and talents the mutual recognition of skills qualifications and standards of professional practice has been a continuing top priority concern of the apec working group on human resources development here in the philippines as you already know we have created the commission on higher education ched and the higher education development fund h e d f to undertake whatever reforms may be necessary to bring our standards over time up to par with the world 's best learning institutions this surge is what we envisage for the philippines we have adopted what we call our pole-vaulting strategy to diminish the gap between ourselves and our more prosperous neighbors and then to move ahead central to this strategy will be the establishment of the philippines as an education and knowledge center in the asia pacific i like to add the objectives also of making the philippines a maritime power and a medical center in east asia among others these are just some of the competitive niches that we have identified for ourselves in the global economy this means capitalizing on and optimizing our basic strengths and distinct advantages our open society our archipelagic setting and strategic location astride the two great oceans of commerce the pacific ocean and the south china sea our adaptable workforce and our strength in services such as information technology or knowledge-based words enterprises we must give the highest priority to intensifying and speeding up reforms that free the market to prepare the ground for faster and sustained economic growth and social development but to attain global excellence in our chosen niches we must emphasize and encourage innovation by promoting a culture of creativity productivity and excellence in both the public and the private sectors we must set for ourselves the specific objectives that are high enough to be meaningful and should stand out as ambitious even among the east asian tiger economies that is why for our pole-vaulting strategy we in the philippines have chosen the olympic motto citius fortius altius faster stronger and higher in all of this we place the highest value on education which we realize has always been one of our strongest resources thus this congress is a great source of interest and inspiration for all of us judging by the superior quality of the papers presented cough and the number of declarations to which you have agreed in this congress i have no doubt my dear friends that you have words more significant contributions to mankind 's search for new knowledge and the attainment of the true potentials of the individual i am extremely pleased to know that at this congress various memoranda of agreement and understanding were reached between and among ministries of education in countries such as canada thailand and others with our philippine commission on higher education these agreements should enable our colleges and universities to cooperate and work more easily and more fruitfully with one another in closing let me also commend the congress organizers for bringing together in manila the ministers of education the presidents of leading universities in the world and the most eminent experts on human resource development in behalf of our people and our government i thank you all for your support and selfless efforts towards enriching the minds and the futures of all our peoples and of humankind as a whole thank you  mabuhay
