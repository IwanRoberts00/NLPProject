yeah our house is about fifteen minutes away fifteen minutes away  so how it how is angeles now without the base was it better than when it had the bases or i think it 's better 'cause they 're like uhm converting the  former former base into uh an eco ecozone uh-huh there are more there are more there are more people coming in yeah but was it better when the americans were there i mean did you get any advantages from them i mean like uhm their uhm what do you call this their discipline something like keep angeles clean like in subic olongapo there 's not much difference because they just stay in the base yeah they don't do they go out i mean out of the base aside from the red light district sometimes yeah do you have american neighbors or are they all in the base it doesn't just in the base   not in our house not in your house are you in your village really i don't know do you know anybody from angeles named vanessa santos yeah i i know she she was she graduated from holy family
