""
""
mr speaker may i ask that the gentleman from antique the
honorable exequiel javier be recognized to interpellate   the sponsor
""
""
""
 the chair   recognizes the gentleman from antique
""
what 's the pleasure of the gentleman from antique
""
""
uh mr speaker uh may i be allowed to field some uh 
clarificato  clarificatory questions to   the sponsor 
""
""
 the sponsor   may yield if he so desires
""
""
uh yes mr speaker
""
""
thank you mr speaker
""
uh mr speaker  uh i 'm in support of this bill but uh on uh a
qualified basis mr speaker 
""
i 'm also a member of the uh ways and means committee
""
now my question is uh your honor  uh will this uh increased rate
be a permanent fixture in our national internal revenue code
""
""
does the gentleman refer to the the proposed increase in the
excise tax on all the items enumerated in the bill
""
""
uh yes your honor
""
""
yes, your honor   there is  no proviso here that
states otherwise 
""
""
 uh   in other words your honor uh this uh
increased rate will forever be in the internal revenue code 
""
mr speaker uh  this bill uh represents what i think is uh  a
uh  measure imposing uh  the so-called  sin taxes 
""
""
this is true because  sloth mr speaker  is one of the
cardinal sins 
""
sloth in ordinary parlance is laziness
""
this bill represents the lazy government that we have mr speaker
because uh these taxes on sin products mr speaker are the easiest source of
revenue for government
""
every time the government suffers a deficit every time it needs
money  it looks at these products petroleum products  beer  liquor
and cigarettes  as the source of revenue since  the taxes are
collected at the place of production 
""
so when government needs immediate cash they resort to these
so-called taxes on sin products 
""
we cannot forever allow this government  to keep on imposing
taxes  at the same time the government does not do anything about
inefficiency in the collection of taxes in looking for ways and means  of
finding other sources of revenue to defray the cost of government mr speaker
""
so your honor we plead you to be agreeable  to put a sunset
clause on this bill that it only be imposed for two years 
""
""
uh your honor uh this is not yet the appropriate time to
consider uh the amendments and therefore during the period of amendments the
subject could very well be discussed
""
but i would want to point out uh your honor that uh  there had
been occasions also in the past when taxes on these items were reduced by the
government and in fact  it was reduced pursuant to uh executive order
number nine four seven and further reduced later pursuant to p d nineteen
sixty-nine
""
so the point your honor is while the law that is being amended
seems to be permanent in nature your honor because there is no sunset clause
it is however a fact that from time to time the government amends 
whenever there is no further need for this
""
and in fact the government has indeed amended by reducing the taxes
in the past 
""
""
uh mr speaker uh this uh  probably in the history of the
national internal revenue code  the taxes on so-called sin products have
been the most dynamic 
""
year in and year out they have been increased simply because the
government is lazy to improve  its  rec  collection system  and
to look for ways  of uh looking for alternative sources of revenue and to
cut  the burgeoning uh bureaucracy 
""
my point uh your honor is  let 's deliver a message to the
government  that at least it must put its house in order at least in
terms of raising revenues
""
they cannot forever come to us in this chamber and impose taxes
which heat which  hit both the both the poor and the rich 
""
these are the taxes which cut across all sectors of society because
these are the taxes which are shifted to the consumers 
""
when you buy beer the company does not pay the tax it 's the beer
drinker who pays the tax 
""
when uh  you smoke a cigarette it is not the government which
pay the tax because it is not the company which pays the tax it is the small
 word  who pay the tax
""
and usually it is the poor people  who want to drink for example
uh rum or  smoke uhm locally manufactured cigarettes cheap local
cigarettes who are hit by this kind of taxes 
""
so let 's teach at least this government a lesson  to improve
its taxes collection system
""
and as the speaker said  let 's cut  or trim down the budget
of the government by uh removing uh the excess fat 
""
that 's one way of uh keeping the government  within its means
 instead of raising taxes which impose a heavy burden on our people 
""
so mr speaker  if the uh the uh sponsor of uh or uhm uh our
honorable chairman would agree  just to deliver a message to the
government why don't we just put a limit a timeframe for these increased
taxes
""
by nineteen ninety-two  these increased taxes should be 
should have a sunset clause
""
after nineteen ninety-two then we go back to the reduced the
existing rates
""
""
uh mr speaker the committee on ways and means of which the
gentleman is a member has been doing its best to compel the government to
improve its collection 
""
and the fact remains mr speaker that during the deliberation of
this bill the gentleman never spoke against it 
""
so it came as a surprise for a vice-chairman of the committee on
ways and means would now be talking about all those things when he kept quiet
all this time during the deliberation by the committee
""
mr speaker i want to point out that under the rule  a member who
voted in favor of a measure has no business talking about or against that
certain measure
""
""
mr speaker what i 'm trying to deliver was is to deliver a
message to the government that we cannot keep on uhm imposing taxes
""
what i 'm suggesting is let 's deliver a message by putting a
timeframe to the effectivity of these increased taxes
""
""
no   your honor  i will not accept that
""
""
 this is uh  
""
""
  this is not  the period of amendment mr speaker
""
""
""
 just giving the  
""
""
with the permission of the gentlemen on the floor the session
is suspended   break in recording 
""
session is resumed 
""
""
mr speaker  uh pursuant to section twenty-nine of uh the
house rules i have filed my written objection to this bill with the secretary
""
""
so it cannot be said  that uh as a member of this of the
committee on ways and means i did not uh stand up and interpellate
""
and mr speaker it 's not true that i 'm here to grandstand 
""
what i 'm here is to deliver to the government that we cannot go on
relying on taxes 
""
uh the government should also impose uh  put its house in order
""
that 's all mr speaker 
""
""
uh mr speaker  as chairman of the committee i 'm not aware
of the written objection cited by the gentleman
""
but the fact remains  that he participated actively in drafting
these provisions
""
and in fact i do remember that he was the one who called me in the
office of commissioner ong  to do the finishing touches  on all of
these provisions 
""
so your honor  as vice chairman of the committee  he has to
fulfill his duty 
""
and as i 've said  i 'm not aware of such written objection 
and this committee report does not state such reservation 
""
""
mr speaker  words 
""
""
yes yes
""
""
the uh gentleman from the first district of the province of
cebu the honorable antonio bacaltos be recognized to interpellate the sponsor
""
""
may i be allowed   to  
""
""
 any member  any member can stand up and seek
recognition of the chair without having to clear with the majority leader
should the any member wish to interpellate
""
the chair recognizes the gentleman from cebu  and the sponsor
may yield if he so desires 
""
""
thank you mr speaker 
""
""
the gentleman from cebu  has sought uh permission of the
sponsor to interpellate
""
and the sponsor may yield if he so desires 
""
""
yes your honor go ahead
""
""
mr speaker your honor  may i be allowed to ask whether
there is any difference or distinction between the word  
ad valorem   tax and excise tax   ad valorem
 tax and excise tax
""
is there any distinction between   the  two
""
""
 excise tax   your honor is a term that is used on
specific items uh it is a kind of tax your honor
""
the  ad valorem  your honor is based on value
""
""
""
value
""
now may i please refer your honor mr speaker to the provision of
 one one eight four six two letter d found on the fourth page of the bill
""
now what really is the intent of the committee insofar as the word
   ad valorem   tax of of sixty-five
percent open parenthesis sixty-five percent close parenthesis of the 
importers'  wholesale price and fifty-five percent  open parenthesis
figure fifty-five percent close parenthesis beginning july one nineteen
ninety 
""
is this not to be understood that there is a reduction of the
 ad valorem  tax  july one nineteen ninety
""
in other words from sixty-five it has to be reduced to fifty-five
percent
""
""
that is correct your honor and this is pursuant to a
commitment made by the government  uh pursuant to the general agreement on
tariffs and trade uh  with a syncronym uh acronym rather  gatt
""
this is one of the gatt provisions
""
""
uh there is uh does it have to be understood therefore that uh
instead of increasing it has to be reduced
""
because what i understand in the caption of this bill is that 
and it reads as follows an act increasing the  ad valorem 
tax on fermented liquors  uh an act increasing the excise tax on
distilled spirits wines fermented liquor and cigarettes amending for the
purpose section one thirty-eight one thirty-nine one hundred forty and one
hundred forty-two open parenthesis c close parenthesis and open parenthesis d
close parenthesis of the national internal revenue code as amended
""
am i therefore  wrong in my  por  perception that this
would amount to a reduction instead of an increase so that the government
will profit by way of increasing tax on imported cigarettes
""
""
the gentleman is correct your honor and perhaps at the
appropriate time the title of the bill may be amended
""
but the point here mr speaker is that uh the government does not
collect anything on imported cigarettes because nobody pays taxes on imported
cigarettes
""
and the reduction your honor is to make the imported cigarettes at
par with locally manufactured cigarettes bearing a foreign brand which will
be also fifty-five percent
""
and this as i have said your honor is one of the commitments made
by the government  uh pursuant to the uh general agreement on tariffs and
trade
""
""
so the subsequent question will be in this manner
""
uh  do you think it would be proper to incorporate this
provision relating to letter d of uh section one hundred forty-two
considering that what is within the contemplation as explained by your honor
mr speaker is that it has to be reduced or was it because is it because of
the reduction contemplated in letter d that there was sort of a conformity on
the part of the distinguished author that at the time of amendment such an
amendment might uh come in for introduction 
""
""
your honor perhaps what could be done is to amend the title
of the bill
""
because your honor what we are doing really is shooting two birds
""
our government made a commitment to  uh other countries and uh
according to other countries pursuant to the discussion made by our
government our government cannot use should not use  internal taxes  to
protect domestically  proda  uh produced products which are of the
same kind as the one being exported to us
