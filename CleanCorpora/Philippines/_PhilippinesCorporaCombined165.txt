if you find somebody   we we feel we we feel your honor that the these matters that are being asked have already been the subject of stipulation as a matter of fact the question as to what branches uh has the witness jurisdiction over was testified to yesterday already that 's correct mr chief justice  do not forget what had been taken up yesterday so to avoid repetition of questions  mr chief justice yesterday i was not able to ask the specific branches of citibank under the supervision of the witness and mr chief justice may we also raise the point that uh up to now there is no basis to ask these questions of the witness considering there that there is as yet no evidence that he participated in the preparation of all these exhibits that is our point mr chief justice uh there has been no basis laid the direct testimony is still incomplete mr chief justice uh mr witness uh there is a there are machine prints after the word the name ejercito luisa p which is not clear in all the copies uh all the photocopies of the original and only you have possession of the original would you like to read for the record uh what these uh machine prints are okay uhm it 's uhm with s h i g h customer list  it stands for with standing hold instruction greenhills customer list   s h i means standing hold instruction your honor what do you mean by standing hold instruction  uh this is our own internal computer tagging system wherein uh an important client is tagged so that uh wherever he or she transacts in any branch would be given uh you know the proper recognition accommodation and uh the next line is uh if i may read philip p h p eight million four hundred thousand  the next line uh reads uh book equal eleven million eight hundred ninety-five thousand one hundred thirty-two and seventeen centavos  avail the word avail is equals to three million four hundred ninety-five thousand one hundred thirty-eight and seventeen centavos is that correct uhm yes your honor i also want to qualify that this is uh internal uh copy of the deposit slip the customer copy does not contain the book or the available  what do you mean by book and available  uh the book balance is the one that is reflected wherein after a check deposit is made the customer cannot withdraw the money yet because the check has not cleared the available balance is the one that the customer can withdraw at any point in time so does it mean then that at the time the two metro bank checks were deposited the account had a had an available balance of three million four hundred ninety-five thousand one hundred thirty-eight and seventeen centavos yes your honor now the account number in this exhibit septuple f is one six six eight two zero is that correct uh yes your honor and then in the box the name is uh account name is luisa p ejercito is this correct yes your honor who filled up uh this information uh mr witness as far as we know uh it is the uh authorized representative of the first lady and then uh in the box at the bottom right side of the deposit slip exhibit septuple f it reads for internal use only and then there are markings here uh would you like to read these markings for the information of this honorable court we have to object to these questions your honor if the only purpose is to read the entries there the objection is sustained there had been stipulation on the existence of the documents and the entries thereon what had been allowed by the chair uh insofar as some of the questions are concerned would only be some kind of explanation yes mr chief justice uh let me re-form then uh mr witness uh these handwritten uh words seem to read like with preclearance from the words the name is no longer legible would you like to explain to this honorable court we have the same objection mr chief justice it asked for an explanation witness may answer okay uhm i will read first the what 's written there is a signature of the uh branch manager with a note with pre-clearance from our uh compliance officer ian fenton and there was a time indicated that around almost five o 'clock four fifty who wrote this uh the branch manager your honor and his or her name is uh what uh geraldine nakpil so these are the handwriting this is the handwriting of geraldine nakpil this this is her handwriting your honor okay now uh who is ian fenton uh immaterial mr chief justice mr chief justice these are the subject of stipulations no mr chief justice he is only asking for who is the person answer uh ian fenton was the compliance officer at the time of the deposit your honor uhm and by compliance officer you 're referring to an officer of the bank that makes sure that the laws applicable and pertaining to that bank are followed leading mr chief justice is that correct sustained what do you mean by a compliance officer  immaterial this this sustained they have no materiality mr chief justice could you tell this court uh what the duties are of ian fenton as compliance officer the same objection mr chief justice witness may answer uhm ian fenton was acting as the compliance officer the compliance officer makes sure that all the guidelines are followed all control processes are followed and uh the the transaction itself uh was done with the right procedures and by when you mentioned about guidelines you you refer to guidelines including those uh that apply with respect to accounts of substantial amount uh and or accounts maintained by politicians or and public officials and their spouses  leading leading mr chief justice sustained what are these guidelines uh mr witness we believe these questions are immaterial mr chief justice to the purpose of the offer let 's see let 's see uh what would be the materiality later okay uhm the guidelines your honor you see uh in the bank we establish thresholds for each customer 'no  depending on the customer certain threshold amount that they deposit creates a trigger that we have to probe the nature of the deposit and the underlined transaction like for example an ordinary individual we may set a trigger of let 's say five hundred thousand or one million while probably a businessman who is a big-time businessman we may even set limits of higher ten million or up so depends on each individual we set triggers for uh monitoring do you have thresholds for public officials immaterial mr chief justice sustained what thresholds if any do you have with respect to deposits maintained by public officials the same objection mr chief justice sustained for lack of basis  you said  now mr witness you said s h i refers to special hold instruction is that correct when you say that an account is tagged as s h i and then the letters after that are g h list does this mean greenhills list yes your honor when an account is tagged does that mean that an account officer or an officer of the bank takes care focuses on that particular account leading mr chief justice sustained what does that mean when an account is tagged as ace s h i the question is immaterial mr chief justice overruled witness may answer uh s h i means uh there could be special instructions there could be hold instructions so it could be any series of instructions that we put on the customer memo so that when a customer comes to any branch it will be followed in this particular case the deposit of mrs luisa p ejercito the first lady who is that officer that handles this account of citibank  i don't think that would be material  i don't think that would be material mr chief justice the uh since it is not a an unqualified objection it it is overruled we have to object we have to object your honor on the ground that the question is immaterial overruled the uh account officer is marivic pantaleon thank you mr witness  is mar marivic pantaleon still the account officer if she is  immaterial immaterial mr chief justice i i withdraw that question mr chief justice anyway we will find that out in due time let me bring you now to exhibit avoid avoid immaterial uh avoid some uh objections based on immateriality so you can go and move faster i want to i know you can do that yes mr chief justice but it seems to me that uh-uh my esteemed colleague in the profession atty flami flaminiano is so sensitive to these instruments no it is not sensitivity i guess we try to save time  if your honor please  yes mr chief justice go direct to the point exhibit septuple f dash four uh and exhibit i 'm sorry uh and the submarked uh items marked exhibit septuple f dash two and septuple f dash three this is a microfilm copy of the check drawn by issued by governor luis chavit singson dated august twenty september twenty-nine nineteen ninety-nine for eight million payable to cash and uh signed by him now on exhibit septuple f dash three at the right side of this check numbers appear one six six eight two zero can you please explain to this honorable court what these numbers mean mr chief justice these are the subject of our stipulations not covered by the stipulation the witness may answer it is trying to explain an entry there okay uh it is bank practice that we always ensure that the account number is written at the back of the check to make sure that it is uh you know if there is uh audit trail that shows that where the check is being credited to just in case there are returns or are there are problems with the check we know where the account uh where the check belongs to your honor and whose account is this one six six eight two zero that has been admitted your honor admitted already in the stipulation stipulations yes mr chief justice uh the next question then is since the check was deposited to this account were the proceeds of this check credited to this account  the answer is very obvious   what is the objection  objection your honor what is the basis for being immaterial and for lack of basis overruled because of the grounds invoked uh yes your honor in the amount of how much uh just to qualify there were two checks that they but this one was an eight-million check your honor it was credited your honor and so since the deposit slip uh covered a total deposit of eight point four million the amount deposited or the amount credited total amount credited to the account of the first lady c a s a account number one six six eight two zero was how much
