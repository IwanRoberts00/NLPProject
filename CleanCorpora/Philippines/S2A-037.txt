""
okay uh good morning my fellow administrators
""
uhm a student uh came to me one day to interview me for a school paper
""
and the first question he asked me was uh  how do you find your work as an administrator
""
by way of an answer i said uh would you tell me what you call the season from june to december here in our country
""
and at first his answer was rainy season ma'am
""
and i said not quite because sometimes in a normal situation you don't find any rain in december
""
and because he sensed that i was driving at something he said uh it 's the typhoon season ma'am
""
and i said precisely that is the season that we go through as administrators
""
typhoons come sometimes if you 're unlucky you uh you get from akang to bening to herming to yoling  names of typhoons 
""
and we have to you know handle them well
""
and uh today i am going to give you as share with you some of the cases that we 've have come our way in dasmari&ntilde;as
""
and uh give you a short background and maybe uh tell you how we handle the case 
""
 break in the recording  faculty member she was on her second year of probation who sued the school for illegal dismissal and unfair labor practice
""
you know this is uh a baptism of fire for me because the decision of the national labor relations commission uh which was final and executory came during my first month in office
""
so i was telling myself my goodness this is the tail end of typhoon akang 
""
but there are some lessons that could be learned and these i 'd like to share with you because in this case the faculty member who was on probation was rehired after one year despite the unfavorable evaluation of the chair
""
that is she was given a second chance
""
although the chair 's evaluation  rep  uh pointed to her teaching approach as not fit to college level teaching
""
uh we were saying that maybe that should not have been done because one year would be enough for us to assess two uh two semesters to assess the competence of a faculty member
""
second the faculty member felt that her poor evaluation was a personal bias on the part of the chair and the coordinator
""
because records show when i saw this in the file that to substantiate their stand against the faculty member they did an interview of her students and she learned about this
""
uh people who were present at that time intimated to me that if only those involved had sat down to talk and had really engaged in a sincere dialogue and discussion this could not have been a court case
""
the university lost the case uh we paid back wages and attorney 's fees in the amount of three hundred thousand pesos
""
we tried to appeal the case to the supreme court but then the lawyer did not take good care of our case and therefore we really lost the case and paid the attorney 's fees and the back wages
""
this is for three years back wages for three years
""
luckily the the salary at dasmari&ntilde;as is low so even for three years it amounted only to that much
""
uh the second case i 'd like to uh share with you is a case of breach of contract  uh by a faculty member
""
all these cases are involving faculty members
""
the university was constrained to seek the assistance of a  leg  legal counsel to handle the case of one faculty member who abandoned his classes at the middle of the semester in favor of a job abroad
""
considered a beach a breach of contract the abandonment really caused tremendous difficulty on the part of the school who assigned classes to other faculty members
""
but a close look at the case revealed that his immediate supervisor failed to explain to him the consequences of his act and even facilitated his exit by endorsing his letter of resignation to the v p academics
""
so we asked the help of a legal counsel which is accra and accra sent him a letter informing him that he indeed uh committed a breach of contract and demanding a payment of twenty thousand pesos for moral damages
""
twenty thousand is not much money but we wanted to give the teachers in school a lesson not to abandon their classes in mid-stream
""
well he has complied with this requirement but the harm has been done to the classes that was assigned to him and that is for one  half of the semester
""
the third case i 'd like to share with you is a case of misappropriation of funds 
""
using a college trust fund we have trust funds in our university
""
a check was issued by the university to one department chair for implementing a school activity
""
i think this was a case of a debate this was a debate to be attended by a group of students in one university
""
now at that time one faculty member who was also on probation was in-charge of the activity and the money was entrusted to him by the chair
""
the activity did not push through for some reasons but the faculty failed to return the money
""
meantime the status board had to meet because the faculty member was on probation and it was the term was about to end and the the decision was to let his contract expire
""
when he learned about this he stopped coming to school
""
but of course he had given the examination that was the end of the semester 
""
when the course card distribution came he could nowhere be found
""
and so the chair uh did his best to look for him
""
he succeeded in retrieving the grades
""
but the money is still uh not returned to the school
""
well in our opinion the person accountable for the money should have  dis   fa  should have disbursed the fund himself
""
and entrusting the same to one who is on probation and had a record of indiscriminate borrowing from fellow teachers should not have should have been avoided 
""
another case is the case of uh cheating during examinations
""
would you believe that we we had a teacher who tolerated cheating while proctoring a class and a uh a group of students complained about it
""
and now because the complaint was written we had to to uh institute due process
""
and so therefore we had the grievance board and there and so forth and so on
""
and the findings by the grievance board showed that the teacher was indeed guilty of the charge and he admitted it in writing
""
well the v p academics consulted me and asked me what are we going to do with the case
""
i said well uh we can terminate him  'no  but uh out of compassion we simply asked him you resign now because the students might you know pursue the case
""
so he resigned at the middle of the term 
""
uh this is one case where the vigilance on the part of the faculty could have prevented a formal complaint by the students because we were informed by some faculty members that in the past similar cases had already happened uh involving the same teacher but these were not reported to us and therefore nothing was done so far
""
so only when the complaint was filed that we had to act on it
""
and the last but the not the least uh case i 'd like to share with you i entitled it status board decision versus promised ranks by the chair and the coordinator 
""
uh as in other units ranks are decided by a board not by individual persons  'no 
""
but in this uh instance uh many times the decision proved to be different from those promised by a chair when he hires or recruits the faculty member
""
and a crisis occurs when the concerned faculty who was promised a higher rank than the one decided by the board will not respect the board 's decision
""
and in our case the faculty member even stopped teaching after two weeks because he did not get the rank that he wanted
""
but we have a faculty manual which has to be followed and uh it has to be respected 
""
so the situation could have been avoided we said if an initial but thorough assessment evaluation of the credentials of the faculty member had been done even before promising anything
""
and maybe he 's telling the faculty member that that is just an estimate don't don't take it as as already awarded to you the the appointment the rank
""
because it is the board that makes the final decision
""
well ideally and i think we all should observe this no one starts handling a class prior to his official appointment so that we will not get into trouble
""
and that presupposes then that those of us in the departments should be ready with the papers and all the hiring requirements so that the status board can meet the hiring board can meet before the start of any term
""
that 's all that i can share with you today
""
