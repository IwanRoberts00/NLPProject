you too what have you been doing uh i 've been busy reviewing for dr isagani 's oral exam and i 'm glad it 's over yes i 'm glad it 's over too  so and what were your feelings earlier before uh there our names were called before the exam i was really nervous and i couldn't breathe and i had my notes in at hand and i i i don't think i was really prepared for that my mind was just in scramble so   did you wake up early for for this for today  yeah  what time did you wake up six a m six a m i woke up at five thirty six a m and then i was here eight sharp i was looking for the cla i was lost this morning so was i i was lost i was lost i was looking for the classroom and then i saw lisa and then we saw another classmate and then she said oh it 's at william hall uh uhm second floor yeah i had the misconception that it was gonna be held in our classroom that 's why i went there i was running after marianne  that 's what i thought  and then when i went up there where is marianne she 's gone and so i figured this must be the wrong room so i went downstairs again and proceeded to the office of dr cruz and i saw him uh drinking water fountain asked him where the exam is gonna be held so what was your question uh the question was what number did you get i think it 's number two number two asking me about the best module how about you number three the best teacher oh it 's sort of related so who did you choose as best teacher actually uhm marianne marianne word  and how long did it take you to you know uhm i tried to talk so that i could consume my five minutes so tha i i didn't want them to ask me any follow-up question but then uhm the examiner had the chance to ask me a question which wasn't related to the original question that i got so i was really nervous but after that it was a relief yeah it 's a relief i also thought that i was able to consume the five minutes but i was wrong i guess they don't know how to count counting it backwards i suppose i think i only finished uh i i finished my explanation in uh two and a half minutes  hindi kasi you speak very fast very very fast and so when i when i was done and i was looking at the what do you call this what the dr isagani cruz was looking at and i figured that well i still have about three minutes two minutes four minutes and so they were able to ask me several questions two to three questions and he was even thinking what to ask me i was lucky because the examiner only had two questions was it difficult what was the exact question it it 's difficult because i don't think it 's related to the question that i got the the follow-up question was how was i gonna teach the same subject to a second year biology class so uh uhm it 's really difficult because i haven't really thought about that and we were talking earlier that uh marianne i and purita were talking that it 's better to have the examination really really early in the morning so that he 's still out of sync which he does  uh uhm  yeah he doesn't know what to ask yeah since she 's feeling her way so we figured we would have a very very uh good advantage   because i when i when it was my turn she was already getting the hang of it so that 's why definitely first she was just observing you know   uhm  trying to ask careful questions and all that and i made the explanation very very long that same question that she asked me i made it very very long but still unfortunately it wasn't long enough because dr cruz still asked me another question uh uhm out of this world i don't remember now what he asked me anyway don't you remember just to change the topic i don't wanna talk about it anymore chuckle  it was really it really gives me a funny feeling when i think about it the oral exam what are you gonna do this summer this summer i 'm still gonna teach teach yeah i have a teaching load this summer how about you uh uh uhm what am i gonna do divulge uhm i 'm going to hong kong with my boyfriend we 're going to visit my father and my sisters so i leave uhm before the fifteenth  my sister who 's twelve years old na she 's going to be baptized on the twenty-second so and it 's my father 's birthday on the twenty-seventh too good for you at least you 're gonna have a vacation i have had such a long vacation because i haven't worked since i graduated really how long has it been march ninety-nine since march ninety-nine march ninety-nine so it 's been a year 'cause after graduation i went to hong kong my my father didn't really think that i should get an m a it was already june when he decided uh maybe you should get an m a uh uhm so i went back for the second term and when i got back i didn't really think of working first because i was you know i tend to study again   i see   you 've been bumming around for a year huh  enjoying yourself   not exactly because when i came here it was really uhm a time for coping because back in college it was really spoon-feeding  uh uhm  yes very different here i have to agree so and then last month i started applying and i i passed the examinations at the bank of commerce for corporate communications i 'm still set for a final interview but i don't think i 'm gonna go for it  i don't  i just wanted to experience because i 'm studying because i wanna teach  so why should i i was thinking if i 'd get a summer job but then i didn't know that i was going to leave for hong kong okay  why not   uh uhm  how long would you be staying in hong kong just for a month because i 'm going to enroll for the first term oh yeah first term would be uh what about you how 's teaching how 's teaching oh boy what are your students like my students uh most of them come from public schools uh uhm but i prefer that i teach at s t i people keep on asking me why why why why not you know teach in a better school  uh uhm   yeah  yeah the question is you know uh why is it that the good teachers always end up in good universities i mean we have already so many good teachers in for example in this university uh uhm i don't think i 'm needed here anymore unlike in the schools there   why not  unlike for example at the s t i the students really need good teachers there because they don't have a good background uh especially pag public schools chances are all of the subject matters not even spoon-feeding nothing they know nothing when they come in grammar is zero zero not only zero  and i pity them  uh uhm   uh uhm  i agree and their confidence level is really low   very very low but they 're nicer  they 're nicer because because of the confidence level when i uh when when we 're with our uhm what do you call this uh the students there in mr cruz 's class dr cruz 's class the the undergrads there compared to the undergrads at s t i word   yeah they are   uh uhm i can't even uh what do you call this iv short for a 's name i can't even fathom how these particular students from s t i were able to graduate from high school in the first place but they 're very very eager to learn compared to the students here who are a little bit you know smart-ass   uh uhm  yeah which is a good sign  that 's a good sign that they are going to to learn more because they 're eager to learn uh uhm they 're eager to learn how about you where do you plan to teach if ever uhm i have an application in a college in lucena city and in a university i plan to teach part-time because i 'm studying right so i haven't gone back there yet but they said that i can start in june  uh uhm  are you gonna teach what subjects english mostly and literature literature both uh uhm so how many units do you think you 'll be taking on i don't know i haven't really thought about that i haven't talked to them again  i have to go there   but you 're really uh what do you call this eager to teach na this june uh i don't know what do you think do you think i 'd make a good teacher of course i mean words enroll   i haven 'cause i haven't taught before you know even the presentation last saturday i haven't really done that before so i was really nervous now you can say that you 've already done it there 's a first time for everything yeah but that still doesn't uhm make a qualification for me to become a teacher i guess uh what do you call this with the way you or okay let me put it this way uhm do you think i have the potential to teach uh-huh of course because i am when i was in college i didn't really think that i was going to be a teacher someday but i think my father wanted me to to become one because my grandmother was a teacher now i wanna throw back the question right back at you what do you think do you have what it takes to become a good teacher to to become a good teacher i uh i think it 's too early to tell for me 'cause i 'm still in the uh what do you call this i 'm still trying to get a feel  i 'm not there yet you 're not there yet yeah how did it feel 'no the first time last week when you presented i was really nervous and i think uh 'cause lisa told me you know you should smile because you were too serious when you presented your demo i guess so that was caused by my my my my nervousness uh uhm you see i 'm still fumbling now when i talk talk about it ano uhm that 's it i think i get really nervous that 's it  well my experience uhm first semester of teaching i was like this uh very uh strict hitler type of a teacher i shouted at everybody i was uh i was always uh demanding them to do more than they should uh uhm i guess first timers for me ha first timers are stricter so to speak but you know as you go along the way you discover things we have to learn along the way it 's just like when you have your first class in the morning and you still don't know what to do but then eventually as the day progresses nine ten o'clock you can become better and better and better eventually at the one o'clock class perfect the lesson plan is perfect  uh uhm   uh uhm  i guess it 's something like that you just have to develop a stronger  it depends on the students that you 're gonna be having if like the students that i have right now it 's very very easy but if the students are like the students here it 's gonna be a little bit more difficult  uh uhm  yeah of course their expectations are difficult uh uh different from rather from uh uh those higher yeah definitely   in our classmates are very very   i remember remember when they criticized the the one the uhm who demoed word "demo" was used as a verb uh who had a demo with us   manny especially manny yeah manny i guess they just didn't like him i suppose i don't know i think that 's unfair
