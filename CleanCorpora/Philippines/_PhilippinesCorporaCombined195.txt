here in manila the games that started on november twenty-four is finally coming to a close and of course for the philippines from the worst of times to the best of times we have seen our athletes do us proud and we have seen that as a country united and one we can see that we can overcome all odds in order to host these southeast asian games a pleasant day this is freddie abando together with sandra dayco sandra the feeling here at the rizal memorial stadium is one of celebration there is joy there is jubilation and perhaps a game like this one is something that will never be matched in the history of the southeast asian games because this is one of the most fiercely fought the philippines coming close to striking the greatest upset in the history of the games yes good afternoon freddie and good afternoon philippines you were right freddie that if i should say so say so it 's outright elation for for most of the participants and especially for the filipino people the staging of the biggest ever biennial sportsfest here in manila is really quite successful that 's uh that 's an understatement in fact freddie well of course the crowd has been a very big factor in all the fronts in all the venues there was no doubt that filipino nationalism is on the rise philippine flags waving all over cheering our athletes giving their best and if there 's one clear line to sum up the performance of the filipino athletes in all the events it 's guts and glory and there 's no doubt that they have proven themselves to be the rising stars of sports in the asean region yes particularly impressive of course was the large turn-out like you 've pointed out in all the venues for most events even though the more exotic ones the demonstration events a beautiful turn-out from the filipino people they all just went out and supported their countrymen in the in their bid for the gold first of all the most important thing that you 'll remember in these southeast asian games is you know that the world is one big community and through the magic of satellites television not only here in the philippines nationwide but the whole of asean is watching us because they know this is an endeavor of countries nine countries who have come here for nine days for one thing sports excellence and friendship and we have really done it we have forged a closer unity among our asean brothers and there is no doubt that uh when our asean brothers will go back to their countries there will be so many stories to talk about what they have seen what they have experienced in manila and there is no doubt that we as filipinos have come of age and we have seen that as a people this country can move forward i think freddie the games in itself our hosting of the sixteenth edition of the southeast asian games is a demonstration of our resiliency our ability to rise up above all the difficulties we 've gone through the flashfloods in ormoc uh leyte and uh the the the earthquakes and all the nat natural calamities and al even the man-made disasters  definitely we have proven that we are one nation we are able to rise up and we are able to host something of this magnitude something that would foster greater brotherhood and sportsmanship among the peoples in the region you know in nineteen eighty-one they called that a renaissance of sports there has been a slide after nineteen eighty-seven when we performed with the performance of nine fifty-nine gold medals in the jakarta games when we only had twenty-six gold medals in the sea games in kuala lumpur but definitely ninety-one gold medals that will be difficult to match in the history of the games at this stage we would like to turn you over at the uh main stadium because her excellency president corazon aquino will be here is now here to declare the closing of the games  and there 's no doubt that her excellency there where the trade secretary the chairman of the organizing committee of the manila southeast asian games has been instrumental in pushing through these particular southeast asian games despite the string of calamities we 've had which started in july sixteen nineteen ninety and ended with the ormoc tragedy where more than seven thousand of our people died in that uh typhoon and of course this as eric buhain sums it up i wanted to give our people something to smile about my triumph is their triumph  and there 's no doubt that the president for being here this afternoon is here to celebrate a new joy a new dawn in the life of this country of course freddie maybe as a symbol of her elation over the tremendous performance of filipino athletes you can see the president is wearing the logo of the sea games on her beautiful yellow dress the traditional yellow dress which symbolized cory power is here and that power which started in eighty-six now very much alive here at the rizal stadium as we now have the national anthem of our country playing of the national anthem  there you have it the national anthem clapping   the crowd here it 's a very electrifying mood the country is in a state of euphoria sandra well definitely coming of course after that string of victories uh the past eleven days of the sea games we definitely feel very good very proud of ourselves freddie and uh like like uh what eric buhain a while ago said this i think should all the more inspire the country to to to move forward that if we 've set our minds to it we will be able to achieve anything we want to there 's no doubt about it the filipino spirit has triumphed the triumph of our athletes is the triumph of our nation there you can see the people near you people who have milled around here in the stadium some of them already starting to come from the south end of the stadium because uh it is only now that they are coming in and more are still out waiting for the start of the parade a beautiful cultural presentation later on here at the rizal memorial stadium noise  you know going back to those twelve days sandra when we started the opening ceremonies obviously the question is will we perform very well as a country for the hosting be successful and after twelve days we can definitely say that we did this country proud and the whole region proud because we did and the philippine filipino ability and style in hosting these games i think we performed even more than our expectations actually  originally uh the sports officials were uh thinking of getting about sixty golds for the philippines well we certainly surpassed that right now freddie we are seeing the mascot of the sixteenth edition of the southeast asian games kiko labuyo a warmer friendlier representation of the wild rooster native to our country no doubt there kiko labuyo must be celebrating himself now because it feels very good but of course there 's a feeling of nostalgia also in every participant of these southeast asian games and all those who have come here to watch these closing ceremonies you know closing ceremonies can always be very heartbreaking because after twelve days of fiercely-fought competitions in all the venues you win new friends you lose uh some medals and yet the whole spirit uh which comes in you is why it 's not only winning but i guess winning medals but winning friends which is essential in these games well as a as symbol of of winning you have the victory girls parading down the track oval uh carrying the sea games flag the sea games flag uh taking its panel of blue for the final march here at the rizal memorial stadium thousands upon thousands of people here inside and those who 're watching millions more on television and those listening over radio and there 's no doubt that for those volunteers who have been a part of these southeast asian games from the manila organizing committee i think more than two thousand of them they must be very proud that despite uh maybe the lack of resources before they have given their very best in serving the athletes and delegates and all the tourists who have come over to manila for the southeast asian games you know freddie the very best minds have participated have volunteered their services for the sea games and the more beautiful you know filipinas are certainly here they represented the country as victory girls in this edition of the sea games and uh these people are volunteers actually and they have volunteered to award the medals to all the deserving athletes who have conquered their respective contests well we now have the parade of the flags of the different competing nations in the southeast asian games nine countries from the whole of asean competing and battling for three hundred thirty gold medals in the southeast asian games and of course for the terrific performance by indonesia and the philippines you know during the first two days the philippines did very well nine gold medals first day second day nine gold medals  uh uh  we led for two days from there on it was indonesia but in the last three days we gave indonesia its biggest scare in the history of the games sixteen gold medals on saturday and sixteen last sunday a total of thirty-two gold medals and indonesia was thinking what does the philippines have and there 's the possibility that the philippines will win the overall crown well freddie uh i 'd like to point out at this point as opposed to the opening ceremonies which was also pomp and pageantry and words atmosphere today 's closing ceremonies of the sea games is going to be very meaningful now we see the athletes this time breaking the barriers of their uh nationalities and marching according to sport or event which they have participated in hand-in-hand they are they 're marching down the stadium it 's amazing that after uh ten days of bitter competition in the playing field just going for that gold medal the pride and prestige of knowing that you can win it for your country there you are now locked in arms together as friends and you have to forget the bitter rivalry on the playing field and knowing that you can move together and share the dream and opportunity experience of knowing that after everything has been said and done you are after all friends and the medal is just only one aspect of these games yes that 's right freddie apart from uh winning and and conquering one 's self and then making one 's country really proud the sea games in itself is is after all for fostering brotherhood among uh the peoples of the the nine countries represented here in the southeast asian games and for the benefit of our viewers who do not know a lot of socials were uh scheduled and and and the athletes themselves participated in a lot of these events uhm they were able to witness a lot of cultural presentations and they shared a lot of time together if one is to chronicle these games there were so many stories that need to be told retold written in for future generations to talk about but of course before we go to those stories of each personal athlete let 's go to the medal tally after today 's competition in the marathon indonesia winning the overall crown ninety-two gold medals eighty-seven silvers sixty-nine bronzes the philippines a proud second ninety-one golds sixty-one eighty uh eighty-five sixty-one silver medals and eighty-five bronze medals   eighty-five bronze medals  yes the slimmest margin ever in the history of the sea games by the way freddie that ninety-two ninety-one finish between the philippines and indonesia our congratulations of course to the indonesian contingent they really put up a good fight and so did we third in line of course is thailand they got seventy-two gold medals they took home eighty silvers and seventy-one bronze medals for a total of two hundred twenty-three down the line we have malaysia tremendous performance to win thirty-six gold medals thirty-eight silver and bronze sixty-five then singapore is at fifth eighteen
