""
 words  are faces of the same thing 
""
this this particular theory is called  cultural materialism  in england 
""
it is called  new historicism  in the united states
""
there are some minor differences between the two theories but they are not significant enough to concern us here in this class 
""
so when when we say  cultural materialism  and  new historicism  we mean the same thing  alright
""
the term  cultural materialism  was of course coined by raymond williams 
""
now  cultural materialism   is a term that is that is more or less self-explanatory
""
marxism as you know is dialectical materialism
""
everything is materialistic and everything is material and the method to analyze everything is dialectic alright
""
cultural materialism applies marxism to culture
""
see one of the problems with all the models of marxism that we have studied so far is that the place of culture is not very clear 
""
it 's not certain in conventional forms of marxism whether culture should stay in the base or whether it should stay in the superstructure 
""
uh it 's supposed to be an ideology culture is supposed to be an ideology but whether it is material or not is not clear
""
so  cultural materialism  starts from from the marxist analysis of culture
""
in a sense cultural materialism can be called a post-marxism
""
in fact it is sometimes called a post-marxism
""
it is it is a continuation of marxism in the sense that the techniques and the insights of cultural materialism could not have been achieved without marxism
""
but on the other hand it is a reaction to marxism because cultural materialists realize that marxism is extremely limited in its  grasp of culture
""
so basically cultural materialism believes that all culture is material
""
immediately therefore we are in the area of bakhtin and company 
""
remember that it was bakhtin and company who said that uh base and superstructure cannot be distinguished from each other as much as we would like to distinguish them because they are both material and the material is language
""
now cultural materialism does not believe that the material is language
""
so unlike bakhtin and company the cultural materialists  uh believe in something else
""
actually they believe that the material is economic
""
it 's still marxist
""
uh the base is still economic but uh literature or culture in general is part of the base  in the sense of bakhtin in the sense that base and superstructure form a continuum
""
alright so cultural materialism then means that culture is regarded as a material object which therefore behaves in the same way that other material objects in society behave 
""
now uh new historicism  is is defined as uh old historicism influenced by newer things in particular post-structuralism uh neo-marxism and feminism
""
yes
""
""
sir according to eric david a culture is either material or immaterial
""
an immaterial culture is for example a belief a traditional belief
""
""
for cultural materialism everything in culture is material including beliefs and ideas and attitudes values etcetera
""
everything is material
""
""
it becomes material when it is expressed in language
""
""
that 's bakhtin
""
""
  that 's bakhtin 
""
""
 but in cultural materialism   you remove the language part
""
""
so how can they prove it as something material 
""
so how can they say that it is material if it 's  the manifestation itself is not really palpable 
""
""
it 's not palpable but it 's material
""
for example if i write a poem  and and i well first when i have to write it i use a pen which is material
""
i use a paper which is material
""
i send it to a magazine which is material
""
the magazine sends me uh  uh talent fee which is material and in other words i get paid as a worker for my poem which becomes a product
""
so in effect i am part of the economic base
""
my poem which i thought was intangible and impalpable and as you call it turns out to be something exactly the same as uh as a toothpaste tube  right
""
except that it doesn't occupy space as in in my mind
""
but it occupies space in the magazine as well as on the piece of paper
""
that 's what uh taking the whole culture as material 
""
okay uh  uh now the key insight of raymond williams as far as cultural materialism is concerned is the insight that you find  on page one two three
""
at the bottom 
""
three last line
""
 residual dominant and emergent cultures  
""
they 're really kinds of culture or aspects of culture residual dominant and emergent
""
now this is the key insight from which cultural materialism and new historicism come 
""
raymond uh raymond williams realized  that if you look at a culture there are really three kinds of cultures in every in everything you study
""
in every culture there are three things or aspects or types or shapes or forms that you can distinguish
""
first there is that aspect of culture that you see all over the place
""
that 's the dominant culture
""
actually we should talk of three cultures
""
the dominant culture is the culture that exists among the most number of people  kind of the majority culture
""
that 's the dominant culture
""
now the dominant culture of the past which still remains today is the residual culture 
""
so as time passes the dominant culture becomes residual
""
the culture of tomorrow which is already here but is not yet dominant but will be dominant in the future is the emergent culture
""
so it 's kind of like past present and future except that they exist in the same society in the same culture
""
so looked at synchronically a society has three cultures
""
looked at diachronically you can see the progress from of a culture from uh emergent to dominant to residual 
""
so let 's give some examples to make it clear
""
let us take technology because that 's the simplest
""
alright today the dominant culture in television technology is colored t v
""
if you go to any of our houses the chances are we will find a color television set in our houses
""
that 's dominant 
""
about ten or twenty years ago uh there were very very few colored television sets
""
most television sets if they had any were black and white
""
today you still find some black and white sets 
""
so black and white television sets are residual
""
color television sets are dominant 
""
what are emergent television sets
""
well we don't have very many of them in this country   students answer in chorus but unclear 
""
uh but that 's still television
""
that 's still the same thing
""
it 's just uh portable
""
there are portable black and white sets 
""
stereophonic 
""
for example in japan if you go to japan and you want to watch a show in english you turn to the you turn on the t v set you switch on only the right speaker and you hear it in english
""
you switch on the left speaker you hear it in japanese 
""
there was an attempt uh some years ago to introduce stereophonic uh television broadcasting in this country
""
so remember they you were supposed to attach your television set to your stereo and then it would come out stereophonic
""
well that kind of fizzled out because it was too expensive
""
but soon enough eventually all our television broadcasts will be stereophonic
""
so eventually it will be english on one channel on one speaker  filipino in another speaker or uh or stereophonic
""
i mean uh stereophonic sound 
""
that 's clearly emergent because the technology exists 
""
it exists with some people but uh  it 's not yet there for most of us 
""
okay
""
so that 's what it means
""
what emergent means is that it exists
""
it 's not only an idea
""
it exists but it is so uh minimal that it doesn't really affect most of the people 
""
but we can see that eventually everybody will have that whatever it is
""
so eventually every television set will be stereophonic
""
just as every television set now is colored alright
""
a t ms in banking is dominant now
""
a lot of people now go to little machines where they put in their card and get money
""
but there are still a lot of people who go to a counter and talk to the bank teller and get money from a real live person
""
that 's residual
""
if this were not dominant banks would not invest so much money obviously
""
they think that there 's enough people who are using cards to justify all this expense 'cause you can see a t ms all over the place
""
eventually  there will be no more actual bank teller because this would be the residual culture right
""
what 's the emergent culture  in banking
""
china banking has it now
""
this is not an ad
""
they now use a telephone 
""
you don't have to go to a bank to use this machine i don't know
""
with china bank it 's their advertisement uh i don't have an account with them so i don't know if it works
""
but their advertisement said that you can use your telephone to do bank transactions 
""
that 's clearly emergent
""
nobody has to go anywhere anymore
""
a t m you still have to go out of the house and do this stuff
""
yeah
""
""
sir so we will not be using paper money anymore
""
""
yeah of course   of course 
""
""
 credit line  
""
""
but that 's another that 's another aspect altogether credit cards cash
""
uh in the philippines dominant is cash
""
in the united states it 's not cash
""
that 's residual
""
if you go to a department store and you pay cash they kind of look with this funny look in their faces and say you 're paying cash
""
this is really strange you know
""
you usually pay by check or credit cards 
""
but emergent is  a student answers but unclear 
""
kind of like kind of like credit cards  a student answers but unclear 
""
so what does that mean  a student answers but unclear 
""
uh but that 's still cash
""
that 's still cash
""
in the future you won't have anything except your one card  uh which is your social security number which you use for all your transactions
""
that will be your banking card your driver 's license  etcetera 
""
and there won't be all these so many cards that you hold in your wallet
""
that will be the future
""
in fact they have that already
""
sometimes they use the same card to do all kinds of things like they do now
""
okay you get the general idea
""
alright electric typewriters 
""
ian  if electric typewriters on  secretaries'  desks is the dominant culture what is the residual obviously  students answer in chorus 
""
""
the manual typewriter
""
""
obviously the manual typewriter
""
what is the emergent uh nestor
""
""
the emergent sir
""
uhm computer
""
""
word processor the computer alright
""
that 's easy enough right
""
no problem with that
""
how about uh warfare
""
culture of warfare warfare uh in the last in the gulf they were using basically tanks right
""
that 's the dominant culture
""
just tanks 
""
so beverly what 's the residual culture
""
""
sir guns
""
""
guns uzis and stuff
""
all that thing
""
and the emergent culture charina
""
""
sir scud missiles nuclear
""
""
yeah missiles
""
see how easy it is
""
this was a very simple insight
""
it took a genius like williams to figure it out but it is such a simple insight 
""
what is of course deep about it is that  history is linear
""
it keeps going so that eventually tanks will be residual
""
i mean nobody will use tanks anymore
""
uh everybody will be using missiles
""
at that time some emergent thing will happen which will make missiles uh kind of look old-fashioned
""
will we know what that is
""
no we won't know what that is
""
see the emergent culture emerges only when something is dominant
""
you can't predict the future that way
""
these things exist
""
they are not ideas 
""
it means that anything we have now is bound to disappear after you know so many years
""
of course in the past past in this century  uh things have occurred in a at a very fast pace
""
i mean the changes are so fast that we can actually see something that is just emergent becoming dominant
""
a good example is the typewriter
""
i mean all of us oh well maybe not you but i can remember the days when everything was manual 
""
but now everything is electric
""
at that time the electric typewriter was really an emergent form and i remember that you remember the days when there were no computers
""
that 's only about ten years ago
""
the the word word processing started only in the eighties
""
so ten years ago
""
nineteen-eighty there were no such things as word processors
""
so clearly we all remember the days when uh that was not emergent 
""
what that means what this particular model means is that when the word processors become the dominant uh tool that is used by secretaries there will be something else  that will be used that will be developed
""
alright
""
how about uh betamax sets
""
the v t r machine malou
""
malou is not here
""
no uh uh yeah christine
