hi pam
""
so you 've been here for eleven to or twelve weeks already in la salle
""
how do you find college life as a freshman
""
""
i 'm enjoying my life here in la salle i mean it 's though it 's very different from the life i had in bacolod but i 'm having fun  e 
""
i get along well with my blockmates
""
i mean you know i mean this college thing isn't that bad at all i mean you know i get to learn a lot of things
""
how about you you 're third year
""
i mean you must have you must have encountered a lot of things already
""
""
oh yes believe me i have encountered a lot of things
""
first of all in my lifestyle
""
it has really changed
""
like in bacolod uhm we 're used to having helpers around we have drivers like if you wanna go to this place you can just say i wanna go to this place and then snap you 're there like and here in manila it 's like you have to commute and with the traffic and everything it takes an hour to get to just one place
""
i mean that 's the least an hour it 's like the least
""
and then uhm in bacolod you don't cook you don't do your laundry while here in manila you 're forced to do all those things just to survive and you have to budget your money also
""
like in bacolod you can ask your mom for money if you need to go shopping and everything and here it 's like you 're on a tight budget and it 's really hard with everything
""
""
i you know what i find amazing in college is that because since we came from an  ex  from an exclusive school in bacolod i mean i find it 'cause it 's coed so i mean you know the first day that i entered school or i attended classes it 's like oh so this is this is the coed school that my other friends have been experiencing ever since
""
and it it 's cool though because you know guys are just all around you but sometimes you will just okay i mean it it 's an  ins  because it 's really different when you have somebody to look forward to when you enter the classroom
""
i mean you know you can get so lazy sometimes and i mean like and like when you have a crush on your classroom i mean woohh okay
""
so i might as well just  en  attend class because i wanna feel that day so i don't know
""
""
that part i have to agree with you because i used to be in this class where i was sandwiched by these two cute guys so i was like really motivated to come to class every m w f because it was like i was really so motivated with you know i mean you 're sitting  wi  with these two guys and then you 're having you 're getting their attention because they need a groupmate and everything
""
so you 're the first one who they come to if they don't have if they don't know what lesson is or something
""
and it 's really fun to have to be in a coed school because we 're used to having an all-girl school in saint scho right
""
so it 's like uhm they 're all girls and then it 's like you face the same people every day and then here in la salle you have the trisem
""
uhm you have the trisem schedule what do you call that
""
so it 's like every term you have different classmates you meet a lot of people and then you make a lot of friends
""
""
and you know what i mean i don't know but even in a short span of time that you know i 've been i 've been in la salle i mean what eleven weeks
""
there was not yet enough to to say about things and to conclude or whatever
""
i mean i i already i already learned a lot i mean i probably uh now i learned that i mean in college you really meet different people with different with different personalities characters
""
i mean i mean uh back i mean there i can i would see some group of friends like they would dress in this and these clothes that you know i 'm not even i was i 'm not even aware of them
""
but i don't know i guess it uh it 's just it 's just it 's just fun i don't know i don't know the word but it 's just cool to to see a lot of people
""
but i guess the hard the hardest part for me right now is that i don't know where exactly i fit in 'cause since i 'm new here in manila i don't know where or with whom exactly i could jive and i could get along with
""
i mean i 'm close with my blockmates but still i mean eleven weeks it 's not enough time to really say that you know uh i belong here  stutter 
""
but i guess that 's the that 's the nice thing i mean that 's the interesting part of it
""
it 's a matter of knowing or  adve  it 's kinda an adventure or or i don't know you get to seek for something  mys  a mystery or i don't know i mean
""
""
yeah i think the studies the studying part is not really the hardest part i think it 's also the  adjust  adjustment thing
""
i mean you have to be able to fit in with different types of personalities here since you 're new you don't know the the people here and then unlike in bacolod wherein everybody knows everybody because the city is too small
""
and then here it 's like you have to you have to really adjust and you have to adopt your personality with their personality
""
and finding friends is really a difficult thing here but there are a lot of people who are also experiencing that kind of thing so you it 's like it helps to know that you 're not alone and then in the end you always find someone to jive with
""
""
i guess that 's what i like best about being here in manila 'cause nobody knows me and nobody nobody knows the real me so i can just do whatever i want i mean i  ca  i can dress what in  wha   wha  i mean i can dress whatever i mean in that in whatever way i want to dress i mean
""
and i guess uhm one thing that probably upsets me is that i remember back in in my l pep the orient thing i mean one of the one of the l officers of the student council told us that you don't have to in la salle there 's no such thing as  tambayan  and you can just sit in a if you wanna sit in that certain bench you can you can sit there but  mo  and then i believed that woohh woohh fair everybody 's equal equality is practiced
""
but then as days pass by i mean weeks after i i realized that you know okay so i can't sit there 'cause the athletes are supposed to be there and what is it
""
that that 's college i mean sometimes you just have to say that that that 's the way that 's the  wa  that 's the way things happen here
""
i mean if say i 'm not saying it that treatment of people or there 's inequality or you know but i guess that the i don't know fun it 's so i don't know jane i mean
""
""
yeah i agree with you i mean with the new image thing people don't know you so you can work here uhm sensitive angle here or your fun angle here or whatever angle you want so you can dress the way you want that 's really that 's really an advantage here considering that we don't have uniforms
""
thank god for that rule
""
and also with with what you said about the  tambayan  thing that 's really true because no matter what they say about having equality here in la salle it 's there 's always a sense of hierarchy
""
like there 's always a structure like this part is for the athletes this is for the upperclassmen and then you can't of course you just can't mingle with them just like that
""
i mean but after uh sometime you tend to these people tend to to graduate i mean they graduate they leave la salle and then you take over their position and then people like you in in the first year also experience the same thing as you do
""
so i think that 's just a part of life and that 's just a part of college life that everybody goes through because everybody is struggling to be up there
""
everybody is struggling to fit in right
""
""
yeah and i just i just wanna ask
""
are you having a hard time waking up
""
i mean i have a seven o'clock class and it 's really a complete burden for me to wake up at  se  i mean what six
""
'cause i still have to plan on what clothes to wear
""
i mean okay i there 's an advantage not to not having our uniform but there 's also a disadvantage to that because you know i mean the way they say that no it doesn't matter what on what it doesn't matter whatever you wear it 's good but duh it does i mean
""
""
yeah i have to agree with that
""
no matter what they say uhm fashion is always a big thing for students right
""
i mean you have to you you need to look your best
""
i mean why look worst when you can look your best i mean that 's always a good model
""
i mean what happens if you meet these people and then you 're not in your best appearance that day
""
so it reflects a lot on your personality too
""
and yes i have uhm difficult time i have a difficult time in waking up since i have an eight o'clock class everyday so i have to wake up at seven
""
and that is really that is really a burden for me that is really so hard
""
and then plus i also go through the same thing as you do in choosing clothes
""
i usually change and then i 'm not happy with what i look and then i change again and then i just tuck all my clothes in my cabinet until i can't see the i can't see the organization of my clothes anymore
""
i mean it it 's really it really affects you a lot right
""
""
right
""
so what do you think about the trisem system here in la salle
""
""
well the trisem system here in la salle in one word if you describe it in one word it 's fast
""
i mean if you compare it with  las  la salle system in bacolod they have two terms a year and if we have our our midterm exams they 're having their preliminary exams
""
and while we 're having our finals they 're just having their midterm exams so you can imagine how how fast our pacing is
""
i mean you 're expected to absorb a handful of information in that short of time and that 's really difficult
""
i mean i don't know how students can cope with that i mean i don't know how i coped with that
""
i mean for staying on la salle for almost three years here i don't know how i survived that kind of pacing when i 'm used to uhm i i need a lot of time to prepare myself for a quiz and everything
""
and then here in la salle it 's like oh you have a long exam tomorrow so you have to study and it 's like everything is really time pressured here
""
it 's like you can really see the importance of your of time managing of time management here
""
what about you
""
""
well i too am having a hard time especially that i 'm still in my first year and you know period of adjustment  etcet  etcetera etcetera
""
i mean this is really it 's really hard for me sometimes to  someti  i used to have a hard time
""
uhm when i wake up in the morning i don't know i mean i would say oh my gosh i have to i have to i have to go to school i have to attend class because you know i mean i i will end the the term sooner
""
i mean in a few in a few weeks i mean the first term i will have my finals already and i can't i can't afford to miss a single lesson 'cause everything as you say i mean here in la salle it 's really fast
""
and and i know it 's a privilege to be here and i just can't you know i i don't wanna be the block i don't wanna i don't wanna waste this opportunity to have a good education
""
and that 's why i 'm really trying my uh trying hard to to cope with this certain trisem system
""
and i think that you know if i pass the exam i might as well i mean i i i can i can cope with this i can i can surpass or i can survive this you know
""
""
yes i mean being able to survive your first eleven or twelve weeks here is a big stuff already
""
i mean i know of some people who who just stay here for a week and then they go home to bacolod i mean they 're wasting their money and then they 're not even trying that hard
""
but i admire you for being so optimistic and and optimistic and very goal goal-oriented for that
