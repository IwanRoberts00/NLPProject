okay
""
so may i just ask from from you in a one-fourth sheet of paper your comments about what just transpired  words  because it will help the department head who was here a while ago
""
if you know her department head of management to uh  determine whether it will consider taking in  words 
""
you can comment or discuss the topic  entrepreneurship  even though we are not really an entrepreneurial group or belonging to a class taking up entrepreneurship it would be better really to find out what entrepreneurship is all about  'no  'cause many a time students take up courses to really train themselves to become employees and as we mentioned last time employment is very much different from self-employment okay
""
so if you were to define  entrepreneurship  you will say something like uh it is the ability  'no  of a person to perceive the products or services needed and or wanted by a segment of society and to deliver these needed products and services the right kind of products and services if we may just uh emphasize it  'no  to the right kind of buyers because it 's possible that you may be catering to the wrong customer at the right time and place and of course at the right price and terms of payment
""
you will notice there are a lot of adjectives uh nouns preceded by the word  right   'no 
""
the right products or services the right customers the right time and place the right price and terms of payment  and the ability to be able to perceive and effect such a transaction is something that an entrepreneur should be able to have okay
""
actually society or a nation develops only to the extent that we have a lot of these entrepreneurs around
""
so if you can say that society 's development is really a function of the presence of entrepreneurs
""
if we have more of these people okay the right kind of course 'cause there are entrepreneurs who are unscrupulous okay
""
they follow certain bad practices in business
""
so we are referring more on the right kind the right kind of entrepreneurs  'no 
""
if we have more of them then it is safe to assume that development of a certain nation or society will really be seen okay
""
so how fast a nation develops is also dependent on the number and kind of entrepreneurs that we have
""
okay suppose we have a lot of entrepreneurs in a given country like the philippines
""
suppose we can say we are an entrepreneurial society what will be some benefits of having this kind of a set-up where more and more of the individuals are turning to become self-employed individuals rather than being employees
""
what will be the benefits
""
now there are about five of them some of which you already know some of which are rather obvious but maybe some of which you still are not aware of
""
one is that entrepreneurial society will experience a generation of opportunities for employment  'no 
""
we will have more and more opportunities for employment okay because the entrepreneur is the one who creates jobs okay not the employee
""
so if we have more people getting to be employed what normally will be the consequence
""
for one thing we will have uh an increase in productivity okay because if people have more money to spend then they will be in a position to buy products and services okay and if products and services are being patronized being bought by more and more people then firms plants okay factories will be encouraged to become more productive okay
""
so it 's uh it 's a chain effect  'no 
""
so productivity is essentially a function of the presence of employment among the people
""
second benefit here is that entrepreneurship improves the quality of life of the people
""
now why do we say quality of life or the living standards of people
""
well for one thing entrepreneurs are supposed to be noted for innovation or for that innovative spirit  'no  now they keep on looking for new and better ways of improving our way of living
""
example may be in the realm of the home okay
""
 yung mga nagluluto diyan naglalaba diyan 
""
 sa  cooking before  hindi kilala yung mga  microwave and all that  'no  but now it 's already an in thing okay
""
before we didn't know about this washing machine and so forth but now it 's very much an in thing among families even even maybe those belonging to the c level okay
""
even in agriculture our farmers before didn't know about certain implements or ways of plowing the field without so much you know hard hard uh hard work and effort and so forth but now they are aware of certain machinery okay
""
even in telecommunications  dati wala yung  fax
""
but now  'yong  fax is maybe an ordinary thing to many of us okay
""
even in computers
""
 dati walang  computers  pero ngayon  we are developing more and more of this in different sizes shapes and so forth
""
so the quality of life is definitely being improved  'no 
""
even among uh mothers  'no  they care for babies
""
before  hindi kilala yung mga  different types of uh what 's this plastic panties and so forth
""
but now  ang dali-dali nang bumili no'n  therefore overnight you don't have to bother yourselves waking up and you know changing the baby 's clothes and so forth whenever they wet the bed and so forth
""
but right now you can you know have a good night 's sleep without being bothered by this  kasi merong  plastic panty and also the bottle feeding bottle  meron na ngayon nilalagay doon sa  bottle  na  plastic  'no 
""
you don't have to be sterilizing the bottle now okay
""
i know that because we still use that at home okay
""
now the third one
""
a third benefit here is that entrepreneurship contributes to more equitable distribution of income
""
what do we mean by  equitable 
""
because as you probably know in our society it is something like a pyramid where the tip essentially about ten to thirty percent consisting of upper a or the a class  'no  while the rest about seventy to eighty percent consisting of the masses okay
""
 kaya sinasabing  equitable distribution of income
""
at the moment maybe wealth is concentrated right there the tip  'no 
""
about ten to thirty percent at the maximum while the rest are probably living below the poverty line okay
""
if we have an entrepreneurial society and more and more people having jobs more and more people having sources of income then wealth of a nation can be distributed more proportionately more equally okay because uh if there is inequity in society we normally would expect something like dissension coming from the masses the people who are supposed to be deprived of certain wealth
""
now what could be some examples of wealth aside from money of course
""
we have a most important wealth  'no  land
""
that is why in our government the centerpiece of the aquino government is actually reflected in that law which is the carp comprehensive agricultural reform program or law carl okay
""
that is why the present government also has this bill actually already enacted into law so that there could be equal distribution of wealth  ano'ng ibig sabihin noon 
""
if we have this implemented the  kalakalan  twenty which is a countryside development program where industries are dispersed in the rural areas  'no  so that more and more of development can take place in the rural areas then the people who are residing in such rural areas will be somehow encouraged to stay there and not migrate to the urban centers like manila
""
and as you know when they migrate to the metropolis what normally happens we have congestion we have traffic we have squatters and normally we have a rise in crime wave okay
""
so entrepreneurship somehow contributes to an equitable distribution of wealth and because that happens poverty somehow is reduced
""
we cannot really eliminate this  'no 
""
if you say you want to eliminate poverty that may be a tall order that may be utopian  'no  it 's something ideal what we would like to have is a reduction in the incidence of poverty
""
okay the fourth one is the utilization and mobilization of resources for great national productivity
""
now what are resources
""
resources would involve many things  'no  like our natural resources
""
that is why we would like to encourage more and more of our entrepreneurs  'no  not only to be extracting the products from mother nature and exporting them right away  'no  all with the end in view of generating dollars
""
that is something good but sometimes we go to the extent of going beyond what is necessary and in fact what is what is more important as we mentioned last time  'no  is to generate some kind of value added to our uh extractive industries
""
what do we mean by that
""
so the logs that we get hopefully we can add some value by using these raw materials and coming out with products like furniture tables and chairs and so forth that our own people will be producing
""
and if we do that then there is the value added component okay
""
so instead of just exporting the logs in their raw form we can use the raw materials and come out with a more concrete product okay
""
so we not only generate employment but it is possible that we can also save on dollars the very thing that we would like to get when we export products
""
why do we save on dollars
""
because maybe some of the furniture and fixtures will  words 
""
so the fifth benefit  'no  is entrepreneurship brings social benefits
""
these social benefits are made possible by our government
""
now what are these social benefits
""
they come in the form of infrastructure okay roads buildings dams and so forth
""
as well as certain basic social services like the collection of our garbage okay drainage system the maintenance of peace and order the presence of our law enforcers
""
and all that will be made possible if we have more and more businesses being set up and from which taxes will be paid to the government okay
""
so the government can only produce such uh  activities which are supposed to be of social benefits to us  'no  if they have revenues and these revenues come in the form of taxes coming from the businessmen the entrepreneurs okay
""
so these are the five particular benefits that we can derive if we have an entrepreneurial society
""
now what 's the next here
""
so we already know what 's an entrepreneur but are there certain types of entrepreneurs
""
basically it 's just two
""
the really pure one and for lack of any term or phrase the not-so-pure-one okay
""
what do we mean by the  pure entrepreneur 
""
the pure entrepreneur is someone who is able to create the idea create the business  set up the business whether it 's a sole proprietorship or maybe a partnership or later on a corporation and then nurse the business to a certain degree of health okay
""
that 's the pure entrepreneur
""
so someone like leonardo sarao with his jeepney like socorro ramos with her national bookstore with narda capuyan with their  ikat  okay
""
and many more even like mr henry ford with his model t mr rockefeller with uh his oil refinery business okay
""
however there are urban entrepreneurs whom we cannot really consider as pure in the sense that they did not start the whole thing from the very start
""
they probably just inherited the business
""
so let 's say your grandfather dies leaves you a million or a billion pesos or maybe leaves you a business to manage that may be the second type or maybe you just bought a business the so called franchising
""
so  yung mga  jollibee mcdonald wendy 's and so forth they are also in franchising so you put up a store bearing the same name
""
you run the business the way the mother company runs it that is franchising okay
""
 hindi ikaw ang nagsimula nun pero dahil hindi  at least you didn't start it
""
you got it from someone else
""
in fact you just pay royalty to the mother unit to the mother company okay
""
so these are types of entrepreneurs
""
now why do you think individuals become entrepreneurs
""
some of them start out as employees okay
""
so he works for a certain company for five ten fifteen twenty years like probably many of you will and then later on decides that he will have a shift in his career from employee to self-employed
""
why do they become like that
""
there are essentially certain reasons for going into entrepreneurship and i 'll cite to you about four
""
one is  after let 's say devoting ten to twenty years of your productive life let 's say you graduate twenty by the time you reach forty or about middle mid-life  'no  sometimes you experience some boredom monotony or in psychology something what you called  burn-out 
""
what do you mean by  burn-out 
""
 kumbaga sa kandila nauupos ka na 
""
you 've almost given-up everything in terms of your productive years and now  parang wala na wala ka nang ibubuga  okay so burn-out
""
another is you have reached your peak  'no  and therefore you are experiencing plateauing you know what 's a plateau  'no  plateau  parang lumakad ganon na  it 's all throughout like that
""
so there is no marked increase or significant change for the better as far as you 're concerned and there 's a tendency that you will decline just like any product just like any company
""
after maturity you may have the tendency to decline to be phased out okay
""
