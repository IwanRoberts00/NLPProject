most fitting diwang pilipino isaisip isapuso isagawa  for truly this is the time when we filipinos in thought in heart and in action must relive the national spirit that made us free  let us all take encouragement as we embark on this year-long undertaking our nation is secure our nation is stable and our nation is competitive  for five long years we have given our best to the challenges before us

stood out and that is the fact that working together and with democracy as our standard we filipinos can move our nation forward  we will not be where we are today but for the faith and spirit that since june twelve eighteen ninety-eight has fortified us in trials and crises that sometimes seem overwhelming that faith and spirit first found its voice in dr jose rizal who gave his life on these grounds for believing that filipinos could be a nation in their own right that faith or spirit was forged on the anvil of revolution by andres bonifacio whose centennial we mark this year and that faith and spirit proclaimed itself to the world in kawit cavite ninety-nine years ago when president emilio aguinaldo raised the flag of our republic around these great events and personages at the turn of the nineteenth century the story of our people before and since has always turned our independence proclamation in eighteen ninety-eight crowned our people 's unceasing struggle since the time of lapu-lapu and soliman to be free and sovereign in our own land and it claimed for all filipino generations since the challenge of building recovering defending and strengthening the filipino nation in the web of history all our struggles aspirations and achievements as a people come together and they lay claim to our memories as we prepare to mark our first centennial as a republic and approach a new century of challenge let us therefore gather our energies together to ensure the successful commemoration of our first centennial it demands the collective participation of all our people every group every sector every community every creed every family and every citizen who constitute our nation  thank you mr president mr president distinguished ladies and gentlemen of the senate my countrymen mr president uh almost eight years ago i stood before this august chamber armed with all the courage and fervor i could summon and boldly shouted no a thousand no to the extension of the united states military bases in the philippines the crucial issue at that time was whether to terminate the presence of american military basing facilities in the country or not today mr president once again we are confronted with yet another vital issue of similar import and that is whether or not the senate should give its concurrence to the visiting forces agreement and this time mr president i rise in this great and important forum of our people to proclaim before the entire nation yes a thousand yes to the visiting forces agreement between our country and the united states of america mr president i realize the seeming contradiction between my position now and my position then in nineteen ninety-one out of personal conviction i completely aligned myself with those who opposed the extension of american military presence in the country i was totally convinced and committed to vote against it as i finally did and i gave you my assurance mr president that if any attempt should be made to revive the presence of foreign military bases in the country i would be the first to firmly stand again amongst those who would oppose such a venture with the same passion and conviction today however i 've aligned myself with those who are supporting the approval of the visiting forces agreement which will in effect allow again the entry of american troops in the country and like before i am as equally convinced and committed to vote in favor of our concurrence as i do now because of this mr president i deem it my duty to give a candid explanation to our people who gave me the mandate the honor and the privilege to serve them in this chamber i owe it to them most especially and to history as well to re  render a clear and faithful account of why i have taken such seemingly diametrically opposing positions on so important and critical national issues of our time as the total removal of american forces from the philippines on the one hand and our concurrence to the on the visiting forces agreement on the other but let me digress briefly at this juncture mr president and relate to you the general impression i gathered during several hearings and deliberations on the mis measure under consideration although our proceedings were conducted under an atmosphere of guarded civility the discussions were in many instances marred by some degree of asperity and animosity there were if you will still recall angry diatribes and outbursts in and out of the areas where we held our hearings even our recent debates in this hall were not spared in addition the arguments of those who appeared to offer their opposition and pardon me for saying this were boringly and tiresomely repetitious and highly emotional and if i may add garnished with a generous proportion of bias and prejudice what struck me most as significant however mr president was the sectoral composition and arguments of those who appear to oppose the visiting forces agreement they were in many respects identical to the sectoral composition and arguments of those who previously stood against the extension of the united states military bases in fact i got the impression that there was hardly anything new that was added under the sun it was to me no more than a deja vu of nineteen ninety-one the same banners the same streamers the same propaganda tactics the same stereotyped speeches the same anti-american slogans the same anti-imperialism 1 word the same invectives the same clenched fists were all too evident to be seen and heard and so since the similarity of the opposition in both cases was quite obvious mr president i deemed it worthless to further dwell on that and so i will therefore simply confine my narration to the arguments presented by the two sides of the debate in nineteen ninety-one to show how closely alike they were to the arguments now being heard in connection with the visiting forces agreement you will recall mr president that the anti-american bases groups argued then that never again should foreign military bases troops or facilities be allowed in our country that our national sovereignty and self-respect required no less than the total dismantling and removal of all vestiges of our colonial past that the existence in our land of american military bases and their component troops and facilities would unnecessarily involve us in international conflicts that were not of our own making or liking that such military bases troops and facilities were really not meant to promote our national security but were intended instead to advance the defense strategy and economic power of the united states of america and that they would serve more as a potent magnet for offensive military action that would endanger the safety of our country and possibly expose our people to a very grave risk if not actual disaster and ruin and that instead of casting aside the historic opportunity presented to us at that time to be truly independent and self-reliant republic we should seize and use it to attain our complete freedom so that we could shape our own future and chart our own foreign policy unencumbered by any demeaning burden on our dignity and honor as a nation you will also recall mr president on the other hand that the advocates of continued american military presence in the in our country especially in clark and subic insisted that american military bases troops and facilities were good for our country that we really needed them for our defense and security that their presence would enhance the prestige of our country and would moreover preserve and provide jobs for our countrymen that they would assure the rapid development and improvement of our military capability that they would effectively maintain the balance of power in the southeast asian region and that they would serve as a strong and dependable deterrent against any predatory nation that might have any ill-conceived design to harm us you will perhaps recall remember too mr president that in nineteen ninety-one i was the lone fiscalizer in the senate against the administration of then president corazon c aquino and at the same time the minority floor leader of this chamber and because of my unique role then as the only remaining elected opposition senator of the republic and because especially of my intimate knowledge and assessment of our national condition at that time i unconditionally and without any hesitation supported the total removal of all american bases from the country i also fully concurred with the anti-american bases groups then that those military bases established in nineteen forty-seven initially and primarily to serve the united states' interests and to project her military power abroad they were not at all intended for or involved in the security of the philippines in fact the united states according to the common understanding at that time had no obligation whatsoever under the military bases agreement to defend us against any foreign military invader except when her own military bases were themselves the object of attack it was only later on that those military bases were somehow linked to our national security because of the mutual defense treaty concluded in nineteen fifty-one which forged and established our defense alliance with the united states of america and those military bases were conveniently used by the united states in fulfilling her obligation to us under the mutual defense treaty in legal norm therefore those military bases had nothing to do in creating the military alliance between the two countries today mr president in voting as i do now in favor of our concurrence to the visiting forces agreement i am more persuaded and impelled now than i was in nineteen ninety-one by the same consideration of national security for the country perhaps because of my pol because my political role has changed from what it had been in nineteen ninety-one since i 'm now a member of the ruling coalition in this chamber there is reason to think that i will simply follow the dictates of the ruling majority and vote in favor of our concurrence for no other consideration and reason than pure political expediency mr president that i will never do if i were to simply vote in favor of this important measure on the basis of a mere of mere political alignment that to me would be tantamount to a betrayal of my sworn obligation as an elected senator of the republic having been one of the so-called magnificent twelve  that voted in nineteen ninety-one for the removal of american military bases i cannot and will not just disregard or sweep aside the collective best interests of this nation neither will i allow myself mr president to be swayed by the almost irresistible appeal of esteemed friends and professional colleagues nor to be intimidated frightened or pressured by the strident clamor the blandishment and arrogant threats of noisy boisterous groups that stand opposed to the visiting forces agreement no matter how popular their position or how serious their threats may be without carefully scrutinizing the material and relevant national interest involved of course mr president as a human being if i were principally moved by a purely selfish motive if i were only concerned with my own political interest or personal well-being that would have been the most facile  the most logical the most rewarding and the safest course of action for me to have taken but then again had i done that had i acted otherwise than to determine carefully for myself the most sensible and advantageous course of action the country should follow in the wake of her present circumstance it would have been a faithless discharge of my duty as a senator
