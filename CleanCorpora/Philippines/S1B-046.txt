""
""

""

""
""

""
""
okay
""
""
i saw you on television today about something  na pero  anyway sharon how are you adjusting to uh to boston
""
""
you know the  ad  the period of adjustment i 'd like to think is over
""
""
uh-huh
""
""
and it didn't take too long
""
""
okay
""
""
i mean it it was much easier
""
""
uh-huh
""
""
it was a breeze compared to what i had imagined it to
""
""
yeah
""
""
you know what it would probably be like
""
so it was it was now i am absolutely in love with boston
""
it 's a great place to be
""
""
yeah it is it is
""
""
it is it 's beautiful and we uhm   we live uhm 
""
""
  saan kayo nakatira  
""
nakatira ba kayo sa cambridge mismo 
""
""
no but very near very near
""
""
uh-huh
""
""
it 's like a ten to fifteen   minute drive 
""
""
 yeah it 's one   of the suburbs of uh
""
""
one of the suburbs
""
yes but i 'd rather not say
""
""
okay  o sige 
""
""
but i 'll tell you later  laughter 
""
no but it 's wonderful
""
""
okay
""
""
it 's a wonderful area
""
it 's quiet and it 's uh  i can drive there
""
""
okay  uh marunong ka nang mag-  drive
""
""
yes
""
""
 nagda-  drive  ka na roon 
""
""
 opo pero  i wouldn't go to downtown
""
""
yeah  talagang 
""
""
that would be like going to edsa
""
""
yeah they say boston drivers are among the worst in the whole world
""
""
well they haven't been to manila  speaker a laughs 
""
""
okay  pero papaano nagluluto ka na ba sa sa bahay n'yo 
""
""
i 've always cooked
""
i 've been a good cook  magmula ng  seven years old  ako pero ngayon  i know all these chores all these other for instance i realized that you know it had been years or
""
""
uh uhm
""
""
it was probably even the first time in my life that i got to open a can manually  speaker a laughs 
""
because you know it 's not   because you don't want to but 
""
""
  marunong ka nang gumamit ng  can opener  ngayon   
""
""
 marunong na kasi naman  you have everybody doing it for you here
""
i mean all families all filipino families have that
""
""
 kumusta naman si  kiko how is he doing with his studies
""
""
he 's doing very well
""
thank you for asking but uhm of course harvard is a very demanding school and
""
""
yes uh-huh
""
""
and his course is very demanding
""
""
uh-huh
""
""
and uhm they have to squeeze in all this uhm all this uhm education in one year
""
""
yeah
""
""
so his knowledge bank is kind of getting stretched now
""
""
  na   na  nakakasama ka na ba kasi  normally uh  lalo na  when students there are are married  'no  there are a lot of activities with the other students
""
""
oh yeah it 's wonderful
""
""
are you  ano  are you already getting involved in the harvard life
""
""
uhm well yeah
""
they have this program for spouses always
""
""
yeah
""
""
and we try to get together although because i don't live right in cambridge
""
""
yeah
""
""
uhm as the others do i don't get together with them as often as i i would want to
""
besides i 'm busy doing my own   things  back home
""
""
 yeah  
""
i don't know if you 've felt this already  kasi baka  mana  maraming mga filipino doon sa cambridge na kilala ka  but are you enjoying the relative anonymity  na   naranasan mo  
""
""
 you know what i 'll tell you   one of the biggest one of the major reasons  na na-  in love  ako sa  boston is that is it 's is that uh it is so different from california
""
""
uh-huh
""
""
in the west you have more filipinos
""
""
yeah
""
""
in boston boston is not even as uh well new york of course is fast but it it also has a lot of filipinos
""
boston is more quiet 
""
""
uh uhm
""
""
there are less filipinos so for a celebrity like me who who appreciates some   peace  and quiet every once in a while it 's the   perfect place to be 
""
""
 yeah  
""
 is this a welcome change   welcome change  laughter 
""
""
yes absolutely absolutely
""
""
has this change already produced  ano may  baby  na ba 
""
""
we 're trying
""
i 'm actually hoping it 's right now but
""
""
really uh
""
""
yeah i i 'm actually hoping but i we do believe it 's all going to be in god 's perfect time
""
""
uh-huh so but but but it 's it 's really there you have all the time
""
""
oh yeah
""
""
to relax and to
""
""
when he 's not reading two hundred pages a day  laughter  you know when
""
but right now he 's having he 's going through his mid-terms   so 
""
""
 yeah   he 's in the the kennedy school of government
""
""
yeah exactly
""
""
as opposed to the law school
""
""
exactly   no not the law school 
""
""
  hindi siya pumasok sa   
""
""
no not the law school
""
a lot of people think it 's the law school
""
no it 's the kennedy school of government
""
""
uh-huh
""
alright well you know  we we 're talking about el ni&ntilde;o earlier  ano 
""
""
uh uhm
""
""
 at saka ewan ko kung   naranasan mo  'to 
""
""
 oh it 's so bad in   boston now it 's a yeah
""
  it 's affecting us  too
""
""
 i understand   it 's  medyo malamig  in the in the area now
""
""
 masyadong malamig   ngayon  
""
""
 right  
""
""
we 're now in our thirties sometimes we go down to the twenties
""
""
yeah
""
but i tell you from experience
""
""
uh uhm
""
""
uh the boston winter
""
""
is worst than new york i hear
""
""
okay so  handa ka na ba para sa  winter
""
 uuwi ka aalisan mo na naman ang  boston  laughter 
""
""
 oo aalis ako 
""
no no but we 'll spend  siguro  christmas here but there will actually be no work
""
 pero  to us  kasi  it 's still a novelty  e 
""
because it 's going to be our first winter
""
so okay it 's a welcome thing  'no  but i don't think i would be able to put up with it if i had to live there
""
""
uh uhm
""
""
for years and years  'no 
""
i don't think so
""
""
well you 'll be able to skate on the charles river i mean uh
""
""
no my daughter will do that
""
she 's a skater
""
""
that 's why because i heard  na si  k c is actually into skating
""
""
she is and she competes
""
""
and she has won something already
""
""
yes and she even had a competition in marlboro in massachusetts
""
""
uh-huh
""
""
with as part of the philippine team that went
""
""
  and i understand the philippine team uh was skating well 
""
""
 a lot of filipinos placed  
""
yes they were very good
""
i 'm so proud   yes 
""
""
 uh-huh  
""
and so  si k c si  k c is also among the among these uh skaters
""
""
yes she is
""
""
uh-huh okay
""
let me ask you   na   na   na  mae-enganyo ka ba na baka  are you are you somehow thinking that you might want to live there for good
""
""
i can't say it has not crossed my mind
""
""
uh uhm
""
""
no actually it has crossed my mind about a million times  laughter 
""
but my husband is very nationalistic  laughter 
""
""
well
""
""
he 's probably you know he tells me that the reason that he 's there is to try to learn as much as he can to bring   back  to the philippines
""
""
 uh-huh  
""
and also in a couple of years k c herself  baka maging  eligible  na 'yan  for radcliffe
""
""
oh she 's uh she 's kind of really  prep  we  sa  we actually sat down with her it 's funny that you   brought that up 
""
""
 radcliffe    laughter 
""
""
yeah we we really sat down with her and we said because i think it 's rubbing off on her this harvard thing because she sees how important education is to her to her   dad  and to me
""
""
 yeah  
""
""
and uhm she sees the kids in her school  'no 
""
""
yeah
""
""
i said she 's in grade seven now that 's middle school and uh she goes to private school near our house which is a lovely school that really brings out the best in every student
""
""
yeah
""
""
so i tell her you better start this early if you wanna go to a good school a good college someday because
""
""
yeah
""
how long are you gonna be there
""
how long is kiko 's uh
""
""
oh we have like about six seven months remaining
""
  the program is for one year 
""
""
 that fast that fast uh the program is for one year  
""
""
it 's the same one that uh secretary alunan took
""
like i had a chance to meet him by the way and i have to tell you the newspapers and television does not do the man justice
""
he 's darn handsome in person  speaker a laughs 
""
  yeah 
""
""
 okay   also after having rested  siguro  for several months
""
""
also yeah
""
""
he looks more more relaxed
""
 alam n'yo  in spite of your distance  medyo naabutan pa rin ng konting tsismis o konting   contro  controversy
""
 hindi ba 
""
""
 meron oo 
""
""
uh i understand that for example  lumabas dito daw si gabby daw  your ex uh has been trying to to contact uh your daughter  'no 
""
""
well
""
""
 nag-uusap na ba sila 
""
""
if you mean that he 's been trying to call
""
""
right
""
""
that 's absolutely not true
""
in the first place he does not know our number
""
""
 laughter  okay
""
""
and there 's not too many people know our number
""
""
uh-huh
""
""
uh if you 're saying if you 're asking if he has tried to have k c call him that is true
""
""
uh uhm
""
""
uhm he 's told some mutual friends
""
""
uh uhm
""
""
uhm and these mutual friends of ours have written k c saying you know your papa   wants  to speak to you
""
""
 yeah  
""
""
but it 's my daughter
""
she 's twelve years old and she
""
""
has she called    words  
""
""
 no  
""
she 's really not comfortable that 's what  sh  she said it on  showbiz lingo    i think 
""
""
 uh-huh   uh-huh
""
""
and i 'm not i 'm certainly not going to be the first person to stop her from getting in touch with her   father 
""
""
 uh-hmmmh  
""
""
but i 'm also certainly not going to be the first   person  to force her to get in touch with him  laughter 
""
""
 yeah  
""
and then interestingly in one of those strange coincidences in   life 
""
""
 uh uhm  
""
""
i understand jenny syquia and her new husband are also in the same area
""
""
yes actually we  speaker a laughs  i might get in touch with
""
i just got her number
""
""
yeah   uh-huh 
""
""
 she   left her number with a   friend  of ours
""
""
 uh-huh  
""
""
and that 's not so bad because you know the one thing that 's nice is that when jenny and i got to talk which was just really once
""
""
yeah
""
""
and about a long time ago on my  birth  after my birthday   show 
""
""
 yeah  
""
""
we agreed that our daughters should grow up knowing that they 're   sisters 
""
""
 yeah  
""
""
and that they should be loving each other
""
""
i remember
""
""
i appreciate that
""
""
yeah i i i i had the honor also of being on that particular show where she came out and you had that encounter
""
have you kept up
""
""
actually no
""
""
 magkaibigan pa ba kayo  or
""
""
we have not kept in touch as in   calling  each other or visiting no no no
""
""
 uh  
""
""
it was never like that because it was still i think for her it was still too fresh
""
""
uh uhm
""
""
and i had also just started a new life with my   new  husband
""
""
 yeah  
""
but as far as you know she 's happy now jenny
""
""
well i really have no idea
""
""
okay
""
""
actually i only heard that she got married when i got back and i was so happy to hear that
""
""
okay   let 's take a break 
""
""
 she deserves to be happy i think  
""
""
alright we 'll be right back  music   comments by sharon 's friends - matthew mendoza and albert martinez - speaking in tagalog 
""

 yeah  
""
""
so it 's it 's a great movie
""
""
  yeah 
""
""
 it 's solely   for women in   particular
