hi patneb by the way what are your plans for this summer i don't know yet but i 'm really planning to go to a beach and go swimming or go to tagaytay or baguio anywhere cold as long as i can go out on a picnic and i 'm also thinking of going and getting a summer job well that 's a great idea yeah because i need extra cash because my mom won't give me any allowance this summer so i need to earn money to be able to go out how about you what are your plans well as of now i have plenty of plans laughs  i want to go to baguio i want to go to boracay i want to go to palawan and i want to go to bacolod but definitely i 'm going to bacolod maybe in the second week of april of course i miss my hometown hometown already yeah and who will you go with well my brother can't go home because he has practices i don't know but he has to practice for his football you know football games this summer  varsity  well maybe i 'm goin going home alone wow that 's exciting are you gonna ride an airplane alone i experienced that for many times already well if you 're from bacolod you have to face the reality that you 're going to ride a plane just by yourself really i 've never i 've never ridden a plane alone ooohhh promise i haven't really   you must try you must try it i 'm scared yeah it 's really scary at first but after you 'll get used to it well you got a point but if you 're going to boracay can i come with you sure any time but i 'm not yet sure but my cousins want to go to boracay so i wanna go also because it 's been how many years that i 've i 've been there so i just want to go back there again and well enjoy the beach the white sand and the clear water at least you 've been there i 've never been there before i 've just heard stories about it and then and then i wanna see it for myself and see if it 's really a good beach but i think it is  oo  i pity you well you have to go yeah so if if ever you 're planning to go there this summer   yeah i 'll call you i 'll call you tell me please yeah i 'll call you how about palawan yeah but yeah i want to go to palawan too because they say the view there is spectacular but i 'm scared of the malaria  stutter are there is i don't know outbreak there 's a malaria outbreak i think somewhere there an and i don't wanna have a malaria i i just came out from a german measles and then i 'm gonna have malaria isn't that too much sickness in one year   but i believe the beaches in palawan are better than boracay yeah but they 're cleaner they 're cleaner the water cleaner clearer and everything but but at least in boracay it 's really a resort   civilized  yeah the service sort type of island unlike in palawan it 's more of a forest and jungle type actually boracay it 's it 's like a city in a beach that 's the setting it 's like a city in a beach and then there 's night life also yeah there is yeah oh god  stutter better in boracay   night life in boracay is very fun yeah and even more foreigners   and there is even golf courses imagine there 's even golf courses in the beach   and we could meet foreigners laughs   ay no laughs  how about uh what was your most memorable vacation me well i guess my most memorable vacation was when the first time i went to the states with my family i think i was around ten years old yeah i really enjoyed disneyland magic mountain knottsberry farm and all those amusement parks uh yeah i remember uh i went to i went to lake tahoe and that was the first time i touched the snow wow it was so fantastic i envy you i 've never seen snow and i 've never been to the states well i guess your time will come just wait for it yeah well at least my sister went there and my mom and my dad except me and my brother why don't you go with them no it was in different occasions i mean my mom went there alone for the wedding of her sister my dad went there on business trip my sister went there alone for her birthday gift in her eighteenth birthday gift  uh   that 's why  why don't you convince your parents to give you the money and uh we don't have the money laughs  as of now yeah as of now maybe if i 'm wor if i after i graduate when i 'm working already and i 'm earning my own money i 'll probably visit the states  ye  yeah break in recording  how about you what 's your most memorable vacation well i guess my most memorable vacation was when i was in third year high school and we went home to our province in romblon  i was with my titas and titos but they 're almost the same age in their in their early twenties during that time so they 're more of the teenager touch but not really they 're like the yuppies and then we went to our house in front in the house in front of the beach wow it was beautiful   and it 's like our sort of private beach because there 's nobody there just us and our house is isolated it 's it it 's in it 's it 's surrounded by forests and was it the first time that you went there no i went there when i was still little e but   but  it was the most memorable because we had fun we were we were swimming we were joking around we sleep in a hut be instead of the house we 'd sleep in the hut because we 'd tell scary stories at night before we go to sleep and then in the morning we eat pandesal and milo  hay those were the days yeah so sad to hear but but i guess you can do it again you can experience it again yeah it 's been a long time since i went back to the province  but if  but you know what if you 're going to think of it philippines is a lot of great places uh better than the oth better than going out yeah the better than abroad we 've got better beaches i think and better uh vacation spots  beach   yeah  but you know the problem is they 're so expensive yeah it 's it 's as expensive as going to the states almost as expensive as going to the states   yeah the rates are really expensive uhm it 's better if you 'll go to hong kong instead of going to palawan it 's more cheaper and that 's chea that 's a reality i 'm not joking yeah i know but well no not all of us get the chance to to visit every island in the philippines every tourist spot in the philippines so i guess it 's just someone 's luck to go everywhere around the philippines how about you pam i believe the you know what i believe they must give special rates for filipinos yeah don't you think   like discount yeah discounted rates yeah because this is our country we should have been enjoyi i mean like what they 're saying we should first visit or get around our country than plan on going out abroad because the philippines has better places to visit this week this summer time and i guess it ju the problem with the philippines is that most of the filipinos still loves to go out yeah they prefer to go abroad than stay in this country not knowing that we have better places like in batangas there are many beaches which are better than those in the states like my uncle who 's an american himself didn't like a beach in north carolina i guess and he doesn't want he 's not sure of visiting the philippines because he 's not su he doesn't want to see i mean he wants to see a beach that is very nice not like the one he saw in the states and to think he 's already an american and he 's doubting the philippines i told my tita that she shou she should bring her husband to boracay or to bat at least either in e even in batangas 'cause our beaches are far better than in the states and look at it hollywood stars are going to amanpulo  imagine going to our own beach hollywood stars  yeah  yeah they 're not contented with their own and we filipino are not contented of what we have yeah  we prefer to go to the states to europe  of what we have yeah  i guess it 's part of our mental mentality yeah so   so we want to be like others like the foreigners we we think that it 's more prestigious or something i guess it 's uh it 's the effect of our colonial mentality yeah you can say it words  it 's really sad hey how will we by the way will we how will we do our solicitations for esa european studies association this summer well i guess we have to meet first with the esa with the other esa officials and after that we should arrange the sponsorsh sponsorships packages and i guess after that we can go around manila to get sponsors well that 's a good idea you know i really want the euro-tour to push through next summer i really want to go to europe it 's really educational my mom even told me that if i let 's say if i 'll go to to europe i should go with my friends not with my family yeah you 'll enjoy it more yeah and it 's more exciting if you 'll go with your friends and and besides we 're studying it so it means we 'll get a a glimpse of what we 're studying of what we 're talking about in the classroom not just imagining in our minds what what does this place look like at least we can get first-hand info or first-hand picture of what we can really feel the ambiance of europe   yeah and when we when we go back to school in june it would be really exciting 'cause we could share stuffs that we we learned from our tour yeah i hope we can go i really hope that 's why we have to work hard yeah to get sponsors yeah we have to we have to get a lot of sponsors from rich companies yeah so they could support us when we go on tour what which countries do you want to go to when we go on the euro-tour well i guess i want to go to paris the usual things in france i want to go to paris france uhm greece also i like to go to greece spain yeah spain yeah you 're studying spanish you should want to go to spain and wanna practice our language   and i think we can apply our spanish language  yeah  even though we 're not that fluent but at least we 'll get  yeah  we know something i mean we know the basics yeah that 's good how about germany you wanna go to germany oh my dad said germany is also a great place yeah i wanna i wanna see those old castles but you know and look at them kasi it was really my dream while when i was a little kid to see a castle and act like a princess and everything but you know in europe everywhere there 's castles   there 's castles yeah i know how about belgium you wanna go to belgium uhm i not that much but i prefer going to paris and the places i mentioned yeah me i want to go to belgium because my aunt is there she 's a nun she 's a missionary nun so why don't you tell her we 'll visit yeah actually she 's been waiting for it i i told her about it even be way before when we were still freshmen
