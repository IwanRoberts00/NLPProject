 first section of speech omitted because it had too many
quotations  i propose to cluster the rights enumerated in 
familiaris consortio  under these headings first the right to a
family 's integrity and be respected in its freedoms second the right of the
family to receive its share of socio-economic benefits and third the right of
the family to pass on its faith and its values to the next generation
""
family integrity
""
the rights of a family are directed principally at its integrity
""
the importance of the integrity of a family is emphasized in the
catechism for filipino catholics which teaches as follows open quote 
actually our christian families like the church itself in some real way share
in the communion of persons and love of the blessed trinity
""
 for in the mutual sharing of thoughts affections and in all
their ups and downs christian families are actively creative like the father
""
in offering prayers and sacrifices to god they share in jesus the
incarnate son 's own prayer and redemptive sacrifice
""
finally christian families form a community of interpersonal love
by being inspired and strengthened by the indwelling holy spirit
""
hardly anything nobler can be said of the catholic family than that
in a privileged manner it not only resembles but shares in the communion of
the triune god  
""
but a multitude of factors and circumstances threaten to destroy the
integrity of the family
""
one example is a slavish attachment to communication media
""
children today rush home from school not to the loving embrace of
their parents who may still be at work anyway but to some cartoon show
""
i tremble at the thought that children will soon know t v
characters better than their parents  laughter 
""
indeed  applause; station break; break in recording 
""
and then there is the internet where a wealth of knowledge useful
to any family is sabotaged by silent threats
""
there are child molesters who choose their targets through the
internet
""
there is also the threat of child pornography hate websites that
encourage the use of violence against certain groups of people and other
materials that contradict what the pope calls wholesome recreation that
fosters family values
""
we also note that a growing number of filipinos and of citizens of
underdeveloped countries go to other countries to find work
""
the intention of course is noble to provide for their families
better through more lucrative employment than can be offered by their
economically beleaguered countries
""
the costs however are indisputably high
""
sometimes the spouses of overseas workers or the workers themselves
abandon their marital vows perhaps out of loneliness
""
even when spouses remain true to each other their children may
become distant as they grow up without the attention of either or both
parents
""
in all these cases there is a violation of what the holy father
calls the right to the intimacy of conjugal and family life and the right to
the stability of the bond of marriage
""
and such violation arises from the breach of another of the family 's
right that is to have adequate means to support a family
""
there is also the unspeakable evil of sexual crimes occurring
within the family
""
rape is evil in itself but incestuous rape is even more
dehumanizing
""
sexual crimes in the family are alarmingly becoming common
""
we can attribute this trend to evil influences in the mass media or
to the breaking of families for economic or emotional reasons
""
regardless of the reason however these crimes are a great injustice
to all families and they must be stopped
""
we must however shun the error of seeing the state as the principal
threat to the family
""
while it is regrettable that the policies of some states have not
always been helpful to the family the fact remains that some of the most
serious transgri transgressions of the rights of the family are perpetrated
by members of the family themselves
""
as the family struggles for justice it must then struggle with its
members so they become in the first instance champions of and not obstacles
to justice for the family
""
the state does its part in the family 's struggle for integrity its
struggle for justice
""
i am proud that the constitution of the philippines is one of few
basic legal documents with express provision on the family
""
section twelve of article two thereof or the declaration of
principles and state policies solemnly announces this state policy open quote
 the state recognizes the sanctity of family life and shall protect
and strengthen the life of the mother and the life of the unborn from
conception
""
 the natural and primary right and duty of parents in the
rearing of the youth for civic efficiency and the development of character
shall receive the support of the government  close quote 
""
it also devotes for the family one separate article
""
this is article fifteen
""
i have yet to see another constitution from among civilized nations
which enshrines a separate article on the family
""
in many respects section twelve of article two of our constitution
is consonant with fundamental catholic teachings on the family
""
it is a fundamental norm in construing the provisions of a
constitution that every term is accorded significance and that the
constitution uses  sanctity  i stress  sanctity
 is both philosophically and legally significant then
""
it suggests an order higher than the merely legal to which the
family must be referred
""
it enshrines the principle of subsidiarity because the family is
guaranteed protection as an open quote autonomous social institution close
quote with the result that matters within the purveyance of the family shall
not be arrogated by the state itself
""
every filipino family should be particularly proud of the fact that
the constitution goes so far in protecting the integrity of the human family
and in upholding the sanctity of human life
""
the natural and primary right and duty of parents to rear the youth
imposes on the state an obligation to distribute the benefits and resources
of the nation to enable the parents to exercise this primary right and duty
""
then we have section one of article fifteen which provides as
follows  the state recognizes the filipino family as the foundation of
the nation  close quote
""
accordingly it shall strengthen its solidi solidarity and actively
promote its total development
""
section three thereof enumerates these rights of the filipino
family  one the right of spouses to found a family in accordance with
the religious convictions and the demands of responsible parenthood two the
right of children to assistance including proper care and nutrition and
special protection from all forms of neglect abuse cruelty exploitation and
other conditions prejudicial to their development three the right of the
family to a family living wage and income and four the right of families or
family associations to participate in the planning and implementation of
policies and programs that affect them 
""
i will now take up socio-economic benefits
""
the discussions i just made on the rights of the family and the
duty of the state to protect and enhance these rights illustrate the demands
of distributive justice that the family must receive its share of the
benefits and the protection as well as the guarantee of the freedoms it can
rightly claim
""
the church has very often been chided for being blissfully ignorant
of the travails of many a present-day family of being naive about the social
and economic forces that strain its resiliency
""
very often these criticisms come in the wake of the church
insistence on its moral teaching especially on the regulation of births and
contraceptive practices
""
while in a democracy the beliefs of all and the rights of all to
act as they believe provided these do not contravene the rights of others
will for all time be upheld it is my position both as a minister of the law
and a son of the church that holy mother church serves humanity best when she
faithfully and unhesatingly  mispronunciation of unhesitatingly 
teaches as she should teach  opportune et importune  in
season and out of season  applause 
""
the church knows the travails of families
""
in  gaudium et spes  the second vatican council
observes open quote  the economic social psychological social and
civil climate of today has a severely disturbing effect on family life
""
 there are also the serious and aram alarming problems arising
in many parts of the world as a result of population expansion
""
on all of these counts an anguish of conscience is being generated
an anguish of conscience is being generated  close quote 
""
consequently the same council summarizes the obligations of the
state in this regard and the demands of justice towards the family
""
i quote  civil authority should consider it a sacred duty to
acknowledge the true nature of marriage and the family to protect and foster
them to safeguard public morality and promote domestic prosperity
""
 the rights of parents to procreate and educate children in the
family must be safeguarded
""
there should also be welfare legislation and provision of various
kinds for the made for the protection and assistance of those who
unfortunately have been deprived of the benefits of family life  
""
hence the philippines has definitely gone a long way in providing
socio-economic benefits to the family
""
there are as well non-governmental organizations which unceasingly
work for the welfare of the family
""
needless to say the failure of the state to comply with its
obligations to the family or to promote and enhance its rights and provide it
socio-economic benefits justly due it would be an act of injustice to the
family
""
faith and values
""
the second plenary council of the philippines identifies the
christian family as a open quote a worker of renewal close quote
""
it teaches and i quote  the family is meant by god to be the
first school of discipleship where the parents are the first catechists of
their children and where all the members mutually evangelize each other
""
 it is also the first school of evangelization where the members
learn to share with others the grace and light of christ  close quote
""
""
article one of the family code of the philippines makes it clear
that the provisions of the family code as well as of other laws on the family
are designed principally to safeguard marriage as open quote the foundation
of the family and an inviolable social institution close quote
""
article one hundred forty-nine of the same code describes the
family as open quote a basic social institution which public policy cherishes
and protects close quote
""
the legal consequence of this esteem is also made clear open quote
 family relations are governed by law and no custom practice or
agreement destructive of the family shall be recognized or given effect
 close quote
""
this then is the underlying ethos of philippine family law
protecting the family through the institutions of law and the mechanisms of
the justice system
""
while the philippines like other democracies believes in the
separation of church and state our political legal and jurisprudential
tradition have never read this constitutional principle of separation as
establishing a secularist an atheistic or an agnostic state
""
when article twen two hundred twenty of our family code recites the
rights and duties of parents toward their children it is almost as if one
were reading from a classic treatise of moral theology
""
these rights and duties under the family code are as follows
 one to keep them in their company to support educate and instruct
them by right precept and good example and to provide for their upbringing in
keeping with their means two to give them love and affection advice and
counsel companionship and understanding three to provide them with moral and
spiritual guidance inculcate in them honesty integrity self-discipline
self-reliance industry and thrift stimulate their interest in civil affairs
and inspire them in compliance with the duties of citizenship 
""
thus does the state manifest that it is its concern that children
receive moral and spiritual guidance from their parents
""
clearly we in the philippines must struggle as all of you must in
your own countries  break in recording  to our visitors with the
delicate balance between a healthy pluralism and the consecration to values
and virtues that foster the flourishing of the human heart and spirit
""
it will remain a state responsibility to shield the youth from
pernicious influences
""
this is why we have harsh laws penalizing the peddling and use of
dangerous drugs and substances
""
this also explains why the exploitation of children in different
forms is a crime in this jurisdiction even when or especially when
perpetrated by the children 's parents
""
in keeping with the treaty obligations of the republic of the
philippines under the convention of the rights of the child the legislature
enacted republic act seventy-six ten and amendatory laws that protect the
child from all forms of exploitation and abuse and that endeavor to keep the
child within the protective embrace of the family but likewise  amp 
amply providing for those unfortunate situations where children are victims
of dysfunctional families
""
exercising its rule-making power vested in it by the constitution
the supreme court of the philippines has promulgated special rules to protect
the child the rule for the examination of the child witness the rule for
juveniles in conflict with the law and the rule for the commitment of
children
""
while awaiting the organization of family courts already created by
law and recognizing that family and domestic problems cannot and should not
be dealt with in the same way as ordinary matters of litigation the supreme
court has designated many courts throughout the country to sit as family
courts
""
i can assure you that the philippines supreme court has been and
will always be on the side of the family in its struggle for justice 
applause 
""
i cannot help but voice the concern that many families have
abdicated the privilege of passing on cherished values to the next generation
""
laws alone will not guarantee that our children and their children
will live their lives by the values that have guided and molded their
forebears
""
the family 's struggle for justice will also take then the form of
a struggle for its members to be what god and human society call them to be
bearers of the values of future generations
""
foremost of these values is  pakikipagkapwa tao 
which is definitely more than just amiability or affability
""
it is true concern empathy and charity for others
""
it is being a neighbor to others as the gospel uses the descriptive
 neighbor  stress  neighbor  especially
to the poor and the weak
""
it is in the family where the concept of human rights must first
make sense and this means that every member must deal with the other with a
sincere regard and genuine respect for elemental human rights
""
it is the family that must teach the young the precious lesson that
the greatest privilege one can ever enjoy is that of standing from the table
shedding off one 's finery and stooping to wash the feet of one 's brothers
and sisters
""
this is love beyond measure
""
when the family is thus faithful to its calling true to its
vocation it becomes the frontier for the world 's struggle for justice and
its members the agents and the prophets of the often unarticulated cry for
justice
""
the greatest tribute that can be given to such a family is for all
to be able to say of it  see how they love one another 
""
after all it was thus that the master the christ wished his
disciples to be known
""
thus every family must grow on the foundations of love and be
nourished by love
