jullie music  i think i 'm going to be uh tongue tied tonight because we 're going to talk about romance and i 'm no expert i 'm only an expert in the art of expecting laughter not in the art of having but you know there are they say that politics is the art of the possible for me that is a better definition of romance the art of the possible what is possible in romance what is possible in love whatever you dream of having the illusion of love the hoax of romance that 's what we want in our lives women need it for to get along uhm through the hard through the rough edges of the day but men expect it that 's why all all the magazines that i have read the articles are always addressed to the woman how to make your love life better how to please your man but they never tell the men what to do maybe tonight we shall find out because uh we 've got three guys and the problem is they 're all single maybe they 're single because they don't want to lose the romance in their lives chuckle  so when we come back you 'll find out who they are music   an interview clip love should be sustained by romance in its many forms some people might think that love might not be present or existent any more and yet they 're appalled not really appalled but surprised why they still feel what they think is love so perhaps uh my answer is yes uh and uh yes uh you know love is upheld so love love love is sustained by romance music  that was angelo castro and uh guests started to talk all at the same time   hoy teka muna teka muna teka muna  quiet quiet first quiet first laughter

always looking for that special spark that we call romance uh a touch a look a gesture that uh expresses something inside the heart and maybe uh our guests tonight can tell us more about that beginning with mr manoling morato i think manoling is a very romantic person manoling can i tell them your secret yes yes laughter  you know many people think that manoling is afraid of women wha to come close to 'no  but he had a romance and unfortunately that girl perished in a fire sometime ago and that is the reason manoling 's romance lives in the embers of his heart oh laughter  correct correct yes uh okay so so you would be the perfect person to talk about what happens to a man 's life when romance goes away in in this case it it went away with the person well jullie i i 'd rather listen to the young people tonight because i don't know what they 're up to these days  yeah well you have to share with us  yeah yeah laughter  i belong to another generation that 's it we will compare the expectations of your generation   and i i think medyo pass&eacute; na 'ko ano   oo laughter  no never never  pero makikinig ako and i i 'll try to uh speak out and man manoling doesn't mind uh to express his love to his mom  he is he is one he is one person who who looks at his mother uh and puts her on a uhm pedestal  i don't i don't  well uh i 'm not a mama 's boy jullie she 's like my daughter uh she 's the daughter laughter  i rule over her  oo  she 's totally helpless without me   well i i think that happens you know yeah as as a child grows older the the roles are reversed  change of roles  yes now ms cynthia patag hi jullie single forever i don't know everybody knows cynthia so i don't have to read all of these except   oh really except what she said the necessity of romance and sex is dependent on the kind of love the couple enjoys did i say that yeah speakers a and c laugh well do you believe uh that romance is missing in your life because you 're single well we we by romance you mean the rituals of courtship whatever whatever it means to you  we  uhm kailangan ba 'yan   kailangan mo ba ng romansa  me now yeah speaker c laughs  my gosh well i haven't i went back to college after twenty years and i 'm graduating october two if you have   congratulations  thank you  congratulations   you think i have any room for romance i 'm shell-shocked you have no room for romance and yet you 're  not  not not 'till i with a thesis ha  uh-huh  pagkatapos ng thesis ko october two i 'm going off  ang ibig mong sabihin you have to have a block of time focus for romance focus no no for love to come in you need a chunk of time say from three to six this is my time for love and from six to six i have to immerse myself in my books  ganon ka  jullie you you have to define love no no how can i we cannot if i could then i would be the greatest ano sage in the history of the wo in the civilization of the world i cannot define love but maybe you can tell me what romance is  okay   you 're you 're going to graduate with a degree in literature  ehem yes literature okay now let 's give you the test laughter  alright after reading shakespeare and uh marlowe and uh whoever else okay in the context we 're talking about love in the context of a relationship romantic love there are two persons i won't say the gender uh uhm chuckle  uh and and your question is can love survive without romance without romance uhm platonic love yes oh yeah by definition   but uh romantic love no it cannot it cannot survive without romance  no  because there is uh sexual desire which definitely needs a consummation uh uhm but but somebody told me that uh if you were to get married or to get into a serious relationship it wouldn't be with a filipino  ay na naman   o mamaya mamaya   ayan na naman   o mamaya mamaya mamaya mamaya laughter  for now let 's let 's go to lara  i haven't been talking anyway laughter  anyway you 're spoken for laughter  anyway so lara lara fabregas she 's an actress and uh regular in the drama series saan ka man naroroon  you know a title like that speaks volumes saan ka man naroroon  romantic mga role mo do'n   kontrabida  uh uh romantic i guess 'cause all my evil derives from the fact that i 'm a scorned woman uh-huh you 're a scorned woman and you must have your man and i have to have my man and i 'll do what it takes i 'll kill wow that 's romantic that 's romantic so natatakot nakakatakot sa mga lalaki  yeah yeah i guess it 's pretty aggressive right   but some men it 's very obsessive love there 'no  uh-huh but some men like strong women to come come on to them i don't know i mean maybe some people would like to think that a woman would go to that extent would you in real life no i wouldn't you know your father will kill you first yeah no i think you can't force somebody to feel wha how you feel you know you would love for them to love you back but  so  so why are roles like yours so popular and classic and and and ubiquitous and identified words  eternal because of a perniciois patriarchal system where where the men speaker c laughs  okay where the men write the stories of course where they write the stories and they brainwash the women yes right okay okay yes but you you you deserve to be punished you deserve to be punished for  words  you deserve to be punished for grabbing a man away from his wife or his girlfriend  naku jullie mamaya na laughter  okay okay  words eh violence against women na ito laughter  yeah okay okay  si dr mario katigbak naku ito yung romansa daw magkano two pesos ano twenty pesos a day ano 'yon laughter  i i i cannot answer this remember if abanse pinay is here yeah dagger looks dagger looks yes willing to give them jewelry what 's that trips abroad trips abroad  oo  actually it 's giving them love  and then   give them love oo  but that 's all romance what does it take to make make a woman happy less than twenty pesos a da   love  tender loving care laughter  no what he was trying to say in that commercial was that the man has to be physically fit di ba   that 's right that 's right that 's right physically fit to you know the physical aspect of romance that 's all it was dealing with uh-huh like like you said you devote all the time   i don't wanna look at her anymore you devote all your time to your studies and uh mario naman believes in devoting a part of his life to being physically fit in order to please and pleasure his lady love  gano'n ba  is isn't that you know it 's non-chauvinistic you don't think so the pharmaton =a brand of vitamin is supposed to be given it 's supposed to be given  alright  you 're not supposed to mention that name laughter  well i did already laughter i don't take it so you don't take it you don't need it no need no need no he 's supposed to be giving it to the woman to his wife to his wife that 's correct  oo no no he 's supposed to take it no i think it 's open to it 's open huh to individual interpretation uh okay okay   and i won't say any more about it okay what is your individual interpretation of a romantic affair uh of a romantic affair uh you know i i think that you know a lot of romance really depends on the people i 've always held that you know that you know like you can go anywhere you know uh a date can be a perfect date  doesn no matter where it is as long as you 're with the right person you see it 's really it 's really chemistry   chemistry  it 's not something external i think but but the two of you have to express it it cannot take anything for granted because if you don't let it out if you don't demonstrate it true true   that 's when it begins to wither and that 's what we 're talking about tonight how do you keep the fire going how do you keep the flame burning di ba  uh like in the case of manoling he didn't have the chance to light a conflagration 'no  okay mr ryan agoncillo is uh another commercial model and uh he 's a part of a morning show he for him romance is an expression of love so it cannot be taken out of the equation of uh uhm uhm romance striving love thriving with or without romance it has to have romance now in your commercial you you were asking you 're asked about being in heat ano  do they allow that on t v what oh no laughter oh no who 's your target here well uh laughter  they allow that on t v in m t r c b they did they did thankfully thankfully for his sake   because they think uhm not many people understand what it 's trying to say well uh are you in heat it has a double meaning because in the in the story uhm the the elev elevator lights go off and uhm anyway they went out and then uhm you 're sweating yeah and i was offering my my drink and i was kinda see laughter  oh my god dagger looks i was trying to offer her my drink and uh and in order for her to cool down instead of asking her na uhm mainit mainit ba or naiinitan ka ba i asked her are you in heat laughter  she ended up slapping me so you know uh she did yeah so she resurrected her pride and speaking of pride
