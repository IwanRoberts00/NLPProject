mrs witness who was atty fernando chua as introduced to you by mr go atty fernando chua according to mr go represents a certain uh principal or client of the bank who wants to lend to a corporation using his personal funds mr chief justice yes we will have to move to strike out the answer of the witness on what ground on the ground in the first place that it is hearsay and that the answers sure to be elicited are not covered by any of the paragraphs of the second article of impeachment if your honor please uh the private prosecutor adverted to the fact that uh he wants to prove that the president accumulated unexplained wealth that is what i gathered from uh his statement just a while ago but the allegation is this your honor the president by that sworn statement also committed perjury and the offense of unexplained wealth because this is the this is the point your honor because records show that he and his wife and mistresses and their children have other assets in other companies outside of the three firms listed in his statement of assets and liabilities  those are the only assets that that had been read into the records already yes your honor that is why the tendency of the question now is to elicit the answers that will not be evidentiary of what has been alleged in the articles of impeachment so it there could be some kind of evidentiary value but the it is the manner of presenting it yes your honor the counsel should uh do it in such a way that he 'll be able to link it if he wants to unless you 'll be able to establish that linkage the chair will have to sustain the objection your honor please if we will be allowed to proceed we will establish the linkage you may nobody 's preventing you from uh proceeding but uh do it in such a way that you would be avoid you you 'll be able to avoid objections your honor the objection was hearsay i think it is baseless well uh you want the the chair now to make a ruling on that the fact that the witness heard  it is uh the the the chair will have to sustain it is hearsay but you can do something about it your your honor it is independently relevant because the witness is merely test testifying to what was told to her if it is only offered therefore as an uh independently relevant statement the answer may remain but that should not be taken as evidence on proof   yes we agree your honor thank you  and mrs ocampo did mr go identify the borrower of the amount of five hundred million pesos we 'll have to maintain the same objection for being immaterial and irrelevant your honor objection overruled thank you your honor uhm mr go mentioned that the borrower is wellex group incorporated mr chua then followed through by saying that it is wellex group because the principal is very close to mr gatchalian and uhm wants to uh help him we 'll have to move to strike out mr chief justice the answer of the witness what is the basis on the ground that it uh it calls for hearsay evidence your honor as it is on it calls for hearsay evidence not that it was hearsay it is hearsay your honor actually overruled thank you your honor part of the narration of the witness thank you your honor and did mr did atty fernando chua mrs ocampo advise you on when this loan transaction was supposed to be completed uhm that uh we met on february third two thousand he mentioned that the loan five hundred million should be released on or before twelve noon the next day february fourth two thousand what instructions if any did mr go give you with respect to the proposed loan transaction of the principal of atty chua mr chief justice we have to object again on the ground that uh it does not have a tendency to connect the testimony of the witness to any of the paragraphs of article two was the object  the articles of impeachment  wha what 's the comment of the presenting counsel it 's independent it 's independently relevant your honor based on the same ruling of the chair  ho how ju just to avoid further objection later on ho would you try to give us an idea how it is how it would become relevant or material because the documents that will uh for this purpose uh can we require the parties to approach the bench  atty mendoza and who else for the defense pause of several minutes gavel  the session is now resumed  is there a pending question atty bautista or a pending objection may we proceed your honor on another point you may proceed go direct to the point yes your honor mrs ocampo as trust officer of the p c i of the equitable p c i bank are you aware of an account a trust account in the name of jose velarde yes mr chief justice we have to object to the question for lack of basis and for being immaterial and irrelevant it is not alleged uh it has no tendency to prove any of the allegations in article two of the articles of impeachment yesterday the court uh opened uh the sealed envelope uh containing that particular account so as to the first basis uh overruled as to the second basis may be preliminary thank you mr chief justice thank you your honor yes i 'm aware of an account in the name of jose velarde can you explain to us in brief the circumstances on how you came to know about the account of jose velarde mr chief justice i 'm sorry i have to object again unle  unless they present the proper basis lay the basis because there is no connection between jose velarde and the respondent in this case they have not established the connection mr president during the uh when uh the parties were called to approach the bench uh among the agreement was for you to lay the basis and to go direct to the point this trust account mrs ocampo is this covered by any documents leading your honor preliminary your honor we we have made an objection on the ground that there is no connection between jose velarde and the respondent and jose velarde has never been mentioned  but the  then the the wit the witness may answer in this uh on this issue and the on on this particular issue you may proceed and as i said the chair would repeat go direct to the point yes your honor there are several documents uh with the uh signature of jose velarde that 's the investment management agreement the investment management agreement the directional letter to invest in wellex incorporated the investment guidelines and the signature card this is for the trust department mr chief justice sir yes the witness mentioned several documents the ag agreement has been for the prosecution to furnish us with copies of all documents that have been pre-marked we have not been furnished with any copies of these documents yeah the agreement must be strictly observed uh mr counselor there is a violation of the agreement we suspend the proceedings for five minutes to

furnish copies of the documents uh i thought that hah the defense had been given  you compare that with the uh mr mr chief justice sir may i call the attention of the court that uh the markings were apparently done by the private prosecutors themselves we do not see any initial of the clerk of court who is the secretary of the impeachment court is that true private prosecutor you did the marking yourselves  there is no  the private prosecutors did the marking themselves your honor what is the answer of the private prosecutors your honor please it was uh the clerk of this honorable court which marked one set and it is duly signed who marked the exhibits atty yap your honor so it was prepared uh it was marked by uh an officer  of the court   the copies that were given to us your honor do not bear any initial of uh either atty yap or atty barbo atty yap would you kindly go over uh the exhibits in the possession of the defense to to find out whether uh indeed you have not affixed you have not affixed your signature thereon may i please the honorable court pardon uh your honor uh it appears that uh a the the copy that was given to the defense uh panel do not have my signature because uh what i only affixed your honor was only one copy and yet  whi which copy the copy which uh the private prosecutor is now uh when you say copy you you mean one page one set of the all one set of the uh documents because i could not uh affix my signature in all of the xerox copies your honor the defense would have would be entitled to uh receive the copies of the documents uh as uh marked by uh the officer of the court to avoid any possibility of uh uh tampering or whatever and at least in the course of the cross-examination the proper exhibit number may be made a basis do it again in the uh and i hope that this would not be repeated uh the next occasion even for the members of the tribunal uh what should be given to the members of the tribunal would be copies of documents duly marked by an officer of the court initialed by such officer uh honorable chief justice if i may uh are you the assisting counsel yes your honor i 'm atty jaime hofile&ntilde;a i 'm uh assisting  wha what was mentioned before uh was another name or is he the one i 'm sorry your honor the one mentioned on the record as assisting is a certain atty poblador the court uh i 'm sorry uh the court cannot recognize any other one not announced earlier as the assisting counsel again for the purpose of a very orderly proceeding uh i 'm atty poblador your honors i have one set of the exhibits duly marked and initialed by the clerk of court following the instructions of this honorable court we 'll now have this particular set photocopied and give these copies to the uh the defense  atty flaminiano uh make of record uh your receipt of the documents if these are the documents no your honor the these documents that have been given to us are xeroxed copies and uh without the initials of the clerk of court yes and uh some members of the tribunal uh are even complaining uh about the nature of the documents given them uh mr chief justice the honorable uh senator uh judge uh osme&ntilde;a mr chief justice just to manifest that as far as i know my copy is not initialed neither is the copy of uh senator judge teresa oreta or neither is uh senator judge honasan or uh neither uh those of uh senator judge ople or senator judge uh tatad may i request the uh atty uh yap uh to uh approach the bench and to see the copies also furnished the presiding justice if these copies uh had been initialed by him  uh would you please make of record your answer to the query of uh the uh presiding justice uh your honor the copies which i have uh verified are not the copies which uh i initialed see even even the documents uh given to the presiding justice are not the ones marked uh your honors i confirm what the clerk of court said that he marked and initialed only one set  that is why why were we given uh copies of documents which were not initialed  following following because uh precisely unless these are not initialed they do not appear to be uh official documents of uh the uh the the court yes your honor following the instructions of the court we had that very set initialed and marked by the clerk of court photocopied again photocopy again the initialed document yes uh your honors  1 word of the defense uh of the prosecution that it will be submitted as uh uh it would be subjected to the condition that if once there is a a connection or once it would establish an allegation then it would stand if it will not then it has to be expunged from the record and that should be very made uh it should be clear to all parties concerned if you if the prosecution cannot make any connection direct or indirect the testimony would be stricken off the record and expunged therefrom yes your honor but that connection may not necessarily be established through this witness that connection could be done through other witnesses through other evidence we would like to present the statement of assets of liabilities of the president which is a public record which says that he only has thirty-five million pesos your honor and if it is proven as the witness has already proven that the president owns the jose velarde account which on this one sole transaction alone involved five hundred million pesos well you can go forward with your evidence later on to remove uh the effect of uh a a conditional uh evidence thank you your honor  on each of these investment management agreements the senator uh judge uh drilon there was a pending question which was not answered your honor how far was the witness was from the president the records  words  uh well i understand there was a pending question but uh the counsel uh abandoned it and made another question there there was no manifestation to that effect well the it was uh we leave it to the prosecution what uh the prosecution should do thank you may i reiterate my former question mrs ocampo how far away were you from the president when he affixed the signature of jose velarde on each of these three copies of the investment management agreement sir i was about one foot away because i was seated beside him on the le on his left side and at the time the president affixed his signature i 'm sorry affixed the
