mr president there are perhaps as many ways to look at the v f a as there are observers and critics and there are equally numerous issues that can be brought and discussed in order to form an opinion either favoring or rejecting this agreement there will be no end to the debates but by the end of the day we need to make a choice and as is true on any other issue we need to decide no matter how difficult the choices may be and act in accordance with our conscience and what we believe is to our national interest mr president no one i repeat no one has a monopoly of patriotism i cast my vote in favor of the visiting forces agreement ratification in the senate i do so with much confidence and optimism that the greatest interests of the filipino people shall have been served when this treaty finally comes into force my vote favoring the ratification of the v f a is anchored on two fundamental concerns one the need to strengthen our defense capability and two the legal and constitutional issues which if adequately understood by everyone would expose and erase the false fears peddled about by the v  about the v f a by its opponents mr president to begin with the v f a merely operationalizes previous agreements forged between the philippines and the united states under the mutual defense treaty under article two of the mutual defense treaty both parties had agreed to separately and jointly by self-help and mutual aid maintain and develop their individual and collective capacity to resist armed attack but these being short on the de on the details of how to go about developing such capacity to resist armed attack article three of the same treaty broadly mandates the foreign ministers of both parties or their deputies to consult from time to time regarding the treaty 's implementation mr president there is a diversity of possibilities that are heavily hinged on the v f a 's ratification or rejection not the least of which is the promotion and preservation of the country 's economic security this stems from the fact that the bulk of the philippines'  trade and economic ties with other countries is carried out in the vast expanse of the south china sea for instance mr president data reveal that about forty percent of our exports which are shipped to the different parts of asia is almost wholly transported through the south china sea and surrounding seas another twenty-five percent of our exports to europe is likewise shipped through routes along or traversing this sea on top of that more than ninety percent of our oil supply from major trading partners is also transported through the south china sea trade in this region and beyond may even be expected to expand on account of globalization and the increasing economic interdependence of nations yet the threats to regional security and stability remain mr president the still-unsettled question of sovereignty overs over the spratlys for instance is continually seen as a potential flashpoint of conflict it has to be emphasized that despite the growing importance of the south china sea to us there appears to be no way or no means for us to actually defend or enforce our interest therein no less than our own defense department has admitted the painful if not so surprising fact that our country is militarily weak and extremely vulnerable to the external threats and that it neither has the mean it neither has to the means nor it neither has the means nor the influence to deter those who would take our patrimony and cut away our sovereignty in front of our very eyes mr president it will not be often that an opportunity to strengthen our capability to enforce our common interest with the united states will present itself the v f a is one such opportunity we cannot afford to miss for without the visiting forces agreement any thought of arming ourselves in defense of our interests or to deter aggression will be meaningless on the other hand through the visiting forces agreement we shall have the practical means to one improve the capability of our armed forces two strengthen our national defense strategy three stren strengthen regional stability and our relations with the united states in all important dimensions security trade foreign policy environmental protection and resource preservation having thus said let me just enter into the records my position on the various contin contentious issues raised by those opposing the visiting forces agreement particularly the constitutional and legal points my vote in favor of the visiting forces agreement carries with it the submission that there are no constitutional or legal infirmities one the v f a need not go through the ratification process under article eighteen section twenty-five of the constitution an examination of the records of the constitutional commission reveals that temporary placement of troops in philippine territory as that contemplated under the v f a need not go through the special procedural requirement under article eighteen section twenty-five clearly mr president the intent of the framers of our constitution is that the placement or stationing of such foreign forces and installation in the country must be made with some degree of permanency and let me quote the records of the constitutional convention volume four page seven hundred eighty-two to seven hundred eighty-three  long quotation  mr president this view is in fact supported by the opinion number thirty-four series of nineteen ninety-seven of the department of justice the opinion reads in part quote this department has consistently ruled that the aforementioned uh aforequoted e  constitutional provision disallows the establishment of foreign military bases and the facilities for stationing of foreign troops similar to the u s military presence in the philippines under the r p - u s military bases agreement of nineteen forty-seven as amended and that it prohibits the presence of alien military units in the country which is characterized by some degree of permanency and magnitude unless the conditions set forth in the constitution are met additional quoted sentences  since the visiting forces agreement pertains to and provides only for brief and temporary visits of u s troops in the philippines the agreement may be thus ratified on the basis of article seven section twenty-one of the constitution which sets no treaty or international agreement shall be valid and effective unless concurred in by at least two-thirds of all the members of the senate under article six section twenty-one second mr president even if it be conceived that the v f a is within the ambit of article eighteen section twenty-five the agreement would still be constitutional and a binding agreement the premise of those who argue for the submission under article eighteen is that the v f a would be unconstitutional in the absence of advice and consent by the u s senate which they believe is not forthcoming in view of the united states government 's pronouncement to that effect thus there being no such ratification by the u s senate it is argued by the critics that the v f a cannot be considered as to have been duly recognized by the united states government mr president the argument carries with it the implication that our constitutional requirements be complied with by a sovereign equal this cannot be so mr president as articulated by two distwinguis distinguished members of the constitutional commission ratification may be effected in accordance with the laws of such other contracting state allow me to quote therefore the exchange between commissioners maombong and bernas found in volume four of the records of the constitutional commission page seven hundred eighty-two quoted exchange  clearly then mr president the recognition by the other contracting state shall be in accordance with its own constitutional or municipal laws this is necessarily so since under international law a state cannot impose its own municipal requirements on another state three on criminal jurisdiction i submit that the visiting forces agreement provisions governing criminal jurisdiction add nothing more to what the philippines already adheres to under generally accepted principles of international law which by explicit constitutional affirmation is made part of the law of the land the v f a provisions on criminal jurisdiction derogate philippine sovereignty no more than the country 's adherence to a host of other treaties and to the generally accepted principles of international law particularly on the aspect of sovereign immunity let me quote an authority on this point long quotation from a foreign author  mr president the grant of sovereign immunity is made more explicit in the case of foreign troops it has been ruled by our supreme court in the case of beyer versus tison g r number l dash two four two nine four may three nineteen seventy four long quotation  mr president nonetheless our supreme court was quick to add that such principle shall yield to treaty stipulations the v f a therefore mr president shall limit the applicability and extent of the doctrine by allowing exercise of jurisdiction by the philippines on certain offenses or class of offenses concededly there are certain types of offenses which the philippines by its own accord has agreed to a restriction to its sovereign right of jurisdiction under the doctrine of 1 or 2 words  limitation thus the v f a may have diminished philippine jurisdiction in some aspects however it cannot be said that the jurisdiction of the philippines has altogether disappeared as it is made to appear the only class of offenses which the philippines under the v f a has no jurisdiction are those relating to the security of the united states and those punishable solely under the laws of the united states in all other offenses the philippines has either exclusive primary or concurrent jurisdiction the fact that the philippines has jurisdiction in all offenses punishable under its laws negates the claim that the v f a grants immunity to u s personnel or accords them special or preferential treatment four it is a distortion to claim that the r p - u s v f a has provisions inferior to those appearing in similar agreements of the united states with other countries let me just cite the provision on waiver of jurisdiction as an example the u s agreements with japan south korea australia and nato uniformly provide that quote the authorities of the state having the primary right shall give sympathetic consideration to a request from the authorities of the other state for a waiver of its right in cases where the where that other state considers such a waiver to be of particular importance  close quote in diplomatic parlance mr president this sympathetic consideration clause calls for automatic waiver the r p negotiators thus resisted this language both parties settled instead on the following philippine authorities will waive their primary right to exercise jurisdiction in ca  except in cases of particular importance to the philippines end of quote we will note mr president that the broad formulation of the exception clause practically nullifies the mandatory meaning if any was intended that can be given to the use of the words will waive the u s er israeli agreement states quote israel will waive its primary right to exercise over a members of the force except in cases where the authorities of israel after special consideration determine that its interests acquire require the exercise of israeli jurisdiction  end of quote and with spain quote spanish authorities except in cases of particular importance to them will exercise their right to waive their primary ju jurisdiction upon the request of u s authorities  end of quote the language of the r p - u s v f a provision mr president on waiver of jurisdiction is for all purposes the same as that of spain and similar to that of israel in providing for a broad exceptional clause to the waiver of jurisdiction and these are better than the automatic waiver clause contained in the agreements with japan south korea australia and nato the u s agreements with egypt honduras and the netherlands also contain the phrase will waive except in cases of particular importance or exceptional importance  five it is argued that the v f a provisions on criminal jurisdiction is in usurpation usurpation of the judicial power to promulgate rules of court procedure particularly in allowing the united states military commander to have custody of the offending u s personnel pending investigation or trial before philippine authorities mr president the v f a does not provide for a different procedure for the custody and prosecution of u s military personnel before the philippine courts it does not mr president in any manner modify the existing rules of criminal procedure nor does it provide for a new procedure governing such subjects it is in fact consistent with and cognizant of the rules promulgated by the supreme court six the release of accused pending trial is not purely a judicial matter this issue has been raised in relation to the provision allowing custody by u s military commanders mr president the custody and detention of accused pending trial is a matter not within the exclusive domain of the judiciary particularly the supreme court the constitution and the rules of court provide quote all persons except those charged with offenses punishable by reclusion perpetua with evidence of 2 words shall before conviction be bailable by sufficient sureties or be released on recognizance as may be provided by law that is under article three section thirteen whenever allowed pursuant to law the rules of court provide or these rules the court may release a person in the custody in custody on his own recognizance or that of a responsible person clearly therefore mr president the release of the accused on recognizance is made pursuant to law and not under the rules of court alone it is submitted that the v f a provision allowing custody of u s military personnel accused in our jurisdiction to u s military authorities is constitutionally and legally allowed there can be no doubt that u s military authorities can qualify as the responsible person under whom the custody of the accused may be reposed.  1
