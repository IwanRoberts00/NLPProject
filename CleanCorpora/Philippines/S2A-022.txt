i 'm sorry that i brought a uh laptop here
""
in the bank i am in charge of the audio-visual uhm treatment
""
i was responsible for  bringing in the marketing touch for our presentations
""
that 's the reason why i can get away with this equipment without the bank knowing it
""
anyway when i told them that i was going to share the uh corporate vision of union bank with uh you la sallites  they did not hesitate to allow me to  borrow the equipment
""
it 's sort of a uh selling also a selling tool to you la sallites who would like to work later on with our bank
""
so much for the advertisement 
""
some of you know that i am an atenean and you may wonder why what am i doing here
""
i didn't realize that max uh tricked me into this  'no  uh but it was from a great la sallite by the name of dr bernardo villegas  that i got to learn about business ethics
""
you may say that in ateneo we uh are taught sixteen units of theology and sixteen units of philosophy more than our major uhm course 
""
you may think that us ateneans would have more or less a lot of this social awareness or social consciousness
""
in fact the battle cry of ateneo is  man for others 
""
but even with that i did not know how to face or i was not prepared when i started working  on how to judge whether what was good or what was bad
""
in ateneo they taught you uh for as long as you 're serving others then you 're okay
""
but there 's this big question when like  my  myself when i started joining a corporation or working for a corporation we very well know that the  ano  and we were taught in business that  the end goal of business is profits
""
so i was not able to reconcile profits and social responsibility 
""
but it was uh when i studied at the center for research and communication  when dr bernie villegas taught about two principles in business ethics and these principles are called  the principle of solidarity and the principle of subsidiarity
""
what is my laptop doing here
""
well  inside that laptop is two months of hard work  translating in visual terms what union bank 's vision is all about
""
this is my shared experience with you
""
uh you 're one of the few and lucky  shall we say lucky viewers because this isn't shown to everybody
""
right now our bank is up for for sale at least thirty percent
""
i am supposed to be there but uh since it was a previous commitment i 'm here
""
in any case i hope that you will uh seeing it a lot of uh values that i just mentioned about uh solidarity and subsidiarity
""
but i 'll tell you much  late  much more about this later on
""
but first  let 's talk about solidarity and subsidiarity 
""
how many of you here would say that business is based on greed 
""
you know i 've i went i 've gone through the mission statement of of uh la salle and there is a lot of it there 's a lot of social responsibility there isn't it
""
and uh there 's one thing that i observed also here that every six o'clock i dunno if also every twelve o'clock you say the angelus
""
that 's very admirable 
""
but i think this group here is coming from the business economics  am i right  group
""
and am i also right that you are here and you are taking your courses so that you would earn a living right
""
how many of you here would say that you are here uh for altruistic reasons   ha 
""
isn't it that you would like to  crash in  your course and finish your course as soon as possible so that you can start working  hindi ba  and not only working but working in the best companies
""
because do you know that it is only here in la salle that i realized that you are already learning courses or subjects which  normally if you compare with other graduates they get to learn only in their masteral courses not even in their masteral courses but during actual work experience
""
so you 're very fortunate
""
but that all adds up to your trying to get the best in terms of income if you want to work for a corporation right you want to be employed  hindi ba 
""
how much how much are you expected to earn right now
""
before one thousand was fine with us  'no  let 's just say five years ago  laughter 
""
but now i think the uh average hiring rate at least in commercial banks would range from three to five thousand pesos
""
okay let 's say let 's say that you know inflation is high and uh things have changed and you guys are more experts supposedly 
""
but can you reconcile well some of you here i know i have some students who are all who would also like to be entrepreneurs  but isn't also the end goal of a business  profit   hindi ba 
""
i can see some students here who would like who would one of these days would like to put up their own business and make money and become heroes  exporters 
""
so let 's  let 's say that you are here in la salle studying working your your very best to get the best grades so that you can if you want to work for a corporation you can earn  the highest salaries possible
""
or if you become entrepreneurs  immediately join the big league in export business
""
all for what
""
money  hindi ba 
""
but is money bad 
""
how many of you say that uh how many of you here think that money is evil  laughter 
""
otherwise you all shift courses to what and you will become priests and nuns  'no  
""
but money  per se  is not bad just like business just like earning a career  earning a living 
""
what is bad is the abuse of money
""
or what is bad is the abuse of business   di ba   coughing  
""
let me quote george  guildern 
""
he is a noted uhm american  socio  uh  socio  anthro  anthropologist
""
he says that christianity preaches that it is better to give than to receive but in business it is better to receive your profits  hindi ba  
""
now he also says that the church condemns the abuses of capitalism but not private initiative
""
and that 's the core of  business
""
and that 's the core of  that 's the core of you working for corporations  private initiative 
""
and he goes on further to say  that  enterprises are essentially altruistic
""
hard to believe  'no 
""
so it is other-oriented not a zero-sum game when a gain for one player can only come at the expense of another 
""
hard to believe again  'no 
""
but i think knowing i mean knowing uh la salle for two semesters  uh they also bombard you with a lot of social responsibility
""
but let me share with you these two principles which can help us uh make judgments when we 're working either for a corporation or when we put up our own business
""
and these once more are the principles of solidarity and subsidiarity 
""
 solida  well subsidiarity is essentially  human right
""
it is part of  a basic human right for one to earn his living  okay and make money in the process because if we think of it some of you here who have more or less uh some background on theology or religion isn't it that we are primarily responsible first to our creator   di ba 
""
next to ourselves  then others
""
because how can you help others if you cannot even help yourselves
""
and how can you help yourself if you 're not you don't even know that you have a creator to serve first 
""
so it is okay so it 's okay that you 're studying what business economics so that you 'll earn money
""
but i 'm sure some of you are doing this what primarily for  your loved ones
""
some of you would have families later on and you 'll do this what for your families but not for yourself
""
then it becomes altruistic
""
then the principle of subsidiarity which is basically private enterprise or self-interest  becomes a noble thing
""
but there 's a problem
""
if all of you would start getting interested primarily for  hi  for his or her own concerns there might be some trouble   di ba 
""
because who can tell you or who can tell the other that once i start doing my thing it might be at the expense of the other
""
so there 's a need for order  social justice  and the order of law
""
and  thi  this is where the principle of solidarity comes in
""
just simply common good  'no 
""
uhm  let me give you an example
""
the government has no business running  small enterprises which can produce goods and services more efficiently
""
this is the reason why mr gorbachev went through  perestroika  and  glasnost 
""
this is why china has started to move into market  capitalism
""
why because they 've realized that you guys who would be businessmen later on or working for businesses can produce goods and services more efficiently than the government
""
but on the other hand  you have no business building roads building bridges public uhm  utilities
""
it 's not profitable  di ba 
""
and this is where the principle of solidarity comes in wherein the common good is at stake then the government has to come in
""
then private individuals like you and me have to bond together and work for this common good
""
i hope i have shared it with you as as well as lay-mannish as possible 
""
now the dangers to avoid  are the of course anything the dangers to avoid are extremes  and one extreme is liberalism
""
well in in liberalism uh the individual is glorified
""
okay this is where we have the rightists  'no   and uh they sometimes do their thing at the expense of the common good
""
now we have what the uh military rightists right now threatening the country
""
for as long as they pursue their cause even at the expense of what investments that could have gone to the country and gone to productive purposes   bahala na kung wala 'yon basta 'yung masusunod 'yung gusto namin 
""
 mapapalitan si 'yung  present administration and they would come in and uh claim to put order into the government
""
on the other hand what do we have
""
the other extreme  leftists
""
uhm they 're technically called socialists  hindi ba 
""
where the collective is glorified at the expense of what  the individual or individual freedom
""
and so we 're left with no choice  but to strike that happy balance between the two extremes wherein going out making business and making money for altruistic purposes or working for companies and getting as much salary as you can  can be justified
""
and in fact i encourage you to even get more because the country needs more
""
i told some of my students that graduating after graduating they 'd better work in hong kong uh thailand malaysia  singapore south korea all of these newly-industrialized countries or tiger economies
""
why
""
it may be for altruistic reason
""
they can get more in terms of money and in terms of experience  and of course that money would not go to swiss accounts like somebody else did
""
because if that money were circulated within the system then even if uh no matter how greedy that person can become that money would benefit a lot of people especially those in the financial sector 
""
don't you think so
""
but it was pulled outside of the country so who  bene  benefited from it  the swiss 
""
so if you guys work outside for say five years while you are young 'cause each year i understand that the age limit is getting younger and younger
""
you have what five years is easy to spare   hindi ba 
""
gain that experience
 not only not only will you be uh if you will be if you would be  pit  against a local here in terms of experience you 're ahead
""
but i 'm sure that money that you will be earning and that experience you will be earning will be brought back here
""
the p l d t commercial  babalik ka rin  di ba 
""
that 's why they 're called heroes right now the new heroes those who are bringing in the dollars 
""
so  i 'd like now to share with you uhm an example of uh our vision
""
i work for union bank of the philippines
""
it is a uh government-owned bank and i 'm very happy to inform you that we underwent a visioning process and it was in this process that we were able to find out that our stockholders were not greedy at all okay
""
they of course they demanded the best returns on their investments
""
they also were able to open their eyes to the needs of employees and others
""
and we also realized that we not only have to concern ourselves with our employers but we also realized that we had a responsibility to share or we were responsible not only to our stockholders but also to other stakeholders
""
so this is another uh principle which i 'd like to share with you
 it 's the concept of the stakeholder concept wherein which guarantees that if you uhm take care of all of those guys who are part of your business be it a janitor your supplier  your buyers  management employees even the community the nation then if you take care of them pretty well not only managing your own business but also your relationship with them then you can be guaranteed of success in your business endeavors
""
so so much for the theory
""
let 's move into the into uh an actual output of our bank 
 you 're falling asleep  audience says no 
""
okay uhm this is uh supposed to be space  referring to presentation material   laughter  
""
now the background here is that our stockholders the aboitiz group s s s who owns sixty percent aboitiz owns forty percent together with uh top management meaning department heads and some middle managers uh got got together and decided to find out what do we really want to be in the next ten years okay
""
and so and and the process was such that uhm let me pause for a while  ha kasi baka naunahan na kayo 
""
the process was such that uhm we were supposed to come up with drawings  'no  literally a literal vision of what they expect the bank to be ten years from now
""
surprisingly uhm they found out that  the owners the employees and management came up with more or less the same picture and this was really hair-raising because we didn't expect it to be that way
""
