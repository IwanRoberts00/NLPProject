which reminds me that 's the twenty-second  'no 
""
""
uh uhm
""
""
and you 're supposed to be ching 's 
""
no but your attendance is required 
""
  actually  i don't have any role   in the program 
""
""
 is that a  
""
 neither do i  
""
""
the thing is     we 're part of one and the same department
""
  we should give her moral support 
""
""
 uhm  
""
 it 's good if we 're there   yeah
""
  so what do you want to do 
""
""
 so that 's going to be a problem  
""
""
how about
""
""
can we move it to thursday  is that okay
""
""
yeah  yeah
""
""
thursday but thursday  there 's another lecture  it 's andee 's lecture
""
i think that that 's the twenty-fourth  'no  
""
that 's andee 's lecture and i think you have a role
""
""
i don't have a role
""
i 'm supposed to introduce her that 's why i got the photocopy of her     c v but apparently it 's dr ching who 's
""
""
 uh  
""
who 
""
""
who 's uh introducing her
""
let me see
""
""
that 's on the twenty-fourth
""
so i i guess it 's going to be the lecture 's the   whole morning 
""
""
 no  
""
""
uhm
""
""
she 's on the twenty-ninth
""
""
uh twenty-ninth uh okay 
""
twenty-ninth so that 's that 's tuesday tuesday next week and the week after next  'no 
""
that 's the yeah twenty-two is  thu  tuesday twenty-nine is tuesday 
""
uhm okay see you on twenty-four eleven o' clock  okay
""
""
unless uh   it 's a little 
""
""
 twenty-three i can't   i can't because we have a
""
""
well neither can i because we 're supposed to be together presenting the thing
""
""
 laughter  which reminds me  are you ready with the   lecture 
""
""
 uhm  
""
more or less
""
can you just remind me before we go  so i can give you the or you have the do you have the copy of the final report
""
""
i do yeah i do i do uh uhm i got it
""
and it 's my my my part is going to be basically uh based on  ano 'no  on on that
""
and i  dr tish gave me the lent me the  the c d c d   of the i c  e great britain component yesterday  'no 
""
and last night i i opened it and it 's a very very  cru  it 's well well done 
""
so it is beautiful
""
""
 great britain  
""
yeah
""
i mean they have to do it right if they 're going to start and pioneer the whole thing dan
""
""
it 's beautiful
""
but i i just have a comment on their  syntactic trees
""
uh maybe it 's not the the trees are not really trees  e 
""
  they 're  linear
""
the the analysis of the constituents of their sentences  in the   corpus  is is linear
""
so you know their it is like parsing or    words  
""
so it 's not really trees   because in the trees you have subsets 
""
  which one  
  uhm  
  uhm  
""
 as in one  you have subsets  
""
""
yeah
""
and you can see the you know know what what they call the dominant relations  you know 
""
""
yeah 
""
so
""
""
it 's well done
""
""
yeah
""
at least well you should be able to get some data from that for the presentation 
""
""
uh uhm for the intro
""
""
okay
""
i i haven't i haven't sat down yet to do mine but i should  i should be able to
""
anyway we each only have  twen  what   each of us has  ten fifteen minutes 
""
""
 ten  
""
did you see my e-mail  interruption in the tape 
""
""
you have to submit your handouts uhm at at the latest at the day before a day before the presentation which means tuesday
""
""
what
""
""
i got a call from jocelyn jocelyn
""
""
if we 're coming for ching 's  chair lecture
""
""
uh uhm 
""
""
besides  i 've been thinking though except for that one list of categories that tish wanted me to have as a handout that people can bring with them  the rest are going to be on acetate and so i was thinking of just doing it myself 
""
""
uh uhm but i told her we need an o h p
""
""
uh uhm uh uhm
""
are you gonna 'cause you 're gonna use one
""
""
no
""
""
but yeah i 'll use one 
""
off hand i was thinking of having  list of categories
""
""
uh uhm
""
""
that 's one acetate
""
""
uh uhm 
""
""
header what what are the things that are contained in the header
""
""
uh-huh
""
""
just to give them an idea that they can have background information about the kind of  words  or the persons they are  listening to in the tape
""
""
uh uhm
""
""
and  sample text so that they know when i say just ignore the markups then they don't say what are the markups
""
then i 'd say these are the markups 
""
""
and  tho  those will be on uh on acetates
""
""
yeah i want to do them  on acetates 
""
i don't wanna do handouts a lot when i discuss 'cause people don't listen
""
is it the same for you
""
""
yeah 
""
""
so we 're okay with that
""
""
uhm
""
""
the other thing 
""
can we talk about the  the fuse  the trip
""
""
uhm
""
""
oh can i ask you
""
""
uh yeah the the schedule has been changed
""
""
what do you mean
""
""
it 's still in may but uhm it would be one week later
""
""
what
""
""
so it 's going to be may 
""
the the original the first schedule was may one to may   seven 
""
""
 seven  
""
""
now it 's going to be may seven to may thirteen
""
reason since the secretaries are coming along     one of them has to be here to be left behind
""
uh and coolly said we can't afford to you know to close the the   office  for one week  'no 
""
so one has to be left behind
""
and that means that paz 's group will go to cagayan de oro first week of may
""
we will go to palawan second week
""
third week uh coolly 's group will go to iloilo 
""
that 's three weeks in may
""
""
 uhm  
""
 office  
""
is it okay if i ask about the  honorarium in regards to a personal plan i have
""
""
uhm
""
""
you know how we 're given the honorarium right as in eight thousand but with the daily allowance how are you planning to do that like we did in davao
""
we we will you give us each our budget for the meal and the  lodging
""
you know how you had  words 
""
""
the the the the one that we did in surigao was was something different
""
""
how how did you
""
""
if you still remember in davao  we shouldered our own expenses for food and accommodation
""
i think in surigao  we had free lunch
""
""
uhm
""
""
free everything is free except the breakfast because we stayed in a hotel
""
but otherwise the lunch and the  the dinner
""
""
but are we gonna liquidate the accommodation and meal  money
""
no
""
""
the one that  it 's the allowance that 's not liquidated i 'm not sure
""
the honorarium   is 
""
""
 dan   can you find out because  for me if it 's not  pera  because  uhm  i was thinking and and you 're invited too if you want but if you don't have to liquidate the the accommodation and meal allowance     can you just give it to us and then i was i was planning to stay in the house and not in the hotel
""
""
 uhm   
""
uhm
""
""
then if you want you can come  they can come
""
it 's just that of course it 's gonna be more  luxurious and you know     better facility
""
because i i wanted to do that 'cause i wanted to save because i roel and the kids are planning to come the week after we 're there
""
""
 busy  
""
uh okay 
""
so are you staying on or
""
""
yeah
""
""
uh staying on
""
""
yeah that 's what we wanted to do because we were gonna go to subic in march
""
""
okay
""
""
but then when i said  oh i 'm going to palawan and i don't have a choice 
""
""
what you should do then is tell nilda  that your return ticket
""
""
would be one week later
""
""
one week later  oo  
""
'cause i gave her the new date may seven to may thirteen
""
""
did you wanna stay longer 
""
""
no  one week 's okay
""
uh and then so uh uh i 'll look into that
""
""
yeah
""
""
i 'll look into that
""
""
that is is you know
""
""
because yeah i remember in surigao one the allowance i think was not liquidated but the one which had which was taxed was liquidated i 'm not sure it 's the other way around
""
""
uhm 
""
any news yet on the  moa
""
""
uhm
""
the  mo  matel
""
""
uh uhm c o e
""
""
they have the money
""
it was released yesterday and nilda got a notice from the accounting office that the point five million     is already available
""
it 's it 's already been deposited in the accounting office
""
so i made it clear to her that that 's just the first installment because it 's one million per year  e 
""
""
 uh uhm  
""
uh uhm
""
""
and ched might say that it 's just point five million for one year but uh nilda said no it 's just the first installment second installment will  will come very soon
""
i i have not talked to coolly about that yet
""
but it 's a  it 's a development a great development because we 've been waiting for that     since last year
""
so it 's all it 's all systems go for the matel
""
""
 yeah  
""
do we have the faculty though 
""
""
we have identified them
""
the thing however is that we haven't talked to to people and we haven't given them the schedule
""
""
who do you have in mind to teach
""
""
what
""
""
the c o e matel
""
""
uhm the usual faculty graduate faculty plus you cora uh and lily might go might be asked to go uhm remy miciano also
""
i think we have enough except that we have to synchronize the i mean you know to see the the schedule and not hold the courses at the same time
""
that 's why i  the first reaction to the moa uh the p h d applied linguistics extension program in ateneo was a little negative
""
i said  i i go for deferment of the project to the following year because we might be understaffed
""
""
uh uhm
""
""
if all the the extension programs namely lipa zamboanga and the matel uh c o e  pro  projects uhm are held at the same   time  on schedule i mean you know same schedule then we might be left with no one to teach the courses on campus
""
and we have three masters and one p h d courses in on campus
""
""
 yeah  
""
if if i 'll be teaching the matel i 'll i 'll be going to san carlos  or that   depends on the  course
""
""
 we 're not sure about   san carlos yet   'cause  i haven't talked
""
""
 uh all right  
""
and it depends on the course and not so much on the place
""
""
yeah
""
""
what course were you thinking for me to teach
""
""
i was thinking of giving you advanced grammar for philippine languages  laughter 
""
no i think you were identified for to teach curriculum design something on materials prep
""
""
uh okay
""
""
the one that andee has been teaching
""
""
all right 
""
that 's exciting but ateneo de zamboanga at the moment is being deferred
""
""
no
""
""
uh   it 's all systems go  also
""
""
 it 's all systems go  
""
yeah yeah i didn't finish the statement allan said allan e-mailed me back and said danny if we defer to the following year then they might look for  ano  another school
""
""
right but
""
""
we might lose the chance of you know
""
""
yeah
""
""
serving that
""
""
but where i 'm not i 'm not teaching there right 
""
""
no
""
""
just so i can pace myself if i can go to europe or africa
""
""
where in africa in rwanda  laughter 
""
""
no but you know roel 's going to australia in september but i don't know
""
""
uhm olympic olympic  'no
