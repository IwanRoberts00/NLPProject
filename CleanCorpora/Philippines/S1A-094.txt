""
""
 oo   nga e  
""
""
 you 're not   you 're not you know you dont
intend to to get married anymore because   of all these 
frustrations
""
""
  indigenous words   
""
""

""
""
we formalized  words  february
""
""
uh very new  very new relationship
""

new relationship  pero  of course uh we we
both prayed for it
""
""
uhm good
""
""
it it it 's a it s a relationship born out of prayer
""
""
  amen 
""
""
 definitely   and then
""
""
i think that 's the difference with your former  ano
""
""
""
that is a very big big difference
""
""
yes  kasi yong  before out of you know 
tukso tukso  out of you know  yung 
""
""
infatuation  lang  basically
""
""
yes but this time it 's a little you know serious not just
little maybe
""
""
it is  laughter 
""
it is well of course as far as we 're concerned  syempre
 we 're taking it  ano  as lightly  lang
 as the lord leads day by day but of course  syempre kung anu
yung  leading  ni  lord we follow that
""
""
wow
""
how mature  naman ng disciple ko ate linda ang lalim
""
""
""
you know what
""
 meron kaming ano  we have this weekly prayer
""
couple 's prayer we call it
""
 pumupunta kami sa isang  garden and then we pray
for one another  kung ano yung mga  needs  namin
""
""
""
that 's exactly what we did
""
""
 ah ganon 
""
oh
""
""
every time we had a date we would you know we would have our
devotions and a long session of prayer
""
sometimes we would go to  ano  to  ano ba
yun  to manila memorial park and we would pray there kneeling
""
""
exactly that is our venue  rin kasi ah yung dad niya
namatay na 
""
""
hmmmh
""
""
uh the dad 's there together with the brothers
""
""
oh  speaker b says something but unclear 
""
that was also our favorite spot to go  kasi  very
 ano e  that 's where we we pray we would uh plan out about
the wedding 
""
of all the places  ano   laughter  cemetery
 pa 
""
""
 ikaw naman 
""
how about you
""
how are you doing now
""
""
well
""
""
you 're in the new place and everything
""
""
yeah uhm the last time you called me up we were in in
""
""
alabang
""
""
no in las pinas
""
""
uh okay
""
""
our church is still located in las pinas but our house are
are basically is was located in las pinas and then two or three weeks ago we
moved to paranaque because my son is enrolled in ica
""
""
okay
""
""
and we opted to go there because you know distance and we
wanted to save some time travel time
""
""
is your son a scholar
""
""
no uhm we  get fifty percent discount because he 's a
pastor 's kid
""
""
uh okay okay
""
""
so that 's that 's a big blessing a big help although 
malaki pa rin kasi  first first uh year we had to pay the development
fee
""
""
uh   okay 
""
""
 yeah   so a little bigger compared to the
previous tuition fees that we paid when he was in preschool
""
""
how young is your son
""
""
he 's seven
""
he will turn seven this july seven
""
""
wow
""
""
yes
""
""
it 's hard to believe  'no  that you have a
seven-year-old son
""
""
yeah  parang kailan lang 
""
""
you look single
""
""
oh  laughter 
""
do i oh  di  yun na nga e  if you see me now
 naku  dens
""
""
well the last time i saw you that was only a couple of months
ago  ha 
""
""
was that only a couple of months ago
""
""
 hoy di ba 
""
""
uh when i had a lecture at uh  ano 
""
""
 oo  couple of months ago  lang yun
""
""
i think late last year
""
""
i dont feel pretty  e  because my tummy 's
bulging and you know  parang feeling ko   the tape was cut
 
""
yeah this is my last   uh  term
""
""
 wow  
""
term
""
""
for my course work
""
""
for your   and then  you still have some more
""
""
 course  
""
i still i still have to enroll one sem for my concept paper
""
that concept paper will be leading to my dissertation writing
""
""
so that will take uhm one more year
""
""
one more year  pa  if i could get to finish
and complete my paper in six months or one   year 
""
so if not  medyo mahirap 
""
""
 wow  
""
from there what 's your plan
""
""
from there uhm  uhm from there uhm there are a lot of
options
""
first i wanted to pick up my teaching career because you know i
gave up teaching and went into private tutorial because of  to give way to
my studies so i wanted to pick up my teaching career but of course this time
in college
""
uh la salle has  in  has invited me i think twice doctor
dayag my professor but i refused because i said i wasnt ready yet
""
so that 's one option uhm
""
""
uh so you 're supposed to have a teaching career at with la
salle
""
""
uhm i was invited once or twice
""
""
uh okay
""
""
uhm but i 'm not yet ready
""
""
okay
""
""
i 'm not yet ready
""
that 's one option
""
second is maybe going abroad  chuckle 
""
""
oh that 's another good option  pero  we 'll
miss you definitely  words  we dont want to
""
""
oh but my husband wont allow me
""
""
uh-huh yeah
""
""
so anyway so how about your church  church life
""
""

""
 hindi 
""
""
you 've grown a lot  speaker b chuckles  spiritually
