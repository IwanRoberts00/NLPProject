where is your president mr president fellow inventors ladies and gentlemen at one of the occasions uh i was invited to after uh addressing the crowd uh a man sprang up and asked a question with certain degree of enthusiasm and said why did you address us uh fellow inventors then i shoot uh another question how many children do you have and he said i have eight oh my god you are as good a prolific inventor as i am but i uhm i mean you are more prolific than i am i have only two  my point really is that everybody is an inventor in his own right right perhaps you have invented so many alibis laughter and justifications for coming late at night because of such uh an exciting date but if we agree that uh necessity is a mother of invention then everybody 's necessity has to be addressed with certain degree of inventiveness  at any rate before we go on inventing let me just briefly tell you about the filipino inventors society in nineteen forty-three during the war a group of true blooded filipino nationalists grouped together to organize the filipino inventors society at a time when imports were curtailed you know that uh if the war is uh ongoing freedom halted  and so the society was formed if only to address the promotion and development of local inventive capabilities  so along that direction the filipino inventors society was able to lobby and uh congress approved the then known as republic act number thirty-eight fifty and then later was amended by apo ferdie marcos by p d fourteen twenty- three to be responsive to the need of our so-called technological requirements regrettably under the current administration i don't know who of you are pro or cons especially the treaty the republic act number was abolished that would include the tax exemptions that we were enjoying that would include the funds that supported the development of crazy ideas  you know ideas have to be prototype to make it you know make it to make them workable demonstrable and then perhaps convert that into economic realities   yun ang nakakalungkot   kung baga ako may trauma kahit na kasama ako sa edsa   dahil nung panahon ni apo the filipino inventors were given kahit na consuelo de bobo mayron din  to tell you frankly we were given enough support we were holding regular inventors' week in which contests were held and for which presidential awards were given including the international awards of the world intellectual property organization under the u n system but under this current predicament we have been plagued by what the doom of the referendum the lahar the mount pinatubo the quake the flood why is this country cursed oh my god almighty have mercy upon us  what is happening to this country ladies and gentlemen for the last fifty years we have stagnated immediately after the war we were only said to be second to japan but what is our per capita income now it 's about seven thousand dollars vis a vis japanese twenty-two thousand dollars much higher than the u s twenty-one thousand  this is very regrettable then we have to address this and we have to ask questions like why have we stagnated the following statements will give some as unassailable answers let me read to you so that i 'll not get lost  in seventeen ninety the president of the united states george washington during the inauguration of philippine patent office said the advancement of agriculture trade and industrial manufacture with all appropriate measures may not need a special recommendation but i cannot refrain from pointing out to you the necessity of effectively encouraging introduction of inventions from abroad as well as the skills and genius at home for the production of these inventions  mr name an attorney-at-law head of the japanese and far east department max planck institute munich federal germany he said industrial property as an element of national industrial strategy  he said uhm averred in his paper regardless of development or growth economics regardless of whether you have a developing or industrialized country or regardless of which branches of industry a given industrial strategy strategy focuses on one factor that is essential to all was essential for sustained high growth in korea and taiwan is technological progress  werner von siemens the inventor of the telephone that we are using now perhaps whose efforts were decisive for the adoption of patent protection in germany he added national interest and national industry must come first because patent law was established so that industry should develop not for the inventor himself to make money or especially good profit that is only secondary  our industry shall blossom and progress for this inventive activity is necessary not for itself  mr takasha takashi tahakashi korikyu of japan founder of the japanese industrial property system he said pasensiyahin mo yung english ng hapon we have looked about and see what nations are greatest so that we can be like them and he sai and he said uhm what is it that makes the united states such a great nation and we investigated and found that it was patents meaning inventions and so we will have patents and look at japan now of course the organization of which the filipino inventors society is a member mel said uh a voting member yes and the united nations uh world intellectual property said industrial progress and prosperity are to a large extent heavily dependent upon the inventors   the significance of the inventors becomes overwhelmingly evident when we consider a situation had many of the great inven inventions never been made  the latest uh statement i have gathered the u s claims to a foundation educational foundation of inventors quote our inventors are the single greatest national resource unquote these are some statements which perhaps can address the question we asked earlier and in this uh in the country we have uh a very active uh secretary then of president marcos and i have been overwhelmingly fascinated by his uh popular popularized phrase and he said innovate or stagnate so at least you know now why we have stagnated  if we ventur venture to say that the government has failed to employ the invention or the technological inputs into its economic agenda then it is a sign it is a reflection that will tell us perhaps it 's indifference or outright ignorance of putting the invention into the industrialization process  alam mo don't uh be malice about this you know the government has been embarking on industrialization thrust  ang sabi ko sa bisaya we can never un industrialize i tell you we can never industrialize  so sinabi ko sa bisaya patuli ako uli papatuli akog utru kung makakamot makamtan nato ang industriyalisasyon sa the year two thousand i don't have to interpret that in tagalog anymore because namimilipit yung dila ko  it is sad to state ladies and gentlemen that our government has been inventive i tell you has been inventive look at the invention of the garchitorena scam the graft and corruption the two billion pal scandal the borloloy the lear jet  alam mo binili raw ng amerikano e ay seven million e dollars pero ang dini-clare ay five million lang   nung bumalik dito ang sinisingil ay seven million nahalata tuloy  i think uh at the very late i mean lately i think you have not that lately uhm you have perhaps seen some t v pluggings no during the time of joe con  alam mo yung background dun is the song of uh ninoy aquino yung favorite favorite niya yung the impossible dream   baka nangangarap lang tayo nananaginip tayo sa ating industriyalisasyon without the aid of science and technology it 's uh nakakalungkot no  it 's a sad thing that uh why this government has not been able to establish a strong science and technology policy why why the private sector perhaps like you has not been able to address that problem of science and technology as one single economic factor because if we have to industrialize we should employ technological innovations or inventions there is nothing else there is no way else that we can industrialize without the aid of science and technology  so additionally the filipino inventors society has been aggressive to restore what was abolished by execution order one two eight i mean executive order one two eight that abolished the incentives there is now the hou the senate bill seventeen fif uh seventeen fifty-eight which embodies the ten year tax exemption for inventors who may be able to to to commercialize an invention a fifty million guarantee fund but this bill is still pending in the senate there is also the house bill three three eight seven which would make the filipino inventors society as a chartered organization  as a chartered organization it can now enjoy tax exemption corporate tax and perhaps customs duties to be free if an import would complement the r and d activity of the filipino inventors society let me mention some filipino inventions for your information which have uh per ga uhm gone into some kind of a world fame but uh i know you know rizal he was the first to invent the hollo the block-making machine that could produce at that time six thousand blocks a day i don't know if you are aware of that then he invented a cigarette that he gifted to dr blumentritt and other friends at the age of nine and then he made a some kind of invention an irrigation system that only made with uh was made with bare hands and some innovations that irrigated his autarchic republic within the republic during his exile in dapitan 'no  he he collected about three hundred forty-three conchology items 'no  and then he invented some equipment for bakery making biscuits among others and so i think from the very from the very history of the filipinos the inventive gene has been there that 's why i call you inventors uh in your own right take a look at the fluorescent lamp this is documented during the time of quezon this was presented by agapito flores to to the president but uh wala ngang alam e ng invention di mayro'n mayroong certain diplomatic visitor there who was interested doon sa kumukuti-kutitap uh nakikita niya e  and so he brought uh agapito flores in the u s and it was further developed and perfected there and so it was known flores-cent lamp look at also the moonbuggy one of the aggressive designers was ed san juan during the time of marcos he came over and we presented him a plaque of appreciation he died two years ago in the luxury of wealth at the nasa look at the signal light yung sa yung sa kotse baka hindi ninyo alam yan  it was patented by a filipino in nineteen twenty-one in the united states 'no   kaliwa kanan kaliwa kanan ha by buncio william buncio the t v telephone association it was demonstrated in nineteen sixty-seven between the depa the development board office at herran and malaca&ntilde;ang during the time of president garcia it was done by dr greg sara the multivitamins and and many other inventions but the recent one the sing-along system was copied everywhere else this was originated by then president roberto del rosario 'yung sa trebel 'no  in fact he has invented a new a new tape colored tape  yung mga paos yung mga sintonado pwede nang kumanta  believe me 'no kakanta kayo pwede na   tatlong kulay yun na- distinguish yung kulay ng boses nyo   sabi ko nga hindi yan colored tape kung hindi voice range find uh voice range finder at any rate unless we do something about our inventors this is quite uh self-pity but i have to say with all candor from within my heart unless we do something with our inventive capabilities and put this into the vortex of economic strategizing we will never never industrialize  ang sabi ni concepcion we have there is already an investment to as much as three billion dollars or three hundred billion dollars in the country what three hundred billion dollars do you think that is an industrialization per se never because this capital siphoned in would only exploit your skills and my labors our natural resources and what is foremost is the repatriation of income perhaps hindi pa magbabayad ng income sa atin  and that would tend to exploit rather than industrialize our country so unless we do something about this we would be left singing to dream the impossible dream to reach the unreachable star no matter how hopeless  then the n i c or the new industrialization program of tita cory administra administration will never be as good a dream as a nightmare thank you very much the following is a response of the speaker to a question raised in the open forum  okay cough as per international statistics the ratio between success and failure is anywhere from ninety-five to ninet ninety-seven failure only three to five percent success remember thomas edison when he was experimenting on one of the items uhm sina sinabi do'n sa boy uh ang nagreklamo yung boy e sabi niya 'yun boy eh uhm sir sagad na   do'n sa calibration 'no  uh that was the that was the limit according to the boy
