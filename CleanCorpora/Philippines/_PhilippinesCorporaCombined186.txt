the archers managing to survive a scare by the blue eagles at many occasions during the course of the first half especially when tenorio got into the ball game and scored with about eight points but unluckily for ateneo ateneo got into foul trouble and fonacier has his own uh highlighting the first half but still wilson and ritualo i think they carried the load heavily for de la salle while we 're still waiting for rico alvarez to sign on with three fouls to erupt in the second half but you know definitely blue becomes you today i must say that you were wise to wear blue here today  laughter oh yes i i 've to think about the uh situation of the laughter i have to blend with your group  laughter okay okay but uh this game is being fought so ferociously by both sides uh uh the foul trouble might be the key and the free throw shooting might be the areas where it could spell the difference oh sa free throw shooting for example sev 'no it 's uh eighty-nine percent by la salle they made seventeen points on nineteen tries while ateneo only made ten out of eighteen from the free throw line that could spell the difference right now it 's the difference in the first half in terms of defense both have tried to draw the press uh yeah ateneo managed to break it la salle also managed to break it sino ang matibay ang resistensya might be also a difference here in the game uh la salle we 're looking at two point guards only for la salle it 's uh mike cortez and eric arijola with matching joseph yong for uh de la salle cholo villanueva the other rookie is not playing today for ateneo l a tenorio would certainly be the difference for ateneo  ateneo is a different team without l a tenorio i mean uh they do move a little better the fluidity is there yes but they 're you 're so correct they are not the same team when tenorio is down on the bench because of three personal fouls yes because they 're confident that tenorio can bring down that leather unlike when they pressed gimko and tanchie there 's really a very good chance that they might lose the ball from the back court so if tenorio uh watches his fouls and gets to play on the court majority of the second half i think ateneo will be okay by the same token la salle is a different team when ritualo has to sit down on the bench we take a look at some of the significant numbers we take a red ballpen you 're the teacher here also and we circle some important numbers my friend well both of us uh belong to the academe sev so laughter i don't have a monopoly of the title professor here laughter  okay thirty-six percent shooting for la salle but today they atoned for that uh eighty-nine percent free throw shooting that 's actually fifty-six percent and eighty-nine percent free throw shooting ateneo did better from the field but only shot ten of eighteen from the free throw line ateneo had one rebound better but the turnovers it favored de la salle forty turnovers committed by the ateneo and only eight for de la salle jolly paz we mentioned earlier was thinking about quickness the pace of the ballgame  it looks like it does favor la salle when it 's wide open court basketball that 's where ritualo likes it and that 's where tenorio likes it but it 's just that he cannot stay on the floor for long  oh  oh yes that 's that 's that 's correct sev about uh about la salle 'no they want open baske  they have the men to do that  for ateneo they 're just feeling it the strength of ateneo is still rich alvarez and rico villanueva unfortunately rainier has not yet hit his stride membrere only fonacier i recall and tenorio has hit shots from the three-point area they need a lot more to free up the uh play offensively for rico and rich downstairs and just for the information of everybody i also brought a green shirt just in case  i knew that this was going to be the la salle side speaker b laughs  you also have your green shirt with you oh yes uh just to make sure for insurance sev in the meantime the uh blue babble battalion is on the floor right now with their all-halftime palabas  this is just getting better and better year after year oh yes the way uh and some people say that we 're the only teams just la salle and ateneo i hate to say we 're words   wala e 'kala mo nagkuwentuhan lang 'no  in fairness to our other members in the broadcast panel la salle and ateneo they 've stuck to the tradition of cheers while the other cheerers really you 're a the real cheer leader yourself sev words  long time ago but la salle and ateneo they 've stuck with the tradition of cheering and that 's what the u a a p is all about and the big thing that has developed here is because because these two universities which became co-educational some time in the seventies have now accepted that women are part definitely of the halftime palabas and i think rightfully so in fact the ateneo palabas right now even has their grade school cheer leaders on the floor right now  so it is the whole uh community so to speak  laughter that 's right and uh it 's a good thing for ateneo really to have the the women also participating in their cheering squad okay and uh you 're very nice to me today i noticed in the uh meantime talking about community we have for the ateneo blue eagles patty laurel with this gentext update take it away patty update from patty  thanks a lot patty and uh it is indeed up to the ateneans to bounce back because la salle they are not just going to give away this game and their championship they 're looking for number four no question about it they 're gonna work very hard for that and the same with ateneo ateneo wanted to break into the championship 'no  they 've been in the final four for a couple of years now and you know this could be the big year for them and and i i 've anticipated you know  we missed the la salle ateneo dream match-up last year f e u got in the way but so many teams wanted that and i think hard work would really be the the point for all the teams here in the sixty-fourth u a a p what are the other teams seeing here like u s t i see uh some players and some of the coaches from f e u and u s t what are they seeing here well one it 's a different la salle team that they 're looking at uh it 's it 's becoming a renren ritualo show eighteen points for renren ritualo and i think that 's gonna be one factor that franz pumaren may be happy at this point but be unhappy later on because you have the countdown on renren ritualo he can can't score eighteen points 'no la salle would not want him to do that for ateneo it 's becoming terrible for the other teams because they now have the last piece of the puzzle which is a point guard 'no  it 's just a matter of time before rico and rich alvarez combine together and really make the defense very difficult against ateneo because he 's gonna scatter the entire defense  we have the outside game of tenorio and uh and rainier sison complementing alvarez boguia and uh villanueva inside that 's three and four positions seems to be at at ateneo 's advantage in this game at the point  and at the four position la salle seems to have the clear edge in the game at least if we take out tenorio from the equation of course yes of course but uh tenorio 's part of the equation we could only take him out if he has more than uh if he commits his fifth foul or fourth foul early in the third period but ateneo would need to start tenorio in the third quarter  it 's very pivotal for ateneo but of course tenorio would have to watch out 'no he wanted an exciting ball game 'till the end sev and our full schedule of games we will be presenting majority of the games in the course of the u a a p season and i 'm sure the other teams will see this is the level not just because it 's ateneo and la salle but the level in which they must play to be able to go up against these two teams noise  it 's clear they 're watching the game between la salle and ateneo  of course everybody every team in the u a a p wants la salle 's head  they 're the defending champions they don't want to make another uh occasion wherein u s t in the nineties bagged the four consecutive championships the rest of the teams they don't want that to happen to la salle of course la salle wanted it for ateneo it 's been a long time since eighty-seven and eighty-eight for danny and company that they wanted i wonder who the center of that team was as speaker b laughs you take a look at director fritz infante who uh helped direct our opening palabas also and there of course well ateneo la salle he 's on the la salle side of the the floor but you 're right about the other aspect uh the big alumni so to speak yung mga in government politics and business they 're all around and all the pretty girls from a different time a different era speaker b laughs  my classmates are here they they 're my batch from high school seventy-four they said uh to kill you but i said you 're a nice guy really but you know uh they said uh can you at least try i have an atenean father so laughter he 's high school fifty-four partner  laughter so that neutralizes the whole thing okay i told you he 's a very nice guy in the meantime chuckle forty-seven the bob novales formula say the score when you 're too happy forty-seven to forty-one laughter is is the count as we begin the second half of play we are so glad you could join all of us here today in this very special presentation on studio twenty-three u a a p sixty-fourth season second day of competition yes i believe we have to jump again noise wow tall line-up together with cortez and ritualo ritualo circles around a huge pick by ramos finds himself open gets a good look unable to sink it noise   even renren ritualo in a pre-season interview said nag-iiba din ang laro niya 'pag ateneo la salle  oh yes ibang-iba yung level that was a plain steal ritualo is gone any markers for renren ritualo noise  and that was sort of expected when you have ritualo if you can bottle him up maybe it will help your cause in the meantime here comes membrere across the time line applies the breaks sison sends it over to uh tenorio in the meantime rico villanueva got a foul from santa maria doubling up on rico villanueva noise third foul on uh adonis and that 's a clear smart zed steal smart zed the power to live the life you choose smart zed your telephone now noise  it 's enrico villanueva outside to membrere 1 word connection with tenorio there in the meantime there 's a foul  la salle will have another and that is on michael reyno second team foul now for uh la salle  it' s a difficult match-up for vainio he 's covering uh rainier sison vainio used to play the foreign five in high school but he has to contend with somebody like rainier sison  and from the outside he moves very well from the outside  na magalaw   oo oo  there 's alvarez altering his pace drives hard loses his control of the ball santa maria was not exactly going to give him an open lane but look at this tenorio with a heist up up up and away that 's gonna make cortez think about dribbling in front of tenorio noise  tenorio may be feeling right now i 'm on a bit of borrowed time and the coaching staff i 'm sure told him huwag kang susundot pag alanganin  cortez managing to get it to santa maria santa maria starts his drive to the basket blocked by villanueva but there 's a foul prior to that block ouch we missed george during halftime now we would get an opportunity to chat with george in this gentext update update from george  excellent report uh george and of course i 'm not surprised that la salle is a bit worried about what tenorio can do as far as damage to their cause is concerned if la salle doesn't figure it out he could be this big in his first game in the u a a p noise  here 's rich alvarez seeing his wide opening unable to fill in that gap decides to slow down membrere switches it over to tenorio who cuts up the inside but to no avail noise   rico villanueva can't get to it he 's beaten to the punch that time by ramos
