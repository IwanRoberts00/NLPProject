so can you give me a brief account of your family and educational background okay uhm educational background i just finished law school in the states and i passed the minnesota bar and i trained in the u s  uh uh  you 're gonna be working here or  uh  yeah i 've come back for good na  and i 'm hoping to take the bar again next year for the philippine bar after petitioning the supreme court 'cause they might not let me take it after a few years there uh uh  word  yeah in the family i 'm the ninth words i was the baby before my nephew came laughter   yeah   and you are so you 've been away for how many years three years three years out in illinois 'no  yeah two years in illinois then i spent my last year in minnesota uh so i 'm here to ask you about your dad i 'm doing it for my thesis so you 're not working yet 'no you just finished uhm i 'm i 'm a researcher at free legal assistance group the flag office uh huh uhm since i can't take the bar until next year what word until i can so i 'm doing legal research for flag uh so now you 're you 're a lawyer and your dad was a lawyer did he influence you in any way yes laughter   words  i think i 've i 've i 'm not sure i wouldn't have been a lawyer if it weren't for dad i always started out saying no i 'm going to be an artist no i 'll be an archaeologist i don't want to become a lawyer i always said no i don't wanna be a lawyer and uh it seemed that everywhere i turned it would always end up with me going back in the direction of law school oh and he was a big influence it was something i knew would make him really happy if i did go to law school did he ask you did he ask you no  but you could sense it  no yeah yeah 'cause when i told him that one time that i had decided to okay for sure i 'm going to law school he was really really uh that 's good   that kind of tone of voice  uh  and i knew he was really really happy so that that was the big influence part words it was nice to make him feel laughter  i felt he he really wanted me to go 'cause i 'm the only girl who 's gone through law school although cookie probably knows more about the law than i do 'cause she worked again with him practically but uh i 'm the only one who really went through formal training  uh   uh-huh yeah  uh so how old were you before you he formally went into politics that was around nineteen no i was born in nineteen sixty-four i think around four years when he was already starting so you have no memory of him aside outside you know his political life before that i mean before he was really into the limelight so what do you remember most about him you know his being a family man  uh what do you  uh he was always around to talk to he liked to read uhm uhm we liked to read the same books so we read the same books   yeah  we 'd always go to bookstores  he was fond of reading   i think that was i think our main activity he 'd come up he was tired of work and i would be home from school he 'd say c 'mon let 's go to the bookstore so we 'd all go together and you uh and then we 'd be reading the same books so it would be fun it could be a family outing and when i was a kid he liked to take a lot of photographs yeah that was one of his major hobbies so i have lots of since i was the baby at that time i was one of the favorite subjects laughter  so if you look at the family albums there 're lots of pictures of me  lots of pictures of you interesting so he liked photography 'no  what about his uhm his his what do you call this his writings i know that he he also liked to write especially during his detention  he liked to write a lot  yeah  for each us like there was a time when he was in solitary confinement and there wasn't anything he could do he would pray the rosary and he would make a poem and that was all i mean he couldn't they weren't allowing him any access to books or the radio or what so he would just think and he would make a poem and then when we finally got to see him about a month after he 'd told us all the poems he 'd memorized them completely and he had one for each of us and we 've kept all his letters from prison every birthday 'cause he couldn't really buy anything or make any uh buy anything for us he would either like i have a kit he had this model of a cinderella coach  uh   it it 's more a pump with uh with water and at the background there 's the cinderella coach and those would be his gifts he 'd make crafts ahh and then always the letters and if he couldn't make anything it 'd be one of the roses he grew in his tiny garden and always a letter how does it affect you personally 'cause you were very close to him 'no  i think you 're yeah i was laughter  yeah i was the baby for awhile until my nephew came laughter  by that time i was happy not to be the baby because i was in high school already uh huh but okay good somebody else now uhm you know the way i thought was really influenced by what he did i only realized it when i got to high school 'cause i would talk about things with my classmates that they never saw and we all when i went to assumption and it 's true the convent walls are really high uh uhm laughter  you there 's nothing you don't see anything of the outside when you get out of san lorenzo village so you end up thinking yeah this is probably the world so when i would talk with my friends about what was going on they would say uh yeah uh yeah that 's interesting but they never really saw so he really he really influenced you in thinking 'no about the world and everything  yeah  yeah about what was going on that there was something more than just within the four walls of the house or within the thick walls of the school there were other people and and that 's why i al i became a lawyer i think it was there is always the desire to serve and i saw how much work he did and it 's nice to be able to you know help continue what he did what about you know when he went into detention after that how would was he changed in any way i mean emotionally aside from physically ha  it it was a big change 'cause when he went in nineteen seventy-two i was eight years old and mom was very worried about the situation so she pulled us all out of school except for the ones in college we all studied at home for two or three years three years yeah two years then i only went back to school in grade four so i think i took part of grade two and part of grade three it was maya who was teaching me 'cause at that time she was getting her education degree so she would tutor me and uhm so it was a big change in our quality of friends and there was that thing you know your father is under detention so it really didn't affect my friends i don't think their parents ever told them don't play with her or what there was no change in that but i just felt that knowing you were you had a different family life kind of it sets you apart and the nuns would kind of look out for us  uhm   uh uhm  uh yeah yeah i always felt that you know we were always watched wherever laughter  uh huh they made sure we were doing okay uhm and 'cause we would also have i think we started having masses in the house and words  but what about his attitude you know was he did he feel that he was weaker you know his spirit i mean it made him go did it change him in any way he wanted to to serve for yeah i think it it really strengthened his resolve to do something but before that he was really more of a politician  i think i mean this is thinking back 'cause when i was growing up i really didn't think about it that much uh uhm uhm before i think he was a traditional politician you know he went to the senate although he would talk to people and help them as much as he could when he got out of prison it was a deeper commitment to really really serve because he went through a lot he wasn't a politician anymore and he didn't have to go to the senate or what he really went into lawyering seriously he would travel all over and for him it was i think this is what he always said that he was treated very well while he was under detention and he knew that other people weren't uh uhm and but for him he i think he really hated the experience of being confined yeah and he said if it was that bad for me i was treated pretty well i had my own room they 'd never tortured me what about the people who were tortured they couldn't afford legal help and that 's what really pushed him to start the free legal assistance group flag and really get into it but ahmm what about his family life he was very busy 'no after after this he always had time for everybody  yeah  not as much uhm uh we used to laugh i used to say that i saw more of him when he was in prison than after laughter  but all of us i don't know we took it in stride because we all understood i think he he al he made us understand which is what i appreciate it that you know he explained what he was doing uh-huh so we never really resented the fact that he wasn't around and when he was around it would always be fun uhm meal times were great you know you would all sit down yeah and we would talk politics we would talk about what was going on you know it was a more than just the how was your day like that did you hear about this what did you think of that that was your special time right during meal time probably you were all together yeah we all liked to eat too laughter  and okay so what about family gatherings you know did you have any reunions or anything always birthdays dad 's birthday mom 's birthday   and the whole family would be there yeah and christmas 'cause by that time some were married or some had lived separate words for a time they 'd live with us mench lived in bacolod for a while and she had a separate house but always for birthdays we 'd be together so what what happened there and what would you do you know uh oh i don't think we ever really had any gathering that was just really family he had a really public life he liked people and people really liked him so every time it would be his birthday friends would always drop by and it was always like the extended family i mean the only times would really be i don't think we had any really family gatherings just the family except when he was in prison always after that it would be a gathering of lots of friends and he 'd just circulate and go on everybody would just be talking uhm the kids by that time we had escaped chuckle  they used to make all the girls sing all the children sing and dance  uh uhm   okay  so by that time the nieces were growing up and the nieces and the nephews were there so it was their turn already there would always be a short program for whose ever birthday it was and yes a lot of eating drinking and laughing so he was very i can say that he was very viva person he enjoyed a lot uhm   yeah  so now we go to his uh he got sick right again sick how did this affect you your relationship with him when he it was really it was really hard to believe the first few years because he had always really just been going on and i thought nothing could really faze him i think the only time he had gotten really sick was he had a bypass in his early seventies and then in prison he got really really thin but it was hard to think of him getting sick  uhm the usual case it only really started showing i think in eighty-six before although he would go for treatment he still had hair laughter  uh uhm  and he would still go around in eighty-six he was appointed to the committee on human rights and i was his confidential secretary at that time and like there were fact-finding missions he wa he was scheduled to go and we couldn't go because he was too ill and that was the only time we really saw it how did that affect him as a person did he say i 'm sick and you know i 'm i 'm just gonna give up now no i think he he tried to fight it as much as he could uhm like he would uh he would promise like he would you know get up on certain days and in fact uh i have a notebook of his i got it after he died 'cause he said he had his penmanship really suffered he had great penmanship and when he got sick he couldn't write it wasn't as clear and he told himself he was going to learn how to write again so he asked me to buy him one of the you know those writing notebooks with the blue line the red line the blue line and i got it after he died 'cause i said mom you know can i have this so i thought it hadn't been used until i noticed at the bottom corner of each page he had written a big a a small a a big d and he was he had full real intentions of practicing unfortunately i don't think he ever really got to the fourth page he was sick he got really tired when he was really really sick he got tired a lot  uh uhm  what about you how did you take this it was it was very hard it was hard to see him that way 'cause knowing how he had been the years before and how quick his mind was it was painful for me to see him like that so i knew it was probably painful for him though he never really said he never told us
