while you and your wife are in a business one day you come home you 've lipstick in your collar she gets mad chuckle  you say it 's your grandmother your grandmother passed away so she won't talk to you and she 's the only one who knows everything about one half of the business and there 's a problem there what do you do she won't talk to you confess these are some of the problems of having a family business and then what if she doesn't ever want to be a part of the business is that what you 're saying right that 's right  words the capital goes all right joining us in this segment is joey cuerdo he 's the owner of power up center for climbing and fitness and says friendship and family relationship should be given priority instead of business uhm also joining us is genevieve lim she 's the owner of zagu and says it 's better to avoid friends and relatives as business partners uh and then we have william leung owner of word restaurant it 's very good restaurant by the way thank you and says the business should be kept within intermediate uh immediate family members only and then also joining us is robert francisco owner of figaro good evening okay uhm your your business is it because of the nature of your business it 's a restaurant right yeah you try to keep the recipes within the family  secret   yes   oh okay  it 's secret so that 's that 's like tan long in in in san francisco it 's only the grandmother who knows yes aside from that is it is that is that the only advantage of keeping uh aside from that uh we do keep uh yeah the secret is uh it 's within the family you also underpay your relatives laughter  i hope not laughter  they would rebel uh what do you think uhm we we all know that after zagu a lot of other different kinds of pearl shakes have you know gone all over the place it 's really become a phenomenon but that 's because uh you broke up with your business partners right and then they set up their own yeah but besides them opening up there are a lot of people who got into it because of the fact that i guess investment is pretty small returns are good and it 's pretty easy to set up  right  uh uhm so a lot of people got into it you know having that thought in mind but is it is it uhm you don't recommend it to uh start a business with friends or relatives   well from my experience from your experience yeah then i 'm gonna say no  uh uhm but it can work out for other people but i think in general i mean i 've been hearing it even before i got into business not to get into business with friends but i never believed it uh uhm and in some ways someone has to go through it in order to believe it what what exactly happened uh with with uh your situation and your business   i guess it 's just differences uhm uh it 's just difficult if people don't wanna you gotta have an open mind hear people out uhm willing to uh hear like constructive criticisms and and move on  uh uhm  uh uhm yeah and joey you you you uhm actually have a business with yo with your wife right yeah you started out five years ago right uh yeah but prior to that uh we were already in business uhm after college when we went to uh what kind of business is this modules hand-outs oh okay uh we we went into that right after college and prior to that we were together for a while so when we went into business it wasn't really so difficult words   yeah to get to know yeah uhm of course you started with with your wife because well you know you both would have the same risks you don't have to pay each other anything laughter until the thing finally takes off words  no salaries yeah yes when you start a business it 's like that but what about when you when you i mean like every couple has their you know ups and downs right and when you have your downs isn't that difficult having a business together or is it because is is it more like a like your baby together that you have to really just put your differences aside and and be business partners  no  uhm well in our case because both of us are kind of strong uh strong headed uh uhm the when one believes in the other and e e sometimes we really end up uh arguing and it 's hard because like what um teddy said uh when she knows this half of the business and i know this half and we don't agree and we go uh you know we decide to to go separate directions   separate directions   words advantages that you can really shout at each other argue like hell but you know that neither of you is gonna break up the business oh yeah because it 's your future is there yeah oo  so probably with a with a stranger you can't be as open that 's true i think that 's true i believe also that uh constant a arguments or debates really opens up books and you can see all sides of the the the coin and maybe just not two sides but even the circular side of it you can really screen out and you know dig up all the flaws and if you 're relatives right and you you know it 's okay to really open up so like like s m robinsons rustans like these are big the the these are family-owned businesses as well   right correct  uh well that does it mean it 's better to start your business with with family so that you end up being a big corporation like that i mean really successful like that it 's easy to keep the secret inside actually   yeah uh okay because you become very protective and you only share probably what what uh my uh seatmate over here would say they keep the secrets to what they really want uh uhm and let out only what has to be let out uh uhm and therefore if it 's a family corporation you sometimes really can control there are some bad sides here that you become extra-emotional when you make decisions uh uhm but then again like you said i think earlier when you 're more of a powerful corporation you can easily buy or hire a professional manager  but don't uh but don't you find that that uhm there 's also a limited range of of ideas and and and you know when you feel the idea needs to evolve  actually  when it 's with the family there is always a clash of ideas it 's all the same people 'cause like like us we are brothers and sisters uh so we have the same ideas but different application so that 's why we always clash but you know it 's good in the end that you find you find comfort that you you still have a brother and a sister with you to run the business you didn't start the business with uh with family right you started with friends i started with friends yeah and uhm did you think it was uhm necessary to start first with friends even if you had bad experiences later on you couldn't have done it without friends well i think i could have but ideally i wanted to work with my friends you know work together be all in one place and put in the long hours in the beginning right yeah but uhm it just didn't work out the way i wanted it to be and instead of prolonging it when we realized that we couldn't work together we just had to part ways rather than going on and then you know i believe you have to whatever you feel say it don't keep it in your like don't keep it and let it build up inside you have to express how you feel but but when you had when you had this business with friends you owned the entire company then  open communication  no i didn't you did not no uh  you had to buy them out   you had to buy   i had to buy them out later on it was offered to me just because i was the one who brought back the idea and they feel they have to offer it to me first uh uhm before like it 's offered to someone else right  words yeah did you have that in an in an agreement you know uh pre-emptive right uhm not really   words  it was just an understanding we had a meeting we called a meeting and they all agreed that i think it 's best that it was offered to me 'cause i owned like majority of the the corporation yeah uh uhm fifty percent so what about like uh drawing the line when does that like family businesses how do you do that with you have a restaurant and it 's all your brothers and sisters they 're running it i mean is it easy to fight with them because they 're your brothers and sisters yes when we were young our our parents instilled in them that i should be the  the kuya laughter   i 'm the eldest right so when arguments arise you know they would in the end they would respect my opinion and it it it works out that way i guess most of the quarrel is whether to expand or it 's a good thing let 's not lose let 's not put in any more money to expand it and then lose it all   actually the fight normally starts either when you 're losing money or when you 're earning too much money that 's where the differences come in yeah okay well we 're gonna take a break here on points of view stay tuned we 'll be right back commercial break  okay welcome back to points of view  the question that we 're gonna ask in this segment is why is it that pinoys love to get into business first with family and friends why why why do they need to have these people around them what do you think it is you have a business with your friend right family family also   right  i thought it was your it 's not with friends only family  no  family okay well our reason is probably because of security comfort and you know you don't wanna make your mistakes uh uhm and it 's so much easier to correct your mistakes among family uh you know now how many how many people in your family is part of the business are all your brothers do you have brothers and sisters we have seven partners are all related uh uhm uh so they 're not all immediate no  pinsan  direct direct direct uh first cousin like two first cousins and uh three direct my brother and my sister and the rest are and are there any brothers and sisters you have there that are not a part of it yes why why didn't you uh words you know by the time we incorporated the the the caf&eacute; or the store figaro two of them were not in the country then uh uhm it was just us you know we had a very very bonded family barbecue every sunday so but did you ask them to join in this thing you know uhm they 're most welcome when we have some expansion program we invite them first and foremost right okay  they get first option of course  well that 's good  that 's good uhm how about with your wife are are there any other people in your business now involved   well actually we hired a lot of friends friends okay   uh from school and uhm i think we got them because uh well our business it requires a lot of uh skills uh skill and the people we needed their skill actually who were we used to climb with uh uhm when we were in college uh uhm but what happens if you if uh you know you get into have a falling out and something like that and uhm you need to fire someone that 's in your business actually uh we 've gotten close to that already uh yeah   a very good friend uh uh actually the first option that we had was uh not fire but uh lie low uh uhm uhm save the friendship  it was actually uh it was actually a move to to save what we used to cherish in the day you know  uh uhm  uh uhm or if it 's an employee he 's out when you words  yeah because someone you just someone who hired espes uh someone who applied actually for a job so what happened so what happened after i mean after he lied low  it was  uh it was painful  mga matagal na  we had a big debate so are you saying like pare you should resign or something like that no no laughter  no but but it 's normally the way it happens 'pag among kaibigan  you normally ask the closest friend to talk to him yeah as a warning  oo  then you know eventually if it still persists then you know you tell him the board is already recognizing your flaws for example then you know as a warning you know already but should it happen do you give do you give more chances is it hard to but do you give more chances oh yeah yeah you give more considerations you give third fourth fifth chance  super lenient  yeah  but i wanna ask you this is it hard to uhm okay fine you have the these uh warnings or whatever right uhm you give memos out also you do that i mean no no no not among directors i suppose you don't do that but normally in directors' meeting uh uhm what i would probably anticipate is you know you open up and put out your mistakes or you lay out this happened in this outlet this is what 's happening right now in the in the business and uh uhm we see that there 's a a weak point here and of course who 's responsible for this
