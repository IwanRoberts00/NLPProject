this to be as casual as possible and later on i 'm opening the floor to whatever questions you might have or whatever questions you might want to ask me i don't want it to be you know like a forty-five minute talk on just you know a one-sided talk i want it to be you know like what it says you know a dialogue first of all i 'd like to introduce myself i 'm gary valenciano and the reason why i wanna do this is because sometimes or most of the time people say you know and now here he is without any further introduction but actually there 's a lot of things i 'd like to share with you i 'd like to give you a little background on who gary valenciano is first of all i 'm uh the sixth of seven in the family there are two boys and five girls uhm i 've been a la sallite since nineteen seventy-one i studied in the states in nineteen seventy-nine and i came back in nineteen eighty and i entered uh la salle greenhills again in nineteen eighty-two i joined the kundirana la salle greenhills choral group and it was the beginning it was the start of a new chapter in my life that has been going on since then nineteen eighty-three i entered de la salle taft and uhm it was also in nineteen eighty-three that i turned professional in my singing career nineteen eighty-three also was the year where i met my wife angeli and uh that 's also another chapter that has been going strong ever since then in nineteen eighty-four i did my first movie and uh which was entitled hotshots and i did my first uhm major concert entitled gary v live at the araneta coliseum and then nineteen eighty-five uh well nineteen eighty-four also introduced reaching out into the airwaves nineteen eighty-five i joined the tokyo music fest and di na natuto came out in nineteen eighty-six paano huwag mo na sanang isipin uh and take me out of the dark uh started being played eighty-seven eto na naman  eighty-eight was a u s tour and a u s album that i recorded eighty-nine take me out of the dark again was uh aired notice 'no from eighty-six to eighty-nine it was only in nineteen eighty-nine that take me out was really played on the airwaves in nineteen ninety uhm the songs look in your eyes and each passing night and songs like that came out and major impact was staged uhm in nineteen ninety-one i had the privilege of performing for the very first time uh at the amphitheater in los angeles i recorded another album this time in japan under toshiba e m i records to be released on june of nineteen ninety-two and you know i can go on you know i 'm telling you all the wonderful things that i 've gone through now some of you may ask how does gary v do it or some of you might have you know why is gary v telling us you know giving us all this information about what he has accomplished well definitely this is not being shared with you to impress you with the things that i 've done because frankly speaking this was not done by me you know this was all just given to me it is my way of revealing to you the secret of my success and maybe impress you with the one who has given me all this and much much more for one who never used to dance or write music or play any instrument you know like me and received you know and yet received all this one cannot help but say to all who wonder and who care to listen that one that the one who takes full credit is christ jesus himself and no other he has been the sustaining force behind all of what you see and hear of me today he is the rock that my family is built on he is the one who has put me and my wife together and the one who will keep us together through all the ups and downs that life has to offer he is the one who has given me my music he is the rhythm of my soul and he is the one who has given me my fans and my friends like you and he is the one who has come not just for people like me but for you as well and i guess this is what you 've always heard of gary v you know uhm uh having this kind of relationship with the lord but i can go on and on and on talking about it but i know that there are questions in some of your minds about my faith about the industry about uh what the future is for gary v about what the future is for the industry and that 's why i 'd like to open up the floor you know for you to ask any question i want you all to treat this like not uy you know we 're getting to meet gary v but  i mean i 've been around for nine years now and i just want you to treat me like the way you treat any friend of yours you know if you have any question just ask i 'm opening up the floor now we 've got enough time and uhm then later on you know uhm if it would be possible i 'd like to you know render you with one number clapping  but before laughter but before that but before that uh i just wanna say one thing uhm you know when i entered show business in nineteen eighty-three there was no expectation of lasting this long in show business because excuse me because to be honest with you i never really used to sing when i used to sing uh in nineteen seventy-nine i used to sing over i mean hindi pa uso ang minus-one when i was in the states and it was a very traumatic experience for me when i lived one year in the states that i got to listen to the kind of music that i believe has molded my music today and i was singing over the voices uhm that was already recorded and so i 'd send it home to my sisters and my father and i 'd say hey listen to my tape and they couldn't hear my voice you know uhm obviously because i was singing i didn't have the technique and the style yet but i came back in nineteen eighty you know and i entered de la salle i mean i entered la salle greenhills kundirana in eighty-two and still you know there was no expectation there was no dream of becoming a singer or a performer there was no idea in my mind there was no there was no uh uh picture of of gary v performing on a stage like one that you 'd see in uh at the ultra or at the araneta coliseum there was none of that and i never used to play keyboards as a matter of fact i still don't know what i play i just play and obviously this is not again 'no this has not come out of my own doing because i don't practice every day i just you know when i when i dance it just comes out with the help of my choreographer from the maneuvers who you all know and these things uh honestly i don't you know when i come out on stage i don't think okay i 'm gonna do this in this part i 'm gonna do this in that part it it just happens and that 's why i cannot contain myself from sharing with you the reason and the secret of my success so if there 's any question that any of you would like to ask you know i 'm i 'm open to any  don't be shy if there 's anyone who 's supposed to be shy it 's supposed to be me 'cause i really don't come up and talk like this not often at least you know but i 'm talking to uh fellow la sallites and for me that 's the hardest crowd to uh relate to i don't know why but i always feel that way  okay okay the question is did i did i ever have any formal voice lessons no i never had any voice uhm uhm professional vocal training all i remember was in the kundirana we 'd rehearse from six to nine every night including exam week and i guess that gave us the not the not the the the technique or anything like that because i think each singer was able to develop his own but because of that training every night from six to nine there were nights i 'd come home i wouldn't have a voice and my my father would be so alarmed what 's happening to you and all that but it helped later on you know now i can really go days on end you know with hardly any rest and yet perform maybe not a hundred percent but i still have the voice here a question was asked  yes laughter  i know you go ahead a question was asked  i 'm sorry you can go ahead you can use the mike student asks  what made me turn to god actually actually there was no intention to look up and to turn to god because there was no need to at that time so i thought this all happened in nineteen eighty-five and in nineteen eighty-five some people consider it to be still my biggest hit 'no uh di na natuto came out that song was played in the airwaves for more than seven months and was on the charts for more than six months and i felt because of all that i had gone through in life prior to this point i felt wow for the first time i did something on my own and really there was no you know it was like i looked up and i said yeah okay i know you 're there but hey i did this on my own so you know you can just leave me now i 'll be okay and if i need you i know you 're there for me it was that kind of a god that i had pictured in my mind someone who i could just run to when i had problems i didn't realize that he was there from the very very beginning even through all the trials now just to give you some trials that i 've gone through  in nineteen seventy-nine like many of the kids today like many of all of you like many of you rather well some of you rather might have family problems and might have homes that are separated that 's exactly what happened to me in seventy-nine it was also in nineteen seventy-nine when i discovered that i had diabetes i came back and in nineteen eighty-one my house in makati burned but that was a blessing in disguise 'cause i moved to san juan and there was a piano there and i again would practice two hours every morning not knowing what i played you know just this sounds good and that sounds good
