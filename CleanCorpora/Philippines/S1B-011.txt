chapter thirteen which is uh the chapter the uh we 're trying to find out whether the principal teachings of christianity starting with uh creation which we finished last meeting and salvation which we also finished right
""
uh now we come to the question or teaching on the kingdom of god
""
and eventually uh no no ahead of that we will have the question of sin love and sin
""
alright now let 's go first to love because that 's actually the uh ahead of the kingdom of god
""
we have already defined uh the love we are talking about is wishing and doing sometimes not doing what is really good for another for the beloved okay
""
and we said also that loving is not in the heart but it is in the in the will huh which in psychology you will call our affective part affective faculty affective with love  'no  that 's the will while that which pertains to the mind or to the intellect uh we call it
""
you don't remember
""
cognitive cognitive for knowing
""
okay so you have cognitive
""
this corresponds to what we call here as intellect and we have here what we call the will
""
and both of them are aspects of what we call rationality
""
your being rational means you have intellect
""
you have a will
""
the will for loving intellect for knowing okay and the all the physical organs including the heart they simply manifest uh what we have in our uh mind or what we call intellect or will
""
""
sir question
""
""
uh yeah
""
""
sir how come sometimes like when you don't want or how do you explain uhm people who want to fall out of love yet they can't help but still be in love with the person
""
""
uh uh fall out of love and you 're still in love
""
""
yes
""
""
in the first place   christianity tells  us we should love everybody
""
""
 they 're emotionally attached  
""
""
you should love me  laughter 
""
that is what christ said
""
and i should love all of you
""
but you see this is love has different degrees you know
""
so here you have a zero you have one hundred degrees
""
you love your boyfriend or girlfriend almost boiling point right  laughter 
""
uh you love all men
""
that is a command of god uh
""
love everyone including your enemies
""
right
""
now where will you locate them
""
this is the area of love
""
somewhere here is the area of non-love huh no love no love huh
""
you may say hate or whatever huh no love
""
uh there is by the way a an area where you are neither hot nor cold   uh 
""
""
 indifferent  
""
""
indifferent
""
and what does the psalm say  because you are neither hot nor cold i will vomit you out of my mouth  you know
""
a symbolic way of saying if you are indifferent you 're out  'no 
""
so uh all men should be located in this uh scale  the teacher writes on the board  right
""
our definition of love by the way fits your sweetheart and fits your parents fits your friends
""
it 's the wishing and doing sometimes not doing what 's good for another  right
""
sometimes not doing  uh or something something huh
""
now you have to do what 's good you know
""
you know to do what 's good
""
uh but is love always doing
""
not necessarily  'no 
""
love is not always doing
""
uhm i know what your difficulty there
""
you are connecting not doing with what is good right
""
""
yes
""
""
you put you place it in  ano  in the context there is uh always doing something is not necessarily a sign of love
""
always doing something for another is not necessarily uh a sign of love
""
for example okay uh you said you love me and you will uh uh do things for me okay
""
uh let 's go to bed
""
oh no no things like that right
""
you 're not doing you 're not
""
you are abstaining from uh anything you know
""
so so there are cases where you will not have to do it
""
what we are trying to uh emphasize also is that love is not just wishing
""
they said hell is full of people who were always wishing to do good but they never actually did good
""
any student in la salle always wishes to get to study harder but not everybody actually studies harder not all those who are wishing would be studying harder okay
""
so uh this is where uh we are supposed to put all people
""
we have to love them huh we have to love them
""
and the real challenge of christianity is that we also love those people who we should be hating  right
""
 love your enemies 
""
and it is very difficult
""
but unless we forgive we will not be forgiven
""
and there are many things there in the bible which tells you that
""
and there are people who have actually uh done it
""
the classical example of a very recent saint saint maria goretti huh who was uh stabbed because she was resisting rape
""
and uh when she was dying uh the priest was called and the the first thing asked her is do you forgive your killer you know the one who stabbed you
""
because if she doesn't forgive neither will the priest give absolution
""
 hindi puwede 
""
as christ says you must forgive one another if you want to be forgiven by god
""
now when you forgive that 's already a sign of love right
""
sign of love
""
incidentally that man became the chief witness uh for the uh beatification and eventual canonization of saint maria goretti
""
he repented while in prison
""
he never got married
""
and uh eventually uh asked to be a gardener in a monastery
""
so the rest of his life was spent uh
""
it was like the second part of the life of mary magdalene right
""
second part of mary magdalene okay
""
so uh love
""
we have been talking about love love love
""
now what about sin  'no 
""
some of us think that sin is so far away  'no 
""
sin is only for priests or talk about sin when you take religion
""
but you see all these practices that are committed in our society for example kidnapping for ransom uh cheating on people with whom you uh sell things for example uh cheating in the construction business where you put inferior quality of wire and then sooner or later the house burns down due to faulty electrical wiring and all of these forms of cheating are considered sins right
""
so what is this
""
uh sin in the old  our father  is known as a trespass right
""
and a trespass means violation
""
violation of what violation of the law
""
violation of the law of what
""
of love
""
love of what
""
of god of fellowmen  the teacher writes on the board 
""
so that 's  ano  that 's the definition
""
very simple
""
anything that violates love true love okay is sinful 
""
so you disrespect your  par  if you love your parents you respect them right
""
when you disrespect them it 's a violation of love 
""
so we have that
""
now there are two theories that are rejected with regard to sin
""
some people say sin is  merely  subjective
""
it 's all in the mind huh it 's all in the mind
""
there is really nothing sinful
""
it 's all in the mind
""
there is no fault of such thing as pornographic it 's all in the mind you know
""
there is nothing as a lewd dance it 's all in the mind  'no 
""
lambada oh okay it 's all in the mind whatever it is  'no 
""
uh i steal your car
""
you accuse me of having uh committed uh a sin
""
no
""
you see it 's all in the mind you know
""
for me it 's good  'no 
""
i never do something which i think is bad
""
i always do something which i think is uh good
""
so the rapist thinks that what he 's doing is good
""
so why punish him for doing what he thinks is good if you believe in this thing that wrongdoing is all in the mind you know
""
the other one is an error of thinking that it is uh objective huh
""
objective and nothing subjective
""
in other words you have the objective norm of morality with its corresponding uh punishment for violation
""
so for example when you kill a man under the law that man must be punished either by capital punishment which is death or maybe by life imprisonment or number of years in jail or by firing squad or whatever
""
alright
""
you agree that that is the law
""
okay
""
suppose your five-year-old uh brother while at home with your mother finds the gun of your father
""
it 's loaded
""
so he gets it goes to your mother who is cooking in the kitchen and then you know he has seen many things in uh t v you know shooting playing around
""
then he shoots your mother
""
and your mother is killed
""
will you now say hey little boy you are guilty of matricide killing of one 's mother
""
now you will be brought to court and condemned to death electric chair
""
will you do that
""
   students answer in chorus  no 
""
""
why
""
because in judging the guilt of that person you just don't take the law like that
""
you have to consider the subjective condition of the person  right
""
some years ago there was a beautiful woman i don't know who she is who was found walking near the old international airport totally naked
""
under the law that is what do you call that public scandal
""
she could be charged of public scandal
""
in photography overexposure  laughter 
""
but you see it so happened that it seems that lady is a little bit out of her mind
""
so you can't put her to court and imprison her for uh what is that indecency or public scandal
""
so where do you bring her
""
you bring her to the mental hospital have her treated see
""
so what does this show
""
it shows that in sin there is uh sin implies an objective element which in other words is the norm of behavior and a subjective element
""
for example knowledge  consent
""
that is why if you remember your catechism oh what makes a mortal sin what causes a boy to commit a mortal sin
""
those of you who learned your baltimore catechism i think you learned your catechism under vatican two already
""
but before vatican two we would memorize and try to understand the so called baltimore catechism
""
oh what constitutes a mortal sin
""
very serious matter full knowledge full consent okay
""
full knowledge full consent
""
the little boy that the in the example i gave you has no full knowledge he doesn't know what he 's doing because he 's not yet in full use of reason 
""
and the uh young lady i told you about a while ago has no full use of his reason
""
he 's out of his mind okay
""
and so although there is an objective norm violated the two examples i gave you are not guilty of any sin okay
""
because uh they don't have this  clear enough
""
the moral norm is different from the uh uh what do you call this
""
uh legal civil law where you say  ignorance of the law excuses no one  right
""
 ignorance of the law excuses no one 
""
in uh moral theology eh true ignorance excuses you from moral responsibility
""
for example uh if you know or you think it is monday huh suppose you are in uh the mountain area you have lost track of the of the uh days
""
you have no calendar there for example
""
and you think it is sunday
""
and yet you treat that as though it were monday then uh let 's see
""
actually it is monday but you think it is sunday
""
if you work are you guilty of violating the sabbath rest or sunday rest
""
no huh
""
if you think it is if it is uh sunday it 's actually sunday but you thought it was monday and you work you don't violate
""
if it is monday and you think it is sunday and you  o  you observe the sunday rest then okay alright okay
""
so it must be true ignorance not feigned ignorance
""
""
even if it 's
""
""
you have tried to verify and there 's no way of verifying the what 's the true day okay then you have to depend on your conscience
""
""
sir does it come with a responsibility that you should be responsible enough to
""
""
yes but there are times when uh you err because as they say  to err is human  right
""
so there are times when you are in a position where it is impossible to get the correct information okay
""
alright so uh this is uh the meaning of sin and it is not something that is out of this world
""
no
""
all these things you read in the newspaper are sinful acts
""
sinful acts  words 
""
uh one thing i 'll tell you this the more love goes up  'no  and let 's say non-love huh uh non-love will naturally go down
""
uh non-love will entail a for example you know indifference uh 
""
and they have an effect on progress or development even physical progress
""
not just your uh progress in the non-physical area
""
for example i 'll give you this progress or development in a non-physical area
""
suppose uh at home all the members of the family they love each other okay
""
plenty of love there
""
then one day you go home and then say wow i got sixty in our test in codevel you know 
""
and if your brothers and sisters say okay we know you can get higher try again next time you know and so on and so forth
""
perhaps your spirit goes up and you resolve to study harder
""
but suppose your brothers and sisters say yeah  buti nga tanga ka e   laughter   wala  you know
""
you see that will not put you up right
""
so the same is true with this
""
for example respect all other 's property
""
is it here or here
""
where  you respect other 's property  is it here or here
""
it 's here
""
if you respect other 's property there will be no hold-ups
""
there will be no robberies
""
there will be no stealing
""
