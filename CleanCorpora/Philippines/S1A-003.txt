 uh  
""

""

""
""
 hay 'naku  sir  laughter 
""
you don't know people in la salle
""
""

""
""
 they are   very punctual
""
""
what is this uh  kwan  uhm
""
""
  council of deans 
""
""
 no when   when will we when we will meet
""
you said that twenty
""
""
seven to thirty-one is bad sir because that 's c l a week
""
""
uh uhm
""
""
is it very late already the third to the seventh anytime except tuesdays
""
""
uh in the afternoons
""
""
 oo  yes except tuesdays which is a good which is  also the bad day for you
""
""
yeah
""
no i don't think so
""
i told fe  that i 'm meeting you and brother andrew 
""
and uh  after talking it over with her  i said nobody will advise this in the philippine normal college and she said  well i accepted because uhm she is a good student  and you know fe seldom accepts to advise because
""
""
uh uhm
""
""
unless this student is very good
""
 but i thought you were resigning 
""
 oh no i will be like you even if i 'm i 'm not there anymore i 'd like to advise 
""
""
how nice
""
""
that 's what she said
""
""
uh uhm
""
""
and then when i told her that you are uhm you are uh up-to-date on the literature she said  we 'd better give it to tish 
""
""
uhm
""
""
so what we will do is to give it to both of you you 'll be  co   co  co-advisers
""
""
uh uhm
""
""
what i 'm interested in is the data
""
""
yes yes
""
""
i 'm
""
you know this girl teresita fortunato
""
""
yes
""
""
the one teaching here
""
""
yes she 's very good
""
""
uhm so i recommended her after uh she was in my class
""
""
 oo    yes yes yes 
""
""
 she was in my class twice  
""
i recommended her to brother andrew
""
""
uh uhm
""
""
 so why don't you send her  first send me some of her her uh term papers 
""
so i sent term papers to to him
""
then he said  okay i 'd like to interview her 
""
so she interviewed he interviewed her and uh got him hired got her hired
""
""
yes yes yes she 's valuable
""
""
she 's very good very good
""
you know  i don't know why the why people are so selfish
""
they don't want to discover people and help those you know who have promise and so on like that 
""
that was the defect of  william 
""
""
really
""
""
he had a certain selfishness
""
""
uhm
""
""
instead of helping people
""
""
because brother andrew and you are the primary examples of people who help     people     who seek out excellence     who are not threatened by excellence
""
""
 yeah  
""
 because  
""
 uhm  
""
""
no
""
but  william  is  william  somehow
""
""
how did that happen why
""
""
i don't know
""
yet he 's very bright
""
""
uh uhm very bright
""
""
 william  is very bright
""
""
yes yes yes
""
""
in fact i was the one who discovered  william 
""
how i discovered him is by accident
""
we both went to the philippine without my knowing we joined the philippine normal college at the same time nineteen sixty-two
""
""
is that right
""
""
july nineteen sixty-two
""
""
 o  
""
""
before i went there i had a conversation with ramirez the president
""
""
 o 
""
""
and uh orata the dean  because when they requested my services i was no i in fact the u p and  kwan  the request for my services after i came from abroad uh both came from the u p and from the p n c
""
""
uh uhm 
""
""
the  requ  request from uhm the late fred morales
""
""
 oo naku 
""
""
and then p n c from  kwan  so i went to p n c and uh because nobody said that the reason that they were not uh their people were uh not getting their degrees is that nobody were advised
""
and so i had the brilliant idea  which i thought was brilliant  of seeing to it  that i would be assigned  uhm and that all these people who were uh wanted to get their m a  after assigning their topics
""
we assigned we assigned somebody as the chairman and then some more some juniors some some relatively junior members of the faculty
""
so there we assigned five five advisers to every student three to five
""
""
wow
""
""
members of the faculty   all members  of the faculty
""
""
 my goodness  
""
uh-huh
""
""
all members
""
""
uh uhm
""
""
son of a gun
""
i found out  that many could teach but didn't know how to advise
""
