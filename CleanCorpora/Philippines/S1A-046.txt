""
hey i have a story to tell you
""
""
uhm what 's that  clears throat 
""
""
i got it from a magazine
""
well  it 's a distorted version of one of  the most  famous fairy tales
""
""
uhm
""
""
but i won't tell you what the fairy tale is  you 've got to guess
""
""
what 's that
""
""
okay  so  here it is 
""
there is this kingdom  see of course when you say kingdom there is a king and there 's a queen right
""
""
uh-huh
""
""
and it so happens that this king and queen they have this little cutie cutie pie baby
""
it
""
""
boy or girl
""
""
it 's a baby girl
""
""
okay
""
""
and  so during birth  the queen died  so natural tendency for a male the king remarried
""
so he married this  beautiful peasant woman
""
so the king and queen  and the new queen that is  they took care of the baby
""
uhm the queen kinda raised  the princess as her own
""
so for a while the   king 
""
""
 wait wait   wait is that cinderella
""
""
nah not cinderella    bad  guess
""
""
 okay  
""
""
okay so  the king and queen hey i said king and queen
""
there 's no king there 's no queen in cinderella  laughter 
""
""
but there 's a mother a stepmother
""
""
yeah but i never mentioned that they had two stepsisters with them
""
""
uh okay continue with your story
""
""
okay so  for a while the king and queen  were happy with their lives
""
so the kingdom was peaceful as in there was no war  no fighting etcetera
""
so the child grew up
""
the little princess she grew up to become very pretty
""
""
wait wait  where 's the prince
""
""
what prince 
""
""
do you think  clears throat  if there 's a princess so  there should be a prince
""
""
okay so the prince comes in later in her life
""
""
oh okay okay
""
""
okay so  the king  grew weak as the child grew up
""
do you get  what i mean okay
""
so the king started to age  so  as time went on as in years passed by the king became bedridden
""
""
what
""
""
bedridden as in  he couldn't do things for himself
""
he had to be in bed all the time have servants take care of him
""
""
paralyzed
""
""
sort of paralyzed
""
so he had  no she noticed scars all over the king 's body and stuff   break in the recording  and blah blah blah blah blah blah blah he knows stuff like that  break in recording  actually healed
""
but then there were lots of them all over his body
""
after a few months  the king died
""
so
""
""
uh
""
""
the whole kingdom was sorrowful because their king was already gone
""
""
so 
""
""
what 's that noise
""
""
i don't know
""
""
this building is too much
""
okay so  after the king 's death  of course the child the princess  the tendency of the child is to become  sad   because   her father is already dead right
""
""
 uh-huh   
""
uh-huh okay
""
""
so the the child the little princess she came to  the queen 's bedroom
""
""
uh uhm
""
""
so the queen understanding the situation that the child is in  she openly comforted the child
""
uhm she hugged the princess you know comforted her
""
but then  you know what happened
""
""
uhm what
""
""
well  the princess bit her
""
""
why
""
""
don't know  it 's just said in the story that the princess bit her 
""
and then you know what the princess did
""
""
what
""
""
well  she just sucked blood from the wound
""
""
the queen sucked blood from the wound
""
""
no the child
""
""
why  is she a dracula or something
""
""
i don't know  but then the child kept on sucking blood from  the queen 's wound
""
so the queen fainted at the sight that the  ch  the little child was sucking blood from her arm
""
so next morning  when the queen woke up uhm she was at the foot of her bed 
""
""
the queen
""
""
yeah  because she fainted right
""
so when she woke up she saw that there was a faint scar
""
""
where
""
""
at her arm where the little child the princess was sucking last night 
""
""
how old is that princess
""
""
the princess is about  fourteen fifteen  or sixteen
""
""
uh okay
""
""
so  when the queen saw that scar at her arm she was scared because she remembered that the the king remember the king
""
""
uh uhm
""
""
he had scars all over his body before he became bedridden
""
""
oh
""
""
so what she concluded was that the little child was responsible for the king 's death
""
so uhm  she steered clear of the princess
""
  she  
""
""
 wait   wait wait is the queen also bedridden by then
""
""
no
""
remember she was only bitten once
""
""
oh
""
""
so what she did was she stayed away from the princess
""
she tried avoiding avoiding the princess because she didn't want to end up like the king as in dead
""
okay so she barricaded her doors at night so that the princess couldn't get in and suck more blood from her
""
""
where did the princess go
""
""
well the princess stayed at her quarters at her bedroom of course
""
but then they always found these animals as in deers  uhm  little birds dead without  a trace of blood in their body left
""
""
okay
""
""
so one day  the queen  as scared as frightened as she was  because she has power like in   poligov   course code for politics and government 
""
""
 wait wait  wait that 's a fairy tale right
""
""
yeah  i told you it was a twisted version  okay
""
so one day    she  ord   
""
""
 oh oh   it 's raining
""
""
uh uh i hate the rain  because my  cupcake gets wet  'no 
""
okay back to the fairy tale okay so one day she ordered a huntsman to take the princess to the forest
""
""
uh uhm
""
""
because she has power right
""
""
uh okay
""
""
so so she ordered the huntsman to take the heart of the princess you know take it back to her after he kills her
""
""
you know i think i heard about that  you know the taking of the heart   and then 
""
""
 okay so   what fairy tale is it
""
""
i don't know  speaker b laughs 
""
""
uh you don't know  uh how can you be like that
""
okay let 's continue with the story
""
so the huntsman  of course he will do the job for a price     as in lots of gold jewelry
""
""
 uh uhm  
""
wait wait i know the  hunts  the huntsman   right  the huntsman didn't  get the heart of the princess
""
""

so the huntsman took the princess to the forest and then he did take the heart  and then  he brought it back to the queen and then the queen  well  she hung the heart  over her dresser
""
""
  she 's  so cruel
""
""
 so she 's  
""

""
so she hung the heart at her dresser and then  the funny thing  the horrifying thing is  the heart continued beating  even without the body
""
""
without a blood
""
""
without blood  it just continued beating and beating and beating for years
""
okay let 's go back to  okay so  the huntsman killed the princess right
""
so  there were  dwarfs who found the body of the princess
""
""
