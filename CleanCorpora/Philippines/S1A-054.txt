since we are all practitioners of meditation in our community  maybe it will be of interest to to discuss how we started or why we started the practice of meditation
""
 kuya  art
""
""
uh okay uh well i think uh basically uh  i wanted i was uh in the charismatic uh renewal and i uh wanted to search for something deeper as far as my prayer life is concerned
""
so uh one day i was in mass in magallanes and i saw an ad on a christian meditation retreat which uh uh made caught my interest and i decided to sign up for that retreat
""
and uh in that retreat uh fr lawrence freeman was the one who  start  who started to teach uh uh and share meditation
""
and it intrigued me and as far as ah i was concerned i wanted to see what it would do to me in my life  'no 
""
so i decided to practice that way of praying meditation
""
""
when was this   nineteen 
""
""
 this is   in nineteen ninety nineteen ninety eighty-nine or ninety and then uh i decided to tell myself uh i 'll do it for two months religiously as taught to me and see what it will do to me if it changes if i see a lot of changes in me then i 'd  con  i would continue to practice it
""
so after two months i realized that it was really giving me a lot of insights and a lot of uh depth as far as life was concerned
""
i started to see the other side of the coin so to say so to  s 
""
so uh  i decided to continue the practice until today
""
uh i 'm still practicing it for the last ten ten years  'no  and uh i still try to do it uh religiously twice a day
""
so i and i don't think i intend to stop because i see that it has really given me uh a lot of peace a lot of tranquility a lot of security uh uh and it has brought me closer i think to god and uh i 've come to know god uh the many aspects of god uh in this life
""
so uh i think it 's something that i will not give up and i consider it as my prayer time every time i meditate
""
i took aside this time and say this is god 's time so i devote twenty to thirty minutes in the morning and twenty to thirty minutes in the evening for this   so 
""
""
 that is   daily practice
""
""
that is my daily practice
""
""
but uh on the first time that you did the meditation did you have a guide or did you read books
""
how were you able to sustain two months of uh meditating on your own
""
""
uh uhm
""
""
uh did you go to fr lawrence or you mean just by this one talk you were inspired to do this all alone
""
you did not have community you did not have books
""
""
no uh nothing
""
""
uh uhm
""
""
it uh there was no organization yet at that time
""
there was no structure that was the first time fr lawrence gave a retreat here
""
it was a one day actually it was a one day not retreat but a one day recollection on christian meditation and uh i just told myself i 'll really do it for two months
""
and then uh later on i his books came along and i decided to buy some of his books and that 's what uh kept me in the journey
""
and after two months or three months i decided that uh i think there should be a group really that should start to share this and i realized that uh uh maybe about four months later someone called me and told me that they already have a group that had started in don bosco
""
so i decided to go there to don bosco and then as i started to sit and meditate in this group i also started to go out and try to share it with others
""
so then other groups started to come along the way
""
and that 's when christian meditation really started
""
""
uh  ho  how about our group what did you  when  wa  when was the group formed
""
""
well of course this is where we live  'no  and uh so with uh it was one of the earliest groups also formed
""
i decided to take along all my friends around me uh and share it with them
""
so this i think this group also started the same time in nineteen ninety
""
""
in my recollection  clears throat  it first started with uhm art 's trying uhm making an appointment in uh the parish in merville parish
""
uhm he asked the the parish priest then to if he could give a talk and after the mass after the six p m mass and so after the six p m mass he gave a talk and then we started putting out poster one or two at the church door and uh we or he was able to find the venue that was the   knights of columbus 
""
""
 knights of columbus  
""
yeah knights of columbus
""
""
and there were people and he we started uh just being there and then there were people who read the the poster or who would uhm or who heard his speech his his talk and they would uh go to this session and uh because it was happening weekly uhm shortly after we we started to experience a bonding uh among us
""
so we extended it a little bit more to cover uh bible sharing
""
so originally it started as a pure uh talk on meditation and experience of meditation and then later on as as the participants uh
""
""
grew
""
""
uh stayed on longer they they had a hunger for the word
""
and uhm so there was a suggestion that uh we read the the gospel and  bi  and share
""
""
but then you were already  kuya  manny you were you were already complete you were there 
""
""
well uh  in my case uh
""
""
actually uh excuse me actually even before it started in knights of columbus we already started here in south   admiral 
""
""
 south admiral   yeah
""
""
in the chapel and uh of course uh manny being one of my best friends i asked him to join us in the south admiral chapel  okay
""
and then it grew after maybe a month in south admiral chapel we moved to knights of columbus
""
""
the group uh grew bigger as dinggay was saying
""
some people saw it through the posters and uh some people were invited uh as the group became bigger
""
and then you know that was the time that we incorporated through a suggestion of a couple that we incorporated the bible sharing so that uh there 's also more bonding and more activity in that sense
""
""
you were all charismatics then
""
""
i was not
""
""
only  kuya  art
""
""
me and dinggay  oo 
""
""
well i 've always been you know i was not charismatic but i 've always been uh uh how do you say that a searcher you know uh i think ever since i was born i have been searching you know
""
uh even before the formal practice of christian meditation which i am doing now uh i started reading books on uh self knowledge uh self-realization
""
i went into the hindu scriptures
""
i read uh  bhagavad gita  and uh uhm another one i forgot  'no 
""
and i worked i dabbled into uh buddhist scriptures also and some theosophical books and i sort of toyed around with uh different forms of meditation
""
it was just that you know i could not sustain it because i was all alone and i was doing different forms
""
until you know uh i got to join this group also and then there was a sort of formal way or technique of doing it and uh there was this uh group that met once a week so it that 's helped sustain me you know until now
""
i still sit quite regularly
""
uh that 's about it
""
""
twice a day also
""
""
uh twice a day
""
sometimes well sometimes it 's once a day but i do do a lot of quiet you know
""
uhm for me meditation is not just simply just sitting  'no 
""
uh meditation is i think a way of life
""
in that sense  'no  uh it 's being aware of what i am doing
""
if i am eating i am just eating  'no 
""
totally there  'no 
""
if i am playing billiards i 'm just playing billiards  'no 
""
uh nothing outside that
""
so that for me is also a part of of the whole process of integration
""
that 's about it as far as i 'm concerned   break in the recording 
""
""
how about you
""
""
uh  clears throat  on how i discovered meditation
""
uhm i was a regular uh blessed sacrament worshipper and uh i was a charismatic
""
and also uh in the beginning uh centering prayer was uhm taught to the community of  buklod ng pag-ibig  where i  be  the community where i belonged
""
and i tried to do centering uh but it was a one day seminar one day teaching and then it was not followed up by the community
""
uhm so i could not sustain it
""
so i stayed in the blessed sacrament that that was my quieting
""
when i saw art there whom i did not know at that time uh  'no 
""
finally i got to know him uhm and i i wondered how this man could uh keep so still and  clears throat  i asked him about it and he and he taught me the the technique  clears throat 
""
and from there on uhm i started meditating
""
uhm then he started he put up this group which uh which sustained me and others because of the regular teaching and then there were there were fr lawrence would come often so there was constant nourishment uhm 
 in the beginning i i was so hungry for silence in my life uhm although i had hours and hours of it in the blessed sacrament but for some reason this this type of quieting was  was deeper
""
i i  cou  i can't explain it but then it 's a hunger of the soul  e  and and uh i i do i do meditation five six times a day and  and uhm i 've stayed on
""
i i do it twice a day and i 've seen a lot of uhm changes in myself like i used to be a very nervous person i 'm very anxious and uhm trying to please everybody all the time
""
when the group knew me they knew they they knew me on that level
 but because i believe i 've been faithful to the to the sittings i 've been able to detach from the opinions of others and i 've been able to discover myself uh love myself understand myself
""
i i was able to uhm unmask many of my masks unravel uh and and then i started to understand how truly god must have loved me
""
and because of that i  because of that i love myself more and when i love myself more i  i uhm when i love myself more i just became a better person
""
""
basically i think the reason why people who really practice it stay on to it is because uh you see that uh it really expands us
""
""
uh uhm
""
""
it   widens  our level of understanding
""
""
 yeah  
""
""
it uh makes us uh the opposite of being narrow-minded you know
""
oh uh we can be so focused and be one track mind but not closed to others
""
in other words it has led us to understand the journey better especially the spiritual journey
""
and understanding the spiritual journey i i feel that uh following the context of the bible where jesus said uh  where the spirit is there 's freedom and liberty  it frees uh it has freed me from a lot of perceptions and concepts which i feel has restricted my growth in life
""
and through the practice of meditation uh this way of praying it has led me to understand that  there there we can widen our horizon we can widen our understanding call it maybe wisdom uh and this widening happens without studying
""
it 's an internal knowledge that comes about through the practice of meditation
""
uh you don't need to read a lot of theories uh and study in order to understand the insights the depth uh the call it maybe the revelations or uh what term do we use uh when
""
""
intuitions
