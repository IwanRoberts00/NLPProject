 the president 's hour continues and our topic for this half of the program is the continuing struggle for human rights ladies and gentlemen the uh aquino administration has made human rights uh one of the uh cornerstones of its program and uh we are pleased to have with us uh some of the top human rights officials uh in this uh government well we start with uh secretary of justice uh franklin drilon we have uh commissioner paulynn sicam of the commission on human rights and uh commissioner jesito mallilin of the commission on human rights we also have a reporter from probe team mr david celdran uh who 's also a television personality and sometime uh sociology teacher okay anyway uh secretary drilon the uhm human rights record of the uhm administration has been a topic of some controversy uhm of course it was an anchor of the opposition uhm platform against marcos in nineteen eighty-six but since then uhm internationally the philippines has taken a beating uhm in uh in its uh human rights record uh perhaps uh fairly enough and uh that 's what i want to ask you uh where do we stand now because uh the the big issue about a year ago when i was covering human rights was that the human rights record of the aquino government was worse than the uh marcos government and that 's what the uh the uh various elements abroad were trying to uh spread around i take exception to that that the human rights record of this administration is worse than marcos there you know it 's basically the fact that you have freedom of speech now freedom of the press and all these things are reported in the press who do not know really what happened in the marcos regime and more impor but most importantly apa on in in matters of substance this administration as a matter of policy has never tolerated human rights violations i must emphasize that we 're in an insurgency with an insurgency problem such as ours human rights violations happen that you know we do not deny what is important the difference between president aquino 's administration and that of the previous regime is that when we take action we do not tolerate we hale purport violators of human rights whereas before uh although they were saying one thing they were doing another they were saying that we do not tolerate this but in point of fact it is happening and nothing was being done about it and we can be proud of the fact that indeed this administration has uh has uh put substance to the policy on protecting human rights we have shortcomings i must admit uh uh in this area but uh it 's not because we we do not want to do it but because of circumstances which uh prevent us from from uh doing everything that we want to do okay now let 's focus on the particular issue of uh military offenses i think it might be uh uh perhaps the central issue in uh in human rights here uh dave uh you just did a story uh which i caught on on  probe  what was your experience uh up there in isabela well we 're talking about the uh tape of uh marag valley marag valley in apayao area and uhm true enough no uhm it was an investigative piece and we went there uhm we did interviews and we talked to the the uh local government officials the military and the finding around there is that yes there have been uhm extreme cases of human rights abuses now apparently the context we find these abuses 'no  within is that in counter-insurgency operations or military operations the biggest losers are the civilians who are caught in the crossfire now i would like to throw back the question to our commissioners and the uh secretary here what guarantee do civilians have in a situation of counter-insurgency operations yeah and uh uh how can you prevent human rights abuses uh perhaps exactly words victims all the time well you know uhm a group of us went to marag valley in april  and uh one of the things that we uh that we found out was that exactly that the people are the helpless uh victims 'no  they 're caught in the crossfire and one of our recommendations which we submitted to the president through uh secretary drilon is that there should not be uhm aerial not clear if aerial or area bombardments such such a thing should be banned from the uh tactics of the military uh especially when you know there 's even uh the the danger of being one of one civilian being there uh now we 've planned this recommendation among others to uh cluster e to the president so well yes uh that 's correct we i i i 've received in my capacity as uh chairman of the cluster e uh the report of the mission which incidentally uh was the was part of the mission who words centered to marag valley and uh these uh recommendations were discussed this afternoon in cluster e among which was the suspension of the offensive military operations in order to allow government services to come in indeed the finding of the mission was that might be that the last time uh the people of marag valley felt government 's presence was probably in nineteen eighty-five and uh the suggestion of the mission that was sent there was that we uh bring back the credibility of government through government services in marag valley but frank uhm this this recommendation to stop military operations does this apply only to marag or is this going to apply to all other areas where military operations are displacing civilians well uh i find difficulty answering that uh you know i am not from the defense establishment we must also consider what kind of operations they 're having in other areas they have also their own mandate their own uh interest to and and duties to perform we we we uh i i don't think that we tolerate this policy of bombing a a anywhere but uh uh i in this particular case it was only focused on the marag valley well uhm the uhm problem i see with that is that the military is probably going to react uh rather uh uh negatively to that suggestion because uhm aerial bombardment while it it poses a very real danger this is a cornerstone of military strategy it uh cuts down on their own uh casualties like by let 's say  socking an area before they go there and if they 're asked to cut it out that 's you know in in effect asking them to to uh to go in there uhm sort of uh it 's a more dangerous situation and uh if they 're not going to be happy about this uh how can you convince the military that uh such uh tactics or or or even even calling off military word in populated areas are necessary you know apa some military strategists would tell you that aerial bombardment goes against the uhm the uhm the total approach ba  that they call it yeah it goes against that because you alienate the population right away while what you 're supposed to do is come in there and be their friend sure but the s o p is a long term strategy here we 're talking of a a short term conflict let 's say you 've isolated a group of of uh as the military calls them uh uh communist terrorists they really have their own terminology c ts  uhm you know uh let 's say uhm you 've isolated a group of them there and and uh you 're gonna go in after them you know that 's that 's not an s o p case i mean you know when i go in there and talk to the villagers and sort of get their sympathies you wanna go in there and start shooting right uh and that 's what i 'm talking about i think that uh necessary aerial support uh and aerial bombardment is is uh very key to uh a to modern warfare and it seems to me that the military might not agree that uh they should call it off  as regards that in an interview that i did with the uhm with general templo he said that operations will resume soon what 're just needed are for the fact finding missions to come in and once the reports are returned they intend to push through with the uh military operations and second uhm it is very difficult no uhm lots of human rights abuses take place because of what 's called you 're guilty by association now here 's a populated area of tribal people and i 'm not i 'm not just talking about marag in fact with every other hot spot in the country insurgents by the by the uh fact that they engage in guerilla warfare do operate within densely populated areas and because of that uhm it 's very difficult for military operations to take place now is there any way that the military can of course isolate or pinpoint who uh the enemies are and who the civilians are that 's exactly it but the moment you do that then uh human rights advocates would charge the military with hamletting they try to remove the civilians and uh you know precisely to protect the civilian population and again uh human rights advocates uh charge them with uh hamletting again a human rights violation which is which is why i 'd like to bring up the idea that perhaps pure military operations or the military approach to solving the problem of insurgency is already defunct or debunked, not clear which  as has been proven by vietnam and by so many other third world experiences yes and i agree with you that the only way to uhm solve the problem is to bring government services sincerely and not just as propaganda but sincerely bring government services to the people i i said uhm that uh that is part of the s o p formula we 're talking here about about military uh conflict 'no  i mean i i think that there there 's agreement around this table that that is in fact the the only uh viable long term approach to the problem but let 's talk about military engagement let 's talk about shooting war because that 's where we 're really concerned with with human rights violations uh i think uhm i remember very clearly the case of those uhm young marines who uh who uh were one morning in bulacan uh around this house and and they shot up the house they claimed they were shot at from the house they were on patrol across uh some fishponds and ricefields and they were firing out like this and there was this this house right next to a a fishpond and they claimed they were shot at from the house and they shot up the whole house and uhm there there was a claim that there were civilians there and that these people had died and uhm you know in these cases you know what what are you going to do what are you going to say i mean that 's uhm that 's uh what i 'd like to know uh perhaps uh you can tell us how the commission on human rights reacted in that case i remember we we conducted that inquiry right in the department of justice i think that the   mr mallilin < you were involved words i believe the early solution of this case what we call the  word massacre and uh isn't the massacre sort of uh words  it 's the words massacre but uh the commission came up with a resolution absolving uh the uh marines in that uh incident though i would say that i had the lone dissenting view there i didn't agree with the resolution i thought there should be more a thorough investigation of this uhm how was the case investigated i mean this is all after the fact uh was it a very tedious process not really we were able to call uh the marines immediately those involved words and even uh general biazon testified and then we called in the doctor who autopsied the bodies aha and after that we had our own evaluation words  even the owner of that fishpond we were able to have him testify and give his side but there are still questions being asked why did you dissent well uh any particular reason i believe that there was really a massacre and uh you know where the bloodstains were they were just in one position aha there were no bodies found in the upper floor of the house they were all in one place so i said these people were not  words
