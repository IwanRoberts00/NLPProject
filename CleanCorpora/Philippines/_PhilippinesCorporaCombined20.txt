what do you think can we discuss about our presidentiables what do you think someone speaks in tagalog  can you suggest   wala akong alam do'n e  don't you know about those people glitch in recording one of those presidentiables i know some of them uh you know some of them how about you pam i know some of them uh you know some of them but in my case uh i only know some but among them are pimentel estrada enrile defensor and maybe cory herself and recording interruption  uh then these people maybe they have their own they have their own intentions to run for candidacy for this this this coming nineteen ninety-two elections   what do you think  but  but i don't think uh they will be a good president okay how about you how about you pam do you think that all of or each one of them will become a good leader something like that there is a possibility but uh we are used to it that traditional politicians are doing the same things uh uhm uh these are these are the trapos traditional politicians  well anyway in my ca in my own in my opinion i would say that uh i might be the same with what you think that there is no one of them who is capable of running for presidency because almost everyone of them has been proven to be corrupt to be something like that to be they 're just using people to be their instruments that when they uhm when the election has already lapsed they don't think they don't even mind they don't even mind us anymore we voters they just think they just think about themselves and then once   for their own benefit yes that 's true and then once they are already in their position they don't even mind us what is our what are our needs and they don't even ask us right it 's the same scenario  so it 's better to change the ano  yes but in my case you know what is important there is i think this election of year nineteen ninety-two is still premature in the first place we do not know yet these people who they who really they are and then what is my point there is the first ones to change first their attitudes are those who are there in the official uh there i mean in the government positions because uhm like for instance no matter if we keep on electing officials we keep on choosing from them but if they don't know what is basic what are the basic functions which are inherent to them i think it 's it 's useless right it will be useless  how about estrada what do you think about estrada  estrada is he good laughter  can you consider estrada as a good pre president he was proven to be a good mayor but i don't think if he can be a good president  uh uhm wel  uh-huh well that 's also my opinion as a matter of fact even his educational attainment yes he has not he has not finished yet his college as a matter of fact he is a drop-out from uhm m i t mapua institute of technology and i don't believe i don't have the nerve to think that he can be a good president  he can be he can be the same also but i mean he can be the same with the other pres uh past presidents but maybe in some other aspects in some other walks of life he can be different from those past past presidents how about defensor miriam defensor oh yeah defensor you know i like this miriam defensor-santiago because aside from uh aside from being good in his uh position because when he was when she became the c i d commission on immigration and deportation commissioner he did uh he did his uh he did his her uh he did her best when she was in the when she was c i d commissioner and then when she became   and not only that when she was a judge yeah she when she became the judge judge she was the one giving uh death penalty oh yeah and then how about  salonga salonga yes salonga pimentel ay  they are traditional politicians yes they are traditional politicians and i think they can they will just do the same with what they have done in the past as a matter of fact when they do it they don't these are the people who do not uh give any importance just imagine this treaty uh the treaty which has just been concluded last oo  the treaty of friendship  oo the treaty of friendship security and cooperation  you know the point is this this is it is it was very untimely for the senate to kill that treaty in the senate  why because we don't have yet uh enough capital we don't have yet enough money to build or or to build and to stand on our own feet yes own feet yes as a matter of fact uh it was there that according to the senators who have rejected this uh treaty that uh we can stand we can now stand and we can be very independent yes anyway we are independent you know the point is uhm we are not independent from our own fi from our own uh from our own race   from our own country  yes from our own country but we are already independent from the other countries we we are no longer administered we are no longer we are no longer manipulated or whatever it is it is us because they themselves are uhm uh i mean they themselves are doing it that they are being manipulated by those people they are the ones that they are making that filipinos are being manipulated but they are the ones being instrumented isn't it in fairness to uh the senators the twelve senators uh uhm uh what they are fighting for here is that uh the the content of the treaty is not clear  uh uhm  uh uhm and the the figure the figure over the payment you know it is not clearly stated in the treaty that is one of the thing that they are fighting for of not uh of not do of not uh what what do you call this uh of not signing this treaty yes have not signed have not approved it   yeah  uhm but somehow it uh it would help us if they approve the treaty yes i do believe also if they if they have approved this treaty just for a while but there 's if they have given it at least ten years or at least less than ten years or ten years  at least ten years   uh  ten years yes it would be a good it would be a great help to the filipino people   filipino yes  because   especially the ano the mount pinatubo victims  yeah  because when this mount pinatubo erupted there were a lot of people who were affected isn't it the buildings and even the sub uh the clark airbase and this clark airbase is severely affected by mount pinatubo uh uhm and that is why because this has been uh the that base was destroyed so we don't have the money to uh to to renovate that that building because well why oh oh i mean where are we going to get the amount where are we going to get the money to pay for the renovation of these buildings or of these buildings so if these if these buildings will be converted for us to be our uh i mean part of our philippine uh philippine what is that philippine properties something like that so i think it is something that we can uh but i want to ask you yes how about if if we sign a treaty the twelve senators if they signed a treaty for another ten years do you think after ten years uh we can we can uh we can what do you call that we can cut the treaty or we no longer have the treaty from the americans do you think we we can stand already after the ten years oh after giving them the chance the ten years it would be of the same case because if we cannot stand if we cannot stand after ten years if we are not sure if we are not certain with ourselves that after ten years we do not know if we can stand on our own feet how much more now yes 'no  the fact that if we would be given uh the americans would be given another ten years  they are less   1 word by the filipinos if ever they if ever the senate approves it and the ano and another problem is ano 'yong underemployment  but  yeah there would be a lot of unemployment yes there would be a lot of things that might be affected the economic stability not only the political stability but at the same time our social uh yes our employment our and many other things okay let 's let 's point uh let 's focus on employment there are more than almost two hundred thousand to two hundred thousand to five hundred thousands who are already unemployed because of that because of that uhm because of that rejection and because of the mount pinatubo eruption and then don't you don't you know that don't you hear that that some of the electronic companies nowadays are now are now i mean are now slowly declining it declines now because some of the electronics companies now are now starting retre uh i mean terminate or not exactly terminating but they they have now the retrenchment they retrench these people who are employed because according to them they are at great loss  yes  they they lose they lose uhm lots of uhm products and these products are coming from u s and i believe that these products are be are are are being supported to us by the u s economy and it will also affect the ano foreign investors but for me 'no uh but for me the thing is the i think uh the thing is when when we will be when we will be going to stand on our own feet and try to uh try to build our own you know our own economy like that perhaps if we if we if we depend too much to them well that is also true that how can we build our own ano our own independence well anyway the sense is the point is we already we are already independent we already have it but it is it is the manner of administration  actually i do not i do not con yes i do not condemn those twelve senators  yes the administration   the leaders  i do not condemn with i do not condemn them in fact i am very proud of them because at least they have the pride they have their pride of nationalism patriotism and loyalty to the philippine or loyalty to the country to the nation   do you believe that it is a nationalism or patriotism or it is just a self-interest maybe i uh because as we all know that they are politicians and politicians are good in that they really they can really make everything what they want both of them might have their personal interest  yeah  as a matter of fact when the edsa revolution happened everyone every politician there had his own like enrile yes enrile had that personal interest when he uh went to edsa revolution and i don't believe that they could uhm make it possible everything what we hear now what do you think uh what should we do after the rejection of the treaty so i think uh everything depends on our government and then well it will depend to them you know it that the government is just making us uhm we are being enchained we are being en we are being enslaved by them because everything what they want they implement it without even consulting us especially these senators especially these people who are who are voted who are elected in their respective positions
