and i think all 's well that ends well uh uh they are good friends uh i i sincerely hope that uh with her statement tonight uh everything will be cleared and number one that there is no evidence whatsoever to uh merit uh the accusation and number two that ms martinez heard it from someone so in effect that 's hearsay hearsay okay going back a little uh sa statement n'yo sir truth versus blackmail who 's blackmailing whom who 's blackmailing no no that 's uh no no i 'm sorry that that 's uh that 's a misstatement that 's truth versus lies meaning uh  baka nag slip of the tongue ho kayo  that 's uh maybe that 's why so who who 's blackmailing whom  no no no no   someone 's trying to blackmail dan romualdez  no no that i said i clarified that that that 's a misstatement and i 'm sorry for that uh i think it 's truth versus lies so maybe not even lies maybe i 'd like to say that it 's truth versus uh uh maybe accusations or unfounded accusations i 'm not saying it 's lies 'no  uh you know i i 'd like to give the benefit of the doubt to ms martinez  it 's possible that somebody told her that atty romualdez did indeed receive money that to me is uh and especially so that it 's coming out that the person who told ms martinez that uh somebody uh that dan romualdez did indeed receive money came from somebody from a polluted source okay okay yeah senator pimentel but is is it really all 's well that ends well because some may may opening pa doon sa statement ni chit e because she is saying that uh this is what rita canlas told me okay you know what about rita canlas now if if chit martinez 's statements are hearsay what about what rita canlas is saying well if canlas has first hand information on the transaction as it were 'no then she would make for a good witness but i don't know where she is we have had no contact whatsoever with her did you try to get in touch with her at least the opposition no not at this point because uh my understanding is she is out of the country uh uh okay mr ang do you have contact with ms canlas  no absolutely no contact with ms canlas  uh uh i i don't intend we don't intend to contact her uh our conscience is clear atty romualdez has not received any money from anybody he has not attempted even attempted to influence the president into lifting her order or lifting a veto uh uhm and so   that 's  that 's it as far as you 're concerned he is cleared already  ganon ho ba yon kahit na may rita canlas pa doon  let let me say that he was not tarnished in the first place there were innuendoes there were some talks but these are loose talks you know and and and very unfair accusations i 'd like to think that uh if a man is truly honest and truly uh not guilty of anything he should not be worried uh senator pimentel as far as you are concerned is mr romualdez cleared already probably cleared by chit martinez  but not by unless somebody comes up and accuses him again using for example ms canlas then uh the re-investigation can be started uh again okay we 're going to have to take a break for uh a while  strictly politics will be right back stay with us break  she will not uh i you know she word no ifs no buts she has to get to the bottom of things and she has decided to get to the bottom of things and precisely she has or she has asked or ordered instructed her chief presidential legal counsel to refer the matter to the ombudsman for proper investigation uh yes uh but sir you have uh years uh of experience as a publicist and in politics also uh are you are you so sure that there that money did not change hands at all i 'm not an investigator i 'm saying with respect   but from your from what you know about politics from what you know well from what i know about politics it 's sometimes you 're most of the time you 're innocent and they just throw uh uh everything at you including the proverbial kitchen sink and uh uh you take care of the rest meaning uh it 's propaganda uh uh that 's politics for you but but let 's get to to to the real core core issue is dan romualdez guilty i don't think he 's guilty uh uh okay what kind of damage control did you try to do sir damage control we just tried to encourage people to talk about it because the more people talk about it the more people realize that dan romualdez was not at all is not involved in this what what do you mean by encourage people to talk about it like who well the senators even senator pimentel talked about it i did not need any encouragement from him  laughter well but but honestly   okay  we didn't do anything to to really uh uh stop the issue from being ventilated in public   yeah  because we 're sure that as as the more it gets to the public the more clear it becomes the issue becomes and the issue uh uh what are the facts that there are no there is no evidence to uh to show that the first gentleman received money and that there is no evidence that uh he even tried to influence his wife uh uhm so those are the facts so why will you not encourage the discussion of those facts in public uh usually kasi pag publicist p r they would rather uh not talk about it you know keep it under a lid uh this is one time when i think you have to allow discussion of of the issue because uh the facts are very clear uh uhm the facts are very clear ha  yes sir uhm senator ople was saying a few days ago guns of august 'no  uh this was supposed to be part of it paano na ho kung wala na hong bala guns of august pa ba or is it guns of september october well let me just repeat uh what i have said that uh we are trying to be a responsible opposition uh that means we don't fire guns you know figuratively speaking uh in the senate without any basis  yes  and that 's the reason why uh i have tried to touch base with ms martinez through an emissary who had you mean chit  that 's right okay okay who had come back to me to say that uh she wasn't able to convince ms martinez to even see me uh see and i so i said look uh uh it 's very difficult for me to start even filing a resolution when i don't have any solid uh thing to stand on you know  i cannot rely on what i hear on tv or see on radio or or i mean see in print and uh use that as basis for the investigation because anything that is said let us say over radio or television can be recanted easily by another person so where where would that leave you mr ang sino ho kaya yung nag-arrange nitong statement ni chit martinez  was it you no no not absolutely not  just asking chuckle  absolutely not or you helped engineer it helped it uh bring along  no  no no i will dispute that uh let let 's give you know let 's give credit naman to chit  you know she is a very intelligent lady and uh she 's very sober and uh she can naman distinguish uh facts from from the truth from lies 'no or truth from imagination so let 's let 's give chit credit for that she has uh in effect retracted or clarified maybe not retracted clarified her earlier statement aired over the radio uh and she said to the effect that uh she heard that dan romualdez received money so uh she admitted that that what she said earlier during the week uh was based on hearsay so let 's let 's leave it at that let 's give her the benefit of the doubt uh is the president aware already of uh her latest ms martinez 's latest statement oh i 'm sure she is i 'm sure she is and what would she what would her reaction be oh she 's very pleased because finally the truth uh is out uh ano hong pakiramdam last question before we go to a break for the second and last break para ho bang nabunutan ho kayo ng tinik nung narinig nyo na ganon ang sinabi ni chit martinez  well we 're thankful for to chit martinez that once and for all she clarified her statement uh if not retracted her statement but nabunutan ng parang tinik no it 's part of part of politics we look at it as part of the part of the propaganda maybe of some i said some members of the opposition uh uhm you 're not referring to senator pimentel who 's sitting beside you no no no no senator pimentel is a very sober gentleman and uh i know we 've we 've gone a long way no no no when we come back we 'll continue our discussion with senate minority leader nene pimentel and president romualdez 's personal publicist mr dante ang we 'll be joined by congressman prospero pichay and people 's consultative assembly secretary general linda olaguer montayre stay with us this is strictly politics music and break  joining us now in this uh uh second half of the show are linda olaguer montayre of the people 's consultative assembly and congressman prospero pichay congressman pichay uh a little background kayo po yung nag-file ng impeachment complaint di ba kay g m r dati  in the eleventh congress yes uh and now you 're here to uh help defend the first gentleman not really defend we we we legislators we always want to find out the truth and uh that 's why uh we are here because we want to ferret out the truth uh you you heard the statements of chit martinez a while ago what is your reaction to that well uh at least uh she came out in the open and told the truth you can't hide the truth for a long time and uh i think the basis of her statement was a hearsay coming from rita canlas and uh uh you you were asking earlier you said what happens now there 's still that statement of rita canlas  but uh i feel and i believe that uh the group uh of uh the the this corporation that wanted to get the franchise will come out with the statement that there was no pay off there was no money involved and she is part of that group uh uhm okay so uh among the many in the group uh i think uh the official statement should come out as the truth uh uh mrs montayre the people 's consultative assembly came out with the statement today in the newspapers uh in today i think and ano pang dyaryo ho ang lumabas saan lumabas  uh sa pinoy times and then in malaya  uh uh and you also and abante  uh uh doesn't this the latest statement of ms martinez take the wind out of your statement ma'am uh not really because that 's just one part of our statement uh in the first place regarding chit pimentel 's statement  chit martinez   uh chit martinez  i 'm sorry chit martinez 's statement while we respect her 'no we 're not that convinced so easily 'no because there 's something not convincing about her statement  why why  what is in this that is not true to you because of course there are legalities that we have to talk about and that 's what senator pimentel has said they respect it but as far as we are concerned mukhang hindi tama e ni-raise nya yung isyu tapos biglang ga ganoonin lang na parang wala   where there is smoke there is fire   sa n g os kasi sa mga masa sa tao yung ganon hindi kasimple simple lang ng ganon  how come it was raised in the first place and then the president was explaining all about the role of chit martinez then ramon espiritu  i think there should be more uh investigation uh regarding that particular uh state uh the particular story of the president so whether the senate takes it up or does not take it up anymore that would be sad if they don't but for us that 's not enough we are not contented that 's and then as i was saying that 's only the first portion of our statement we have the statement regarding the philippine charity sweepstakes office okay so first oo ma'am bale ang ang unang uh bahagi po ng statement nyo you 're you 're extremely disturbed by the accusations of uh chit martinez against the first gentleman and then you go on to the p c s o also yeah of course uh uh yeah what has that got to do with dan romualdez  why why is dan romualdez 's name here
