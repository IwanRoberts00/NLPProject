branch manager of security bank uh your honors uh i 'd like to manifest that ms ngo had submitted seven batches of uh documents and uh as a preliminary matter your honor each of the first six batches these are from exhibit l l l to exhibit l l l dash three exhibit l l l dash four exhibit l l l dash five exhibit l l l dash six exhibit l l l dash seven up to the end of the uh stapled bunch of documents respectively your honors pertain to the six branches and the documents uh contained and previously marked as exhibit l l l dash eight up to l l l dash thirty-six is a bunch of documents that pertain to the six branches uh they were not able to insert some of these uh documents uh in the respective branch files because the respective branch files had earlier been submitted your honor now ms witness so what is your proposal so i 'm takin going to take up your honor with the witness uh on a per branch file each of these exhibits better be very orderly thank you your honor you may now proceed now ms witness uh you said that you conducted an in-depth study yes your honor and have your prepared something out of that study i have prepared a summary i am showing to you exhibit l l l this is a one-page document  what is the relation of this uh document in with the summary that you have mentioned this is exactly the summary that i prepared your honor excuse me mr chief justice we do not know what they are talking about we were not furnished a copy of these documents may i ask that the uh prosecutor furnish us at least a copy of what they have furnished   again that was supposed to be the understanding i reiterate again compliance faithful compliance with your understanding uh providing copies of your exhibits to the other party not only to the members of the impeachment court so that we will not be wasting our time  i 'm sorry your honor my understanding was that our staff would already provide to everyone copies of these uh documents your honor provide the defense now with a copy yes your honor thank you your honor as a matter of fact uh the presiding officer also suggest that uh it would be the defense which should be immediately provided with the copies since during the markings the defense was represented these are all documentary exhibits i beg your indulgence mr presiding officer uh many of these documents came only during lunch and uh anyway uh now i am referring to you ms witness uh a one-page document entitled first line reads this is exhibit l l l first line reads equitable p c i bank timog scout tobias branch  could you tell me could you tell the court what this exhibit l l l is all about uh ms yolanda ricaforte opened his her first account on september first nineteen ninety-nine at timog scout tobias branch and the accounts that were opened are under current account number zero one zero seven zero zero six three eight dash nine and under savings account number zero one five seven zero four two two seven dash zero now would you have copies of the supporting documents pertaining to this current account number zero one o seven dash zero zero six three eight dash nine yes i have your honor i have copies of their her specimen signature cards uh your honor your honor yes uh i noticed that the witness just for a while yes i understood that the uh cross-examining counsel for the defense for this witness would be atty flaminiano yes what is the pleasure of uh defense counsel daza uh yes your honor i i will just bring it to the attention of the uh assisting counsel yes uh atty flaminiano or atty versola uh this is exactly the same copy except uhm i have marked the exhibits because i have a separate folder yes sir your honor we were furnished a copy of exhibit l l l but what atty uh daza noticed is that while the witness was making the answers she was reading from a document which is not this one which is not a copy of this one she was reading from another document which is quite confusing to us because we were following her statements so may we request that the witness be cautioned to use only the copy of our own exhibit l l l that should be addressed to counsel for the prosecution to be fair to the defense  but better yet for the defense especially for the assisting counsel to be there near the witness so the time that the document is presented you can see the document  thank you   thank you your honor let let me explain because all these bunches of documents could be confusing your honor the markings are meant to identify the relevant pages of these bunches so every time that you present a document to the witness indicate the exhibit number yes your honor so the defense can also be on guard against any surprise mr chief justice the majority leader in the meantime is recognized mr chief justice to allow the parties to thresh this point better perhaps uh a twenty-minute break would be in order twenty minutes would be given to the parties to thresh out uh the matter uh so we shall have a break uh for twenty minutes music < now uh your honors uh i 'd like to manifest that the originals originals of all these documents that the witness has carried have all been in her possession and uh these have not been turned over yet uh mr chief justice however we will be comparing these originals with the photocopies which have been pre-marked already now for instance uh what what were uh uh pre-marked the pre-marked documents not the original documents not the original documents your honor but the pre-marking was uh done in the presence of counsel for the defense yes your honor go ahead atty tecson tecson was so what are these documents on the basis of uh this is contained in exhibit l l l could you take a look at exhibit l l l dash two b uh l l l dash two c and l l l dash two d and tell the court what these documents uh have in relation to the original documents that you have brought with you these are exactly the photocopies of this uhm original specimen signature that i have with me under c a number current account number zero one seven uh zero zero six three eight dash nine and savings account number zero five seven dash zero zero four two two seven dash zero mr chief justice the honorable senate president uh mr counsel uh congressman moreno yes your honor would it be possible that uh for you to go uh you know one exhibit at a time so we can follow it more systematically yes your honor i 'd be willing to do that your honor however these documents are not arranged uh chronologically let me tell the your honors please that uh the witness had earlier prepared these documents and arranged them uh in in the order that uh she had deemed fit as i went over these documents i realized that perhaps a better approach would be to indicate the deposits and then the withdrawals and in so doing uh your honor uh there would be a uh we would be jumping from one annex to another uh but we can go we can approach that on a per document basis if the court wishes
