the release of staff sergeant lozada and that of chief inspector bernal earlier in sorsogon are mere dress rehearsals to the main event the release of general obillo and captain montealto on april sixteen

sergeant alpio lozada 's release went on smoothly
""
there were no media or political hysterics that accompanied the release of police chief inspector roberto bernal in sorsogon

but that 's all that was different

almost all local media or all media local and national were there

and every local politician human rights and religious group wanted in

mrs winifreda lozada and her five boys were not taking chances

but by six o'clock as bishop ireneo amantillo led a special thanksgiving mass for lozada 's release the family was still waiting

the negotiating panel and n d f representatives were nowhere in sight

not that there was a lack of representative

just as with the release of bernal lozada 's became a fiesta of sorts
with everyone or anyone wanting the exposure around

we counted three mayors a governor various councilors  barangay  chairmen about five religious and human rights groups heads of several civic and people 's organizations and of course the media who from daybreak never seem to get enough of the lozada family

it was near ten in the morning when the negotiating panel pulled in and the caravan of twenty vehicles pulled out for the fifteen kilometer journey up the forest and mountains of barrio biatogon in anticala where members of the n p a 's  pulang diwa  command waited

for a while it seemed media would only have mrs lozada and the boys to harass

by then even politicians wanted a chance to be seen next to the captive the rebel and the whole scene

even when the  rebels'  short program ended by two o'clock the lozada family were still not spared as they were taken on a chopper ride to another presscon  =press conference  this led by the a f p

deputy speaker eduardo gullas says there is no compelling need for the country 's three oil companies to increase pump prices at this time
""
gullas says the oil firms have already started to recover from their losses and sees no justifiable need for them to resort to price increases in the near future
""
he points out that petron corporation caltex philippines and  pilipinas  shell petroleum netted an aggregate net income of six point one billion pesos in nineteen ninety-eight a big turn-around from their combined four point forty-three billion pesos net loss in nineteen ninety-seven

starting next week the oil companies are expected to raise pump prices by an average of fifty centavos per liter following an up trend in world oil prices

the uptrend was an offshoot of a decision of the organization of petroleum exporting countries to scale down crude oil production
