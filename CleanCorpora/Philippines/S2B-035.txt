allow me first to place on record my observations and remarks
made earlier by a colleague that the blame for the sad state of the armed
forces should be laid at the door of the presidency of corazon c aquino
allegedly for giving low priority to their funding requirements
""
i find that conclusion of my dear friend without merit for two
reasons one when mrs aquino assumed the presidency the national treasury had
been looted blind and number two the repeated coup attempts by a significant
segment of the armed forces were hardly conducive to enlarging their share of
the national budget
""
in fact mr president if blame is to be laid on anyone 's shoulder i
would say that it should be placed on those who had run of the military
establishment for so long but had not been able to enhance its capability for
one reason or another as a fighting force for the security of the nation
""
mr president voting on the v f a is one of the most difficult
decisions of my life as a public servant
""
in nineteen ninety-one i was a member of the senate along with
senator teofisto guingona senator juan ponce enrile and senator uh john
osme&ntilde;a and uh we were faced with a proposal to renew the term of the u
s military bases in the country
""
sixteen votes were needed to approve a the proposal eight votes were
needed to reject it
""
mr president when i rose to cast my  no  vote
mine was the eighth negative vote that irrevocably sealed the doom of the
proposed renewal of the bases agreement
""
i had cast that negative vote with no doubts no qualms of conscience
no second thoughts about the rightness of my vote
""
i then believe as i do now that the u s bases had to go in the event
""
mr president i believe that history has vindicated our decision to
ask the u s bases to leave
""
i had voted  no  despite the repeated requests
of a dear friend and a political ally the then president corazon c aquino
with whom i had the privilege of working for the restoration of our people 's
freedoms not only when she was already installed as president of the republic
but even during the dark days of martial rule in our country
""
today as a senator i am called upon to decide whether or not our
country should have a visiting forces agreement with the united states of
america
""
and this time another dear friend and political ally no less than
the incumbent president joseph ejercito estrada asked that i agree with the
ratification of that agreement
""
how i wish mr president i could decide the issue today as easily as
i did the proposal of the renewal of the u s bases in nineteen ninety-one
""
the issue now as i see it however is not a choice between black or
white as was the proposal to retain or reject the u s military bases in
nineteen ninety-one
""
the issue now is whether or not we allow the friendly military
forces of the united states of america which happens to be the only remaining
superpower in the world to visit our country and do military exercises with
our armed forces
""
in an an attempt in an attempt to be dispassionate about the issue
i have asked myself a two-pronged question one why does the united states
want a v f a with us and number two why do our leaders want to have a v f a
with the united states
""
number one on the u s motives
""
mr president as u s motives go i venture the following observations
""
first the need for access
""
the u s is by universal admission the only superpower in the world
today
""
flowing from that pre-eminent status the united states by
auto-appointment now performs global police work with the deferential
acquiescence of the rest of the world
""
as the world 's  de facto  policeman for
instance the united states believes that iraq 's saddam hussein is not doing
right to his people and so it bombs iraq imposes no fly zones in iraqi air
space and shoots down any plane that dares to defy its rule
""
the u s does not like what the drug lords in colombia are doing and
so it backs up the anti-drug war in the country that has neutralized not only
the drug lords but also some political opponents of president cesar 
gavria  trujillo
""
the united states does not like what slobodan milosevic ethnic
cleansing in kosovo and so it bombs the daylights out of belgrade and other
cities of yugoslavia
""
what i 'm trying to say mr president is that since the united
states is now the only superpower in the world it looks like it it can do
whatever it wants to do in the name of humanitarian intervention or to create
a new world order according to its image and likeness
""
nonetheless i think mr president that the united states is  es
 essentially a democratic country and therefore it wants to ground its
police actions on agreements and treaties that are enforceable or justifiable
under the law of nations
""
enforceable agreements or treaties on visiting on u s visiting
forces are important to the u s so that any challenge to united  states'
 interest in any region could be met under a legal cover and from the
vantage point of a territory close to the challenger and far away from
mainland u s a
""
hence i am made to understand that now the united states has v f as
with seventy-seven countries around the globe in addition to eighteen
military alliances of various sorts
""
that makes mr president ninety-five countries out of a total one
hundred eighty-seven united nation members
""
roughly over one half mr president of the world has become integral
parts of what somebody has called  the shifting plates of armor of
the united states 
""
with the v f as in its pocket mr president the united states may
then legitimately oversee the activities of the world north to south east to
west and do police work in this or that country and in this or that region so
that they do not conflict with or do damage to u s interests
""
as george and meredith freedman have said the american navy mr
president goes where it wants and does what it wants and the american troops
land in eurasia and brush aside enemy armies and they intervene in latin
america at will for reasons as trivial as arresting drug dealers
""
of particular relevance to us mr president in connection with the v
f a discussion are the sea lanes within or the air spaces above the countries
of southeast asia and other asian countries
""
free access to these sea lanes is  consider  considered of
strategic importance to the u s because it is through these sea lanes that
vessels ply their cargo especially oil to fuel the economic demands of japan
europe and even of the united states
""
free access to the air spaces is likewise of vital importance
because u s war planes that sail along the sea routes of southeast asia to
their ultimate destinations elsewhere will need the protection of the united
states air force
""
the world view of the united states therefore mr president dictates
that the united states armed forces need to oversee and police what the
nations of the world do in order to ensure the unhampered transaction of
global business of which the united states is the main exponent and principal
beneficiary
""
in a word the name of the game of united states business as it has
always been for the business of the dominant powers of europe or asia is free
access to the resources of the world
""
the continued dominion of the  domin  dominant powers for
prolonged periods over the subjugated states that was fueled by their free
access to the resources of the enslaved countries has been euphemistically
called various names in honor of the dominant powers at different stages of
world history
""
the romans called it  pax romana  great britain
called it  pax britannica  hitler called it  
lebenstraum   japan would have called it  pax
nipponica  although in fact they opted to call the organization the
so-called greater east asia co-prosperity sphere
""
now because of the undu undisputed military and economic supremacy
of the u s some american drumbeaters apparently want to call it  pax
americana 
""
now mr president there is nothing wrong intrinsically with getting
access to the resources of any country anywhere in the world to promote
business
""
there is nothing wrong for the u s to consider business as its main
business
""
but for the united states to draw other countries into its embrace
as a spider lures a fly into its parlor is a cause for legitimate concern for
the latter
""
an extensive discussion of this issue may however carry us too far
a field
""
suffice it to say at this point that gaining access to the
resources of the world for the sake of the united states or its  allies'
 business is not trouble-free
""
it causes friction especially when the u s has to use muscle to
ease the flow of business through what the c i a calls choke points or places
where shipping may be interdicted by unfriendly forces
""
according to the c i a mr president these include the choke points
include the bering strait panama canal luzon strait and the singapore strait
""
with the luzon strait being categorized by the c i a as a possible
choke point it stands to reason that the united states will want to ensure
that a choking of ship passage will not happen at that point
""
but since there are no longer any u s military bases here from
which u s forces could pry open any choking of the free passage of vessels at
the luzon strait the ramos administration formulated with the americans the
so-called visiting forces agreement which in turn the estrada administration
has submitted to the senate for concurrence
""
what does all of this discussion mean
""
mr president it can be the meaning can be capsulized in this phrase
 preventing the rise of rogue nations 
""
while it is true mr president that the right of innocent passage of
ships and air ships of friendly nations is guaranteed under international law
i think the united states out of extreme caution as old man cicero would say
  ex abundante cautela   wants to plug all
loopholes
""
the united states knows that as of today in the year of our lord
nineteen hundred ninety-nine nearly every country in this region wants to be
its friend
""
some out of lapdog loyalties most others out of pragmatic
considerations
""
yet nobody can foresee what the future will bring
""
a new hegemon or a rogue nation may rise to challenge the
predominance of the united states and get out of its sphere of influence
""
in fact china mr president in the aftermath of the bombing of its
embassy in belgrade by nato planes recently and for historical reasons
perhaps is already acting up calling the u s a global bully that wants to
heighten conflicts in many parts of the world instead of resorting to
diplomacy to end them
""
i do not think mr president that the united states wants to be
caught off-guard when a rogue nation may want to strike an independent course
of action for itself in any region or in the world
""
the united states mr president would most likely want to prevent
that eventuality from ever taking place and what better way to attain that
purpose than by cementing friendly relations with the military of any country
which as everybody knows is always a force to reckon with especially in
developing countries like ours
""
i suggest mr president that the v f a will certainly achieve that
objective for the u s
""
under the terms of the v f a the united states forces will come
a-visiting not to hobnob with civilian functionaries or even to do a quickie
with prostitutes as the silly-minded would want to emphasize as if there will
be no prostitution if american soldiers do not visit here
""
nonetheless the american forces will come primarily to exercise
with their comrades-at-arms our own soldiers who wearing similar uniforms
would take orders in english of course from u s military commanders and test
new u s arrangements armaments and experiment with new tactics and new
straged strategies defined by u s war experts
""
in furnish fairness mr president let it be said that the military
in our country since the administration of the former president fidel v ramos
has largely kept to the barracks
""
by that i mean the military did not mount coup attempts against the
ramos administration that had become rather endemic to the cory aquino
presidency
""
but i am not too sure for how long
""
for even now as we talk the police which used to be an agent of the
military has been quiescent and restive under the prodding of some
disgruntled police officers  1
