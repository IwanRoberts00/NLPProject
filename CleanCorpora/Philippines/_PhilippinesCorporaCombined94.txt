performance  uhm i 'm just starting to get the feel of college life uhm or   so i havent havent recited that much yet   in my class  uhm  how do you find it is it really different from high school in a way it 's different in what way 'coz you 're not really pressured to recite uh-huh unlike in high school the teacher would call one by one and you have to recite in college if you dont want to recite you dont have to  unlike in high school  you dont have to   yes  but how will you be evaluated as a student  uh   is it not a part of the grading system i think mostly it 's the test the test yes uhm how many units did you enroll uh fifteen units only why fifteen are you not underload no  why   uh the load in u p is very unlike the load of la salle and ateneo because it 's lower  ahh ahh it 's lower so fifteen units is the regular load uh yes ahh okay  word high school unlike in uh the other universities i think there unlike in la salle it 's twenty-nine twenty-nine yeah it 's twenty-nine and in some universities i think the regular load for students is twenty-six ma'am i cant hear you  twenty-six  ahh you cant hear me i think the the regular load for other universities is twenty-six twenty-four something like that i think it 's in p l m it 's twenty-nine uh twenty-nine also yeah because jescel 's course in p l m is nursing uh-hum and her load is twenty-nine units twenty-nine units yes what are your courses or subjects uh natural science wow history communications math math one social science p e and n s d p how many subjects all in all does each subject have three units each no no how many only two uhm i think it 's math and science has have three units ahh three units the others one or two ahh really you mean to say even the subject i i what 's that uh communication yeah it it you mean there 's only one unit for that subject yes ma'am uhm how come it 's different from the other universities i think i 'm not sure uh you 're not sure  anyway   pero i i know it 's only one unit it 's only one unit and how much did you pay for my course it 's five thousand twelve five thousand yes five thousand twelve uh-huh for for the first sem for the first sem you have two semesters yes ma'am uh-huh by the way somebody asked me this morning 'no  some students in v mapa regarding uh upcat upcat yeah the deadline for the submission is on june eighteen june eighteen so that is on what date is today friday fifteen sixteen i think it 's a friday friday uh-huh by the way how much is the application form uh three hundred three hundred pesos ahh so when you took the upcat it was three hundred pesos  but i heard a different number  yes  i think it 's three fifty now three fifty now yeah three fifty that 's why some students you see they they 're having problem now with you see three fifty that 's already big amount 'no  i thought that sections one and two have already done their forms yeah i heard from ninang that since last may   they were there and they were arranging for their forms to be finished  uh-huh  ahh so they 're they 're almost done with their forms  yeah i heard from ninang  how did you find the test last year it was easier  ow  yeah compared with compared to that of la salle and ateneo ahh so because the math in in the upcat it 's in filipino ahh it 's in filipino  yes it has two forms  uhm  the one part is in english and the other part is in filipino  uy that 's good  hmmmh   they really uh   so those who 're not that good in math they 'll really understand hmmmh u p is really promoting 'no the filipino language actually i think 'no uh mathematics now is really taught in filipino is it in u p or no ma'am it 's in english uh it 's in english the only subjects that are that is in filipino in our school is kasaysayan   kasaysayan   kasaysayan   kasaysayan uh-hmmmh we 're encouraged to speak filipino instead of english how do you find your professors my favorite professor uhm i think will be my history prof really because she 's very lively lively and she makes kasaysayan ng pilipinas  interesting interesting by   you wont be bored ahh you wont be bored yeah uh how what 's the approach she just takes it as as if she 's only telling a story yes  ha  as if she 's only telling stories hmmmh unlike in high school my favorite teachers were english teachers speaker a chuckles my en my english teacher she 's very strict  really  strict i 'm very sorry but she 's very strict really yeah she 's very bo boring she 's boring really yes ma'am  wh why did you say that she 's boring i dont know because is she bookish i mean does she depend on books no why very unlike very unlike hmmmh is she old no she 's not that old hmmmh i i think many u p profes professors are very young right she 's very young actually ma'am she 's very young uh very young because the last time i attended a seminar at la salle our speaker then was a very young professor and at that time  she doesnt smile that much   ha  she doesnt smile that much ahh really she doesnt smile she doesnt smile at all i think really and for the whole period uh uh  just like today  why   uhm uhm uh-hmmmh we did so many activities so you had english today yeah  today is my day for english  uhm uh-hmmmh does she give regular quizzes yeah she does ma'am uh she does and everything is graded everything is graded everything is graded from homeworks to seatworks   really  just like in the high school laughter  it 's like in the high school at least in college we dont have to write yeah really you 're right uh actually in college you will not be forced to take down notes no you will not be forced to recite you said you write but you see uh reciting or recitation helps a lot in but in math we are obliged to write  uh-hmmmh  uh you are obliged to write yes uh-hmmmh uh so you 're enjoying your math laughter   no   why did you lau  no you still dont so they   my professor my professor in math was the professor of my brother when he was a freshie ahh so   and he knows my brother  and he expects that i will be good in math as well i would like to raise my hand and tell him sir dont expect anything from me i 'm not good in math chuckle at all   so  at all speaker b laughs  so you already have uh enough background about the professor through your brother actually my brother said he 's nice uh he 's nice i think he 's our relative again he 's our relative relative  daw  oh speaker b laughs  really i 'm not sure according to my brother my lola told him that mister regaspi that 's the name of my professor mister legaspi regaspi  re   re regaspi yes uh-huh his name is george allen regaspi is our relative from from my in my father 's side uh-hmmmh what time do you usually leave your house it depends ma'am 'coz uhm mondays and thursdays my first class would be eight thirty so normally i would leave the house at seven ten uhm but on tuesdays and fridays my class starts at ten oclock so i leave at nine nine ten are your rooms at u p air-conditioned yes all of our rooms in u p are air-conditioned hmmmh although some do not work uh-huh by the way how 's your mom my mom  she 's okay  yeah  she 's breathing chuckle  uh so no one in the family got sick these past few days uh fortunately none ma'am oh that 's a blessing because many people got sick these past few days because of the weather right we 're very healthy people laughter  actually even if you 're heal healthy with the kind of weather we 're having these days you see you will really be sick in the morning till noon it 's very hot then at night when people are about to to go home suddenly it would rain right uhm classes will start on june twenty-one right ma'am yeah uh on monday  hay hannah we 're so bored in school  you know   i 'm guessing that your high school students are bored we teachers are bored i mean what do you do at school aw would you believe we were required to to clean last week monday and tuesday and then just these past two days we had a seminar uh yeah i hea i heard from ninang  that you had a seminar nga  oh what did your ninang tell about the seminar she was very inspired by the talks ahh inspired   by the mass even by the priest because she she said that ano it teaches the teachers to have a better relationship with students okay really that 's good actually of the two speakers yesterday i really liked the the second one it 's doctor sayo uh her talk is really inspiring it 's about professionalism and actually i i got much from her sharing you see the experiences she had when she was an elementary and high school teacher ahh yeah the one who was given the scholarship ahh really by the nun by the nun the nun or the teacher oh i 'm not sure uh but you see uh some teachers just didnt mind the seminar i mean some teachers didnt uh take the seminar seriously it 's a pity to think that the staff planned an activity like this and still they wouldnt mind at all they wouldnt yeah some teachers kept on talking at the back even if they 're seated in front they would just talk speaker b chuckles   it 's a shame  it 's a shame that 's why this afternoon when mrs bernardo closed uh i think before she closed during the evaluation she really 'no cant help it but  they didnt appreciate the talk  she told them she told the group that most teachers were not listening
