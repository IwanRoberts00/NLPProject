applause  today i fulfill my constitutional mandate to address congress on the first day of its regular session by tradition i am to dwell on the state of the nation let me start with a sincere apology to all those who expected or wished to see me fail i 'm sorry to disappoint them applause  i am pleased to report that our nation is rising growing and strengthening this is in contrast to the situation i described to you last year and which i vowed to reverse several sentences in filipino  last year when i first addressed this august body our nation was in an economic crisis today we are out of it last year i told you that our aim was to help the country escape the recession we did it in nineteen ninety-eight most of our asian neighbors sank into recession in contrast our country managed a modest but positive growth of one-tenth of one percent in our gross national product however our gross domestic product dipped by one-half percent or points or zero point five during the year in the first quarter of this year our g n p abruptly surged upward by two percent and our g d p by one point two percent last year we were struggling to keep ourselves from sinking today we are sailing towards the high seas again it is time once more to pay tribute to a special class of filipinos our overseas workers they as a group kept our g n p growth at positive rates even during the worst of times they continue to be our economic saviors last year i expressed my hope of keeping inflation at a single-digit rate we did it in nineteen ninety-eight the inflation rate was at a full-year  av average of nine point seven percent it improved further to a six-month average of eight point four percent in the first half of nineteen ninety-nine in june alone inflation was down to five point eight percent inflation is a vicious enemy of the poor last year i said that without undermining the independence of the  bangko sentral ng pilipinas we would support the lowering of interest rates we did it in the past twelve-months period alone the benchmark ninety-one day treasury-bill rate dropped steeply from fourteen point nine percent on the first auction on july six nineteen ninety-eight to eight point four percent last monday this is its lowest level in more than twelve years bank lending rates have also dropped to pre-crisis levels last year i lamented the devaluation of the peso as imposing burdens on our people i inferred that we should strengthen our currency we did it at the beginning of nineteen ninety-eight the peso plunged to an all time low of forty-five pesos and forty-two centavos to one dollar at the beginning of my administration it was at forty-two pesos and four centavos since then the peso has strengthened dramatically it has stabilized within a range of thirty-seven to thirty-nine to the dollar this was achieved largely by leaving the market alone and the market responded with a show of confidence it sent billions of dollars of loans investments and exports orders to the philippines the bangko sentral intervened only occasionally to prevent wild swings and to forestall speculative attacks not to set the trends of or levels of the exchange rate last year i committed to more effective and efficient tax collection we did it despite the ravages of the asian crisis on tax collections total revenues amounted to four hundred sixty-two billion in nineteen ninety-eight of which tax revenues constituted four hundred sixteen billion or four billion pesos higher than in nineteen ninety-seven for the first ti for the first four months of nineteen ninety uh nine nineteen ninety-nine b i r collection reached one hundred twenty-six billion or three point two percent higher than in nineteen ninety-eight custom collections amounted to twenty-three point one billion pesos and non-tax revenue fourteen point one billion pesos this does not mean that we are happy with our tax re  rep effort we need to improve not only our collection performance but the tax structure itself and hence our existing tax laws last year we found the government in a deeper fiscal hole than the public had been made to believe we committed to reduce the government deficit this time we didn't do it it is not that we failed we deliberately shifted shifted course at a time when the economy was threatened by recession uh the administration has decided on a twenty-five percent across-the-board forced savings on the expenditures of the government this was like administering the medicine for high blood pressure to a patient with low blood pressure  lalong lulubha ang pasyente dahil baka mamatay nang di pa oras  that is why my favorite doctor the first lady always makes sure that my blood pressure is normal especially when i 'm reading the newspapers we scrapped the forced cutbacks and did exactly the opposite we not only ensured that public services would continue at adequate levels we also engaged in various pump-priming our aim was not to save but to spend this was to counteract the slowdown in private consumption and investment expenditures in other words to raise the country 's declining blood pressure rather than let it sink further our logic was simple a time of growth and threats of inflation calls for balanced budgets or surpluses to prevent further inflation but a time of recession and deflation calls for budget de  deficits to jump-start a recovery thus towards the end of nineteen ninety-eight we increased the budget deficit to fifty billion or one point eight percent of the g n p for the first time and for the first five months of nineteen ninety-nine we incurred as planned a deficit of forty-five point three billion pesos still within the nineteen ninety-nine program deficit of sixty-eight point four billion pesos or two point two percent of target g n p for the next two years we intend to reduce our deficit to one point one percent and zero point four percent of g n p and eventually attain a balanced budget in the year two thousand two and surpluses thereafter in other words i will not end my term with a deficit applause one problem we faced was how to finance the deficit borrowing locally would have raised interest rates at a time when we wanted them to go down borrowing abroad was too costly monetary expansion would have triggered inflation and a run on the peso foreign exchange controls were untenable raising taxes or cutting government expenditures would have led to a deep recession it seemed like there was no way out but we found one anyway substantial funds were located right under our noses the foreign currency deposit u units or f c d us so we borrowed from them on a short term basis at relatively low cost as a result we brought down interest rates we brought down the inflation rate and we strengthened the peso experts say these all cannot happen at the same time because they are inconsistent with one another but we did it and we emerged out of the regional crisis ahead of most our of our neighbors i narrate all these inside stories to make a point those who make a career and a business out of hitting me are saying that the improvement in the country 's economic performance was due to pure luck to good weather or to anything but erap the president 's nickname four sentences in filipino  our recovery was due to the innovative way we analyzed situations and made bold decisions our success was the result of effective governance it was a matter of having the right policies being supported by competent and dedicated cabinet members respecting the freedom of the market managing and budgeting our resource ces right and acting quickly before the danger grew out or the opportunity disappear as a prominent filipino economist dr ber bernardo villegas recently wrote and i quote the economic team of the present administration during its first year has been superior in cohesiveness effectiveness and clarity in purpose when compared to the equivalent teams during the first years of the previous administrations   with due respect to the president ramos i didn't say this  president estrada 's first economic team is among the best in asia  effective governance by a team-powered administration also explains the rapid recovery of the country 's international credit standing and i assure you that you know the definition of a banker he is a person who lends you his umbrella when it stops raining credit markets are even more jittery so when the global market gobbles up one point two billion worth of repub worth of the republic of the philippines global bonds for budget support from the first ca country to float such an issue after the asian crisis and when the market buys up the four hundred million dollars of bangko sentral bonds issued for reserve management purposes and when the eurobond flotation of the national government raises three hundred eighty-three million dollars obviously the world believes that in the philippines it has stopped raining we are getting a shower of umbrellas this is not to mention the billions of dollars of inflows in medium and long term loans from bilateral sources banks and financial institutions from the world bank and the asian development bank from japan 's export-import bank and overseas economic cooperation fund and from the monetary fund among others three sentences on lower unemployment figures in filipino interspersed with applause  in the meantime our exports are zooming up at double-digit rates our balance of current accounts are in surplus and our gross international reserves are at all-time high currently amounting to fourteen billion u s dollars with all these developments it is no wonder that in the space of only one year the other asian countries and indeed much of the world have come to recognize the presidency of the philippines as among the leaders of the region this is indeed a long way from the skepticism that greet  greeted this presidency when it began in apec in asean and in other regional international forums the current leadership of the philippines enjoys a high level of respect our international prestige is on the rise the dramatic rebound in the stock market is a strong indication of confidence and the people according to the latest surveys give the president a seventy-seven point six percent approval rating the heads of the i m f and the world bank also have a have had good words to say mr james wolfenson president of the world bank said and i quote  what is clear is the philippine situation is vastly different from korea thailand and indonesia  i think you all know you are weakened far less than anyone else in the region with the exception of singapore end of quote and mr michel camdessus managing director of the i m f said he considered the philippines as a model for countries in the asean region only last thursday the i m f executive board completed the fourth review under our standby arrangement this will now allow us to draw about two hundred fourteen million dollars which will further increase our gross international reserves the i m f executive directors also praised the bangko sentral headed by governor gabriel singson for the successful implementation of monetary policy through the turbulence of the past two years it is ironic that while foreign experts and the foreign press have good reviews of our performance and while investors pour money into our economy some quarters in our local media are undermining confidence in our country
