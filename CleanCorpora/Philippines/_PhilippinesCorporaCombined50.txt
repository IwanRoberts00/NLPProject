i suppose so i suppose so  we have no choice laughter  hamburg is not being represented yes it is in north of germany very near denmark isn't it very near uh yes denmark uh the uh how do you call that uh scandi scandinavian countries yes i 've been there twice so when i was there  i suppose you 've been to heidelberg i was there a year ago it 's a beautiful city well it 's a it 's a university town huh yes it 's a universi  how about the the university of leeds is that is leeds supposed to be a town or well leeds used to be an industrial town they produced wool textiles and the university was built because of the woolen industry  uh uhm  oh yes then philosophy evolved and philosophy and literature i heard from uh vic brias that uh the the author of a of our book alistair macintyre yes he 's supposed to have taught in the university of leeds i 've no idea they told me once yes probably probably before i was there how 'd you find that book of uh macintyre it 's good although i had to get used to the language uh it 's not anglo-american so it takes getting used to  it 's very  i uh my comment is that uh i think macintyre is uh getting into a problematic into that problematic of uh what we call postmodernism like that of 1 word  i don't know anything about 1 word  uh-huh postmodernism postmodernism uh although i have heard people mentioning the word but i 've never really word  let me see let me see let me recall how macintyre gets into this problem uh based on this book after virtue that very title after virtue i think it 's postmodernist because virtue you know after virtue what uh it it it gets you into thinking about the the the phase  i think the cultural phase in which something of the past is uh going through a threshold being questioned being transformed and uh precisely at the point where you don't yet know exactly what the what it is that it 's going to be transformed into  now it doesn't uh  well so far somebody told me i 'm not really sure about this you have to correct me then some people say that postmodernism is sort of a critique of all forms of meta-narrative something it 's anti-foundationalist uh i 'm not really sure uh i may be talking my head off yes uh  maybe if we we could say it is anti uhm anti-modernism uhm of course that begs the question of what is modernism it 's a critique of a of the modern spirit and so again the question of uh what is the modern spirit isn't it is it also a going back to the classical 1 word it 's not it 's not it 's not a going back  it 's not  it 's a moving on it 's a it 's going forward without having to i hope without having to lose the heritage of the past because for example this uh book of macintyre while it is it is speaking of something after virtue is contextualizing itself within history isn't it  there 's a great deal of of his history in uh macintyre  well i have to you know think about that you think about it there is however a kind of post-modernism which is uh also anti-history an example will be uhm will be somebody who is nietzschean who is radically negativist  uh so whose postmoder postmodernism could be a sort of umbrella term for a lot of things but they could share certain assumptions is it like that including that but generally it is uhm it is it has a historical dimension because uh we are supposed to be going through through a stage a stage in history in which we are no longer we no longer belong to the modern age in other words the modern age is past in the same way that there was a time when the medieval age was uh was past  and uh we are moving into a new epoch we don't have a name for it yet so we call it post-modern  so what characterizes this as you as you say it new epoch at this point of the game uh the general charac character of this epoch is one of critique the critique of the immediate past noise   i see so there 's something new in i i think post-modernism is uh is optimistic about about the future that there 's something new in the offing  and you can see that even politically because uh everywhere in the world something 's going on right  changes right and left  these are no longer the same as before so new time is a new epoch don't you feel that way  no no not really not really break in recording  are you enjoying your classes  yes oh i enjoy the the the graduate class the graduate class i see i see  hey i hear you have plans to introduce computerized logic teaching in la salle   uh uhm  uh uhm and so that will relieve the teachers to to discuss to discourse more on the philosophical issues involved in logic uh uhm yeah when you come back i think uh we should uh think along those lines design courses and uh 'cause i have done this tradition also with word  'cause when i was in leeds they they they had the they had this logic interaction with with computers and it 's it 's the computer really teaches you how to because if you make some for example if you devise something wrong the computer will give you a feedback it 'll say it 's wrong like that uhm uhm it 's very good uhm we don't have that yet here i know you know it 's raymond 's birthday also yes i heard  so when is the  when is the when is the lunch going to start or are we just waiting we 're just waiting we 're just waiting but the food is here right actually i have had my lunch  you haven't received word from uh where 's that finland finland no i haven't yet i think they 're supposed to deliberate on it after the end of march oh and then you 'll hear from them april may april may and then ju just in case you uh get accepted when you when do you are you supposed to go it 's my choice actually it 's your choice my choice uh-huh you don't want to teach uh for the first term well it depends yeah because uh i 'm not really sure what i want to do yet with my life actually before i was so sure but then after i came back i uh uhm i 'd like to work in government  how 's your work with the c c p it 's tiring it 's always very tiring  laughter what is it that you 're doing actually because i 'm researching in the office of the tribal groups in the philippines the art yeah yes and it 's difficult to research and type it out it 's very tiring uh uhm uh uhm but uh what 's your contract with them is there a stipulation time or well it 's until the end of may oh until the end of may  yeah  yeah it 's until the end of may words  how would you like teaching for the first term graduate school logic oh i 'll i 'll i 'll see about that yeah may june july about may june july  yeah  have you met dr quito  have you talked to her not yet  she isn't dean she 's at l s building if i decided to talk   yes yes on ground floor ground floor  you can actually drop by any time for as long as he doesn't have she does not have a meeting yeah she 'll be very open to you  i enjoyed it very much when she went to england to see words   oo nga daw ano   yeah that was very nice uhm she visited you at the university no she she was in london uh i went down from leeds to london oh is it a distance two hundred fifty miles two hundred fifty miles that 's uh four hundred kilometers uh-huh that 's quite a distance huh yeah but the train is fast two and a half hours two and a half hours yeah fast train  i 'm going to see dr reyes and you left each other there no no i wrote to him oh uh and i so i did you know that both of you were coming this year no i had no idea no idea uh yeah i only knew it when i came in i think that was the friday before the start of term uh-huh and the secretary said that uh words  uh-huh i was supposed to meet uh prof quito in paris oh yeah uh after she visited me she would be going to spain then france and i would see her in paris uh-huh she gave me her address in paris uh-huh but then something came up uh i went to liechtenstein which is a small country between yes yes i went there instead and uhm germany switzerland i sent her a postcard  luxembourg uh luxembourg luxembourg is nice  how long have you been in been there five years or so four and a half four and a half and keith was about the same time i think a bit a bit longer five or seven years   six  there is a in england there is a time limit for the p h d oh it 's four years i see if you 're doing full time four years is the maximum time limit i did it in four and a half because they calculated because i stopped for for a few months and if you don't make it for four years you 're considered words  i see you fail yeah and then uh you don't have an m a there right there is but i think it is because of their educational system because their undergraduate is already very geared towards research so after you finish your undergraduate you can proceed if you have excellent grades you can go straight away to p h d because in p h d in p h d in england we don't have we don't attend any classes we just do research we don't have class  uh uhm uh uhm how nice so   only it was quite disorienting in the first because i am not very much because i i was not part of that system so at first i was a bit disoriented yeah but in the second year i slowly yes  how was the language  the language yorkshire well if they speak with a yorkshire accent you wouldn't know what they 're talking about what is it yorkshire accent what 's that is that a native well it 's not native it 's eng it 's sort of english with a very thick very very strong let me give you an example uh i thought that was me spoken with a yorkshire accent  hoo hoo hoo hoo  i thought that was me  what time do you have twelve thirty twelve thirty i 'm going to the library yes
