mrs president in nineteen eighty-six eighty-seven you yourself gave away these two pier contracts for a song
""
we don't blame you for that because at that time you probably did not know what and how much they meant
""
you probably did not even understand the meaning of the word  arrastre  contract or stevedoring contract
""
today however after five years i hope you will pick up the phone and order the p p a board to explain to you what they are doing and why
""
 bayan naman  mrs president
""
at any rate mr senate president i move that the blue ribbon committee open investigations on this matter
""
at the very least this senate should be able to put on record the strange occurrences that this administration has allowed to pass in its dying moments so that should it go along the routes of inaction on this as in previous expos&eacute;s then we hope that you or senator enrile or senator estrada or senator pimentel or any other incoming president will order an investigation of these matters at a proper time
""
thank you mr president
""
""
senator osme&ntilde;a 
""
""
mr president will the uh gentleman yield for a few questions
""
""
uh willingly mr president to the distinguished chairman of the committee on public services who i know is also very knowledgeable with the case under scrutiny on the floor today
""
""
uh mr president i would like to congratulate our colleague senator maceda for having brought this matter up today because this representation mr president has been uh shall we say bombarded with information regarding the  rich  octopus that uh has taken over with all its tentacles the uh p p a
""
your honor in your uh study of this matter have you limited yourself to the port of manila alone
""
""
for purposes of brevity your honor we have limited although just like you i will admit that there have been information submitted to us on anomalies in the bidding of p p a contracts in different ports all over the country
""
""
uh your honor are you uh familiar or have you heard of the situation in the port of zamboanga for example
""
""
uh not uh so familiar your honor
""
maybe you could uh favor us with telling us what happened in zamboanga
""
""
well your honor one of the shipping companies that calls on zamboanga who operates out of cebu because out of the eight domestic shipping companies seven are headquarters in cebu uh told me your honor that a uh nephew of the octopus uh is the one that is controlling the port of zamboanga
""
and that this shipping company has to pay forty-five percent of its gross revenues as a kickback and uh therefore your honor  com  uh piling this up with what we heard about what 's going on in the port of butuan and in the port of cebu in the port of dumaguete in the port of iloilo and even in small ports your honor like the small port of hagnaya in northern cebu uh is your honor uh have you has your honor come to the conclusion that this practice is going on on a nationwide basis in every port in this country in one form or another
""
""
yes your honor because i have also heard of complaints about the port of batangas and the port of cagayan de oro
""
and therefore uh all of this now being of record uh would should be part of the investigations that are going to be conducted by the distinguished chairman of the blue ribbon committee
""
""
uh without wanting to overwork the distinguished chairman of the blue ribbon committee who is now also on top of a very very big uh uh anomaly like the philphos land deal may i amend your honor 's uh may i offer an amendment to your honor 's resolution referring this matter to the blue ribbon committee with the request that the blue ribbon look at the entire uh operation of p p a to cover all ports in the philippines because my information your honor is that this is not limited to the port of manila
""
""
i accept the amendment your honor
""
""
thank you mr president
""
""
thank you
""
""
senator romulo 
""
""
well mr  chai  uh mr president would the distinguished uh gentleman uh yield to a few questions
""
""
willingly uh mr president to the distinguished chairman of the committee on banks
""
""
well mr president uh uh as senator osme&ntilde;a said that was uh precisely the point that i wanted to bring up too
 that whereas you had stated uh the monopoly and other practices uh being uh uh done or undertaken by marina seven r i think i heard about metro and then as senator osme&ntilde;a stated in several other ports all over the philippines both big and small uh what is the agency that is in-charge of all of this uh mr president
""
""
it is the philippine ports authority your honor uh which happens to have uh a board headed by the uh secretary of transportation 
""
so right now it is supposed to be headed by secretary  ben castro     and  the vice-chairman of course is general manager former or retired commodore  jaime dancel 
""
""
 who who  
""
uh is uh commodore  dancel  still the general manager at present
""
""
uh yes your honor as far as i know
""
""
uh has he not been the general manager since uh at least nineteen eighty-eight
""
""
uh yes your honor uh there have been uh i think uh three changes uh i think one time it was  ceferino aguas  then i think there was a  calixto santos  and if i 'm not mistaken after that commodore  dancel  came in
""
""
so commodore  dancel  because i think uh capt  santos  was during the previous administration so commodore  dancel  has been at the head not only in nineteen eighty-eight as i posed in my question but perhaps earlier if not eighty-six perhaps eighty-seven is that correct
""
""
well your honor uh based on the uh  lease agreement signed  in nineteen eighty-seven in nineteen eighty-six it was signed by  ceferino aguas      i really don't know who  wa   i  is it is in nineteen eighty-seven because the lease agreement was signed by the chairman then  secreta  minister of transportation hernando v perez
""
""
 i see  
""
i see
""
well at any rate mr president uh the records of the case will show when in fact commodore  dancel  started as general manager
""
now mr president uh you mentioned that the chairman is uh is uh the uh secretary of transportation but what i have heard because uh several groups have also approached me lately about this uh is that it is in fact a certain jose  bustamante  i don't know if he 's undersecretary who is the chairman
""
now again it 's uh it 's a matter of record but can you uh uh try to remember whether it 's in fact uh uh undersecretary or whoever jose  bustamante  who is in fact the chairman or whether if you say that it is the secretary of transportation perhaps then  bustamante  sits or stands for him
""
can you tell us uh if you     can remember what is the status of this chairmanship
""
""
 yes  
""
yes your honor uh the chairman is secretary  ben castro 
""
""
i see
""
""
uh however most of the time     undersecretary  bustamante  uh uh sits for him
""
but based on my information and again this has got to be uh confirmed or denied during the investigations uh probably part of the reason why secretary  castro  precisely has not sat on these meetings is that he as well as uh mr philip tuazon of marina there are two of them seem not to be in agreement with this particular uh extension
""
  but it seems  that there are some people who are exerting representations let us not say pressure at this time for them to grant not only the ten years but the twenty-five-year extension
""
""
 uhm  
""
 i see  
""
okay
""
""
uh but in fact uh mr president whether as chairman or sitting for the chairman who is the secretary of transportation in fact isn't it true that uh mr jose  bustamante  has been the one sitting not only now that secretary  castro  has been appointed interim or acting but even before and so that uh the fact that undersecretary  bustamante  is there is only uh uh continuing what was the practice before uh  ben castro  took over as acting secretary
 is that not correct
""
""
that 's probably the case your honor and at least in the last meeting last thursday it was undersecretary jose  bustamante  who presided
""
""
now mr president uh in the case of the p p a uh under what department is the p p a connected mr president
""
""
it is attached to the department of transportation and communications
""
""
and being attached to the department of transportation and communication as in fact the chairman is the secretary  1 word  or the undersecretary of transportation what is the scope of supervision monitoring authority etcetera of the department of transportation and communication with said p p a and the actuations of p p a with these various uh entities that you had mentioned
""
""
well technically your honor it is not under the complete control of the secretary of transportation as secretary but it is under the control of the uh p p a board of which he happens to be chairman
""
so uh it is more  lo  uh more or less uh if you may use the word  semi-autonomous 
""
but still the chairman being the secretary of transportation uh he should uh exercise uh almost uhm uh what we say absolute uh supervision over this particular matter
""
now the only problem here is and that 's why maybe uh it should be clarified in fairness to him why we brought in uh the name of executive secretary  mario carlos  is as you know  ben castro  is still an o i c
""
 ben castro  uh has not been submitted to the commission on appointments and the impression in the whole d o t c is that anything that happens in the d o t c still must have to be cleared with executive secretary  mario carlos 
""
""
well mr president not only that but in point of fact uh the the items the juicy items that you have been mentioning did not only happen when uh acting secretary  ben castro  took over  i 
 is that not correct
""
or are you saying that all of this that you have enumerated and detailed happened only starting from the time that uh mr  ben castro  took over as acting secretary
""
can you clarify
""
""
now you are correct your honor  ma  the uh after uh secretary rainiero reyes uh uh was able to successfully insist on awarding the uh contract for the m i c t to razon after that secretary  as   carlos  came in as you know and uh at least i think in the otsi case the ocean terminal services incorporated uh secretary  carlos  was uh already the secretary
""
now in the case of marina i 'm not quite sure whether it was still in the matter of the acquisition of marina lately whether it was still  carlos  or it was acting secretary arturo corona who as you know also was a proteg&eacute; of executive secretary  mario carlos 
""
""
uh so that what you are saying mr president is that all of this did not only occur starting from the take over as o i c of uh acting secretary uh  break in the recording  is that most of this if not all of this occurred after the incumbency of secretary rainiero reyes
""
""
uh yes your honor except the original uh change of contract in eighty-seven which reflected more favorable terms to seven r that occurred during the incumbency of minister hernando perez before secretary reyes
""
""
well so  e  with those uh uh uh few exceptions all of this has occurred between the period after secretary reyes and the assumption of acting secretary  ben castro 
""
""
yes your honor with one little uh uh modification
 the questioned attempt today to grant a twenty-five-year extension uh which started maybe two or three months ago is now under the administration of  ben castro 
""
""
uh but it has not been consummated yet
""
""
not yet your honor
""
""
and as you 've stated uh  ben castro  does not even attend and in fact there is a continuity in the person of uh undersecretary or assistant secretary or whatever his title is jose  bustamante  whose continuity starts from the time after uh uh minister or secretary rainiero reyes and the present acting incumbent
 is that   not  correct
""
""
 that   that would be correct your honor
""
""
well mr president this is very important because mr president the  unholy alliance  that i don't know if you used that phrase did you use that phrase
""
""
i 'm not sure now whether i did
""
""
well at any rate mr president this is what the groups that have approached me lately uh have told me
""
this unholy alliance between the p p a and several of this uh well probably the word is not several but this monopoly of  arrastre  and stevedoring uh is a general perception in the pier mr president
""
and so this is nothing that is uh new mr president
""
uh are you aware of this that uh you know this is the general perception in the in the south and the north harbor that there is an unholy alliance between the p p a and these monopolies of  arrastre  and stevedoring
 is that correct mr president
""
""
and uh that is correct mr president and if i may add with uh uh there is a perception that there is a spin-off into certain smuggling operations and there is an unholy alliance at that point which includes officials of the bureau of customs
""
""
yes mr president
""
and have you also been informed mr president now of course uh uh this is up to us to invite but uh the  lighterage  association and the other users of the uh ports importers exporters shipping lines have in fact brought this to the attention of secretary  carlos  when he was still secretary of transportation and communication
""
 ha  are you aware of that or have you had that information from this group that they have in fact brought this to the information of secretary  carlos  not now but before yet in nineteen ninety and perhaps even before
""
are you aware of that
""
""
i 'm not aware of that your honor and i 'm thankful that you have brought that up because uh uh this only uh strengthens uh the uh representations that we have made in our speech
""
""
now mr president if this is so that it has been brought to the attention both of the p p a and the secretary of transportation by the importers the exporters the shipping lines the port owners uh the  lighterage  association and all of this uh do you believe therefore that since this was brought to their attention they could have done something about it not now but in nineteen ninety nineteen eighty-nine or nineteen eighty-eight
""
""
uh that 's correct your honor and since they did not then it strengthens our uh assertion that it was because uh there are very powerful backers supporting this octopus at the piers
""
""
well the only reason why i have brought that up is because you have raised that question what role is the executive secretary formerly of the d o t c playing in the spinning of this monopolistic web why is d o t c o i c  ben castro  who is p p a chairman so strangely silent on all these things
""
so that is the reason why i am bringing to your attention matters that have been brought to my attention by these groups
""
""
thank you your honor
""
""
so uh but you you have not been informed about this mr president   that this  has been brought directly to the attention of the higher ups specifically those that we have mentioned
""
""
no  your honor  
""
no your honor uh what has been brought to my attention is that uh messrs dizon atayde rocha and company have been name-dropping uh the name of secretary  carlos  and uh i understand there was one confrontation where uh mr  ben castro  uh blew up and said uh uh you should not pressure me on this by name-dropping the the name of secretary  carlos 
""
""
well at any rate uh in the hearing of the blue ribbon committee uh these various groups will be summoned should be summoned and i hope that under oath they will make the same statement that they have given to me mr president at least as to the facts
""
i am not saying that there is anybody in cahoots
""
i 'm just saying that this has been brought to the attention of the higher ups and that up to now obviously because of this privilege speech nothing has yet been done
""
or has something been done mr president
""
""
not that i know of uh your   honor as  i said uh the other uh development lately is they have started to try to take over the ninoy aquino international airport cargo handling services and senator osme&ntilde;a 's brought out the fact that they are operating nationwide uh which i did not really mention in my speech
""
""
 i see  
""
well mr president i have mentioned  unholy alliance  between the p p a and several of this group
 i think what you have mentioned is the tentacles of the octopus which is trying to extend uh not only within the north and south harbor but even beyond
""
but one other point mr president uh in the case of the p p a are you aware of the twenty-seven million ghost drainage project
""
""
uh no your honor i am not aware of that particular project
""
""
well uh i thought i would bring that up mr president because this has also been the subject of uh a lot of complaint and representation by the  lighterage  association of the philippines to the p p a and to the chairman and the secretary but again mr president nothing has been done about this twenty-seven million uh ghost uh uh drainage project
""
and mr president uh we only have to establish that there is a twenty-seven million contract and the fact that the pasig river that portion which has is supposed to be drained is still not drained and is still a hazard or an obstacle to shipping
""
and nothing has been done about that in  s  fact in spite of the fact that this has been brought up in so many fora by the uh associations involved in this nothing has been done by the p p a
""
""
well i 'm glad that you brought that up your honor and uh therefore it should also be included within the scope of the investigation
""
""
well finally mr president i think the tell-tale and the significant portion of all of this is as you said the chairman or secretary of transportation exercises absolute supervision and authority and therefore therein hangs the tale mr president
""
thank you mr president
""
""
thank you uh your honor and i 'm certainly relieved that senator osme&ntilde;a gentleman from cebu and you have added to my privilege speech because there is always a tendency on the part of these people to immediately deny it and charge that uh either i 'm lying or i have no basis
""
at least in this speech today uh two members of this uh chamber have immediately come forward to uh validate uh uh at least uh a substantial portion of our privilege speech
""
