""
""
you didn't hear like things fall down like you know

""
""
uh uhm    and  then there
""
""
 yeah  
""
there  kasi  in  ano  we were in uhm
""
""
makati
""
""
makati in that in that club fun thing
""
""
glorietta
""
""
glorietta
""
""
uh uhm
""
""
where that party was 'cause of that gatecrasher came here right
""
so there was a big party a d j party  so  ang daming tao  and then all i thought we were staying by like a few steps by the d j 's booth and what separated the d j 's booth from the dance floor was like a ledge right
""
and it was like maybe a foot wide and i saw  kasi  people uhm would put their glasses and their bottles on top of the ledge so what i did was i was going down the steps
""
it was like  mga  around two three feet away and right when i reached my hand up 'cause i wanna push back the bottles and the glasses 'cause people kept on bumping into the ledge i was gonna push them back and all of a sudden before you know nobody hit the ledge but the bottles kinda tipped over right into it fell into my hand
""
so and that 's when i felt swaying like really  lakas  really strong
""
i swayed back and forth
""
even the d j was like what the hell is going on
""
everybody was swaying
""
 some of my friends thought it was the effects of the place of the club
""
yeah  be  because everybody was high everybody was on whatever
""
 and there were like laser shows   and all  of that
""
""
 uh uhm  
""
""
and people it was it was it was as strong as it was like the tide that you could get knocked off your feet     if you were like uh unsteady or something
""
it 's really strong i had to i had to hold on to my friend
""
we were hugging each other 'cause it it was like  ang lakas grabe  
""
so there and the thing is you know after that right after it happened  uhm my boy friend and i was let 's go let 's get out of here because aftershocks  daw  are   strong 
""
""
 uh uhm  
""
 are worse  
""
""
are worse so you we had to get out of the building
""
we couldn't take the elevator because we know it 's stupid
""
so we went to the parking lot and uh
""
""
took the stairs
""
""
and took the stairs and a lot of people were going out but the thing is like maybe half of the people were still stayed in there
""
they were still partying and the d j just kept on going
""
he 's like what am i gonna to continue or and everybody was cheering and okay we 'll continue
""
they started playing and then everybody was there shouting you know  it was kinda
""
""
stupid
""
""
stupid because you know  di ba 
""
""
people don't realize that things like that happen for a reason
""
it 's not just
""
""
yeah exactly and they didn't kinda piece it together that you know earthquakes have been happening in first in turkey and i don't know where else but it was  sunod-sunod  right
""
it was right one after
""
""
signs in signs of the coming of the end of the world
""
""
i know it said in the bible and these people aren't even scared i mean  di ba  i was telling you before  it was like the perfect setting for it to happen
""
i wasn't even surprised that it happened because you 're here amidst all these people who are high on something or drunk or whatever and it 's kinda like that image when uhm  uh when when people are
""
""
 parang  they turned in salt  from the bible  what was that
""
""
no the one where they were uhm they were like worshipping that golden cow or something that they have made
""
""
uh yeah yeah yeah and when you look back the the person who looks back will turn into salt
""
""
uh that 's the one
""
""
uh uhm that 's it
""
""
okay so it was kinda like that i i kinda  re   parang  i pictured in my head  na  this is the scene from the bible only we 're not by a mountain we 're in a party and these people are worshipping the wrong thing
""
""
  i know 
""
""
 they 're   enjoying the wrong thing worshipping their drugs their fun their hedonistic whatever
""
and it was like that earthquake was kinda like the lord 's voice from above
""
remember when  di ba  in the bible it says uhm there 's a loud voice from above or something like that
""
""
uh uhm  that was so that was so scary
""
i was so scared and
""
""
what did you do
""
""
uhm when i woke up i wasn't even sure because i was i was sitting on the bed and i was i was just sitting there for the longest time waiting for it to stop because it because i couldn't move and i was i felt so dizzy and then after it like after like i looked outside and looked if everything was fine if
""
""
yeah
""
""
there is if there 's a fire or whatever and then i called my friend dianne
""
and she 's this religious type she 's really
""
""
yeah
""
""
right she 's i i i called her i talked to her
""
and we were praying over the phone and we were saying stuff like uhm people are out partying while uhm god is getting mad  na  and stuff  and then there we were so scared
""
there was crying over the phone
""
""
dianne was crying also
""
""
yeah we were crying we were and we called i don't know we texted we called christine
""
we found out she went to that party and   she 's  also scared
""
""
 yeah  
""
i saw her i was there
""
""
and there
""
""
and the thing is another friend christine  montalvo  they didn't even leave right away
""
they saw that i was leaving with jim and i 'm on i 'm going i 'm leaving this place let 's get out of here and they 're like you know they didn't make   me  pansin  
""
""
 uh uhm uh uhm  
""
""
they were just you know there dancing and i was like what the hell is going on with these people
""
""
christine was scared she told me   after  she she went home right away with her sister but then when they when they were on their way home people from condos were outside
""
""
 yeah  
""
""
some of them were some of them were even wearing robes
""
""
yeah
""
""
because they were so scared
""
""
in the hotel in hotel uhm   i think 
""
""
 nikko  
""
""
nikko  ba yon 
""
""
i don't know  somewhere there in glorietta
""
""
or new world or something like that  basta  the one that 's  malapit 
""
""
uh uhm
""
""
uhm the security made everybody get out of the room intercon i think intercon something i don't i forgot what what uhm hotel it was
""
and then everybody was going out but we had to pee so we had to go in and go to the bathroom and then right away they they told us to leave to get out and there were security all over
""
i guess there were some important persons there
""
""
 grabe 'no 
""
the signs are everywhere but then
""
""
i know
""
""
everybody just goes on with their lives and not thinking of what may happen in the future
""
""
it 's more of like they 're brushing it aside   they don't  they don't  di ba  they don't wanna deal with it
""
""
 uh uhm that 's it  
""
""
they don't wanna think about it
""
they don't wanna feel scared
""
""
sometimes when i tell my friend when i tell them like i feel like it 's going to be the end of the world soon they 're like can you not talk like that
""
""
exactly they don't wanna
""
""
it 's true it 's gonna happen soon so why not face it while and be ready when it comes
""
""
exactly
""
but they don't wanna face it
""
they wanna go on and do whatever they 've been doing
""
they don't want the reality of god 's power to to kinda rain on their parade kinda thing
""
they wanna enjoy they wanna do what they want
""
they don't wanna have to uhm you know  speaker a says something but unclear 
""
they don't wanna deal with their conscience
""
""
uh uhm
""
""
 di ba 
""
""
'cause they know things are really going bad and and they 're not doing anything about it and  sometimes they 're just not really interested anymore
""
""
exactly
""
it it 's like they don't wanna feel anything  di ba 
""
it 's sad  e  
""
""
people are so uhm apathetic
""
""
yeah
""
especially here in the philippines i 've noticed that and and it 's ironic  kasi  here everybody is supposed to be so catholic and so christian and blah blah blah blah blah
""
but look what they 're doing they 're not doing anything
""
""
but sometimes it 's extremes some are really religious and and you know god-fearing and whatever and some are they just don't care as long as they have the pleasures of life they they they have they have uhm they have money they have whatever they can get everything is fine as long as they 're living a a normal and and  what
""
""
well that 's what i 'm saying  kanina  like
they 're worshipping the wrong things like what you said perhaps people are happy that they have uh a good home they have money to buy food they have money to buy clothes  ganyan  and they 're worshipping money they 're worshipping you know these material things that you won't even be be able to bring with you when you die
