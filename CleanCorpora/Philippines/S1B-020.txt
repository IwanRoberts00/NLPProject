""
""
so whatever you get out of ten is your percentage grade right
""
let 's say for example you get six out of ten sixty percent
""
i 'll just put that on your recitation grade
""
so over all whatever recitation points you get we 'll just average it and uh it 's going to be considered over a hundred okay
""
now  i haven't checked the papers yet so  most probably i 'll give it back to you by wednesday okay
""
but anyway oh is there a tape recorder
""
uh oh sorry
""
so anyway uh i got conscious because the tape recorder is there
""
but anyway i 'll give everybody a chance to speak so we 'll all get recorded  laughter 
""
come on oh it 's not running
""
it 's just there for display
""
no no don't worry about it
""
just imagine it 's not there okay
""
now  don't worry about it you don't have to be conscious  laughter 
""
it 's not going to take a picture of you  laughter  
""
okay so uhm this is a course which is supposed to talk about contemporary national development
""
and before we go further into that uh we have to talk about  development and growth first as contrasted with one another okay
""
so i think in the in the quiz i gave you i asked the question about development right
""
so what do you think is development
""
ms maralit myla
""
""
sir uhm the process of development is the process of improving the quality of life
""
""
it 's the process of improving the quality of life
""
the end-all objective of course of development is to improve welfare right
""
so when we talk about an improvement in welfare it automatically means an improvement in the standard of living
""
but anyway uhm let 's try to get a more comprehensive definition of economic development
""
so aside from improving the standard of living is there any other thing aside from the process of improving the standard of living is there any other thing you would like to add to what ms maralit said
""
ms lee mirabel
""
""
aside from aside from that uh economic development is increasing people 's freedom to choose
""
""
so increasing people 's freedom to choose
""
so if you have a wide variety of choices it means that you are also approaching development
""
why
""
""
for example  words 
""
""
uh uhm so is it good for us or is it bad for us 
""
so for the consumer it 's generally good right
""
if you have a wide variety of products to buy which are going to satisfy you it 's generally good
""
so aside from process of improving standards of living aside from having a wider variety of choices is there any other thing uh you would like to add to  de   development 
""
ms de leon
""
where are you ms de leon
""
""
de lara
""
""
sorry de lara
""
let me write this down again
""
can i borrow your pen please
""
 o  ms de lara
""
""
uhm it involves changes in structure uh  words 
""
""
okay so let 's talk about the actual  gi  definition given in the text okay
""
so if you take a look at different economic development textbooks you will find different definitions but if you take a look at the  darish  text i think it gives the most comprehensive definition of what development is okay
""
so let 's try to give that definition and let 's look at it one by one okay   writes on the board 
""
okay now so in all my economic development classes as well as in all of my conadev  course code for contemporary national development  classes i normally start out with this definition okay
""
and then i ask the rest of you to try and translate it for me
""
so it  is a multidimensional process which involves changes in structures attitudes institutions inclusive of sustained increases in output creation of more jobs and eradication of mass poverty 
""
now in the definition do you find economic growth there
""
ms de lara
""
""
yes
""
""
where is economic growth there in the definition
""
""
sustained increases in output
""
""
okay so when you talk about sustained increase in output this is actually the definition of economic growth
""
so going back to the quiz i gave  is economic growth the same as economic development 
""
ms de lara
""
""
uhm for me economic growth is part of economic development
""
""
so it 's not necessarily the same right
""
they 're not the same because economic development covers a wider scope compared to economic growth
""
economic growth is just talking about sustained increases in output
""
on the other hand development covers a lot of other things outside of economic growth right
""
so the answer there is they 're not the same okay
""
now if you read the  darish  text and you were able to give me this answer this is an automatic five points for you
""
now if you gave something which is close i give you a four
""
if you if you write something there which has the idea and uh  despite writing it in different words although the idea is the same i might give you a three or a three point five out of five points
""
now if it 's if it 's really far off uh i can give you maybe one point five or one okay
""
but anyway as long as you give me an idea which is relatively close to the definition i 'll give you points for it okay
""
now let 's try to  talk about the definition phrase by phrase okay
""
what exactly is the meaning of  multidimensional  
""
mr gello  pronounced with a j  uhm
""
""
gello  pronounced with an h 
""
""
gello  pronounced with an h  sorry
""
""
it involves different aspects of the economy
""
""
so  multi  means  many right
""
multidimensional
""
so it means many facets or many faces
""
so aside from having a multidimensional process it involves changes in structures
""
so let 's take a look at structures 
""
okay
""
so development involves changes in structures
""
multidimensional process
""
let 's take a look at the structures one by one
""
what particular structures are you aware of 
""
uhm what is a structure in the first place 
""
april  de castro
""
 ha  what is a structure anyway
""
""
it 's like a framework
""
""
framework correct
""
so a structure is a framework
""
now what kind of structure are we aware of existing today  uhm
""
in your everyday life it 's a set-up right
""
it 's a framework
""
so in our everyday life do we know of any structure which is existing 
""
uh let 's be more specific
""
in terms of people
""
so when you talk about classes of people how are they categorized
""
commonly
""
""
uhm  bale  their purchasing power uhm their wealth
""
""
so people are normally classified in terms of income brackets right
""
so when you have different classes of people you automatically talk about social structure  di ba  
""
as part of development ms de castro is there anything you would like to change regarding the social structure
""
""
yes
""
""
what
""
""
'cause uhm if we  words  still go on with the present structure i don't think we can achieve uhm uhm a development probably because most of uhm it 's a the prevailing framework is uh  bale  that the rich are getting richer the rich gets richer and the poor gets poorer
""
""
what exactly is the existing social structure in the philippines
""
can you show it 
""
is it possible to illustrate social structure in the philippines
""
how does it look like 
""
""
upper middle middle class
""
""
so in what form does it look does it take
""
so it looks more like a pyramid right
""
so if you take a look at the social structure in the philippines it looks like a pyramid
""
why is it considered a pyramid
""
""
small parts  bale  the top of the pyramid which consists of the upper class is relatively smaller than that of the lower class
""
""
okay so when you talk about income classes  and you talk about a specific number of people okay there are only a few people belonging to the upper income class and then the majority belongs to the lower income class or what we call the masses okay
""
 mga masa  okay
""
now  if you talk about the actual income which goes to them  you can also make use of a pyramid to illustrate it but this time around it 's inverted right
""
 di ba  
""
a majority of the income in this particular case goes to the smaller upper class while a small portion of the income is distributed among the masses
""
so this is the existing social structure in the philippines
""
that 's why you have different classes of people upper middle and lower class
""
okay now if you go outside of the philippines especially if you go to india for example there is a stricter social structure okay
""
so they have the caste system wherein they have four social structures which are more rigid and there is no way by which you can move up
""
if you are born in that particular structure you cannot move up anymore
""
you 're stuck with that particular class
""
on the other hand for countries like the philippines okay despite people belonging or beside despite a lot of people belonging to the masses there is still a chance to move up as long as you become successful in life right
""
now as part of development is there a need to change the existing social structure
""
ms de castro said yes
""
why ms de castro
""
""
uhm because if we maintain uhm the the actual distribution of income as it is i don't think that uhm there would be uhm as if uhm evident  words  uhm a clear development of that could be seen from the lower class
""
""
what is the consequence of a growing lower income class  ha 
""
what is the consequence of expanding this base
""
let 's say for example this base keeps on growing
""
is there any consequence to that 
""
uhm  aniceto 
""
uh what
""
""
what is the consequence of a growing uhm lower income class
""
""
 oo  what 's the consequence to it
""
""
uhm more people will be uhm needing uh needing needing jobs uh they need to uhm have a means of living
""
so we 'll be  words 
""
""
so it creates a greater population pressure right
""
aside from these people suffering from low income
""
but aside from that is there any other uh consequence which is drastic
""
ms  uh ms casigura  unclear statement by the student 
""
uh so let 's say for example the lower income classes are suffering from poverty
""
if the poverty gets worse and more people become poor what is the consequence of that
""
uh what are we experiencing today
""
what problem what 's the biggest problem of the military
""
 sir, insurgency
""
""
insurgency
""
what is the biggest problem of the police
""
 crime
""
""
crime
""
so when you talk about insurgency and crime this all leads to social unrest okay
""
social unrest
""
so if you do not try and change the existing class structure it will lead to social unrest especially if the mass the masses increase and they suffer from more poverty okay
""
so when they 're in poverty it 's automatic they suffer from low levels of living but what i was asking for was the consequence
""
if you don't solve the problem ultimately it 's going to result to more crime
""
it might result to people joining the insurgency because they want to change the whole system okay
""
uh so that 's one
""
what other structures are you aware of
""
mr toledo
""
what other structure are you aware of which needs changing aside from social structure
""
""
political
""
""
uh political
""
what about  political  
""
what exactly is politics mr toledo 
""
when you say that politicians are uh no let 's let 's rephrase that
""
when we say that uh people are playing politics what exactly is the meaning of that
""
when the word  politics  comes to mind what 's the first thing you think of
""
mr toledo
""
""
power
""
""
power okay power
""
so when you talk about political science it it studies the reallocation of power right
""
 pagka ang mga tao namumulitika ibig sabihin ano 
""
they try to influence people right
""
and of course influence comes with wealth and power okay
""
now what exactly is the existing political structure in the philippines
""
mr toledo 
""
what kind of government do you have
""
uh democratic form of government right
""
democratic form of government
""
now is there anything wrong about having a democratic form of government
""
is it efficient
""
is it able to provide enough public services what
""
uhm mr toledo  unclear statement by the student 
""
uhm so most of the rich people have the positions in government okay
""
by the way when you talk about our government okay the democratic presidential form of government it 's divided into three branches right
""
judicial legislative and executive
""
so mrs aquino and all of her cabinet members belong under the executive house right
""
it 's called the  executive  because they execute they are supposed to execute all of the policies they are supposed to implement all of the programs
""
when you talk about legislative  law-making right
""
law-making and then when you talk about judicial they take care of settling disputes okay through the courts the legal system
""
now  there are different types of democratic systems right
""
you have presidential you have parliamentary
""
question in the philippines uh do you think the presidential form of government is effectively giving public services to all of us
""
mr catabian
""
where are you uh  oo 'yong gobyerno natin ngayon  is it giving efficient services public services for all of us
""
present government
""
""
sir uhm in my opinion
""
""
 o  in your opinion
""
""
 hindi masyadong marami   words 
""
""
delegation of responsibilities why did you say that
""
""
'cause sometimes the responsibilities overlap
""
""
overlap so it 's not  red tape  anymore
""
it 's a matter of defining function
""
""
sir  red tape  is another thing
""
""
 red tape  is another thing
""
let 's talk about something which is more concrete something which we experience every day
""
something which you can blame on government 
""
 garbage
""
""
 o  garbage garbage right garbage
""
something which you can blame on government
""
all of us pay taxes by the way none of you are paying taxes yet but your parents pay taxes we pay taxes okay
""
so we expect efficient public services
""
but what is the problem
""
efficient services are not being given okay
""
and garbage is one example
""
garbage is piling up everywhere
""
collection seems to be very very inefficient
""
in fact drainages are being clogged because of garbage the reason is there aren't enough dump sites okay
""
so what is happening
""
so it must be the fault of the government right
""
