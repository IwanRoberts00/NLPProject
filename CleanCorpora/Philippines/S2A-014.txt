 missing words  p c a open tennis championship
""
this is mia fernandez with mr ron de los reyes
""
ron
""
""
yes uh very pleasant day uh sports fans
""
we 're coming to you from the center court of the philippine columbian association here in plaza dilao in uh paco manila
""
and uh we 're going to bring you the finals in both the men 's and women 's events of the tenth or the nineteen ninety-one edition of the p c a open the most prestigious uh tournament in the country
 mia
""
""
ron this is going to be a very exciting match because these women 's finals are going to be uh very very uh memorable because this is between the two top players of the country
""
number one is jennifer sared who is a veteran asian campaigner and always a team member of the asian team while the other side is joanna feria the number two
""
she is the lone filipina to reach past the second round of the wimbledon juniors
""
""
that 's right and of course both players are fresh from their trip to wimbledon where uh as you mentioned joanna feria uh won in her first assignment but uh lost in the second
""
of course uh jennifer sared is also a veteran internationalist having won some of the uh junior titles in southeast asia
""
and of course uh later on after this uh match we are going to bring you the men 's championship between jun allerre and of course robert uh bobby angelo two new faces in the p c a uh finals list
""
""
jun allerre has been the national coach of the men 's and the women 's junior team since nineteen ninety
""
so it 's going to be exciting because bobby angelo just came from the states where he learned new strokes and now he is more powerful
""
by the way the tenth p c a open tennis championship is being brought to you by san miguel beer super dry milo stronghold insurance company grant sportswear only store easy call copacabana hotel the a g q construction integrated sales and of course nike
""
let 's go to the men 's doubles
""
the men 's doubles will pit danilo pila and camoy palaha against jun allerre and bobby angelo are  semi-fi  our finalists for the men 's finals
""
so that 's going to be pretty exciting
""
that comes after the men 's finals between bobby angelo and jhun allerre
""
""
uh well what do you think uh of this uh match mia
""
""
jennifer sared has more experience more exposure in the local and international scene
""
but joanna feria has been moving very well
""
her  forehand has been consistent and so is her backhand
""
so you really can't tell although jennifer sared has the upper hand
""
""
that 's right
""
uh before going into the finals of course jennifer sared adventured to beat francesca la'o in the philippine international junior tennis championships uh held last april where she lost to uh uh francesca la'o in uh in the finals
""
""
joanna  fer  feria made it to the finals by beating bao kim in the semi-finals in the exciting three setter
""
she really showed her persistence and patience in that match ron
""
""
that 's right 
""
well not everybody knows that uh the girl on the other side joanna feria also competed in track and field before really concentrating in uh the game of tennis
""
as i was talking earlier to her father uh nonoy feria and he said that uh well joanna was part of the track and field team that went to beijing in the nineteen ninety asian games
""
""
that 's right
""
too bad she had to quit because she she had leg injury already
""
but then she chose tennis because she feels that she is going to do more in tennis than in track and field
""
it 's already love fifteen in favor of joanna feria with jennifer sared serving 
""
""
our drives by uh jennifer sared
""
""
you know ron that looked like an unforced error
""
but if you just could see the power in the forehand of jennifer sared then the spin just was too much for joanna feria then
""
""
that 's right
""
uh fifteen all is the count
""
this is the first game of the first set 
""
another error by joanna feria
""
""
both players are still playing near the baseline
""
maybe trying to feel each other out
""
""
right 
""
""
it 's thirty fifteen in favor of jennifer sared 
""
there 's a fault 
""
""
second big rally here 
""
first time on the net
""
it 's out
""
""
that 's too bad
""
joanna feria had the chance to make a beautiful approach out and go for the winner but then she just sort of blundered
""
it 's forty fifteen in favor of jennifer sared 
""
nice short  clapping 
""
  this special is brought to you by san miguel super dry beer in cooperation with milo nescafe and coffeemate 
""
""
joanna feria served with feria leading with feria down love one in the first set 
""
okay 
""
another unforced error in the backhand by joanna feria
""
you know in the national level you can't afford to make too many of those 
""
a double fault by joanna feria 
""
maybe she still has opening set jitters but she 'll go come over it she has to
""
""
so looking at the score board
""
it said joanna feria is leading
""
i think our umpire there  yes uh it 's supposed to be thirty fifteen in favor of jennifer 
""
""
the score is fifteen thirty with joanna feria serving 
""
beautiful rally here 
""
thirty all joanna feria has come back from down love thirty to thirty all with her long baseline rallies
""
""
i think she 's playing with uh more confidence now uh compared to the first game of the set
""
""
that 's right 
""
jennifer wasn't able to make the ball go over the net as her racket was just too high
""
it 's now forty thirty
""
""
and joanna feria will now go for the game point and the chance here for joanna to even the score at one all in the first set 
""
""
oh bad choice of shot there by joanna feria
""
she was at the baseline and she opted for a drop shot
""
""
missed opportunity by joanna to level the count at one all 
""
""
joanna feria dictating the point here 
""
""
powerful backhand by jennifer sared forced uh joanna feria to commit that uh error
""
let 's take a look at the slow-mo brought to you by milo the olympic energy drink
""
there 's a
""
""
a powerful backhand a  1 word  shot by jennifer sared which cost joanna feria a point
""
it 's now advantage sared 
""
""
second serve 
""
""
first we would like to thank the sponsors of the tenth p c a open tennis championships milo the olympic energy drink grant stronghold nike copacabana a g q construction integrated sales easy call sportswear only store nodalos and  pro-technics  
""
it 's now deuce 
""
second serve for joanna feria 
""
let 's not forget san miguel super dry beer  and
""
""
yes the first double fault of uh joanna feria
""
""
that was a costly double fault
""
""
and that fault uh jennifer on the advantage needing only a point here to win the second game 
""
""
backhand to backhand rally 
""
""
and the second game going to jennifer sared two love in the first set 
""
""
i think the turning point there was the double fault by joanna feria
""
it gave jennifer sared the upper hand and the confidence to go more for the second serve
""
let 's look at the slow-mo of that brought to us by milo the olympic energy drink
""
""
she had at least uh two or three times or three chances to make the second game but lost it
""
""
that 's right 
""
just a little out by the backhand of jennifer sared
""
seems like this match is going to be punctuated by long rallies ron
""
""
that 's right and uh well both players are opting to go for the baseline
""
and so we can expect that kind of play in this championship
""
and so far  i think that was the first time jennifer went uh to the net
""
let 's take a look at the slow-mo brought to you by milo
""
""
there 's the short and the beautiful cross court by jennifer sared
""
""
fifteen love uh fifteen all   3 words 
""
first serve by jennifer sared 
""
backhand to backhand rally
""
again jennifer is forcing uh that error by that backhand error by joanna feria
""
""
joanna feria 's doing the right thing
""
she 's making jennifer sared move
""
because jennifer can't stay at the baseline all day
""
it just gives the balls to her
""
""
thirty fifteen 
""
""
just a little out by jennifer sared
""
it 's thirty all 
""
""
forty thirty with jennifer sared leading
""
the first serves 've been coming in lately
""
that 's one of the advantages of being a little bit taller 
""
beautiful rally by both players
""
backhand to backhand again 
""
jennifer sared dictating the point now moving joanna feria 
""
""
beautiful backhand to jennifer by joanna feria
""
""
she capitalized on that short ball by jennifer sared
""
there it is brought to you by milo
""
there is that beautiful cross court which caused jennifer sared an error
""
it 's now deuce 
""
by the way we want to thank milo the olympic energy drink for supporting the tenth p c a open tennis championships 
""
another major supporter of the p c a open is san miguel super dry beer the difference is dry 
""
""
jennifer gains the upper hand  in this third game of the first set
""
a very elusive point there uh mia     for both players
""
""
 that 's right  
""
that 's right
""
if jennifer holds her serve she 's up three love 
""
jennifer sared again dictating the point  moving joanna feria to and fro
""
""
sared wins this third game
""
she now leads three love
""
and we will continue with the action after we pause for these important reminders  commercial break

""
it 's now thirty love   clapping 
""
""
beautiful attack to the net by joanna feria
""
""
let 's see the slow-mo brought to you by milo the olympic energy drink
""
there is that beautiful cross court by joanna feria coming from a pure poorly executed drop shot by jennifer sared
