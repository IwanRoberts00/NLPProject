what 's up nothing much busy with school how about you uhm quite busy too and with the finals coming it 's really been toxic   yeah really toxic man anyway have you talked to bea have you seen her lately bea three four weeks ago and but you know that she has a new guy right the new guy yeah she made mention of one i think his name is julio i can't even remember oh yeah laughter  the new guy with the long hair laughter  long hair white yeah white yeah do you find him cute do you find him cute okay i haven't really seen him but i think they 're really bagay what do you think uhm i 'm not really sure pa but break in the recording  anyway i had a bad thought i was at bea 's house last night she in she invited me over to uh she uh she invited me to have dinner over at her house 'cause it was her lola 's birthday she even made me sing in front of her family why didn't she invite me uhm because she realized sure that you can't make it chuckle  but anyway anyway and then what happened  ay sorry it 's okay it 's okay what happened but anyway uh she she made kwento about julio so they 've been dating for three months you know that uhm i uh well what i heard was she has a crush on him but not but you didn't know that ton uh sorry julio like her dude no no no really anyway so they 've been going out they 've been dating for three months and like they know that they like each other uhm they confessed to each other already but the thing is uhm bea i think she 's fou found out last night that i think she asked julio if he was like okay he was if he was just fine with their relationship with what 's going on with them right now 'cause they 're like they 're you can't say that they 're just friends 'cause they 're already committed with each other  really  yeah they 're really close and like but you can't say that they 're lovers 'cause you know it 's so sad tony is not uh sorry julio why do i keep mentioning that guy 's name i 'll forget him anyway julio is not yet ready to commit what 's even more sad about it is that bea yeah bea is ready i mean julio is her her first guy i mean she hasn't had any boyfriend yeah she haven't had any boyfriend well julio is not actually her boyfriend but yeah the one she 's willing to commit with  ye yeah and it 's so you know it 's so sad 'cause finally she 's done with her you know playing whatever she calls it games whatever with guys but and now she 's finally ready to have a commitment with a guy and and word  yeah but i 'm sure even though i don't know julio that much i 'm quite sure that he really likes bea a lot maybe he 's just yeah scared so you think that 's what 's stopping him that 's it i mean he is just scared i mean not   well act  what what do you have to say i don't know 'cause if you just if you say that he 's just scared don't you think it 's a bit what lame such a lame excuse to say that uh the guy is just afraid of committing or not yet ready i mean if you love someone you have to be willing to risk it you know what you 're right if i don't know i just can't seem to blame this guy i heard that he had a very bad break-up with his you know former girlfriend and like i think he left for states and uhm so he made paalam to the girl and then the girl you know his former girlfriend his ex yeah his ex uhm told him that it 's okay uh i 'll wait for you 'cause i really love you ganyan ganyan and all that stuff   words  and like so the guy was like okay 'cause he was really in love with that girl and when he came back from from states he found out that just a few months after he left the girl had a new guy huh so okay sad for him yeah it 's so sad sad for him oh yeah so there you know so you think that 's his excuse actually i haven't really talked to this guy so i 'm just assuming that it 's that 's his reason but you know it 's just so why do i keep on saying it 's sad well it is sad but i don't know i mean i 've met guys who like had bad break-ups and all   yeah  but i mean to say that you 're afraid because of your past that you might do something wrong that whatever  well anyway   that 's not how love goes yeah that 's how i think well we don't know their reasons so would let me just ask you what do you think about their relationship right now like they go out they date uhm they 're more than friends they 're you know parang m u = mutual understanding  fun it 's actually more than that more than just m u  well for me i think that i mean even if like she 's saying that she 's okay with that or they 're fine with that set-up i don't think that it is it 's enough i mean you if you really care for a person you have to what be willing   yeah  to risk yeah to take the risk i mean even if you 're afraid i mean anything for love right that 's true well to some extent laughter  to some extent that 's true yeah to some extent 'cause you know but still you have to know your levels  but still i mean what 's what 's to be afraid  yeah  it sounds weird you know what maybe you should talk to bea give her a call or something well yeah maybe i can do that but she 's like she 's so e you could see it in her eyes that she 's so happy my gosh she talks about him every now and then every you know siya na 'yung buka ng bibig di ba laughter break in the recording  speaking of buka ng bibig have you heard from renee lately i was with her di ba  we were in we were at the party but she didn't we didn't talk laughter  have you heard of what happened to her i mean the crying scene and all yeah i did but i don't know the whole story uh so you don't know about mike  both of them  i mean the story of renee and mike you know no no uh okay mike was with a girl that night yeah i saw them i i know that mike liked that girl back in high school   yeah that 's what i know but the thing is you know i mean renee had a crush on him since what since i don't know i think a month ago a month or two ago well anyway and then like one time kasi we talked right and then like she tells me that she 's already in love with the guy   what  i mean okay so you you you know him a month for a month how long have you been talking and then you love the person don't you think it 's a bit weird uhm i think she 's blinded speaker a laughs by the thought that being in love is good i mean it 's a good feeling so initially she ini she 's in love with the thought of love being of finding someone to love maybe you know well anyway what 's funny about this is that she word at a guy who doesn't really like her okay   ahhh  yeah i know it 's sad but it 's not a funny thing actually i 'm sorry it 's okay so so anyway what 's funny is last saturday the guy was there and the guy mike was there and i think he was with this girl sarah sarah yeah sarah whom he he liked ever since  yes yeah so anyway when renee saw this she 's like oh my god laughter  she was embarrassed yeah she was she was and then i don't know i mean her crush on him was a secret right and then what she cried in front of the people who she 's not really close to at the party yeah she did she did how come i didn't see her cry i mean i don't know where you were with whoever i mean you know laughter  that 's correct laughter  anyway anyway and then speaker b says something but unclear laughter  she cried because what because she was i i don't know i haven't really talked to her but ano just the thought of her crying uhm made me laugh okay so wait i don't get it she cried to whom to mike 's friends yeah to mike 's friends i mean she wasn't really close to that that 's what 's funny about it it was a secret and then she cried she told them about it   oh my god  so i mean what will happen of course mike what he might learn about it   mike will eventually know about this   yeah  that chuckle  isn't that embarrassing i mean yeah you really have to talk to her i mean i 've been talking to her ever since and and i can just imagine right speaker a chuckles  you know sometimes she gets so i don't know emotional  exagge yeah  she exaggerates her emotion and then   emotional   yes she does she does she does do that break in the recording  wait lang ha  i think i have to go na  oh
