what do you want to talk about  1 word speaker a laughs  actually you start it off 'cause you are just bothering me ha ha go for the first question i 'm ready to answer let 's talk about our trips abroad trips abroad actually i 'm going to philadelphia oh don't brag about it hopefully on sometime this week if ever i get my visa then  laughter  'cause my friend is going there on sunday and i 'm not and he 's really he really wants me to go with him because he doesn't know his way around disneyland how about you   so it 's it 's his first time yup it 's dan 's first time in the states and dan and i planned ourselves our trip to the states our fly backs speaker a laughs the states we 're going to the bus trips we 're going to the hotel fares   who 's gonna pay for this the office the office will pay everything   but the but during the course of the training  dur during the course of the training but after that which is around april fourteen we will be going on our own using our own money which frankly is not that much that hurts your mom why would that hurt my mom because she 's gonna spend for you my mom 's not gonna spend for me that 's all my savings in my bank how about our  forget it our what forget it forget what  ha  nothing nothing what how about our future i thought you were saving for our you know for what for i don't know laughter  say it come on say it for our wedding so-called wedding and then look she 's bragging about our wedding which is so funny i can save for my wedding i hopefully get assigned to some project in the u k but aren't you thankful that you are in the per diem basis not allowance yeah that 's cool actually because being on an allowance is really a hassle you have to take note of all your expenses you have to jot it down and after the training you have to return to the office and report each and every single cent that you 've spent so what 's the minimum uh allowance you get speak louder sorry what 's the minimum allowance from the off the office so the for the standard allowance for people going to the states it is forty-four dollars a day that would include everything from breakfast lunch dinner laundry everything  so  okay so meaning that per diem basis means that if you are if you 're if you are going to spend only ten bucks a day so   i get to keep all thirty-four dollars   yeah  wow yup wow but that 's small compared to the per diem we get when we are assigned to hong kong  you were   it 's close to sixty-six dollars that was when dan was assigned to hong kong that was the standard per diem   you were there  i wasn't there why 'cause i wasn't there 'cause i 'm here the time when we were in hong kong it was training   oh   you said uh okay and it was on actual expenses unfortunately when you were picked up  yeah they didn't give me they just gave me one hundred dollars for allowance which is kinda very very very small okay okay what 's your next question how about you have you gone to the states  or you 're
