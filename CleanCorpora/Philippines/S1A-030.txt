""
 he  
""
 yeah  
""
and they make a good couple
""
i don't know they i don't know they   just 
""
""
 but   i really don't like the way meg ryan walks
""
""
yeah she she walks like a guy
""
""
yeah   i know 
""
""
 she doesn't   have   any 
""
""
 the   grace
""
""
yeah
""
she should go to an etiquette school
""
""
oh yes  laughter 
""
""
and learn how to walk   properly 
""
""
 you wanna   teach her how
""
""
but i like her clothes i mean   the way  she she dresses   up  and
""
""
 uh yeah  
""
 up  
""
uh-huh
""
""
you know i mean   she 's slim anyway 
""
""

""
yeah
""
""
so she could wear anything she wants
""
""
comfy clothes
""
""
yeah
""
""
actually  we 've watched a lot of movie together right
""
""
yeah 
""
i like her hair

""
""
 yeah i know  
""
""
it 's the   i don't know

it is
""
""
  yeah 
""
""
 do you   like julia roberts
""
""
she 's a good actress yeah but  the story of  erin brockovich  was for me uh you know boring
""
""
as in boring
""
""
because they featured
""
""
so bland was it
""
""
no it was too detailed
""
""
uh okay
""
""
so it was like they showed every detail   and 
""
""
 as it   happened
""
""
yeah
""
""
uh-huh
""
""
i don't know i found it dragging and boring
""
""
compared to her other movies
""
""
yeah i guess because it 's not a love   story or something 
""
""
 story yeah i know  
""
""
it wasn't really amusing or whatever so but that was okay
""
i just can't believe that it 's one of the it it was number one    in the states for a couple  of weeks   yeah 
""
""
 in the states uh in u s  
""
 uh-huh  
""
""
i couldn't imagine it to be that i mean i guess she played a good she portrayed a good role or whatever
""
""
uh uhm
""
was it was she sexy there
""
""
yeah more of slutty
""
""
oh okay  chuckle  slutty type
""
""
yeah 'cause she was like wearing really skimpy clothes
""
""
why
""
her
""
""
i don't know maybe that that 's how   the real erin  brockovich   dresses  up
""
""
 how erin  
""
  dres  yeah  
""
""
but then i don't know  and i guess it was in the eighties   so

""
""

""
""
 striking   flashing

""
""
