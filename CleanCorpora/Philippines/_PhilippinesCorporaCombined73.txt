was a point i think they showed yesterday remember channel nine uh yeah did you watch it oh i missed it they were supposed to show that special uh documentary something  docu documentary about the the actual survivors of the titanic uh yeah ay wait you know i watched i watched this channel uhm what was that uhm time and again i think it was n b c time and again and they featured titanic  yeah  first they featured the movies the first movie was uh titanic in the nineteen thirties and then there was the nineteen fifties version  word   there were i forgot how many versions there were but the most accurate uh at that time was entitled a night to remember based on a novel  uh  yeah i remember that i went i visited their homepage you visit their homepage i visited the homepage of titanic the movie uh-huh and uh it says there the complete details of the titanic directed by james cameron blah blah blah but there they show us the history of the titanic and the past movies the predecessor movies of the titanic where this curr this current ano this current version uh followed  oh yeah  uh hey you know what what 's interesting the first few movies of the titanic showed the titanic sinking and then leaving something like smoke and then they believe that titanic did not break  yeah yeah  it was only  it only titanic broke only when it reached the bottom yeah because maybe because of uh uh pressure yes strong water pressure yeah hey it was only this version the titanic james cameron that he featured the titanic the titanic breaking into   actually breaking into two yeah and then the survivors actually claim that before it even sank it broke in two so wow they didn't they didn't do much of a research before uh yeah they just maybe they just sank into word  uh yeah and then and then there was this theory uhm they said when that was before nineteen eighty-five nineteen eighty-five was the time when the titanic was found at the o at the bottom of the ocean uhm they they believe that the titanic sank because the iceberg uhm made a three hundred foot gash yeah i guess it 's the other way round the boat was the one that uh no no uh actually they believe that uhm the iceberg was able to was able to cut through the steel of the titanic producing a three hundred foot damage uh a gash oh uh but then when in nineteen eighty-five the titanic was found they found that it wasn't a three hundred foot gash but only a twelve square meter uh a twelve square meter hole  and then it was shocking because it was only as big as a refrigerator and based on you know comparison of size that 's very small then then how come the titanic sank and then one explanation was because of water pressure  hole   yeah too much pressure on the wa water that causes how many ano uhm uh thousands   gallons of water  yeah thousands of gallons of water per second based on research  yeah  yeah and remember the movie itself where uhm they were showing the evidence of how the titanic sank they were showing the old lady they they showed the the the lowest level of the titanic uh yeah i think i think it was the engine room it turned out at the engine room that 's where the water pressured in it was the water uh somehow hit hit the hit the boat at strategic points as if it wanted to sink it  uh-huh   yeah  oh it 's started from the engine slowly sinking to the second and third level so it was adding weight to the front to the dorsal part of the boat uh uhm is that correct dorsal  uh i don't know no i think i 'm not sure i think the dorsal how do you call it dorsal part of the boat adding more weight to the front that 's what caused it to break   uh yeah yeah yeah only the recent researchers yeah interesting yeah and there was actually a safe there was actually a safe found by a by a i think the russian russian uh research team they they actually i i saw it in the discovery channel i think they opened it they tried to but they can't because of the jam really jammed yeah although they found the safe uhm they they vowed never to touch any of the debris of the titanic uh-huh of course as uh paying their respects to the dead there until they found upon finding the safe they found the safe that 's where they broke their promise speaker a laughs uh well this is a uh a robotic like a submersible  uh-huh  uh-huh complete with robotic arms just like in the movie uh-huh they tried to open the safe although it was still it 's still rusted it 's supposed to be weak right yeah and that should have been weakened they could not they couldn't get it to open uh they didn't bring the it to the surface  they didn't bring  no they just left it there because according to ano according to some survivors they said that that it 's useless to open it because the crew left it empty anyway before it sank uh laughter  yeah was it empty what if it 's true oh laughter  what if inside there was really the heart of the ocean speaker a laughs  you know what wait uh  imagine kung pinoy yung naka-diskubre speaker a laughs filipino crew member you can turn off our destiny toward the states word it just takes one blue diamond whoa the moment it is found there 's
