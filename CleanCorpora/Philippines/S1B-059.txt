your honor uh i i i believe that uh uh we we can uh we can uh address uh the problems that that will be brought about
""
i know that you do not share uh my my position on this matter uh and i i i can also tell you that uh i i cannot also share uh your position on this point
""
so uh i guess uh as we have been saying for the past few days uh uh history will uh will judge us uh and uh we just have uh to be prepared to meet the the consequences of uh our decision on this matter and which i as i had said uh was uh a very  agon  uh a very  agon  agonizing one
""
""
well your honor i don't think that the people who are not going to eat are going to accept your statements
""
and your honor you were making here  uh references to s s s which actually only provides one month uh benefits
""
you make reference here to mita pardo de tavera who is running out of money and who has to feed six hundred and fifty thousand displaced persons as a result of pinatubo
""
you were asking questions like  wala ba silang magagawa 
""
you are alluding to opportunities that are non-existent
""
i uh honestly your honor i 'm disappointed because listening to you now you really sound like a  trapo   =traditional politician    making promises that do not mean anything   clapping 
""
""
  chuckle    well uh if you can call me a  trapo  i don't   uh uh    i do not know what you can uh  what you can call yourself
""
""
 well your honor   that is that is what you are saying  you are making false promises  
""
well your honor i am a senator of the philippines  clapping   speaker a chuckles 
""
but let us go back your honor to specifics because these people have to eat your honor   people in olongapo 
""
""
 let 's uh   let 's take out the proposed treaty
""
""
  no not 
""
""
 can you   point to any provision there any provision in the proposed treaty which will show that these people whom you are now so concerned about  suddenly concerned about
""
""
no your honor i have been i stood on the floor of this senate from day one  clapping 
""
i was the first one your honor who stood here
""
""
point point to any provision in the treaty which provides an amount that would be given to these workers
""
""
no your honor precisely what i am saying   your honor 
""
""
your honor  in fact   in fact if i remember right you had spoken strongly against this proposed treaty which we are now considering
""
""
i never spoke against it your honor
""
i was putting up   a  word  stand your honor 
""
""
 you were saying   you were saying that if we would approve this treaty we would be making mendicants of ourselves year every year for ten years
""
""
your honor we were
""
""
the compensation that is being mentioned there is not even in the body of the treaty itself
""
""
your honor i have stood on the floor of the senate from day one favoring the retention of u s military bases your honor
""
""
i recall   you were asking  for two billion dollars
""
""
 this treaty   this treaty your honor   guarantees employment  for twenty eighty thousand filipinos your honor
""
""
 just a  mo   
""
may i ask the gentlemen on the floor please speak one after the other
""
""
well your honor it is the other gentleman who 's interrupting me
""
i cannot finish my statements and he breaks in
""
""
  both gentlemen are being referred to 
""
""
 no no no  words    to me with respect to that your honor
""
""
your honor you were the one that were breaking in
""
in fact i have given you all the time
""
i ask short questions and you give out kilometric answers trying to divert the issues your honor
""
""
i take it that you do not like what i have been uh   saying 
""
""
 no   it 's not that i like or i do not like your honor
""
but i wish your honor would be more concise we are running out of time the majority leader is asking us to hurry up
""
it is the sponsor that is eating up time we are not even
""
""
your honor you   haven't answered my question 
""
""
 may i ask for a short   suspension mr president
""
""
i suspend the session for one minute  break in the recording 
""
""
but uh i i believe that uh i said uh if uh our leaders in government uh could only be more uh creative and resourceful uh  the  they would be able to uh shorten that uh period or if not find other uh uh solutions uh to this uh temporary uh problem
""
now i would like to bring out the fact uh mr president uh that uh under the proposed treaty uh there is nothing uh stated in the  an  in any of the provisions of this proposed treaty uh which uh mentions uh any specific or uh definite amount that uh would be given or that would be used to address this uh problem
""
now uh i would also like to point out your honor that uh  if you are looking for uh  for solutions uh that could be uh used to address this uh problem we have uh what uh we are paying to our uh foreign debt
""
uh for this year your honor uh i think you will admit that we will be paying the amount of two billion eight hundred fifty million dollars for our foreign debt just for one year
""
now under this proposed treaty that uh you are now uh voting for  over a period of ten years over a period of ten years and assuming that uh what was stated in the bush letter will uh materialize without any deduction what uh we will be receiving will be much less than what uh we will be paying for our foreign debt in one year
""
because if we would add uh this together over a period of ten years the appropriated uh amount would come out to a total only of two billion one hundred seventy-eight million dollars
""
""
can i now continue your honor
""
uh because you digress the issue to foreign debt we are   not dealing here  on foreign debt
""
""
 well uh  
""
""
  your honor  i am not finished
""
""
 no no no  
""
""
i 've been very courteous in allowing you to speak lengthily on even irrelevant matters
""
but must your honor please we are not debating foreign debt here
""
i think there 's unanimity in this session on foreign debt
""
we are  delibe  then what we 're talking about here is breakfast lunch and dinner for eighty thousand displaced workers
""
and this treaty your honor if we were to ratify it would provide two point seven billion pesos of wages which these workers are now currently earning for them to buy their food
""
so we are not talking of the compensation for displacement
""
we are talking of continued employment your honor
""
and that is what i 'm asking what replacement are you since you are the chief advocate here in the floor now on the rejection of the treaty what alternatives for the livelihood of eighty million beginning with day one  ha 
""
not plans
""
you know  yung panaginip ni ano'ng pangalan niyan  abueva the likelihood of hair growing on his head is bigger than the likelihood of that plan being successful
""
so your honor let us not talk about those dreams of abueva
""
uh let us talk basic facts your honor breakfast lunch and dinner
""
where are these people going to get their food the day they are laid off
""
""
well uh your honor uh i note that you are only looking at uh eighty thousand workers
""
those uh in subic and those who are working in clark and uh i don't know how many of these workers are uh or were directly hired and how many are contractual
""
uh i i believe it 's uh much less than uh eighty thousand
""
""
well your honor
""
""
i 'm not yet finished uh your honor
""
""
oh yes  than  sorry your honor
""
""
your apology is accepted
""
uh  so i said you are uh just looking at these uh workers in these u s installations
""
now uh what uh we are uh looking at and what we are seeing is the greater number of our workers who are now unemployed as uh senator uh herrera had said that there are  at least four million workers now who are unemployed
""
and he said that underemployed uh could reach even the number of nine million
""
now how can we limit our concern to just the workers that uh you have mentioned
""
of course we are as concerned as you are maybe you will not believe this but we are
""
but uh we have to look at the total picture
""
and uh if we will allow the americans another period of ten years to make use of of subic then we are uh uh setting aside and not uh making use of the opportunities the the wonderful opportunities that are now present to us to convert this valuable piece of land
""
as i said in the studies that have been submitted if uh subic uh uh  wi  will be uh returned to us uh and uh we can start implementing the conversion plans for subic where uh among the plans are to establish a maritime industrial complex a ship building ship maintenance ship repair facility uh transshipment center a container port
""
uh we know that uh uh in subic uh there are uh large areas for uh building spaces for storage spaces we know that there is a runway  the  there uh nine  hu  nine thousand uh uh foot long
""
so your honor i i believe that uh if these uh conversion plans would already be implemented uh there can be no doubt that uh there will be more employment generated for our filipino workers
""
not just the eighty thousand now let 's say who may be affected but much more than that
""
now uh  of course there is that gestation period that we have to pass through uh we cannot avoid uh that uh stage even if we were to start after uh ten years we still have to pass through that uh gestation period uh but i i as i have said uh the government uh can uh if only it has the political will can uh come out with the necessary measures to cushion the impact of this on on the workers
""
uh  tai  uh taiwan i heard is uh uh interested in uh uh our uh uh workers uh i i recall uh secretary torres mentioning that uh uh that so many thousands of them uh uh would have an opportunity to to work at taiwan
""
 the  there 's still the middle east uh opportunities and uh i also would not want to think that the workers who would be affected would just stay uh at their uh homes and the and the and not do anything
""
so your honor as i said uh you may you may not have as much faith as i have in uh in uh the filipino but i i believe that uh uh this is a problem that uh uh can be solved by us
""
""
well your honor i have faith in our people
""
i would not have come back seven weeks after ninoy was killed i would not be here
""
i have faith your honor but i do not want the martyrdom of eighty thousand workers so that four million hopefully if abueva 's plans materialize may be able to find jobs
""
your honor besides i dispute the concept that you can employ four million unemployed people in olongapo if that is converted
""
because to begin with i doubt if you can put enterprises there that would employ four million that 's to start with
""
number two i doubt whether we have the resources
""
four million people it costs three hundred thousand pesos of capital to employ one laborer
""
so four million people if somebody has a calculator multiply it by three hundred thousand i think it would be about a trillion pesos of resources which we do not have your honor
""
and your honor again i say i 'm focusing on the immediate problem
""
now if we were to uh ratify this treaty and allow for a phase down a gradual transition no disruption would occur your honor
""
the people in olongapo and i 'm only talking of olongapo your honor i 'm not talking of unemployment in the rest of the country because i will get to that your honor
""
i 'm not talking of the six hundred sixty thousand garment workers who stand you and i do not believe that the united states will be so unkind as to take away our garment quota and cause the hardship of six hundred sixty thousand but the risk is there your honor
""
now your honor you also speak of taiwan and let me point out that the chairman of our committee on labor senator herrera who is right here beside me has told me your honor that he has talked to the authorities in taiwan three times
""
and they have told him that our access to labor in taiwan is conditional upon our recognition of taiwan a repudiation of our one-china policy which of course is in the realm of foreign affairs and i would not want to bring that issue in because i promised the majority leader and the leadership that we have no intention of prolonging this discussion and that is why we want to limit ourselves to short answers and short questions
""
now your honor going back to the need to provide for employment of our eighty thousand base workers why is it your honor that you and your colleagues are so insistent on bringing upon difficulties even hardships hunger upon eighty thousand filipinos in the interest you claim of employing four million although your honor i don't see the logic because when you repudiate this treaty on monday as you are intent to because you have twelve votes and we only have eleven then we will trigger a an environment of apprehension among the foreign investors
""
again you will say we are being threatened i think it is a reality because the truth of the matter your honor is that investors will not come here there are other places where they can invest
""
and we have while other countries are creating environments for favorable foreign investments we seem to be intent on isolation in this country and repelling foreign investors
