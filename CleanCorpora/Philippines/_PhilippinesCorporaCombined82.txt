transcribing everything we 'll we 're gonna have to make sure our voices differ otherwise who 's that laughter  uh okay okay you what have you ever been caught kissing oh my god you know for the longest time i wasn't admitting that i had a boyfriend because i was with this guy uhm starting thirteen no when i was thirteen like that but of course that that time it was just m u m u we call it m u = mutual understanding  do we have chuckle  so when i was finally sixteen i go okay this is the time so i said yes but i was denying it totally to my friends my family like that and then one night we were staying in my dad 's office right we we we came from a party and then we were in the elevator he wanted to say good night kiss good night and then i go okay inside the elevator at that time and then when i walked out he had to grab me and kiss me again and then and then so i i faced right the the hallway and then as the elevator doors closed behind me my sister was there oh no and she didn't even know i was going out with him and you know what i said i go pooot makes sound expelling air from the lips laughter  and then that night i told my parents dad what if i answered angelo already you know what he said say you 're just kidding oh in truth i was already going out with him seven months  how about you gina  i got caught words laughter  by no in the car laughter speaker c

even lock  yeah  we locked it e siyempre and then we opened the door and then he goes is she a prostitute no oh my god and then wala siyempre we had to pay what 's the what 's the violation laughter  indecent act laughter  oh no yes i did now i know someone who actually did get caught laughter  no it 's so true no my friend is worst the so the couldn't they get a motel they sleep did you i think can hear you quite well word  have you ever gone to a motel why are you asking me neeyaah i want i want to know you no but i want to you no just for exposure you i have you have i have i haven't  ako i have is it nice it 's ugly dirty all even  no i 've been to the really really nice ones no i go to hotels e speaker a laughs the really nice hotels no i wonder if it because is it not degrading honey let 's go to the motel huh don't i look like a hotel beauty   yeah that 's why i go to the hotel i think the problem is because like motels in in the states they are just motorists yeah they 're i mean they 're places where you actually go to any time not embarrassing to go but in our society you know motels have have developed into something so one you know few hours like we have big billboards   short time  true three hours yeah and it just makes it cheaper kasi i mean a lot of married people go to motels because there 's no privacy at home  right  'cause they have all their relatives living there   and it 's spice  and so they have to go spice yeah we have co- we have a co-teacher yeah as as   married who goes there when you said spice i remember woops laughter i remem at least they 're married i remember when you said spice and i was talking about it a while ago that my my friends who are still with their boyfriends laughter  brokenhearted laughter  no no you have to be a little dirty if you want spice yeah my tito told me if you want to your marriage to last you have to be the prostitute yeah uh that wasn't even my word i said you have to be the whore of your the mistress the mistress and the wife yeah i don't exactly agree no it 's not that i agree i mean i guess it depends on the guys also but it 's if you think prosti i mean it 's so disgusting i mean this person will just look at you as an object and he won't look at you as a person no treat him the same way honey laughter  yeah if it 's fine with you right laughter i 'm just the wife laughter  right now i 'm the mistress laughter  no no no i 'm the nobody 's  the wife gets left speaker a laughs  yeah for mistresses okay i 'm the mistress speaker a laughs  you wanna go into boys chuckle uh the filipino male psyche chuckle  i know right the male chauvinist pig y'know it 's true you you can't live with them can't live without them no but i think you know for filipino males uh particularly i think they behave so much worst because we allow it uh-uhm you know filipinas allow so much from their boyfriends and husbands and they forgive them every time that 's why we make great wives  you know  heehh we make martyr wives but chuckle like my friend said  what   there 's no mart what 's that a stupid martyr doesn't get like crowned or something like that yeah yeah yeah do you think abby is a martyr no to her boyfriend now yeah i think he 's really nice really she 's nice chuckle  let 's not let 's not tell her but you know what laughter  who 's under abby or her boyfriend uh in what sense laughter  who 's stronger who 's under chuckle  no i mean whose personality is stronger you 're under he 's under laughter  in bed he 's under laughter  okay what do you believe in should the girl be stronger than the guy or the guy should have a stronger personality   i think should be equal equal yeah because we don't wanna be dominated as much as they don't wanna be dominated i guess if you see eye to eye that 's better and there 's respect  what you 're  word he knows really yeah you won't find guys who who like equality  you don't like equality  hardly i don't know okay yeah i was telling my friend because some of my friends when they fight you know they they really fight as in physically i go you know what if in day one you made it clear that you cannot pinch me you cannot even you know wh what 's this speaker thinks of a word that would describe an action oh my god do this to me  what do you call it   e there 's no english word for pitik  flick okay he he he   you know  you don't speaker c chuckles you don't speaker c chuckles as long as you don't touch even the ends of my nails i don't think they will but if you let them yes they will so i was telling i forgot who uh i was telling another friend i go you know remember angelo my first boyfriend he was like the school bully but never in our entire cough relationship and that lasted ten years that he even you know pulled one strand of my hair and to think he had a really very bad temper really yeah because i told him from day one you may shout at me or whatever but you can never touch me i 'll kill you laughter  and i think it di it it also depends on how you deal with the fight if you start shouting and cursing i guess of course they 'll retaliate but have you ever seen anyone who 's you know cursing and all that while the other girl 's super quiet no i haven't  chuckle no you 've started eh  i mean it 's e in our society it 's like really strong that guys do not hit girls 'cause the moment you hit a girl you 're you 're you 're 1 word   no it 's marked it 's accepted here in the philippines no in married people married people accept it not really it 's not accepted as well uhm not like womanizing is more accepted here than beatings but if you 're the wife people would tell you uhm to  yeah  leave the guy if you 're the wife would you leave your husband if he hits you once   of course  once just once  yes   once is fine no once is you know outburst  no  i don't even hit people when i 'm angry i know of course so you would once you get slapped it was really big fight just once  just once   no way  just once i think once is not sound   i don't think so you don't leave your family for that i 'll leave my husband i 'll take the kids
