""
i will describe some of the methodologies used  'no  so that you have an idea of what kind of research goes into these types of topics okay 
""
now uhm i 'm not i i remember when i gave a talk last time i don't consider myself primarily a psycholinguistics a psycholinguist  'no 
""
i 'm sort of a closet psycholinguist
""
uh i i took courses with  psych  uh with psycholinguists but i never really established a uh continuous research program in psycholinguistics  'no 
""
although i have always included language variables in my researches
""
so  actually the when i was trying to think of topics to write these were like my wish list the things i should have been doing
""
but but uh maybe you would be in a stronger position to look at these topics
""
uh i got interested in language research in psychology mainly because of the bilingual experience of filipino  'no 
""
uhm and so my entry point into language research is bilingualism and uh most of the topics that i will be rattling off start off from bilingualism
""
now uhm first there will be several clusters of topics here and the first thing that i thought you might find more interesting or you might be able to identify more easily is the implications of bilingualism to education
""
we have a bilingual policy
""
uhm the reality is most of the teachers code-switch in the classrooms
""
many of our students are at least  bi  or almost all are at least bilingual
""
many are multilingual uh polyglots  'no 
""
uhm one question that has gotten a lot of attention is what is the consequence of using either the first language or the second language or the third language to learning to thinking in the education process
""
uhm there have been studies and i 'm sure brother andrew talked about them of the consequences or the impact of bilingual education
""
but as psychologists we have to focus on the more micro effects
""
what i mean by that is how did using the child 's or the student 's first or second language affect his or her learning of a particular subject matter
""
so it 's focused more on the individual 's uh learning or thinking  'no 
""
now when we do that in cognitive psychology we tend to be very very focused in terms of the cognitive abilities involved
""
for example since most of you are language teachers  'no  you might be interested in reading
""
uh how is it for example that students come to develop reading skills in filipino or english
""
does it make a difference if we teach our young children to read in english or filipino or does it not make a difference at all
""
you must have heard of some of the studies done in this line  'no 
""
but uh what i want to start thinking of maybe is look at reading not as a global function but a unitary function
""
look at reading as an activity that has many many different smaller parts
""
for example reading actually involves at the most basic level word recognition pattern recognition
""
this is a very perceptual process  'no 
""
at a higher level it involves understanding meaning  literal meaning of the text
""
at an even higher level it involves making inferences
""
it will also involve applying information things like that  'no 
""
so some researches a student of mine for example looked at uh  how  i think she studied kindergarten or grade one children uh perform as regards these four levels of uh reading comprehension
""
she found out that as far as uh uh word recognition was concerned  what made a more important impact was the language used for teaching 
""
and uh we think it 's because word recognition is primarily a perceptual process
""
so if you have more experience with words in uh printed words in english you would be much better uh at recognizing them
""
simply because you have more experience processing these types of words printed words
""
when it came to comprehension  literal inferential and applying information students always did better with their first language
""
but these were early learners remember these are people who were just starting to read  'no 
""
uh there were similar findings done by uh an ateneo researcher
""
and this time she studied  uh students with three languages cebuano english and filipino
""
and the results were pretty much similar but she focused on comprehension
""
comprehension was really better in the  students'  first language
""
most of these studies have been done with early learners  'no 
""
i am not familiar with them  i 'm not familiar with other studies that look at higher level learners  'no 
""
and uh maybe later on we can look at other variables  a class interruption occurred 
""
okay  so i was talking about you know uh  possible things i was just talking about reading  'no 
""
  yeah 
""
""
uh and then you can think of other things that you might be interested in when looking at reading  'no 
""
for example if you look at reading fiction  you can look at uh whether students are better able to make inferences about motives of the character  'no 
""
are they able to uh understand subtext or subplots better  'no 
""
are they able better able to establish motivation certain events things like that  'no 
""
uh  are they better able to appreciate literary works
""
are they better able to uh see nuances  'no  in the narrative structure things like that
""
this would be for more advanced students because earlier we were talking about early readers  'no 
""
you can look at very specific things like how do they  inter  interpret symbols  'no 
""
are they better able to to appreciate metaphor  in their first language in their second language
""
that 's just reading
""
you can look at writing also   'no 
""
are they are are they better able to uh  do exposition in english or filipino
""
there 's a lot of anecdotal evidence or or anecdotes from teachers who say that when their students write in their first language tends to be more tends to be richer tends to be more original
""
and when they write in english they tend to be more clich&eacute; they tend to resort to stock phrases things like that 
""
maybe these things need to be documented rather than just relying on stock or anecdotes  'no 
""
you can look at their expressiveness
""
maybe uh the range of techniques they use when they write is uh wider for one language or the other we don't know that yet we don't know these things  'no 
""
you can also look at the depth of their ideas  'no 
""
these are the kinds of things that you know people always talk about
""
  that 's right 
""
""
you know my student writes better and this and that
""
but you know we have not done the research that will support these types of uh conjectures  'no 
""
aside from the task we notice i was looking mainly at the task you can look at the variables related to the learner
""
what do you mean by that
""
well we all know not all bilinguals are alike  'no 
""
there are so you can look at the types of bilinguals
""
you have  uh  simultaneous bilinguals those who grew up listening to two languages or three languages
""
you have additive bilinguals subtractive bilinguals  'no 
""
you have multilinguals of course
""
that that creates a totally different situation altogether
""
so you can consider a range of variables related to the learner as regards  bi  level of proficiency  'no  in l one and l two
""
that might make a big difference  'no 
""
you can consider things like level of knowledge of the subject area
""
uhm i sometimes think that people who are experts in a field could not be as dependent on language  'no 
""
they if if they know the subject matter very well they would not be as constrained when it comes to talking about these things  'no 
""
so that 's one layer of studies that you can do
""
just looking at whether it makes a difference to use english or filipino when it comes to these very specific aspects  actually focus on language skills  'no 
""
but if you look at how they do uh my work is in mathematics so i look at how these things affect mathematical tasks
""
you can look at how they appreciate history
""
you can look at how they appreciate uh their studies in religion  'no 
""
this can apply to any of our uh subject matter 
""
the methodology usually involves a simple comparison  'no 
""
same group of subjects two sets of stimulus or two sets of tasks one in l one in l two or another in l three
""
and then just compare the performance afterwards
""
so it 's rather straightforward in terms of research design
""
of course if you will if you will deal with the learner variable it will involve different groups
""
and so you can then combine maybe learner variables with task variables
""
more complicated research design there
""
but you might get more rich information uh richer
""
now another layer of studies still related to bilingualism and pushing it a bit higher is trying to find out not only what the differences are but trying to find out why those differences exist
""
so let 's say they do better at appreciating metaphor in filipino then you might want to know why
""
is it something about the filipino language
""
is it something about their proficiency
""
is it something about the text for example  'no 
""
so it is not sufficient that we say students do better in english or in filipino
""
the next step of studies would have the next step of studies would deal with the question why do we see these things  'no 
""
because i always feel that why is always more convincing  'no 
""
it is much more satisfying in terms of providing explanations
""
of course this is much more difficult to do
""
you have to generate hypothesis
""
you have to try to get data either to verify or disprove your hypothesis
""
but this is the fun part
""
in my work in the area of math it 's trying to make sense of the pattern of the results that is always more it 's much more creative it 's much more challenging so i would be  word 
""
you know it 's everyone has an idea of why it 's better with one  words 
""
it 's a matter of testing it  in ways in which you can you know reasonably conclude this hypothesis and not that hypothesis
""
so and then  another set of studies would be related to  still related to the why but it will require a finer analysis of english and filipino as languages
""
that would require well i suppose they have courses in
""
""
linguistics
""
""
english syntax like that  'no 
""
""
yes
""
""
by that i mean you can begin looking at the different structures of language or the two languages from the most basic the phonology 
""
maybe that has something to do with it
""
maybe the lexicon has something to do with it  'no 
""
or maybe it 's the syntax that has something to do with it
""
the most exciting studies in this area had looked into syntactic and semantic differences in l one and l two and predicting differential performance of learning
""
""
oh who are these who are these uh
""
""
oh uh there are actually few and far between
""
uh i 'm trying to think of a study that would be illustrative 
""
let 's see 
""
you see many of the studies i don't understand  laughter 
""
because it 's a comparison of english and korean  oo 'yon na nga 'yon na nga  turkish and english
""
but for example uh okay one of one professor i was working with  was comparing spanish and english  okay and spanish seems to have   'no  uh this is i can't remember exactly what she has done
""
she hasn't published it yet so i cannot
""
but give me one minute i 'm sure i can give you an example 
""
uh  uh okay
""
in italian in a lot of the romance languages  they have gender markers
""
for the verbs you know everything  'no 
""
so in a set a sentence in uh  in english would have maybe just one word that marks the gender  in the same sentence in italian you 'd have three gender markers
""
it marks the verb everything  'no 
""
and so some people speculate that well does that make the italian reader uh  more mindful of factors related to gender
""
i don't i 'm not sure if that study has been done but i know someone has been talking about that
""
something that has been
""
""
sapir-whorf hypothesis  'no 
""
""
yeah that 's it people are testing sapir-whorf in a very very fine-tuned way
""
one very good demonstration and this one i understood  laughter 
""
uh this was done by people collaboration of american and hong kong psychologists  'no 
""
and uh this is not related to literature in any way but it might be
""
it turns out there are words in english that refer to personality constructs that we have a happy-go-lucky personality we have an extrovert  'no  which embodies a set of personality traits okay
""
it turns out there are no counterparts in chinese okay
""
but in the chinese language they have also their own set of terms that correspond to a  set of personality traits
""
uh one term she gave refers to someone who is very creative outgoing but very close to the family   'no 
""
it 's a different complex okay
""
in a study they did they came up with a story  which describes a person okay
""
and from there you can infer the subjects were required to  make an inference about the personality of the individual what other personality traits would this person have okay
""
the same text was given to  monolingual chinese monolingual english speakers bilingual english-chinese speakers 
""
uh the chinese and bilingual speakers were from hong kong hong kong chinese
""
the english speakers were british  okay
""
uh  interesting first interesting comparison was that when they looked at the sets of traits inferred by the monolinguals they found a totally different set
""
the ones who read the text in english the monolingual british speakers english speakers describe these people according to the english stereotypical term okay 
""
the monolingual chinese described these results consistent with the chinese terms but they were reading the same story
""
they were reading the same  information
""
but the constructs that were evoked were determined by which lexical units were activated
""
but you might say well these were british compared to monolingual chinese in hong kong and if you know anything about hong kong the monolingual  chi  the monolingual chinese are probably not very cosmopolitan  'no 
""
you might say it 's cultural differences   'no 
""
so the interesting comparison now would be the bilinguals
""
how could the bilinguals read the text in english half read it in chinese and you find the same difference
""
""
uh it 's the language so there 's something
""
""
it 's the language
""
and so the same the bilingual the same pool of bilinguals they have the same culture pretty much homogeneous experience  come up with a different personality description if they read it in chinese compared if when they read it in english 
""
that 's a very powerful description  'no 
""
uh i i 'm trying hard to think of a parallel study that can be done in the philippines
""
and it 's it 's not something that i have enough time to think about no but some people have been thinking along these lines  'no 
""
but something like that
""
in that case it was the lexicon that they were looking at
""
so there were lexical entries in english that did not have counterparts in chinese and vice versa
""
and it had an impact on person perception
""
and this is not far a far cry from inferring motives of uh fictional characters for example
""
and there are other studies that relate to you know relating syntax
""
most of these are  extreme examples
""
uh okay now i remember one
""
there is this controversial set of studies done by bloom
""
""
which bloom
""
""
not harold bloom
""
i think it 's harold bloom
""
anyway
""
but he he said that in the chinese language there is no conditional
""
""
 if if 
""
""
 if 
""
and he says because of that chinese speakers cannot reason with a condition
""
""
oh my god
""
""
something like that
""
""
if x and y they cannot do that but it 's very basic in philosophy  di ba 
""
""
yeah something like that
""
and he has some data showing that effect
""
other studies have been trying to show you have bad data you know you did not phrase the chinese
""
he was not a native chinese speaker so his phrasing was not appropriate and things like that  'no 
""
so you you can extend it but that requires very fine knowledge of the language  you know and the types of differences
""
and the the thing is if you look at  filipino  based on tagalog the syntax is very different
""
well they come from very different families  'no 
""
