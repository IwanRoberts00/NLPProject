""
 music  starting line ups of both squads  being announced right now 
""
i think ateneo blue eagles right there
""
""
coach joe lipa likes to start the game with uh edward quimpo for as a point guard for uh for ateneo
""
well he holds the key
""
l a uh l a tenorio comes in but you know we 're looking at abadia but it 's tagupa who 'll be covering uh quimpo as a point guard
 and first possession goes to blue eagles
""
""
so first possession for ateneo it 's now the starting line up you see the graphic
""
membrere throws it away to tagupa
""
tagupa pushing it up against quimpo
""
tagupa nice cross over the hoop hooks it up backs it out
""
mangulabnan with the follow up
""
""
tagupa making uh well well over quimpo but offensive board
""
it 's two points for the falcons
""
""
quimpo against tagupa ateneo second offensive set they built it over last time
""
here 's sison inside to villanueva
""
no double team
""
sison open for three
""
that 's long
""
rebound to yong
""
adamson up and running once again
""
yong  rolls it down to tagupa
""
two to nothing is our score quimpo and against villanueva inside into the lay-up
""
followed by villanueva
""
villanueva brings it up to membrere who loses control
""
here comes tagupa
""
one on three fast break and tagupa says i need some teammates
""
""
that 's a a good decision jude
""
he doesn't have the numbers
""
""
backed out
""
""
he waited for the head of the falcons
""
let 's go over to aileen soriaga
""
""
aileen soriaga for gentext update
""
""
yes thank you very much guys
""
in spite of their three consecutive losses the adamson falcons are still very much eager and optimistic that they will be able to win this ballgame over the ateneo blue eagles
""
but the boys they know that they are off for a big fight and they have to work hard and they have and they need to have dedication to win this ballgame
""
more than just a game plan coach luigi trillo also reminded his boys that they they need to put more heart into their game and more and the heat and the heat itself will start carrying above their need
""
even the players themselves were not that satisfied with their last year performances especially during  words 
""
but this time around they 're hoping that they will be able to win
""
guys back to you
""
""
thanks aileen 
""
""
so confidence is one of the problems for adamson so far
""
rolan nice rebound but there 's a whistle
""
""
could be a foul could be on membrere trying to go or could it be on uh villanueva who  word 
 here 's enrico villanueva will hold that ball
""
""
well villanueva picks up his first foul
""
let 's take a look at this smart zed steal by tagupa
""
smart zed the power to live the life you choose
""
smart zed your cell phone now
""
and adamson rolan gets his two points from the field
""
let 's go over to the ateneo side this time with patty laurel for gentext update
""
""
yes uh earlier on i spoke to coach lipa and i asked him what does he have to fear from adamson
""
and he told me you know that overconfidence can kill sometimes
""
that 's why he always tells his boys to treat each game as if it were a big team
""
adamson is very hungry for a win
""
we should not allow them to win just at our expense
""
with more reason we should watch out for that
""
so today 's definitely gonna be a good fight between ateneo and adamson
""
back to you jude and randy
""
""
thanks patty and uh overconfidence is definitely something that uh the better teams have uh to watch out for here
""
these gentext free throws by villanueva brought to you by gentext by globe handy phone the official privilege card of the u a a p games
""
""
 words  continue for enrico villanueva for his first free throw
""
actually the pressure is not on adamson but so much on ateneo
""
i feel jude that this situation is very clear to adamson i think
""
all year long they 've not picked up a win so it 's not really very difficult for them
""
ateneo really feels the pressure right now  words  as the quarter passes
""
but you know they should treat this game like any other ball game they have to win it on the court play your basketball even against the adamson falcons at the bottom of the standings
""
""
tagupa against quimpo
""
tagupa all the way inside misses the lay-up
""
villanueva gives it to sison
""
here comes ateneo
""
 1 word  to the side with the three-pointer
""
membrere out to quimpo across to sison
""
inside villanueva
""
villanueva makes his move the half move from the baseline is good
""
""
this is definitely gonna be a very difficult match-up for rolan because he doesn't really have that jumping ability to cover rico villanueva
""
the most that he could do is try to push him outside of the shaded area
""
""
the lead is down to one
""
abadia the fake the shot
""
good  good shot
""
""
he shoots over membrere
""
the person  words  in offense
""
but not a good sign for the blue eagles
""
""
abadia scored twenty-four in that first game
""
and as you mentioned probably the next two
""
sison drops a three-pointer but it 's not gonna go and there 's a foul
""
""
it will go against the falcons 
""
michael yong picking up his first foul
""
and the second team foul against adamson
""
""
michael yong one of the very few holdovers from last year
""
luigi has eleven rookies in his line-up
""
cross court to villanueva
""
this is the match-up they want to exploit
""
villanueva against rolan
""
villanueva and a turn-around jumper  he probably got fouled
""
""
rolan  words  to that level
""
he needs to double team early for rico to give up that ball and not make rico just to make his curl over rolan who looks like a rotonda to me against rico villanueva
""
""
well he touched the arm of villanueva and the referee didn't uh he just let that go
""
and you know villanueva we 're gonna be watching his free throws
""
he was one of the players strongest from the free throw line during that game against f e u
""
""
that 's mark abadia or rather tagupa
""
he has an advantage over requito i think that 's a mismatch going out of the way
""
the rest would have to be really ateneo advantage in this game
""
let 's take a look at the numbers of rico
""
 again he splits his free throws
""
one for two for enrico villanueva 
""
tagupa against quimpo
""
a left-handed drive
""
inside to abadia
""
nice move by abadia great pass and great recognition from tagupa
""
""
that 's really the one two punch for adamson
 they really recognize each other 's threats
""
""
oh  laughter  it 's quimpo saying payback time as he goes by tagupa draws the foul
 they have another opportunity for a three-point play
""
here 's that nice  play to abadia high endurance sure shot brought to you by the high endurance old spice
""
mark abadia 
""
 for ateneo you have to be  word  for quimpo i think the minute has given him the confidence with two points a rebound and he 's still active in the ballgame he welcome he tenorio starts for the game and i think they have forgotten about baguio for long time now for ateneo
""
 well danny wasn't able to play against f e u because he had a prior family commitment his sister got married
""
here 's a steal by ateneo
""
here 's sison
""
sison throws to villanueva but nice anticipation by mangulabnan gives it to tagupa
""
adamson down by one
""
with the ball abadia against membrere
""
abadia makes his move out to tagupa
""
fifteen on the shot clock  tagupa gets a screen from rolan
""
tagupa  words  to quimpo
""
tagupa from the baseline hammers it in
""
 that 's what they 're doing right now
 they see the mismatch and they go for the  words  with tagupa scoring
""
""
ateneo takes a quick thirty-second time-out
""
with ateneo down by three  seven to four is our score  commercial break 
""
here in the u a a p the thirty-second time-out in the first half is allowed and not only the coach can call it but the players the players as well
""
""
rico obviously very unhappy with the way tagupa 's burning  word  and no help coming his way
""
""
here 's our smart zed steal by mangulabnan
""
the power to live the life you choose
""
smart zed your cell phone now
""
 rico is calling the shots for the falcons
""
""
randy we would like to remind everyone to watch the new u a a p games right here on studio twenty-three and the t f c the filipino channel abroad and log on to u a a p dot pinoy central dot com for  some statistics
 that 's the official u a a p website 
""
alvarez inside to villanueva villanueva again against rolan this time he misses the shot abadia with the rebound 
""
abadia walks it up for adamson they 're up by three
""
tagupa  throw it away
""
nope
""
bounced back by rolan 
""
one  time  the  on  rolan against villanueva
""
that 's uh that 's a tough match-up randy
""
""
well i really don't know if it 's really that wise to give uh rolan that opportunity to go against villanueva
 probably the idea is to just get rico into early foul troubles and then you know that can take a breather by taking the defense right in the face from rico
""
""
alvarez he 'll be called for the offensive foul
""
""
and alvarez is not involved in the offense of ateneo i mean the first foul on alvarez
""
 it 's the first time for him to get that leather and that pass to mangulabnan
""
alvarez last year 's most valuable player in the league 
""
from  1 word  high school in japan 
""
abadia makes his move against membrere
""
nice
""
sison to rolan
""
but rolan traveled
""
rolan hesitated giving the ball back to the blue eagles
""
well this time coach joe lipa is taking a thirty-second time-out he takes the full time-out
""
we 'll be back  break in the recording 
""
you 're watching u a a p games live on studio twenty-three 
""
back for more in season sixty-four
""
ten seven our score
""

 membrere with the ball  out to quimpo in the corner quimpo makes a play left-handed drive out to sison
 sison gets a screen from alvarez now it 's membrere membrere trying to find a hole inside blocked the way by yong
""
 well six seconds to shoot for the blue eagles
""
  first name  membrere he was the m v p in high school of the n c a a playing for san beda
 alvarez with a double  2 words

""
 tagupa  1 word  to quimpo
 in the corner this is yong looking for the  1 word  shoots the  1 word  doesn't make it
