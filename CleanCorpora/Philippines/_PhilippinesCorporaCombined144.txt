thank you very much  magandang umaga din mga kaibigan and welcome back to breakfast  guys uh michael jackson pretty good referring to music just played uh i liked michael jackson before but not so much now laughter but anyway okay it 's christmas here on the set but we still have a lot of things to tell you in fact today we 're premiering our health portion on the show so every friday from now on you can count on us to give you the latest developments and information in health news that affect not only your health but also your families as well and uh your health update is supported by generation e from mead johnson help make your kids part of generation e exceptional and extra-smart and of course somebody who 's exceptional and extra-smart is alex she 's gonna give us a health update alex not recorded  okay thank you very much uh alex and uh we will be going to this serious health issue in detail as we speak with the pediatrist uh from the intensive care unit of the makati medical center dr michael wassmer good morning good morning okay uh so uh this is not a good thing to say that business has been pretty bu uh i mean it has been pretty busy for you nowadays how many patients do you get on the average per day per week let 's say dengue related uh there 's a lot of uh admissions and a lot of uh kids who are getting admitted in the hospital on a suspected case of dengue okay and uh some of those uh recover quite fast and the others uh require more intensive uh monitoring where uh in an i c u setting do you have a number ten a day twenty a day i would say at least ten a day ten a day yeah has it grown through the years like last year it 's less and before that or is it still the same uh the number of admissions basically is uh the same but uh what differs is that uh as before that it was occurring on certain months now we 're seeing dengue uh earlier like it 's a uh whole year illness as compared to before that we used to see them only in the rainy season why is that is that a weather thing is that uh uh i 'm not so sure on what the actual cause is there 's classic dengue d h f and then there is the dengue shock syndrome can you define please okay when you say uh dengue fever this is basically a child who has had fever for three to five days and has basically all the symptoms of a viral infection like a cold a cough and everything and basically uh because of the persistence of the fever they consult their doctor uhm and uh when they do some blood test uh it shows that uh there is a reduction in their platelets and everything which could be classified as dengue fever dengue hemorrhagic fever is basically uh more like the child has actual bleeding like nosebleed gum bleed uh g i or gastrointestinal bleed dengue shock syndrome is basically uh there 's no bleeding you don 't see any bleeding but there 's massive loss of fluids in the body and therefore uh the blood pressure could go down word the hypotensive and this would affect the other organs in the body what causes this the dengue shock syndrome uhm well it 's basically a uhm immune-related uh it you the virus creates a reaction in the body which causes uh inflammation and it releases a lot of uhm what we call chemical mediators which uh basically uh uh drops your blood pressure and uh affects your other organs in the body doc bam bam bam was saying a while ago that uh he he was a victim of dengue twice as a kid and he said he thinks it 's because he was a plump fat kid  yeah  does does that have a connection the chubbier kids get hit get infected more or something no uhm when uh actually uh it affects everybody regardless whether they 're fat or they 're uh-uhm skinny young uh kid or adult kid or there 's this notion na kids lang 'eh  no no even adults in fact a lot of adults uh have dengue uhm the only reason is that they don't normally uh adults don't normally go to the doctor right away they try to self-medicate and uh uh uhm and before they know it yun pala they already have uh dengue uh-uhm but basically it affects al all types of children i see doc uhm how do we detect dengue uhm the only way to detect dengue is to basically have a uh blood test done e  uh basically uh it 's it 's called uh uh c b c or complete blood count with platelets and uh if you monitor that and uh if your platelets are dropping then you are a dengue suspect although this can happen in other illnesses as well there are certain tests like a dengue blood test or an elyssa test which can be done but basically this can only be done uhm after the fifth day of the fever so kunyari uhm i noticed uh that kunyari my my uh little girl or boy has fever do i bring him right away to the doctor since i know that this is the month na yung maraming nagkakadengue 'no  the rainy season is it okay to bring him right away yeah well early consultation with a physician is always important uh they uh have the skills to basically identify uh which children uh have uh a high risk or a high prospect for for dengue especially like uh when we examine the child and basically the child has very very high fever and yet uh on physical examination you do not see any locus or any area in which uh the child may have where the fever is coming from then uh this child basically is a dengue suspect until proven otherwise why why are pediatricians uh the best people to go to aside from i mean as compared to other doctors even even if you 're an adult you still go to the pediatrician for the dengue because they are supposedly the specialists in dengue well it 's because basically uh we handle so many cases a year of uh of dengue so we are basically uh more attuned in uh identifying uh patients with dengue although uh when it comes to adult i think an internist will be in the same realm as a pediatrician in uh diagnosing dengue okay can i just call my doctor and say my my son or my daughter has this high fever and these are the symptoms can i treat uh that at home can i treat that kind of sickness at home uh i think it would be best for the child to be brought to the pediatrician because uh the pediatrician will have to make a decision whether the child has to be admitted and observed in a hospital setting or can be managed at home is there a vaccine being uh made for this 'cause i know there 's a flu vaccine and there 's hepa =hepatitis so is there a vaccine being i think they are doing initial studies or initial trials on a vaccine for dengue although i think uh it 's be it 's a little bit difficult because we are not dealing only with one strain there are several strains of dengue so therefore in order to create an effective vaccine it has to be effective for all the different strains of dengue anyway uh before we wrap this discussion up uh dr mike maybe give it to us in black and white maybe in just uh tips for the viewers at home uh you know before they leave the house they have to work na important things they should remember maybe just some several things that uh they should do or should not do uh with relation to dengue well uh uh i would recommend to all mothers and uh to all mothers or uh adults who have uh children or themselves persistent fever of more than three days uh or who have have episodes of nosebleed or gumbleed or feeling very very weak uh to please consult your doctor at the earliest possible time so that the necessary uh tests could be done in order to identify whether you have dengue fever or not okay alright thank you and uh well thank you very much dr wassmer thank you  welcome back to points of view   we 're talking about whether using one 's native uh tongue in the educational system  joining us is ed lapis he 's the head pastor but of day by day christian ministry president of kaloob cultural foundation  we also have bart guingona he 's a theater actor and a director and mrs ledinila santos director of bureau of elementary education decs and i think  okay so you were saying na mrs santos na mali daw ang ano mali ang sinabi naming uh policy in terms of the decs now what is the real policy of the decs uh the real policy is that we 're just using the lingua franca   oo  as a pilot for a pilot study in sixteen grade one classes in sixteen schools in the region as a pilot project it 's just a pilot project wherein we are going to use uh tagalog yeah in the in the areas where tagalog is widely spoken cebuano in the regions where cebuano is widely spoken and in ilocano ilocano where ilocano is widely spoken yeah uh from our roster of schools uh there will be eight which will be using tagalog alright five which will be using uh cebuano and three which will be using ilocano as a medium of instruction for all uh grade one subjects  but is this right right  but in the second quarter we will just we will be starting them with oral word 'no and probably oral english if they are ready but this is does this indicate a direction na eventually you really want to widen the scope of uh of filipino as a medium of instruction in all elementary schools well if uh the results of the study would show that the children will be learning better in the lingua franca then probably we could well not just immediately a policy but we could widen the scope of the experiment  pero ngayon hindi ba they are already using filipino in terms of certain subjects like uh sibika mga ganon hindi ba   they are using filipino  yeah they are using filipino for uh sibika at kultura  yeah uh good manners and right conduct but uh and of course filipino as a subject and reading in filipino uh huh and they use english for mathematics and for science and english as a language but in the ling lingua franca experiment we will be using we are not abandoning the bilingual program right right but we are just using the lingua franca as a bridge from the home setting to the school setting from the known language to an unknown language uh uh we are using the lingua franca as sort of a bridge so that the children can be led step by step to the new language to a new setting in the school rather than plunging them directly to something that is not   alright whether gradual or uh whe whether gradual and then do you know uh modulated and all that pero ang katotohanan nito we 're really going towards a policy where english will be de-emphasized and more filipino will be implemented oh no i don't think so uh we are still uh as i said we are not abandoning the bilingual uh policy we are just finding out a way by which we could teach english better probably if we start the children in a lingua franca meaning in a language that is not new to them  yeah   so does  uh we are looking forward to the time when when they learn because i think studies show that if the child learns the concept in his own native language there is better transfer to the new language  in his own native oo   so this is also trying to like uh students learn english better if we do that  i hope we hope that we can that that they will learn english better because i believe there are so many studies that have already been conducted   oo so for example  pag naintindihan na nila pag naintindihan na nila saka na mas madali  yeah pero excuse me lang i 'm sorry how do we evaluate success uh because if correct me if i 'm wrong but uh it 's it 's been done i remember when i was a kid uh an experiment like this was done where uhm the medium of instruction was uh was in filipino uh uhm and that was abandoned a few years later  uh obviously there there there 's a whole generation of kids who are running around very confused out there uh so there 's a unless you can evaluate it and quantify its its success then uhm it 's just going to be an experiment
