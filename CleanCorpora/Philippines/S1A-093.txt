i 'm an accounting student   and

uh my course i could not ask anyone because he 's the only accounting in the
family uh and also my  lola  but then she 's not here with us

""
 yes  
""
yes sir
""
""
where is he working

 uhm  
""

yea  two years now
""
""
 wow  
""
""
yes  chuckle 
""
""
that 's a good that 's a very nice that 's a great institution
huh
""
""
yes sir
""
actually i was also  ano e  uhm what do you call
this
""
i was also aiming for that kind of uhm  uhm profession that he
that he 's having   right now 
""
""
 okay  
""
but but you are in accountancy
""
""
yes of course but but then you know the the the what do you
call   this 
""
""
 the   demands of the
""
""
yes
""
""
the difficulties of uh being an accounting accounting  
student  are pretty how shall we put it  speaker a chuckles 
""
""
 yeah yeah  
""
""
uh demanding very demanding
""
""
yes yes very demanding because you know all companies need 
accounti  accountants right
""
they cannot run the business without accountants because who would
take care of their resources but the accountants
""
""
uh-hmmmh
""
""
and it is where with the with the uhm papers that accountants
are are making it is where they get their uhm uh what do you call this
 ano nga yun   laughter 
""
oh my god
""
""
why
""
""
oh my god
""
i 'm i 'm so nervous
""
""
why are you nervous
""
""
because i 'm with attorney bautista
""
i 'm going to talk to him   about anything 
""
""
 but you 've   never been my student
""
we 've   never been  i 've never had the privilege of
teaching you
""
""
uh yes sir
""
""
so don 't feel nervous
""
""
 chuckle  i 'm really sorry
""
i mean oh my god i mean i don 't know what to say oh my god
""
""
 laughter  let 's talk about your uh your family
""
how many brothers and sisters do you have
""
""
oh we are only two
""
""
uh
""
""
yes i only have one sister
""
we 're both girls
""
  yes 
""
""
 i see  
""
and you are the elder or the  young 
""
""
i 'm the eldest
""
""
you 're the elder   daughter  of your uh  of mr
 valenzuela   speaker a chuckles 
""
""
 yes  
""
yes
""
""
uh-huh and what does your mom do
""
""
uhm my mom  words  she 's a housewife but
uhm she can sometimes she can can uhm what do you call this teach  ay
 she does some tutorial jobs something like that yes to high school
students because
""
""
okay
""
""
she  ano  when she  wa  she was in
college she was taking liberal arts
""
""
okay
""
""
but then unluckily she she she did not uhm make it to the uh
what do you call this to the last year of her studies because she got married
""
""
oh
""
""
yes
""
but then then it 's okay with her because well being a plain
housewife and being a very good mom is you know
""
""
well don 't i don 't think we should uh  uh use the
adjective  plain    when  it comes to
 housewife    because  it sounds a bit
derogatory   you know 
""
""
 uh okay   so
""
 uh okay  
""
 yeah yeah  
""
""
it doesn 't sound right but well of course that 's what we hear
 no 
""
we always have that impression when uh when a a mother does not
work she is just a plain housewife
""
""
yes oh
""
""
but in reality     uh they  the  these
these individuals are these are the silent and the  bonafide
   heroes  of of our uh of our community
""
""
 uh-huh  
""
 uh-hmmmh  
""
""
had it not been for your mom  di ba   
  there would be a a i mean you would not be where you are today and
uh you really owe her a lot in the sense that uh her  she has given you
the her gift of presence
""
that 's one thing that working moms and working dads cannot give
their children
""
and their children as you have just pointed out   you 're
 already you 're already a young lady and yet you miss your father
""
""
 uh-huh  
""
 yes  
""
uh-hmmmh
""
""
you 're already i believe of voting age  are you not
""
""
uhm   uh 
""
""
 not   yet
""
""
not yet but actually i 'll be turning eighteen in july 
na 
""
""
oh so, you 're going to celebrate your debut
""
anyway as i was saying uh well children need the presence of at
least one parent  whi  while
""
""
yes that 's true
""
""
but of course uh the reality is that uh our uh demands our uh
our milieu our environment is is such a way that uh we no longer have the
presence of in some cases  no  both parents because both are
either working abroad     or they send their children to the 
prov  uh to to manila and they are province-based
""
therefore they don 't see their children because of these certain
uh  uh realities whether they are economic realities or social uh  uh
realities
""
some things we just have to accept
""
""
 uh-hmmmh  
""
yes
""
""
but i guess in your case you can still be thankful because
""
""
of course
""
""
because your mom is around and your father while he is
working abroad
""
by the way   uh  is he is he working in the states
""
""
 yes  
""
yes he is
""
""
uh so he is working in the world bank
""
is that in new york or is it in uh is it in uh   washington
 d c
""
""
 washington   d c
""
""
 ayan  washington d c
""
""
uh-hmmmh
""
""
so when is he scheduled to come back and pay you a visit
""
""
actually he doesn 't have any plans of coming back here in the
philippines because he he he wants to uh bring millions of dollars first 
chuckle 
""
""
uh-huh
""
""

""
""

""
""

""

girl
""
""

""
  when he 
""
""

""
""
here 's the story
""
when he was still here in the philippines i used to hate him 
 because  of some things that i don 't understand
""
""
 uh-huh  
""
uh-huh
""
""
but then when he 's gone    uhm 
""
""
 when   he 's out
""
""
yes when he went there   i  understand all of those
things why why he 's doing that thing
""
""
 okay  
""
oh
""
""
or it 's just because of for us it 's because of us it 's all
for us
""
""
okay okay
""
wait
""
what is your nickname
""
""
 pat 
""
""
 pat 
""
""
you can call me  pat  or  patis 
""
my parents used to call me  patis   chuckle 
""
""
okay  pat 
""
take a deep breath  speaker a takes a deep breath 
""
okay
""
""
okay
""
""
now you are more relaxed
""
are you relaxed
""
""
 speaker a takes a deep breath  okay
""
""
you have to take uh a deep breath when you are uh nervous or
agitated or when you 're made to speak before an audience of two thousand
three thousand people
""
""
yes
""
""
you know you have to take a deep breath
""
that   is one  thing that we should remember  speaker
a chuckles  when we especially when we speak in front of an audience
""
""
 uh-hmmmh  
""
yes thank you   so much 
""
""
 remember   that while while you cannot see me
visually
""
""
uh-hmmmh
""
""
uh and that 's why i see no reason why you have to be nervous
 speaker a chuckles  or or anxious
""
uh these these uh tips that i give you when you speak before an
audience you have to produce this uh aura of control of of confidence of
strength and we can only do this if you know if we are uh how can we put it
 no  if we are in a state of relaxation
""
""
yes
""
""
it 's it actually it 's a how would you it 's a you draw a fine
line between a relaxed uh mode and a tense mode
""
""
uh-hmmmh
""
""
but you got to be more on the relaxed mode
""
that way you can produce that aura uh
""
so that 's one thing that you need to remember when you when mr
flores is going to ask you to speak in front of an audience or conduct an
interview 
""
exhale inhale exhale
""
""
exhale
""
""
now let 's go back to the topic
""
""
okay
""
""

""
""
 yes because   before
""
""
why did you hate your father
""

""
""
uhm  uh it 's just that before before he 's not that close
to me and you know uhm  i mean  nothing
""

""
so there was a time when your dad didn 't work
""
""

""
uhm when i  wa  that was then two years
""
""
oh
""
""

for a while
""
""
and how did he how how how was he able to support you in
terms of education your   your  your daily sustenance
""
""
uh he has his savings
""
""

""
""
 already  
""
yes of which uhm enough for my high school
""
actually that was only two years so my third year and my fourth

""
""

""
""
it 's okay
""
i i lived uhm you know i graduated in graduated in a private
school so
""
""

in the
""
""
 that 's marikina  
""
""

""
""

english communication skills aside from uh uh talking uh or rather conversing
with your teachers over the phone
""
what other exercise did mr flores ask you
""
""
i think uhm reading
""
""

""
""
yes
""
""
okay
""
""
but i do love reading
""
""
uh-huh
""
""
but then you know we we can uh uh develop our speaking 
 skills  through reading right
""
""
   pat  
""
 pat  hold it uh
""
""
yes
""
""
 interruption  that is the the occupational hazard
""
""
ha ha ha
""
""

how long do you do you spend uh your uh waking hours on the phone
 laughter 
""
""
uhm actually i 'm not you know i 'm not fond of uh talking on
the phone

that 's good
""
""
because because you know i do i uh uh i mean i prefer to do a
lot more things in school
""
i mean i mean reading like doing my assignments than rather than
speaking with someone else on the   phone 
""
""
 correct  
""
""
because it 's not worth you know it 's not worth doing
""
""
did did were you provided a reading list this semester a list
of uh literature of books that uh  uh you have to  uh
""
""
uh uh yeah

uh no actually uhm  uhm  uhm most of our teachers they
didn 't  ano  they don 't assign books
""
i mean     they don 't give us some uh list of
books of which we can use  no
""
they just you know let us they will just ask us to read uhm or to
find a book which fits the topic that he is giving us but not necessarily
    he is giving this particular book for us to read
""
aside from mr flores he gave     he always he is
always giving us references
""
so that is good for us i i uh at least we can uhm you know we can
have these references with us unlike you know cramming and looking for 
 something 
""
""
 uh  
""
 uh-hmmmh  
""
 okay
