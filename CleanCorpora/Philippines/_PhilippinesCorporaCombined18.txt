hi issa how are you i 'm fine how about you i 'm fine where did you come from well i just had lunch with lala how about you i just had my finama one course code for financial management class  wha yeah you had lunch with lala how is she she 's fine well she just got sick the other day but right now she 's feeling okay we just had lunch in aristocrat that 's good hey guys you never told me about your love story you tell me about it well our love story is kinda long if it 's is it your break right now yes it is well if you have time maybe you can listen to it yeah i have all the time in the world well so when where do you want me to start from the beginning of course well okay it all started when i was second year college it was the first week since classes start i was trying to enjoy school i thought things didn't go my way because i had to take a leave of absence since i didn't want to accumulate failed units and i couldn't coordinate my studies and my football practices friends kept me company and all i did was to have fun with them and play football i liked some girls but i always found something wrong in each of them that made me stop liking them usually because they don't meet up to my standards since i already wanted to have an inspiration and get my life fixed there 's this girl in her first year a new fresh face in school her name was lala i liked her right away but i didn't have the guts to show her we had common friends and i eventually got to be with her quite often i realized that she was easy to get along she was funny easy to talk to and of course attractive i never thought i 'd get close to her i still didn't have the guts to show her that i liked her one day during the second term it was the first day of class i saw lala in the classroom where i was enrolled i realized that i didn't need that to take that subject only to find out that i took it already there was a mistake somewhere i don't know the teacher spoke to me and asked me to drop the class but i didn't want to because i felt so lucky and happy to be with to be her classmate i decided to stay and sat behi sit behind her the class was so boring and she was all i looked at she was just smiling at me the whole time chuckles  and it lit up my day somehow she was really bored and she didn't know anyone in class so she turned to me and taught me funny songs of april boys rico rico j puno and other songs april boys yup and those days that was like the hit song yuck laughter  she made me sing with her and laugh so hard the teacher always caught our attention and we enjoyed philhis course code for philippine history from then on weeks later she asked for my seatmate 's telephone number and i said how come me you never ask my phone number she said oh yeah what 's your number then i gave it to her she called me over the weekend and i said hello she sang she sang our favorite song we used to sing in philhis which was the song by fug the fugees called fugeela then i started laughing  i didn't have to ask who it was after that i found that her friends didn't have the same break as her so i called so from then on i kept her company for lunch and that 's how it started yeah that 's how it kind of started we got closer and closer until i felt that i wanted to be with her more often she even invited me to her birthday party and i was really excited and nervous about it weren't you there yeah i think i was and i saw you yeah that that was our first uhm acquaintance if you might want to call it that way yeah but when did you start really falling for her uhm let me see  i fell i really fell for her when we started to get close to each other and we started sharing our secrets we started to know more about each other and that 's when i realized that she 's the kind of girl who i 'd love to be with and spend most of the time with and the rest of your life with probably speaker b chuckles  i don't know how about you why don't you tell me something about your boyfriend if you do you have one yes i do yeah what 's his name uh his name is thomas but you still haven't told me how you asked her how i asked lala yeah you have to tell me that well it was a saturday night before that i invited her to my friend 's birthday party which was in dasma and so we spent the whole night together and when the day end uh when the night ended excuse me before i dropped her to her car i gave her uh a goodnight kiss  where   in the in the lips of course yeah and and she she made you kiss her   yeah it was more of a friendly smack in that that night then after uh  so i felt that night wasn't complete without saying what i felt for her oh my god  chuckles and then after i called when she got home i called her up and eventually i told her that i loved her and she 's   and what did she say she said yeah me too but then that love was more like i love you as a friend something like that so now that i got to say how i felt it made me feel better then the next day we talked about it and then after we kinda exchanged thoughts about each other  and i don't know  love took its course from then on wow what a very inspiring story thank you issa how about you can you tell me something about your boyfriend about tommy yeah what 's his real name uhm thomas skiden   oh   well he 's swedish that 's why he has that family name i see uhm how did you meet tommy well tommy and i we met at a friend 's party at the hard rock cafe laughter last august of nineteen ninety-six yeah i 'm always there oh yeah how come i didn't see you that night probably because i was out with my lala wow laughter  anyway i didn't really expect to meet someone like him  yeah   'cause that time my my mind was pretty oc preoccupied it was i was thinking about someone else and that time uhm we weren't really in good terms really and so when i met him i just decided what the heck just talk to him and entertain him the whole night since it was my friend 's party anyway yeah  and we started talking and then we found that we had so much things in common and then he asked me to dance and so i danced with him yeah you danced  and   what song  i remember we danced to let 's groove by earth wind and fire  oh  i like that song yeah it it 's a cool song yeah and after that night it became one of our songs for each other 'cause it 's so memorable  cool so that night  so that that was a night to remember oh yeah you bet it if it weren't for that night we wouldn't have met oh so after that night uhm he asked he started calling me up 'cause he asked for my number from my friend yeah and so of course i gave it 'cause i kinda liked him in a way in a friendly way or in a friendly way because he was such a sweet person and then before i knew it he started court not not courting but showing signs of liking me already but at that time i liked someone else  yeah  really yes i think he 's your i think he 's your friend laughter  uh what 's his name  tonio chuckle   tonio yeah he 's my friend he plays football with me yeah uh i know that chuckles  anyway so what happened between you and tonio before you and tommy uhm tonio and i were have been friends for two years two years that 's too long   and during that time we knew that we liked each other but nothing happened oh really and that frustrated me because i thought he liked me and if he had liked me then he would have but i think he   started calling me up already but i think he really liked you then yeah but then he didn't show signs  he was just he was just too shy probably yeah anyway anyway back to your story yeah uhm when i started getting to know tommy better i started thinking to myself why not give him a chance and drop tonio  exactly yeah that was what i did last was that a difficult decision it was one of the most difficult decisions in my life but it was the best that i 've made so far so it was a blessing yes it was a blessing in disguise i met uh we started talking we started really talking to each other last october of nineteen ninety-six and then uhm which means we 'd start going out he 'd asked me out on dates he 'd call me up every day then if wow he 's so sweet yeah he 's very sweet and if i couldn't go out on a weekend he would insist that he 'd see me so he 'd tell me he 'd ask me if i if he could visit me at home he really showed his emotions for you yes like he was very open about it he wasn't shy there is no pride in him like he he fully expressed his likeness for me yeah and i and i and i ful and i accepted it 'cause i like the feeling that it was giving me i 'd have butterflies in my stomach it made you feel like a girl well i am a girl chuckles  well yeah it made he made me feel like a lady like a woman there and then uhm he asked me december twenty of he asked me last december twenty-one nineteen ninety-six yeah i remember that day i 'll never forget that day that he asked me  and it was such a shock because it was fast  so that was your like  he would he was just calling me up for barely two months yeah and he asked me already that night no way yeah and that so were you shocked i was shocked i surprised yes i was so surprised speechless very speechless because i didn't i didn't love him yet that time i just liked him a lot yeah but he told me already that he loved me so what i did was that i just took the chance risked it i risked i risked it yeah i mean i won't it 's not as if i 'm gonna end up marrying him anyway and i was young then so might as well yeah and then so i answered him yes wow and ever since that night i i i 've become the happiest girl here you know like in the world yeah 'cause he 'd always be so nice to me   so it all paid off eventually oh yeah it it all paid off but there 's one big problem pete what 's that issa uhm right now we 're hav it 's a long distance relationship that we 're having don't tell me he 's in sweden no he 's in san francisco no way so how does that work well
