today i decided not to speak on education because it 's i think over-discussed over-talked and still no action so it 's there is a sense of frustration on my part that despite the very familiar and well-known problems of education in this country not not much in terms of policy change in terms of uh of reform initiatives have taken place and uh so i said i 'm going to choose another topic which also affects in a way not directly but affects in a way our educational our education our standards our or or the state of education and that is corruption e corruption in our country  i have a powerpoint = presentation here like like dan 's introduction it 's also a summary also a summary presentation this will not be the last word on the state of corruption in our country but i 'd like to sketch to you in general terms the magnitude of uh official and political corruption in our country and uh how in my mind it affects the the even the direction of our country so let me begin by saying that the stench of corruption is the only constant it seems in our public life for every peso for every peso spent on infrastructure projects and the procurement of goods and services you know public bidding for goods and services between twenty to fifty centavo of that peso is lost to corruption so if you have a let 's just for simplicity a one hundred peso road that road is only fifty peso worth so very very shallow and one night of rain will be washed away  now this is the this is an official study an official study conducted by the world bank not just of the philippines but of uh of several member nations of the world in uh last year you see the magnitude of money of public resources lost to official corruption in the last twenty years forty-eight billion u s dollars and as of twenty o one that would have been sufficient to pay off our debt our foreign debt you know i attended an anti-corruption conference in ottawa in the middle of october one of the resource persons is the president of the world institute which initiated this study and gave an overview of corruption in the world and i really sat so embarrassed because he cited us specifically as one country that has not done anything to stem the tide of corruption well this is familiar data the transparency international a berlin-based monitoring and surveillance agency last august issued this  sur this uh finding our country is the eleventh most corrupt among one hundred two countries that places us in the same category as paki pakistan  zim zimbabwe and romania i think that this uh level of corruption is also eating up into our competitive status into our competitiveness because another study by the world economic forum which is a geneva-based uh uh group of uh businessmen that holds regular fora all over the world came up with this competitiveness 1 word  last year we were forty-eight number forty-eight in the competitiveness ranking today just one year later we have dropped to sixty-one a change of thirteen thirteen levels the same group the world economic forum has a public institution index and the components of this index is how we administer contracts what is the state of our law the independence of the judiciary etcetera  and the other is the corruption level how do we rank in the public institution index last year we were number sixty-three today this year barely a year we have dropped to number seventy so the the pace the pace and and character of corruption in our country is is on a rapid decline rather on a rapid rise now how much does our country lose every year in terms of purchase of goods and equipment and the commissioning of civil works that is the calculation not by us the opposition that is the calculation of our own department of budget we 're losing twenty-two billion pesos a year bec on account of corruption in the public bidding process what can twenty-two billion do this is a rough translation of what twenty-two billion a year if we have that can do well it can we can build forty-four thousand seven hundred new classrooms we can buy twenty-four million new books we can purchase four million desks and acquire forty-four thousand computers new computers so if we can only save on what we lose through corruption i think this perennial school crisis that we encounter every school opening of lack of classrooms lack of teachers lack of desks and textbooks can be alleviated we i think we we remain the only country in the whole of north and south east asia with the largest class size our class size is averaging fifty-five to sixty pupils per per per class china with one point two billion pesos should be people  has a class size of only thirty-two thirty-two pupils malaysia malaysia and singapore of course they are relatively prosperous has a class size of nineteen so that that measures the magnitude of the lack of basic basic uh needs of the education sector in our country now but what can we do should we just uh uh tell each other and relate this sad story to each other and not do anything what can be done as a practical doable way i suggest that uh this i think this can be done number one we must strengthen the oversight function of congress unfortunately our people the public doesn't doesn't think that  congressio that congress could be a redeeming factor which is quite unfortunate and that congressional investigation helps but in in any in any parliamentary democracy congress oversight function is an effective deterrence to public wrongdoing of government so we we ought to to do this and strengthen the oversight function of congress we must reform the the public bidding process of our country the the bidding process of our country which requires a pre-qualification uh stage then a main main evaluation is so designed that it can be easily manipulated for instance my own experience in the department of agriculture when we were bidding out not just millions but billions of pesos for irrigation projects shows that in the pre-qualification process itself you can already favor the contractor you want somehow they 're able to to arrange that a favored contractor and a favored contractor is usually one who can give the most is chosen even before ahead of the main evaluation of the uh tenders so i have filed and i am i have we are now debating in the plenary a government procurement reform act and this essentially this essentially contains the the following requirements we are now going to announce bids not just in a newspaper but uh but in the internet we 'll put we 'll post it on the web site every government agency must post it on the web site this practice of putting a floor also deprives government of the opportunity to get really the best price because usually the the floor set the floor set is generally higher than what the market tells us we 're going to prohibit or at least regulate the so-called price adjustments and change orders what what does what does this mean when you are a contractor you will bid and you will submit probably a ridiculously low low bid and under our rules since the lowest bidder is the is awarded the contract then i will get the contract but after we 've concluded the contract i will ask the agency to change i will submit a change order or the agency will submit a change order and it 's not unusual that the original bid which won can be doubled through these change orders and price adjustment the classic case of that is the so-called diosdado macapagal avenue it doubled not because of the original bidded price but because of change orders the contractor won it because he really underbidded everybody and by our rules he he got the contract we 're now going to impose a five-year warranty which there is none as of the moment a contractor can build that road to your village in one year it may be wiped out by the rains and he 's not liable at all even if you can demonstrate that he put in less gravel he put in less cement and finally this open and competitive public bidding as i said tenders now will be placed on the internet on the web site anyone anywhere in this country can bid so we hope that uh by making public bidding more open and more transparent we would at least reduce the incidence of under-the-table and corrupt practices the third uh the third area of concern to us is campaign finance in this country you can really pinpoint the business interests the businessmen who regularly finance electoral campaigns whether for president or senators or congressmen or and maybe i am exaggerating but sonny knows this there are regulars they 're professional fund uh campaign donors year in election after election they are the regular regulars but when you are elected as a result of the support of this these few who do you think you owe your allegiance or your loyalty do you think you can really introduce radical and structural reform in business in the society if your funder or his interests will be hurt but that is the traditional state of campaign finance in our country but there is a new even more sinister funding source and that is the gambling and the drug and the drug lords  jueteng lords have always funded especially the local elections but we 've seen that even national elections have been supported by jueteng lords and we 've tolerated it i think and we have not made any outcry at all up to now but we are seeing drug money going into the electoral uh system and to me that is that is so dangerous and that 's why that 's uh we i i put together with other senators a campaign finance reform act and i 've convinced my colleagues in the house to file it too that will may not eliminate it totally but at least bring it out into the open compel candidates and donors to disclose their donations in the same manner that many countries outside the philippines have done so consistently and uniformly in the past two or three years we 're the only country now remaining without a campaign finance reform act because when you come come to think of it maybe the state of politics in this country is such because we 've not taken care of the way we are financing and choosing our leaders and if unless we do something about it i think we will be perpetually held hostage by vested interests gambling and other illegal activities syndicates as well as drug drug lords now let me go back to effective oversight  really if uh if our parliamentarians realize the the good that can be achieved by the proper exercise of of parliamentary oversight of congressional oversight i think we will we will it will serve a very powerful deterrence to wrongdoing in government but unfortunately as i said you know people don't look very kindly on congress and on our investigation and that 's why it 's important that we invest our congress that quality of integrity and credibility otherwise we will never we 'll never be able to effectively provide the check and balance that we need in in our country and also that means that the committees and and its staff must be well-trained and well-motivated i 've been to to several international fora discussing all this and i 'm really quite impressed at the efforts being exerted by many parliaments by many governments in providing support in terms of training and resources to to parliaments and and the professional staff which we are not doing in this country  now let me clears throat go back again to the political parties we must also worry about the political parties because political parties both in theory and practice is supposed to be the the screening mechanism by which we select potential leaders of our society and of our politics and supposed to provide the training and the orientation to them that 's not being performed by any political party in this country because as you very well know and i 'll repeat the trite remark political parties in this country are more factions rather than genuine political parties based on ideology based on programs it 's more personalistic than you can ever find i just attended over the weekend an international conference of political parties of asia and uh and uh many political parties in asia except the except the totalitarian states really have a competitive party system they look to the parties to to influence the course and content of public policy and through their selection of the present and future leaders they really make a big impact on the society now what is the bane of our political parties apart from the lack of ideology why is it that it 's so easy to leave your party and join another the yung balimbing star fruit, a many-sided fruit, reference to turncoatism i think that 's unique to us i think that that 's also a function of the of the political system our political system is a winner-take-all system uh pag natalo ka talagang talo ka e = if you lose you really lose you 're wiped out and all the all the patronage and the advantages go to the winner who now dispense the perks and the pork barrels but that 's not i think the main goal of of the party system just to patronage and all but yet that is how it operates in our country 3
