okay in action research that means that lewin was interested in transforming a life problem okay a real life problem into into controlled research and so he would observe something that 's wrong with the environment with the society okay and try to research that okay using a carefully controlled study and always it 's a controlled research and always using a theoretical framework he never did research without first having a theoretical framework okay which is how research should be done as you all know okay so he first observed something that 's wrong with the society came out with a theory that would explain that and then tested that theory okay for example one of his important researches is that of group decision making  okay a firm it started with a firm hiring him to look at the low productivity of the firm they are a factory the factory had very poor productivity very low productivity so lewin went to the environment observed what was wrong okay and he found that the workers were not motivated to produce  the workers had long hours they had a quota for the factory they had to fulfill a quota per day and so the first thing he found out was that the work was simply too much for the workers okay and the workers had no say okay about what they should be doing at work okay so what he did made his theory was that if you allow the workers to make their own decisions regarding their work okay then they would produce more  okay in your thesis if we allowed you to do a topic of your choice then that would make you work more di ba than if we assigned you your own topic okay so what he did was he grouped the workers into smaller groups asked them to come up with what they thought was a reasonable quota reasonable working hours that was presented to management okay they tried it out and they found out as a result of that group decision making productivity indeed went up they 're very practical very approachable  okay another relevant research especially at that time the nineteen forties in the u s racial discrimination  it was still a very big major problem and one of the problems was that the blacks of course at that time were already free so they had problems integrating into white communities okay because of discrimination  his theory about that is that discrimination exists because of segregation because the blacks lived in one community and the whites lived in another community if we allowed them to mingle okay if we mixed them okay then discrimination their attitudes discriminative attitudes would decrease okay so 'yong research niya quasi-experimental okay in one housing settlement in one housing settlement where there were several apartment buildings in alternating apartment buildings are black and white families okay so in one building it 's purely black families in another building purely white okay in a way it 's mixed but still segregated 'cause they 're still in separate buildings compared to another housing facility okay wherein in all buildings the families are mixed black and white okay where would you think discrimination is more likely to exist bad attitudes a student responds  in here why   kunyari you went camping with ateneans okay and we put you in separate tents okay compared to in this type wherein you 're together in the same tent where would negative feelings more likely be encouraged students answer in chorus  when you 're in separate tents and the same was found in this research when they were in separate buildings discrimination was more pronounced  discrimination was also found in stores in department stores wherein there were black personnel and white clients were complaining okay about black salespersons  so lewin wanted to see if having a black salesperson really is detrimental to sales okay because of the complaint of white customers okay so he interviewed customers as they went out the stores okay and asked them would you buy from a black salesperson and many of them said no and yet when he went inside the store and observed okay it was not true they were buying also from black personnel there was no difference between a black and the white personnel okay they were buying from any salesperson regardless of race  okay so with this research he showed the complaints of white clients were not founded and there was no reason to take out black salespersons because sales was not affected by their color or their race  other research seems to counter what lewin did words  wherein he says if you want attitudes to change you should change the behavior first  where usually the belief is if you want behavior to change change the attitude first he showed through his research that the opposite can also be done and he showed this in policies by changing policies of universities regarding admissions  this practice is still being done in in several universities in the u s okay wherein they have a quota for different racial groups okay and they have to fill that quota so if their aim is to have twenty percent admissions black admissions they have to fill the twenty percent  if only fifteen qualified they should still active actively recruit five percent more okay  ganoon talaga  active recruitment to fill the quota okay to make sure that the races are represented in the universities and he said only if you forced universities to integrate black whites indians asians okay so you 're changing the behavior you 're forcing them to go together in one place eventually it will result in change in attitudes  okay think of one group right now which you cannot stand if any  ano  iraqis iraqis if i force you to be together in one room even for a week  sobra naman kayo miss  or hindi in a nicer place in uh a beach house okay kung andoon kayo anong mangyayari  okay in a nice place if you are put together in a favorable setting such as that your attitudes will change and by forcing you to change behaviors you will force yourself to get to know the other group okay and he showed that also with his research now because of this lewin now he was given recognition in that every year there is now a kurt lewin award given to a psychologist who has contributed to the study of social issues  are there any questions about my favorite psychologist  i assume you have no criticisms  and so words i like about lewin his major theory is in topology the one that we discussed last time physiolo psychophysical field he also branched out into other areas okay all of these are very different from his psychophysical field okay  walang tanong  okay we 'll move on to a new topic clinical psychology  during the renaissance okay so that 's around the fourteenth to the fifteenth century mental illness was viewed very differently what do you think were the early views of mental illness  abnormal yeah abnormal but what 's the cause of it evil spirits evil spirits demon possession witchcraft and so on  okay for example one of the first books to be written about what actually was mental illness was the mallus mallificarum  that 's a that 's a book the title of a book  in fourteen eighty-seven written by two bishops so it had the approval of the church  it had three sections  literally every words  it had three sections first it gave proof that witches exist  the second part which is of more interest to us is it gave descriptions of characteristics and behaviors of witches okay it gave descriptions of characteristics and behaviors of witches and if these descriptions were read by psychologists today or by you you 'd recognize that many of them were actually traits of mentally ill people like symptoms of depression hallucination paranoia schizophrenia okay uhm if you were to read it today you would recognize it as actually symptoms of mental disorders okay and at that time at that time it was recognized as behaviors of being a witch  okay the mallus said that witchcraft comes from carnal lust okay witchcraft comes from carnal lust which is then which satisfaction then is sought from the devil  okay and he says the reason why there are more women who are witches is that this carnal lust is never satisfied in women students laugh  okay according to the two bishops who were men who wrote mallus mallificarum  and in fact at the time about eighty-five percent of all witches who were executed were women  talagang mas marami talaga  more women were witches or identified as witches  and part three of the mallus describes ways of identifying witches  okay like for example one way is by burning at the stake  'pag hindi sila nasunog okay they won't burn that means they 're a witch in which case they 'll be killed okay now if they die at the stake it means that they were not witches but soon they die so either way as soon as the person is identified as a witch wala na talo na okay no matter what trial they use the witch or the alleged witch may end up being dead  okay so because witchcraft is believed at that time to be caused by demons or devils the most popular form of taking care of of what we now know as mental illness is by either by killing by executions okay or by driving away the evil spirits  for example here are some paintings sixteenth sixteenth century paintings okay this one shows exorcism okay of two men who showed symptoms of mental illness and after exorcism the demons came out after which they were cured in this very small picture two people burn at the stake and while being burned again the demons were driven away and so whatever the method the logic is to drive away the demons from the body  in fifteen forty-seven in london the first institution for the mentally insane was constructed it was officially called the saint mary of bethlehem okay but its nickname is old bedlam   kasi ang gulo magulo sa loob  okay at that time there were caretakers who took care of the inmates they had a very small salary okay so what they did they allowed outsiders to go into old bedlam pay admission and then look at the inmates okay  parang zoo  okay here 's again a painting of old bedlam  eto yung mentally insane here are two rich ladies who paid admission to go in so they can view the inmates at that time other disorders other kinds of mental disorders were not allowed in the institution like for example if a person is suffering from depression okay the person is allowed to roam the streets because a depressed person really will not harm anyone okay and if a depressed person is in the institution it 's not fun viewing a depressed person or it does not make for attractive viewing so the kinds of people that they put in are those which are schizophrenic and those who are violent those who are chained okay it attracts more viewers than  institutions of that kind they were now all over europe but in many of those institutions the care provided was not really to cure the mental illness but more custodial care okay so simply giving food and shelter to the people who were already in the institutions the violent ones were chained okay and what is common at that time once you go in really you practically never go out okay because those people do not become cured of their mental illness  philippe pinel was the first to institute reforms in these mental institutions  his interest in studying the insane began when a very close friend of his suffering from manic depression came to him one time and told him about the problem  okay at one point during one of his manic fits okay the friend went into the woods okay where he got lost and was eaten by wolves and so he was greatly disturbed by that and he spent the rest of his life doing studies on the insane okay so doon nagsimula ang interest niya on the insane his philosophy was that the insane were not animals okay that should be viewed but rather people who need treatment  when he wrote an article okay describing how the insane should be treated it caught the attention of a government official who was in charge of hospitals in paris and that 's how he became he was assigned to this ment mental institution for men word paris in seventeen ninety-three  the first thing he did was to unchain some of the inmates okay with very strong opposition from the other supervisors one of the men that he unchained okay was one who killed one of the guards okay with his chains manacles and he had killed one of the guards before and yet when he unchained him the man suddenly became very gentle and two years later the man was completely cured okay and assisted pinel in the asylum the insane asylum okay so he showed that humane treatment okay is always necessary for curing the insane and the reason why they were not cured is because of the inhumane treatment that they were getting
