""
""
but you know these are expected and so far uh you know we probably proceed and finish the voting  'no  without much uh you know problem violence  etcetera 
""
now the canvass itself that would start some time you know uh between the hours of four and five  kasi hindi naman magsisimula ng  three  'yan e 
""
uh no uh nap  'no  and gaby because according to the election code  'pag may mga tao pa 'no  within thirty meters from the polls  eh siyempre itutuloy 'yan 'no 
""
so  ang  experience  namin diyan  is uh the polls would naturally close
""
when i say  close   'yung bang talagang isasarado na 'no mga  about five thirty  'no  to six o' clock
""
 palagay ko diyan  and hopefully you know uh nap has the voice of an angel  na magiging  peaceful  'yan  throughout  'no 
 because the second process to me is the most important  e 
""
 dyan kasi 'yan nagkakagulo 
""
""
even to the second process my my theory applies
""
in the sense that the cheats will be there will cheat if allowed by the comelec if allowed by the armed forces and if supported by the president
""
that has been the experience i 've been uh observing
""
i 've been analyzing political exercises in the country for several years i won't tell you how many years  laughter 
""
and in my study there could only be cheating on a large scale if there is a connivance and a cooperation between the president the comelec and the armed forces
""
and if you look into the character of the military brass they 're also no-nonsense people like the comelec people
""
so the cheats would not be very comfortable or would not succeed in cheating under the circumstances under any of the process at any stage of the of the election
""
""
i think also in a manner of speaking nap  'no  your uh uh you know statement that the cheats would probably not have their day it 's because there are many watchers inside  'no 
""
simply because there are many positions  'no  that are being elected  kanina nga noong pumasok ako  believe it or not  'no  uh when the polls opened  mas marami ang  watchers  e 
""
uh so i think in a way that will also uh not so much eliminate  'no  but minimize  'no 
""
but this is something that we have to see
""
 sumisenyas 'ata si gaby 
""
""
i hate to interrupt your discussion gentlemen but at this point we 'd like to break and bring the viewers to listen to ms josephine reyes and dong puno from z m m  music   break in recording 
""
""
in fact i would like to get back to pastor israel parlade whose groups had asked the different candidates in pasay to sign a covenant of unity for hope
""
uhm while the church has a moral force pastor parlade there is no punitive or coercive force of the church
""
i mean what are you going to do for example if you are going to see that your covenant has not been observed by some of these candidates
""
what are you going to do given that situation
""
""
we leave that to the lord in prayer trusting really that the lord honors the prayer of the righteous
""
""
are you going to fulfill a prophetic role in the sense of saying that certain candidates did not live by their word and therefore the citizenship be guided at that point
""
""
well before they signed the covenant we made it very clear to them that they 're not dealing with men that they 're dealing with almighty god
""
and we made them realize the consequence of abiding in the terms of the covenant blessings for their families and uh for those who 'll violate the terms of the covenant curse for the candidate and reproach upon the family for life
""
""
that 's a very strong statement   actually when you think about  it these these these are messages that these candidates should be thinking about
""
""
 yes yes  
""
""
let me move on to reverend noli estabillo who represents as assistant pastor the  jesus is lord fellowship 
""
this is i understand uh one of those groups called  born again christian  in their in faith
""
can you tell us a little bit more about about how large this group is uh reverend
""
""
well uh  jesus is lord fellowship  is a a part of the  philippines for jesus movement  which is a coalition of bible-based christ-centered fellowship ministries and churches in the philippines chairman by
 the national chairman is brother eddie c villanueva
""
""
and this is a national movement
""
""
yes nationwide composed of more or less uh more than three hundred fellowships around the country
""
""
uh what 's in your mind when you made decisions about the activities that you were going to be engaged in
""
what was the source of your guidance uh
""
""
well you see really we cannot really separate uh our concern and burden for the nation from the bible
""
because the bible speaks uh uh uh openly about the nation and what is the condition of it
""
in uh psalms in proverbs twenty-nine verse two said  when the righteous are in authority the people rejoice but when the wicked  word  rules the people mourns 
""
""
but what about post-election
""
this whole moral suasion and moral force that is exuded by many of these church groups
""
how will you be able to continue in terms of and continuing to energize from your own moral direction the government for example of this country
""
""
well we are commanded by god in the bible in second timothy chapter two to pray for those who are in authority that we may live a quiet and a peaceable life
 
what about if you see something that is not being done according to what you interpret as biblical instruction
""
""
again we leave that to the lord because uh you see it is within the sovereignty of god in daniel chapter two verse twenty-one he said he changes the time he changes the season he removes things and puts new things
""
so it is within the sovereignty of god to place uh those who are in authority
""
""
 sa palagay n'yo ba  reverend estabillo  'yong mga nagdadasal ninyong mga grupo ay talagang nasa isip at nasa puso nila na ang binabasa nila sa bibliya ay dapat mayroong uh  expression  mayroon ring nakikita na ito'y nakikita sa  sos  sosyedad 
""
""
yes of course we should not only read the bible but we should live by the bible
""
""
is there a way in which you are able to for example monitor the activities of your membership in in terms of their political activism
""
""
uh well
""
""
 kung ito ay tama 
""
""
as i said  kanina hindi mo talaga puwedeng mapaghiwalay ito 'no 
""
and our members have been really praying for foremost for our nation
""
""
thank you very much reverend estabillo
 i we will take a break and i would like to thank the guests that we have had who have already spoken
""
ahm we want you to come back and join us in   halalan ninety-two    music 
""
""
we will show you a video of president aquino voting in tarlac 
""
that was his joke  'no 
""
well anyway you can see she is voting like any ordinary citizen alright she is wearing her signature yellow color
""
""
her favorite color ina
""
""
 laughter  is it
""
probably for good luck
""
alright so there she is 
""
she stayed uh for only a few minutes at the booth i
""
i 'm sure she knows exactly who she would vote for
""
alright that 's kris aquino 
""
 o  good there
""
is this her first time to vote
""
how old is kris
""
i think this is her first time to vote if i 'm not mistaken yeah
""
alright that 's another presidential daughter 
""
it 's pinky  or viel
""
alright there you have it the entire family went all the way to tarlac to vote
""
there 's ballsy aquino-cruz
""
""
 alam mo ina tinatime-an ko si presidente kung  how long it would take her to vote
""
 kasi ako kanina noong wala kayo sinabi ko nga dodie 'no  it took me six minutes uh  'no  with all the sample ballots that i prepared myself  'no baka si mrs aquino mas kukunti nap  but  laughter   kukumpletuhin mo 'yong benty kuwatro 
""
""
 kayo naman 
""
""
 at saka  uhm  'no  one minute and a half minute  na siya riyan 
""
""
 kayo naman   laughter 
  hindi ho kasi  most people   have a list 
""
""
 apparently she still uh apparently she is still   going through the tedious process  words  of her preferred choices
""
""
look i 'm sure she has twenty-four like most of us
""
all of us had lists prepared
""
at least the four of us i 'm sure before we got there we knew exactly who we were voting for
""
so on the average like what mr cayetano said it takes about six to ten minutes per voter
""
""
so  ako kasi e ang ginagawa ko kasi kahit na mayroon akong kodigo siyempre tiningnan ko muna 'yong kodigo ko at saka uh sa mga  senatorial  nagbago siyempre ako 'no kaya  it took me some time
""
 pero kung talagang susundin mo 'yong kodigo mo  easily four minutes  tapos 
""
""
mr cayetano  tapos na ho si pangulong aquino 
""
""
 o ayan inorasan ko siya 
""
so two minutes and fifteen seconds
""
 palagay ko 'yan  straight
""
 hindi na nag-isip ok lang 'yon 'no dahil  per time  'no dahil kung meron siyang  sample ballot  tama lang 'yon 'no 
""
 ngayon sabi nga ni nap baka iba ang binoto   laughter 
""
""
 nagbibiro naman kayo 
""
it was a quick uh voting for mrs aquino
""
as you can see she is almost done
""
 nilagyan din siya ng  indelible ink  kagaya nating lahat 'no 
""
exactly how long is this indelible ink supposed to last
""
""
two days
""
""
two days
""
""
two days at least two days
""
and it will just fade away 
""
alright it 's wonderful news a lot of people i mean some naughty people are claiming that this is not as indelible as it should be
""
""
 hindi basta nasa  cuticle  mo  indelible  'yon  unless you cut your finger
""
""
your fingernails  laughter 
""
""
 hindi  you have another finger added to it
<
""
 pero talagang mahirap alisin 
""
""
 tapos na hong bumoto ang pangulong aquino 
""
 hinihintay na lang niyang matapos ang kanyang mga anak   music 
""
so ladies and gentlemen you saw the president herself cast her vote at  hacienda  luisita in  tarlac kasama ho niya ang kanyang buong pamilya na bumoto 
""
so gentlemen is there anything you 'd like to say about that
""
mr rama has been very quiet
""
""
well as i was saying that the voting process itself has been solved by the comelec
""
but it is the counting plus continue the canvassing because you have to read so many names
""
you have to read from thirty to forty names
""
here in metro manila you have to read forty-four names thirty-four names
""
but uh shifting to other topic i did notice that there are several foreign observers who are here   watching  the election process and several uh foreign correspondents
""
""
 yes  
""
""
now what do they think at this at this at this stage of the game
""
that 's one thing that we should probably find out
""
uh what is verifiable is that uh many of these foreign correspondents have been writing about the election process of the philippines and they take a very dim view of our democracy here and our election process
""
well uh they have been influenced also by our media because we have people in media who specialize in bashing our election process bashing the constitution bashing our democracy
""
but uh sometimes we should know how how to count our blessings
""
do we realize that there are very few third countries in the world that hold election democratic election and there is probably none of all those who have uh emerged from a dictatorship to restore democracy while going through the election process
""
this is very uh you know delicate process and we should be happy and some of these third uh countries are watching us with some admiration and fascination that we are able to do so
""
""
uh uhm
""
""
so i would suggest that we should be a little more positive
""
""
yes uhm philippine politics may have its flaws but we should still   count  ourselves   lucky or  word 
""
""
 yeah  
""
 if you are a foreigner   and you watch and listen to all these uh the confusion  ballot boxes not arriving official ballot not arriving people cannot find their precincts  etcetera 
""
