""
""
yes doctor
""
""
okay so what 's your chief complaint
""
what 's wrong
""
what do you feel right now
""
""
i have been coughing for a week now and i am having a hard
time talking 'cause there 's this phlegm in my throat
""
""
okay so your chief complaint is cough
""
and okay let 's move on to your uhm the history of your present
illness and according to you it 's been for a week now
""
could you  could you go through this uh  uh on detail
""
what happened first
""
did you have cough at first  or did you have any fever back then
""
""
i first had this cold
""
""
okay
""
""
yeah and then a slight fever
""
""
so you had a low-grade fever a week ago
""
let 's start  okay seven days ago you had colds
""
""
yes
""
""
uhm did you have any cough with this at that time
""
""
uhm no not that time
""
it was around two days after
""
""
okay did you have a sore throat with it
""
""
yeah
""
""
okay you had difficulty swallowing
""
""
uh-huh i had a hard time eating
""
""
okay and uh any fever
""
""
not then  no
""
""
no fever okay now six days ago  uh the same symptoms
persisted right
""
""
yes doctor
""
""
did you have any uh cough then
""
""
no no
""
""
so you just had cough five days ago
""
""
yeah
""
""
okay let 's say five days ago
""
was the cough dry or was it productive of phlegm
""
""
yeah it was i had phlegm
""
""
did the fever persist until this day
""
""
no not much just the cough
""
""
so you didn't have any fever anymore
""
did your fever  so your fever  word  but you
had cough and phlegm
""
""
yeah
""
""
what was the color of the phlegm would you say
""
""
at first it was white
""
""
okay whitish
""
""
then after two days it turned into green
""
""
okay so uhm  three days ago you noticed your phlegm to have
changed to green and uh i suppose you had fever at this time
""
""
uh-huh yeah
""
""
okay it was how would you say it was high-grade or
moderate-grade low-grade
""
""
it was a high grade
""
""
okay was it persistent
""
did it persist the whole day or uh did it go down
""
""
it went down
""
""
did you take any uh medications with this
""
""
yes doctor
""
""
for fever i suppose
""
""
yes
""
""
okay  so that 's the reason why it went down
""
okay uhm  so you 're presenting here with cough of a week 's
duration   enunciated  by colds fever uh moderate to high grade and
you 'd say that the cough is productive of greenish phlegm
""
""
uh uhm
""
""
okay based on this alone i could tell you that you 've had a
bacterial bacterial infection which most probably would be causing your fever
and that will be persistent and the only reason why your fever had gone down
first time was because of the analgesic you took and uh anti-pyretic 
""
so let 's move on to your past history  uh would you have any
hypertension
""
""
no
""
""
diabetes
""
""
no
""
""
asthma
""
""
no
""
""
were you ever hospitalized before
""
""
no
""
""
how about operated on
""
""
no
""
""
okay uhm do you have any smoking history
""
""
yes
""
""
uh  how much do you smoke
""
""
i smoke around five sticks a day
""
""
for how long now
""
""
uhm  three years
""
""
three years  okay and do you have any alcoholic beverage
intake
""
""
no not much just a bit
""
i drink occasionally when there 's you know
""
""
okay occasionally for how long now
""
""
uhm  about four five years
""
""
uh uhm  so i presume you 're a college student
""
""
yeah
""
""
okay and in your family history do you have any  heredity
 familial diseases like asthma
""
""
no
""
""
is there any diabetes
""
""
yes there is
""
""
uh who has diabetes in the family
""
""
my mother
""
""
okay uh hypertension
""
""
no
""
""
any uh any family member with  tub  uh tuberculosis
""
""
no
""
""
okay  how about heart diseases
""
""
no
""
""
cancer
""
""
no none of that
""
""
seizures
""
""
no
""
""
uhm  okay  so i guess i just have to do a little
physical examination on you now
""
""
yeah  would it be hard for me
""
""
no uh that 's no problem
""
so i would just be seated for a while and i 'll proceed with my
examination
""
""
thank you doctor
""
""
okay uh  would you please take a deep breath  speaker a
takes a deep breath 
""
okay uhm i see that uh  your  sclera  aren't uh
yellowish your conjunctiva are pink
""
uhm  you have some lymph nodes here on your neck
""
and please open your mouth
""
""
uh  opens his mouth 
""
""
okay that 's good and uh i could see that your tonsils are
inflamed and they 're  word  so that 's another sign of
infection plus the lymph nodes on your neck
""
""
what is the lymph nodes mean i mean uh
""
""
uh it 's just a  it just accounts more for uh the fact
that you have a bacterial infection and the lymph nodes are swollen at this
moment
""
so you have an active infection going on right now
""
okay uh take another deep breath please  speaker a takes a deep
breath 
""
okay that 's good
""
now you 're  you have uh equal and symmetrical expansion of
your chest  and you don't have any retractions in your  inter-coastal
 spaces
""
uh apparently i hear some fine rals in the base in your lung bases
""
uhm this could be  this could be the reason for your production
of phlegm
""
okay i 'll just listen to your heart
""
""
uh uhm 
""
""
well the it 's normal  rate regular rhythm
""
you don't seem to have any murmurs
""
""
uh uhm
""
""
okay uhm  let me just palpate your stomach for a while
 listen to it 
""
okay as i 've observed that your abdomen is flat it 's firm
""
you don't have any organo-  word 
""
i don't see any organo-  word 
""
i don't feel any organo-  word  no masses and
apparently it 's not tender
""
""
organo-  what
""
""
well it just means that you don't have any enlarged uh organs
abnormally enlarged organs
""
ah your pulses are full and equal and you don't have any edema
""
okay that 's good  well with uh based on my history and
physical examination mr gonzales uh i would say you  have an upper
respiratory tract infection prior to which you had an acute tonsil or
pharyngitis
""
uh i 'd advise you to definitely stop smoking and uh kind of
abstain from the alcohol uhm and i 'll just have to prescribe you some
antibiotics  some anti-pyretics for this and uh  i 'll just have to ask
you to follow up in a week
""
okay sir
""
""
yeah sure doctor     if you say so
""
""
 okay  
""
it 's just an upper respiratory tract infection
""
but uh make sure you don't take it for granted you might have uh
pneumonia later on
""
""
oh
""
""
okay
""
""
okay  thank you very much doctor
""
""
good day sir
""
""
yeah have a nice day too 
""
""
""
could you explain to me the use of this f r solution for uh
canal filling
""
""
uh yes i think i have uh tried it to my patient already and
uh it seems that the uh the prognosis was very good and uh i would like to
orient you with this also
""
you see when we use uh antiphormine instead of oxidol we
neutralize it with oxidol because uh it might cause degeneration of f r
""
and secondly we have to take note that uh f r calcium hardens more
quickly when the temperature and humidity is high in the operatory
""
uh that is also the reason why uh  why f r solution are kept in
uh in uh dark bottles
""
because of the alcohol content of this uh f r solution there is a
possibility that it will then evaporate quickly
""
so we have to be sure that uh uh when we use it be sure that uh
when you cover it again the cap should be tightly closed
""
and the uh because of air or moisture which causes degeneration of
f r powder you should see to it also that uh the cap of the powder is uh
thoroughly closed
""
""
does this harden the f r with the powder if you if you mix
the f r with powder and liquid does it harden how many minutes or seconds
""
""
well it would take around uh five minutes inside the uh the
uh pulp canal   before it hardens 
""
""
 uhm   uh uhm and uh
""
""
and anyway it does not harden really that hard but uh you can
uh uhm if you want to clean again the canal   you can  easily
scrape it out
""
""
 uh uhm  
""
uh you can remove it
""
""
yeah using the uhm what do you call this the uh  ribber
""
""
""
how do you how do you mix this
""
do you use metal or uh
""
""
well in my case i just use uhm
""
""
metal and glass slab
""
""
yeah metal and uh metal spatula
""
""
uhm metal
""
""
then mix the powder in the liquid in the glass slab
""
""
uh uhm how long will it take  for the for mixing
""
""
maybe uh three seconds
""
""
uhm
""
""
it is very easy to mix such a solution 
""
do you know already the the direction uh for use
""
""
how 's the ratio  uh-huh  the ratio for using the
powder and liquid
""
""
one is to one
""
""
uhm
""
""
then you mix it uniformly either in the mixing  pan 
or in the glass slab
""
but in my case i use i use the glass slab for mixing
""
""
how do you apply it to the canal you
""
""
you make use of the uh  word  and then uh
fill the canal and uh tightly  and be sure that the canal is uh well
filled up
""
 word  is uh what i am using
""
i don't know in your case
""
you can uh use the the instrument of your choice
""
""
uhm either  liqui   ei  either metal or uh what 's
this
""
""
plastic
""
""
plastic uh uhm
""
""
we usually use  word  which is made of
metal
""
""
metal uh uhm
""
""
spring type metal
""
""
like a carrier
""
""
uh uhm yeah like that 
""
and by the way you 'd be you don't have any problem regarding the
overflowing of the uh acetyl solution or of the of the said mixture in the
apical foramen
""
""
uhm
""
""
because it will uh just uh serve as  2 words
""
""
""
uh just like the vitatex
""
""
yeah like vitatex
""
""
uhm
""
""
the only difference of that is vitatex is   more on
 uh it is premixed already
""
""
 in the mixing  
""
uh uhm
""
""
and it has what we call an antibiotic property
""
""
how about this f uh f r no antibiotics
""
""
it 's more of a bactericidal and the essence of this the the
essence itself of the solution is enough to to clean the gangrenous canal
""
""
uhm how about in cases where uh there is a severe pain can we
use this uh liquid f r for uh treatment
""
""
i don't think so because it does not have any analgesic
effect
""
""
uhm
""
""
so i did not try using it to my patient
""
""
uhm this is only totally for
""
""
root canal
""
""
root canal treatment 
""
""
we use it mostly we also use it both for vital and non-vital
pulp
""
""
how about in gangrenous pulp
""
""
yeah
""
""
same
""
""
it is uh effective in in  gang  both gangrenous and
non-gangrenous pulp
""
in the case of  gang  of uh vital uh pulp you uh sterilize
the canal first
""
""
uhm
""
""
then you let it dry like what you are using the same
procedure when you uhm use the other medicines of your choice  'no
""
""
""
uh uhm
""
""
but since you are asking me regarding f r maybe it i might as
well tell you also the the uhm procedure
""
""
okay uhm
""
""
then after sterilizing you make use of the  word
 again and then half fill the the uh rim portion of the canal
""
cover it with the solution of uh f r
""
then after that you seal it with the cement
""
""
uh can you seal it immediately after putting the f r or after
a few days
""
""
after you have maybe after uhm a   few days 
""
""
 twenty-four hours  
""
""
first you let the cement dry
""
""
to settle   first 
""
""
  oo   
""
and then put the permanent filling
""
""
yes
""
any permanent filling can be used
""
""
as long as you have the   uh 
""
""
  word   
""
""
yeah as long as you have the uhm base  you put base
""
""
uh i think the uh after the f r if it dries you can put the
permanent filling
""
""
uh uh uh uhm
""
""
uh uh  ei   ei  either there is no base
""
""
uh no no no you have to put first the the
""
""
base
""
""
the base before you make use of your   uh permanent
filling 
""
""
 composite or   amalgam
""
""
maybe with with amalgam 
""
uh no no no both composite and amalgam there is a need for a base
  just to  be sure
""
""
 uhm  
""
like  bicarb 
""
""
that is if we are referring to a vital  porchotomy 
""
""
 oo 
""
""
but for for non-vital it 's okay you can use it  
directly 
""
""
 directly    uh uhm
""
""
what else  uh  i also have a case here
""
uh i would like also to ask your opinion  about my uh uhm case
wherein there is what we call uh an impacted uh tooth  'no 
""
""
was that upper lower molar
""
""
upper  and then uh
""
""
wisdom
""
""
it is uh yeah it is bothering now my patient
""
since you are more uh uhm well-versed in surgery i would like to
ask your opinion also regarding this
""
and in fact this is the x-ray
""
""
uhm
""
""
so maybe can you orient me with the treatment 
""
uh that is the x-ray
""
""
uh this is  is this upper
""
""
yeah upper  upper first molar
""
""
  upper 
""
""
 uh no   upper third molar   impacted 
""
""
 upper third molar  
""
""
but you see there is  eh  second uh molar
overlapping the the the uh  what you call this the    wis 
 yeah the wisdom tooth
""
""
 wisdom  
""
""
so how are you going to manage it
