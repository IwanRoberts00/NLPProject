good afternoon to each one of you i 'm so pleased for this occasion that i would be able to share with you some significant findings which i gathered from my visits to different libraries and also from my study that i personally conducted regarding uh a topic which became my interest when i enrolled in neuropsychology under the p h d counseling uhm program of d l s u now this interest in brain research stayed with me until now so much so that i try to devour all those different sources of information that i can take hold of because we know that the brain is the most important perhaps you would say the heart but the most important organ in a person as some doctors and different instruments will be able to sustain life if our heart stops to beat or if our lungs stop to function but let the brain stop for a moment and we will be pronounced clinically dead now teachers have been for several years looking for ways of improving instruction to accelerate learning to make unders to make understanding among the students be as simple as what they want it to be so much so that many researchers have focused on different correlates of academic achievement to mention a few school-related student-related family-related what have you 's only to find out that still our state of education is at a deplorable state in his own words secretary former secretary onofre said there is a seemingly deteriorating quality of education and no amount of changes in the curriculum seem to be able to help improve this deplorable situation and so uh this triggered my curiosity suppose we try to study something that is really directly related to learning and that is the brain that 's the background of the study now brain research actually started one hundred or more years ago however it is a relatively new phenomenon in the philippines so much so that in nineteen ninety carvajal a local educator said brain dominance technology is new in the philippines but nonetheless teachers must be familiar with the research findings regarding the brain because the learning styles of students are dependent to some extent on the kind of processing that their brain does okay however the cost of inviting lecturers who would shed findings and programs anchored on brain research is very prohibitive groups would give as much as okay they will give lectures but it would cost as much as twenty-five thousand for a group of twenty-five people to uh a staggering amount of two thousand pesos per participant as a result only very few schools only the affluent ones are able to go through this training program actually in the philippines the first school in southeast asia is one of the high schools in quezon city exclusive school for boys they had this training on integrative learning which is anchored on brain research and they found out that students are able to learn much more easily than before however i have not known yet any other school that has gone through the same training program okay so with this backdrop let me present my research  uhm perhaps a presentation of the structure of the brain at this point may appear off tangent but it is necessary for me to do so in order to situate my presentation okay now the brain actually is a grayish pink uh object somewhat having the consistency of a porridge hmm and crumpled like a big walnut it weighs not more than thirty pounds but it has a great capacity because that is what it is designed for however a little used brain just like little used muscles will deteriorate so in spite of the size of the brain it has tremendous powers and it has it has to be tapped okay now the most important part regarding the brain insofar as education is concerned will be the different functions that have something to do with learning  and so may i present to you two views of the brain one view is called the triune brain and the other view views it from the viewpoint of a bicameral brain so let 's start with the triune brain  this is called the triune brain because it consists anatomically of three parts  we have the neo-mammalian the neo-mammalian or the new brain or the cortex then we have the paleo-mammalian the one at the middle or the mid-brain  and the reptilian brain or the old brain okay of these three brains the most interesting perhaps to educators will be the neo-mammalian or the cortex because it is the seat of all learning in fact it is the only part of the brain in human beings which differentiate man from animals even the largest of primates the chimpanzees and the gorillas only have as much as less than one third of the neo-cortex that man has now actually the paleo-mammalian is the brain that sends messages to the neo-cortex it serves like a secretary so that it processes first what should be acted upon by neo-cortex and prioritize all incoming sensory stimuli the reptilian brain is the old brain and this is the seat of all uh the basic drives of men hunger okay strong emotions so that when it is electrically charged a person would scratch and bite like an animal that is why perhaps it is not surprising why biting and scratching are common among the young children in the nursery school because perhaps the reptilian brain is still strong in them because of the lack of socialization that is needed to be able to tame these animalistic drives now what is important with the triune brain is that the neo-cortex if stimulated with new stimuli functions more effectively than not now the bicameral view of the brain presents it in terms of consisting of two halves  viewed from the top it is divided into the left hemisphere and the right hemisphere actually this is part of the new brain or the cortex even though they look symmetrically the same as if one is the exact image of the other they perform differently so their functions are asymmetrical however there is communication ongoing between the two halves of the brain so that one knows what is taking place in the other brain and this is made possible by means of a nerve tissue a big bundle of nerve tissues here consisting of more than two hundred million nerve cells that makes communication between the two brains possible now perhaps we would ask why is it that the two brains function differently and how come these differential functioning of the hemispheres of the brain are known so may i trace very briefly the history of how brain dominance as it is called now or brain laterality 'no has been discovered  okay the first insight into the possibility that the brain consists of two different hemispheres each functioning differently uh was done by broca paul broca a french scientist and surgeon who had a patient who lost his ability to talk or to speak because of an injury to the left brain okay when that patient died his brain was operated on and it was observed that there is a defect there has been the injury in one part of the left brain so that made broca think perhaps the left brain is the seat of language and another patient with the same problem died and they also found the same injury in the left brain however this cannot be verified by operating on live people although the brain is not sensitive to pain it is the only organ perhaps aside from the nails and the hair that do not suffer does not suffer pain okay however uh in uhm in one university uh spencer together with his associates tried to perform surgical severing of the brains the two hemispheres of the cortex among cats and then followed by monkeys and they found out through their experiments that the two hemispheres of the brain really function differently now in nineteen cen sixty-one okay uh spencer was able really to perform this kind of operation on a human being the purpose is not actually for the pure sake of experimentation but because the patient is suffering from epilepsy and it was thought that to separate the left hemisphere from the right hemisphere through surgery will prevent the spread of epileptic seizures from one hemisphere to the other okay and there were others other patients with the same condition their brains have to be severed in terms of that hemispheric laterality in order that they could be saved or they could be cured with regard to their illness now these patients now are literally called split-brained patients and the experiments that were done regarding these split-brained patients really confirmed what broca had found earlier or had by in by intuition discovered earlier that the two hemispheres function differently now what were the tasks that were done along this line  one technique that uh was done by sperry and his associates made use of special instrument called tachistoscope in this procedure with the use of the instrument for a brief second of time a visual stimulus is presented to the patient to the split brain patient okay the time has to be that controlled otherwise the left and the right eye will help each other understand what the object is the study is such that the object is presented first to the right or perhaps to the left but it has to be presented only to one visual field of the patient now the anatomy of the person is such that the left brain controls the other side of the body so the left brain controls the right hand the right eye the right the right uh foot and so on and vice versa so that whatever object is flashed to the right visual field of the patient will be projected to the left hemisphere and whatever is projected to the right visual field will be absorbed by the by the left hemisphere now they found out that the visual stimulus that is presented to the right visual field which is projected to the left hemisphere could be named readily by the person the person can tell the name of the object but if that object is presented to the right visual field which is projected to the i mean to the left visual field which is projected to the right hemisphere the person cannot give the name of the object and this is true also for the other patients so they say then the language center must be in the left brain okay however if the object is given to the patient okay without looking at it together with other objects by feeling it with the left hand the person is able to say to uh to select what he sees in the picture from the objects given to him or to her so that means that the left hand which is controlled by the right brain is able to understand visual uh relationships spatial relationships and so they say perhaps the center for visual analysis of relationships reside in the right brain  now that kind of study can only be done for split-brained patients it cannot be done for normal people because normal people still have the corpus callosum that connects the two brains and so they have to verify this among normal populations just to confirm the localization of functions of the brain for this purpose they use what we call the e e g pattern analysis okay or the electro encephalogram pattern analysis by which uh certain mechanisms are attached into the scalp of the person this is registered in the galvanometer pen and then it is printed in a piece of paper in the form of waves okay and revenson identified four different kinds of waves that could be picked up from the electric activity of the brain  these are called the alpha wave the beta the gamma the delta and the theta  this will be of particular interest to educators because one of these waves if developed among the pupils will develop their ability to be creative and intuitive
