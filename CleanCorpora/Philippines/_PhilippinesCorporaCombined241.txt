uhm with the permission of the chief justice distinguished senators we filed our opposition only at about one thirty this afternoon because truth to tell we could not make out what the president 's counsel meant when they filed the motion to quash we felt that they were trying to convert the proceedings into a criminal proceeding by giving it the title of a motion to quash which is  in a criminal proceeding and the senate rules does not have any provision on a motion to dismiss or to quash in for interlocutory motions then there 's rules of court are  suppletory  so i made a telephone inquiry to the president of the senate to ask him what would happen this afternoon and he said you argue the prosecution ar i mean the prosecution will argue the defense will argue so we took it to to mean that there would be a hearing on this motion so we prepared and finalized our motio our opposition mr chief justice our law professors have told us over and over again that the constitution speaks of separation of powers checks and balances and coequality that has been instilled in us the president would want us to destroy that delicate balance in filing this motion to dismiss what is an impeachment process we agree that the house has the exclusive power to initiate impeachment and the senate has the sole power to try and decide impeachment cases so you see immediately the distinction we in the house initiate the senate decides so have we initiated yes and if you look closely at the process there 's the magic number of one-third in both the senate and in the house if we get one-third of the members of the house then that one-third prevails over the other two-thirds that is the beauty of this one-third so let me repeat mr chief justice distinguished members of the senate this is an instance where the one-third prevails over the two-thirds and this is what happened and in the case of the senate one-third plus one can block an impeachment so here 's the magic number of one-third one-third to initiate one-third plus one for the senate to block the impeachment this was placed there for good reason now what happened the fact of the matter is that when this started this was started by forty-one members of the house short of the seventy-three i myself was not a signatory to the original uhm impeachment complaint in my case i wanted steeped in the principle of due process i wanted to know whether there was really grounds to impeach the president in fact if you look at the eleven-member panel here i think half of them were not original signatories along the way this was referred to the committee on justice but before the committee on justice could hear it seventy-seven had signed we reached the magic number of seventy-three and under the constitution once you have seventy-three that impeachment complaint is transmitted to the senate and trial shall start forthwith no ifs no buts when one-third of the membership of the house says we want to impeach the president no one but no one can stop the house the one-third speaks for the house and that is exactly what happened but did we follow the rules yes there was a committee hearing and in that committee hearing  talks to other members of panel alright and in that committee hearing everybody was heard those against impeachment and those pro but faced with seventy-seven signatures the opposition collapsed hmh talks to other members of panel  just can i have just a little moment what 's the pleasure of uh atty arroyo i just want to read here the journal because the president 's counsel have used this as reason the journal of journal of the house of uh november thirteen where it reproduces the action taken by the committee it reads likewise upon motion which was unanimously approved unanimous the body resolved to refer to the plenary for further appropriate action the verified complaint and the verified resolutions of endorsement of seventy-seven members of the house filed by them apparently in line with the essence and spirit of section three subparagraph four of article eleven of the constitution of the philippines and section thirteen of the rules of procedure on impeachment proceedings seventy-seven the committee had no choice the committee by unanimous vote even against those who were against impeachment said refer this to plenary  now what happened mr chief justice on november thirteen the speaker having had the report of the committee incidentally mr chief justice and distinguished members of the senate this was not a committee report mind you this is a report as we understand it in legislation in legislation we submit a committee report but in impeachment it is a mere report we are not guided by the rules on legislation we were guided by the rules on impeachment the house had rules of impeachment in the eighth the ninth the tenth and the present eleventh congress and the reason for that is that impeachment complaints were filed with the house the senate had no impeachment rules for the simple reason that nothing ever reached the senate except this one now just to give our colleagues in the senate an idea about what transpired in the house  when the speaker said that he is transmitting the impeachment complaint endorsed by seventy-seven members to the senate he did so as he puts it his job was ministerial and peremptory and that he transmitted it in line with our own provisions which reads talks to other members of panel our own rules our own rules says our own rule says mr chief justice that a verified complaint-resolution of impeachment filed by at least one-third of all the members of the house shall constitute the articles of impeachment and in this case the verified complaint-resolution shall be endorsed to the senate in the same manner as an approved bill of the house an approved bill of the senate or of the house means that there 's no further thing further action to do and what is an approved bill under the rules of the house here is what is an approved bill section eighty-six the secretary-general without need of an express order shall transmit to the senate for its concurrence all bills and joint or concurrent resolutions approved by the house or the amendments of the house to bills or resolutions of the senate as the case may be  the treatment of an impeachment complaint which has been converted into an articles of eh eh impeachment is treated as an approved bill and being an approved bill no further ceremony is necessary it is administrative in nature and that is exactly what the senate did no uh what the house did now mr chief justice perhaps the question would be would uh is asked did we verify this yes did seventy-seven verify this yes the president 's counsel keeps on repeating and repeating and repeating a verification under the rules of court as understood by the supreme court sir we are not bound by the rules of court the house has its own rules we only listen and obey our own rules and our own rules has its own verification and i will read it it says section thirteen of the rules of impeachment the contents of the verification shall be shall be as follows i quote  we after being sworn in accordance with law depose and state that we are the complainants in the above-entitled complaint-resolution of impeachment that we have caused the said complaint-resolution to be prepared and have read the contents thereof and that the allegations therein are true of our own knowledge and belief on the basis of our reading and appreciation of documents and other recor records pertinent thereto  mr chief justice distinguished senators this is what we did that is the verification and that is in accordance with our own rules and nobody can challenge our own rules not the senate not the supreme court not anyone now what are these rules these rules we have our rules pursuant to the constitution because the constitution says section three subsection eight on impeachment the congress shall promulgate its own rules on impeachment to effectively carry out the purpose of this section  we did just that we have our own rules and our own rules say what i have read and that we followed but the president 's counsel tells us we should follow the rules of court no sir we don't we cannot be bound because insofar as the house is concerned we are supreme within our own sphere so what is the next question on the question of verification and could there be irregularities mr chief justice distinguished senators on the day november thirteen you had your reorganization we had our reorganization right after the articles of impeachment were transmitted to the senate we elected the eleven members of the prosecution team and it 's in the journal the journal that president 's counsel have been reading we used it we will use the same text page four of the journal of november thirteen two thousand  election of house prosecutors on motion of rep apostol there being no objection there being no objection the following members were elected as house prosecutors representatives feliciano belmonte jr sergio a f apostol joker p arroyo raul m gonzales wigberto e ta&ntilde;edo ta&ntilde;ada oscar s moreno oscar s rodriguez salacmid f baterina roan i libarios antonio eduardo b nachura and clavel a martinez  they 're all here no one objected to our election electing the prosecutors is part of the constitutional process of impeachment and that was done no one and not only that the same journal relied upon by the president 's counsel on page five says remarks of rep teodoro at this point rep gilbert c teodoro jr hoped that he had the unanimous concurrence of the members of the majority on the election of eleven members of the house as prosecutors at impeachment trial in the senate subsequently he stated the majority coalition has no objection thereto the the chair noted the same  eleven members were elected as part of the continuation of the impeachment initiation of the impeachment because under the constitution the house prosecutes and we have done it now mr chief justice clears throat we have demonstrated at least that every phase have do we have done it the house has done with meticulous adherence to the constitution and the rules but after the election of the eleven prosecutors what happened there was a reorganization what with the reorganization a new a new speaker and a new majority was formed we asked the question mr speaker and for our colleagues in the senate who are familiar with this the new majority could have questioned the proceedings they did not as a matter of fact they sought they agreed they validated everything made number one they ge gave us an appropriations second the speaker newly-elected speaker swore us in what more does the president 's counsel want every action was ratified by the new majority imagine swearing us in in plenary in the presence of the entire house in fact the pr all the objections of the president must be addressed to the house any remedy in any defect in the proceedings cannot be cured not in the senate not in the supreme court it has to be in the house because we are supreme in our own uh in our own place but what does the president 's counsel want like little babies they want to ask the supreme court the senate to nullify what the house did no sir mr chief justice we have tried to show that there is really nothing wrong with what we did and we in the house are jealous of this out of the seventy-seven has anyone withdrawn his signature no in fact we have one hundred and five we have one hundred and five can we say now that the senate can tell us as the president 's counsel is tr would would like the senate to do no we will tell you what to do you nullify the remedy is in the house if they want to but they cannot in fact they 're now the majority 's now in estoppel they cannot after swearing us in after giving us five million to fund us there 's nothing more that they can do
