with the permission of uh the president i would like to uh explain my vote  mr president last monday i delivered the invocation on behalf of the senate and in that i asked the good lord through his son jesus christ to provide us the way mga daan at paraan para tayo ay makapaghusga ng v f a sa tama at sa ikaliligaya ng ating bayang pilipinas  mr president i begin by asking why not today the senate of the eleventh congress is being called upon to concur or not to concur in the ratification of the visiting forces agreement v f a between the united states and the republic of the philippines to be sure friends and foes of the v f a from the clergy to the ordinary citizen have given me counsel and advice i received letters telegrams and telephone calls from so many i wish to place on record mr president that i appreciate all these advice and views solicited and otherwise given as they were to assist me in evaluating the pros and cons of the v f a i cannot thank them enough for their concern but at the end of the day mr president the ball remains with me so to speak because the occasion calls for each of the senator to make a personal judgment consequently for those whose views and opinions i cannot accommodate for the reasons i would later on explain i wish to thank them again for enriching my perspectives i only hope that they will treat this matter as a case of clashing opposing opinions and not a repudiation of their position  walang personalan trabaho po lang ito  mr president the solemn occasion today is not only to decide the fate of the v f a but to do honor to the filipino people who put me here let me assure therefore one and all that my decision is based on what i personally believe in and what is best for the country and the filipinos the sponsors of the v f a have valiantly defended the provisions of the v f a against the legal political and moral assaults by those who in good faith oppose and or express reservation to the v f a they have replied with utmost sincerity and forthrightness to the many questions that have been raised they have rebutted with logic sometimes evasive and convoluted but most of the time rational and candid every argument raised against the v f a for sure there are various important concerns which my colleagues have articulated and raised sometimes with utmost passion and with great personal convictions concerns such as whether the v f a is a treaty or an international agreement or a mere executive agreement whether the applicable constitutional provision is section twenty-five article eighteen or section twenty-one article seven whether the v f a would violate the nuclear-free provision of section eight article two of the constitution whether americans will automatically come to the aid of the philippines if any of our claimed territory is subjected to armed attack by foreign forces whether more security and military assistance would be forthcoming whether more economic support and more u s investment would come to the philippines and finally whether the philippines has surrendered once again its criminal jurisdiction over offenses committed in the philippines by u s military personnels mr president i share all these concerns but some of these concerns cannot be resolved in this chamber with finality as they involve legal and constitutional issues in due time i 'm sure mr president the supreme court will be called upon to rule on the validity of these legal propositions after all as u s chief justice charles evans hughes observed and i quote we are under a constitution but the constitution is what the judges say it is unquote until the supreme court shall have ruled otherwise mr president i subscribe to the legal proposition that the v f a is an international agreement and that the applicable provision of the constitution is section twenty-one article eight article seven this view is not without legal basis since the other uh provision section twenty-five article eighteen obviously referred to the then-existing nineteen forty-seven military bases agreement between the united states and the philippines a state of fact that was not lost in the minds of the commissioners that drafted the nineteen eighty-seven constitution thus i read section twenty-five article eighteen as providing a constitutional guideline on the process of how the nineteen forty-seven military bases agreement were to be renewed as it turned out mr president this chamber terminated the m b a and correctly so if i may add see debates record of the constitutional commission page six hundred sixty-three i also believe that the v f a does not authorize any u s bases facility or troops to be permanently maintained in the philippines no legal gobbledygook or language engineering would justify such an interpretation of the provisions of the v f a i further believe mr president that the one-year deadline to terminate judicial proceedings against american personnel is more a challenge to improve our delivery of justice system in this country than a legal burden imposed by the v f a with respect to other concerns which are basically political social and economic in character whether for instance america will provide more military assistance whether more economic support and investment would come from america etcetera i firmly believe that this is a question of faith and trust faith that america will indeed deliver what it promises and trust that our national leaders will see to it that these promises are fulfilled mr president for me the most important aspect of the v f a is the question on jurisdiction over offenses committed by u s personnel against filipinos in our land the question has both legal and moral dimensions given our past experience when the military bases agreement was still extant it is on this issue that my position has been focused and which would determine my vote the v f a for sure contains both exclusive and concurrent jurisdiction over offenses committed by u s military personnel in the philippines with respect to exclusive jurisdiction the language is too clear and categorical to merit further comments suffice it to say mr president that exclusive jurisdiction over certain crimes committed by u s personnel goes in a way in favor of the philippines in certain cases and in favor of the u s in others here mr president the scale of justice to my view is evenly balanced additionally off-duty offenses regardless of the gravity that are committed by u s military personnel on liberty or on pass are without any doubt exclusively belong to philippine jurisdiction here happily both the u s and the philippines agree paragraph three subparagraph one point two joint report number forty-three of the committee on foreign relations and committee on national defense and security page nine it is however in the category of concurrent and primary jurisdiction that i have great reservations mr president there are two vital points that concerns me first is the exception to the primary jurisdiction of the philippines under three b two even though the philippines has primary jurisdiction the same may be lost if the offenses arise out of any act or omission done in the performance of official duty  once the military commander issue a duty certificate the same has the effect of automatically divesting philippine jurisdiction over the offenses committed by u s personnel in violation of philippine laws this obnoxious provision is found in the defunct military bases agreement and was the source of intense irritants between the philippines and the u s governments i hope to god that the philippine government has learned from the past and would now see to it that this provision is not abused by the u s military commanders one way mr president of preventing such abuse is to define the meaning of official duty which incidentally is not defined in the v f a this representation mr president will recall offered and the sponsors accepted the following definition of official duty  and i quote the term official duty is understood to be any duty or service required or authorized to be done by statute regulation the order of a superior or military usage  official duty is not meant and i would like to emphasize is not meant to include all acts by an individual during the period during which he is on duty but is meant to apply only to acts which are required or authorized to be done as a function of that duty which the individual is performing  thus in the joint report happily the sponsor correctly stated that crimes such as rape murder and similar heinous crimes cannot and should not be included as having been performed in official duty this definition was formally accepted as an amendment to resolution four four three to wit whereas in order to ensure that not all offenses by u s personnel arising out of any act or omission done in the performance of official duty will not automatically be covered by a duty certificate to be issued by the u s military commanders under paragraph e article five the term official duty as used in this paragraph is hereby defined as follows again the definition  the term official duty is understood to be any duty or service required or authorized to be done by statute regulation the order of a superior or military usage  official duty is not meant to include all acts by an individual during the period while he is on duty but is meant to apply only to acts which are required or authorized to be done as a function of that duty which the individual is performing unquote from this definition mr president which as embodied in resolution four four three the validity or efficacy of the duty certificate to be issued by the u s military commanders will be measured and if found wanting by the philippine authorities should be rejected without hesitation and equivocation given the dark history of the duty certificate like the hated  cedula under spain the new circumstances upon which the v f a will be operable that is absence of permanent u s military bases facilities and troops in the philippines the new breed of national regional and local 1 word leaders and finally the assertiveness and vigilance of the n g os and the students and the other sectors i have no doubt that the past would never be resurrected nor replicated in the use of duty certificate by u s military commanders i certainly would not allow it mr president it behooves therefore the concerned philippine authorities not to take the words of the u s military commanders at face value they should be vigilant and strict to the point of being  makulit = be naggers and matigas = being forceful or firm in asserting resolution four four three as well as the definition of official duty and evaluating the circumstances and facts that have given rise to the issuance of the duty certificate in case of doubt mr president the duty certificate once issued should be reviewed and if found against the definition of official duty should be rejected happily the sponsors agreed to this approach second is the language used why is the v f a couched in a language distinctly different from other similar instruments with respect to concurrent and primary jurisdiction more specifically i refer to the question of what appears to be an automatic waiver of philippine jurisdiction pursuant to paragraph three d article five which states and i quote recognizing the responsibility of the united states military authorities to maintain good order and discipline among their forces philippine authorities will upon request by the united states waive their primary right to exercise jurisdiction except in cases of particular importance to the philippines  if the government of the philippines determines that the case is of particular importance it shall communicate such determination to the united states authorities within twenty days after the philippine authorities received the united request  yet on identical situation mr president america agreed to a much different nay apparently more liberal language with respect to her agreements with other countries for instance the agreement with japan on the same situation states and i quote if the state having the primary right decides not to exercise jurisdiction it shall notify the authorities of the other state as soon as practicable  the authorities of the state having the primary right shall give sympathetic consideration to a request from the authorities of the other state for a waiver of its right in cases where that order other state considers such a waiver to be of particular importance article seventeen paragraph thirty-six of the agreement between japan and the united states similarly mr president the agreement with south ame south korea australia and the nato countries to mention just a few contain the same language as japan instead of automatic waiver the  sympathetic consideration are the passwords in these countries with respect to waiver of primary jurisdiction mr president the phrase sympathetic consideration  does not convey to me as the same as automatic waiver  found in the v f a yet during the several public hearings we were told that the particular v f a language is no different in import than those found in agreements with japan south korea australia and the nato countries because the v f a provides an escape clause for the philippines where it can always deny the request of waiver of jurisdiction over cases which are of particular importance to the philippines if indeed the import of the language quote sympathetic consideration unquote is similar to quote automatic waiver unquote why did our negotiator not insist on the former in fact in the defunct military bases agreement  sympathetic consideration was the language used in the agreement paragraph three c article thirteen are our negotiator less tenacious than their counterpart from the other countries or do they really believe that despite the difference in the nomenclature the meaning is the same if the language in section three d mr president is left by itself without any amendment of the v f a or subsequent clarificatory and binding undertaken undertaking from the concerned philippine authorities from the executive department then it is obvious that there is indeed a difference and that such difference places the philippines in unequal footing with america that situation is nakakahiya = shameful  and definitely unacceptable to me mr president i cannot overemphasize my personal concern on the subject of fair and equal administration of justice because i see a great number of filipinos being deprived of elementary due process and justice it is bad enough mr president that at the hands of a fellow  pinoy another pinoy becomes a victim of injustice it is worst and unforgivable if a pinoy will suffer injustice at the hands of a foreigner in cases involving crimes committed in the philippines
