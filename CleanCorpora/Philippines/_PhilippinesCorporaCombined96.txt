's your personal married life na nawala that that uh uh can we not talk about that laughter  are you still married  ha  are you still married yes i still am are you still with the guy no what guy i dont know chuckle  who 's the guy your your your your husband no i 'm not with him anymore i i told you that already yeah i know i know oh anyway have you been talking to james  no i have not why what 's new you know what there 's this common friend kasi of me and  bianca okay   okay  we have a common friend do you know sam i think i introduced you to him a long time ago when we were still in college e  what 's his name sam sam okay you told me pa nga that he looks so chinese  e  okay that he 's so chinese ganyan  uh-hmmmh okay so anyway i have met sam like uh two months ago we had coffee in uh in robinson 's okay and then ever since he 's been texting me you know asking me to meet up and then he 's been telling me a lot of things about james  a lot of bad things about james   uh-hmmmh  like what bad things well you know like uhm you know before kasi  it was him and bianca e  yeah okay they were an item and then suddenly james came into the picture and started telling bad things about sam about sam to the people in bianca 's dormitory oh really yeah okay so yun that is basically what we 've been talking about and it 's not as if i dont have any uhm uh you know it it 's not really hard to believe because i 've never seen james sober  e you get me sober hey what do you mean it 's it 's like he 's always mad he 's always angry he 's always he 's temperamental you know so it 's not very hard to believe things that sam told me about  james   uh-huh  okay and by the way yes this is what he claimed ha  yes he has been seeing james around every time in social gatherings so i was just wondering if you have been talking with james i havent talked to james for a long time as in this i thought you 're best of friends we are but you know when you 're you 're in you 're working you 're in business you tend to drift away because busy with the business i dont really meet up with a lot of friends anymore  james for two thousand and four i think i met up with him once or twice lang  and then what did you talk about  wala lang parang sandali lang i mean we maybe we just buy d v ds i tell him to buy d v d for me and then he brings it to my office or brings it to my home and that 's it we dont even get to meet you know you didnt talk about bianca  no the only thing i know is that bianca is in china  and   i was the one who told you that no yeah he told me that

house  ah ganun  she came to my office uh she went to your room daw e  office yun  uh that 's an office uh office yun yeah okay i think it was the office not house  e i was thinking why do you always have to meet up with them if they already know your company and they 've been ordering from your company ever since why do you always have to you know talk with them no it 's not always meet up e  it 's maintaining it 's maintaining maintenance and then you just meet up to have lunch ganun  and then you pay for everything yeah well that 's part of business and then they really order yeah of course every time they do that  yeah you know on a regular basis yeah uh okay so well at least you 're getting your money 's worth  pala e  hmmmh okay lang okay lang   okay lang  yeah yeah so yun   denny am i bad i dont feel happy for bianca  well i dont know i never i will never like james for her never i dont know i dont know words i dont know  palibhasa best friend mo yun  no i i dont know talaga e  i mean i really dont know oh what when is she coming back from china five months from now that 's the end of her contract  temp uh temp temporarily permanently uh well i dont know if she 's going to renew but she told me that after five months it 's the end of her contract she 'll probably be back but uh what i dont know is if she 's going to stay there and renew or she has to come back here and then go back i really i really dont know her plans right now but she 's it 's the end of her contract in five months okay and she told me she 's missing james very much so probably she 's going home okay uhm you know mushy stuff that she 's been talking about every time we email each other uh-hmmmh but she told me she 's really popular there ha uh yeah yeah that 's what she told me well bianca has uh you know has a look has has the uma thurman look ha  no i think uh i guess uh i guess ha and this is also her her guess because of the fact that she can speak english well not all chinese can do that not many chinese can do that and then she 's very young uh-hmmmh and she 's an english teacher already and uhm i think she has this uhm look that somehow pleases chinese men you know the the  bianca is pretty you know not for not for many races not for many what not for some cultures  talaga  because i have i have uh introduced bianca to some men that i 've met uh who are not either chinese or filipino and they dont find her pretty oh really yeah okay okay she 's okay i mean she 's pretty but uh there are a lot more prettier girls but she is above average pretty which is important speaker b chuckles  you just have to be above average then you know there will always be guys chasing after you hmmmh if you 're average lang uh you know you 're you 're not always in the loop but if you are above average then uhm you know every now and then you have a new guy uh courting you wanting to be your friend etcetera etcetera oh yeah okay james is just one damned lucky guy to have her well you know maybe because he 's a bad person
