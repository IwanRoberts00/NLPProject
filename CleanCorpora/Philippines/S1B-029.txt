""
""
that 's how    secure 
""
""
 well no    no you see what happened is that uhm uh when we first came back from the states you know having been there for ten years our we our initial uh our married life was there and it 's a totally different    it 's a  totally different milieu
""
""
 milieu   
""
uh uhm
""
""
you know you 're always together

we came back here and it was    culture shock 
""
""
 you 're always together    in the states

""
yes    family  you know  etcetera 
""
""
 okay   
""
""

""
""
 okay   
""
 pinoy  here
""
""
that 's very  pinoy 
""
""
okay
""
""
yeah and i was very unhappy with it and so uh  w  i think we were celebrating our seventeenth or eighteenth anniversary
""
anyway kinda long right
""
""
   uh-huh 
""
""
 and i    said hey christian we gotta do something
""
not  naman  seventeen but but but  kuwan na rin 
""
and i said christian we gotta talk about this we 'll have to talk about this because i 've seen so many couples    that have  just sort of drift apart  so  sort of thing and the you know the husband fools around
""
""
 marriages   
""
""
that 's what it is
""
mostly most most of the time it 's the husband fooling around
""
and i said christian we have been friends so long
""
""
uh uhm
""
""
can we just
""
just just get this and i said  until i 'm forty  you have  every opportunity
""
i give you the permission to to fool around because until i 'm forty
""
and he says why is that
""
and i said it 's because until i 'm forty i have options  speaker a laughs 
""
i mean you know
""
""
i was wondering
""
""
 'no 
""
""
okay fine
""
""
i i i i want i i i have options
""
""
you really did say that
""
""
of course
""
i    mean 
""
""
 really   
""
""
we are very we we were friends before we were lovers
""
""
i i know that
""
""
and uh you know i i wanted i i wanted to put it to him as like a friend you know don't betray me
""
""
because i have options
""
""
yeah yeah until i 'm forty i think i have options after i 'm forty i have no options so you can fool around until i 'm forty  speaker a laughs 
""
after i 'm forty you have no right to fool around because i have no more options
""
""
or else
""
""
deal  'no  deal
""
""
okay
""
uh liway
""
""
well in my case i never gave him any option  laughter 
""
""
from the very beginning
""
""
yes
""
""
 talaga 
""
""
he should know
""
anyway
""
""
yes
""
""
just kidding aside well i thank god that in my case really uhm it was uh  not so much love at first sight but he 's really my first boyfriend    and  no one else
""
""
 talaga   
""
but liway what if one day you find out that he has a mistress
""
what would you do
""
""
well i don't know
""
i 'll kill the mistress probably  speaker a laughs 
""
retain him  chuckle  no no
""
""
no no what what if you find out    that  christian is seeing someone
""
""
 uh   
""
""
well i  ha  i have a different perspective
""
""
what is that perspective
""
""
uh i 'd blame my husband
""
the mistress is totally irrelevant to me
""
it 's because it 's our relationship that that is at stake
""
""
whose failure is that most of the time
""
you mentioned earlier husband fooling around
""
""
 eh wala na nga siyang  option because i 'm past forty  e    speaker a laughs 
""
""
 pero 
""
""
okay liway
""
""
 kami naman boy ako naman  i 'm so secure
""
uh let 's just say that i have uh really felt so good when we joined  couples for christ 
""
uh
""
""
that helped a lot
""
""
eleven years ago yes uh and uh that was the time when we were also brought into the marriage uh preparation uh program where we were conducting the uhm pre-cana
""
uh we we took a course on uh uhm  parang  guidance counselors  kami 
""
""
uhm
""
""
so we would give seminars in  mary the queen   preparing married couples    uh i mean uh  engaged couples to get married
""
""
   pero  liway in uh  oo     
""
in a few in a few lines liway how does  couples for christ   as an organization help uh married uh couples i mean couples
""
""
well first of all we should believe in prayer
""
we should believe that there is a god who would help couples who are uhm focused on him
""
and uh because of this if  it has an uh first of all an effect on on your relationship  speaker a coughs  i don't know what happened but we have been more open communicating with each other and uh more than being open communicating with each other it 's as if we have become uh more romantic    more 
""
""
 i will    debate that
""
that 's you
""
but what about couples who 've tried everything but things just wouldn't work out
""
""
because they are not uh surrendered to the lord
""
that 's what i would say    and because  from the very beginning they did not find the probably the love that would strengthen their relationship
""
""
 uh-huh   
""
""
they did not pray for passion  laughter 
""
""
well we talked about  laughter  husbands fooling around
""
my question is this what if somebody comes to you goes to you and says and offers a proposal proposes
""
and what if you discover one day that you have a child who is gay
""
what would you do
""
but before you talk about being gay and uh indecent proposals you are part of this private conversation we 're having with  mareng  winnie and liway chato
""
stay with us
