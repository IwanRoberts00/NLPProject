the topic that was assigned to me to reflect upon is  the christian family and the paschal mystery  wow a heavy topic and the official program of the congress adds a subtitle to the topic and i think it is equally important because it indicates how we should address the topic and the subtitle is dialogue and the spirituality of the cross  so we shall reflect on the christian family as a community formed in dialogue and how the paschal mystery is the driving spiritual force of any genuine dialogue so my reflection will consist of three parts the first part addresses the question what is the paschal mystery and what is dialogue then i move to the second part the paschal mystery as dialogue par excellence and the final portion is a reflection on the family and the spirituality of the paschal mystery so the first part what is the paschal mystery what is dialogue in the second letter of saint paul to the corinthians he says that every christian or disciple of jesus must carry in his or her body the death of jesus so that the life of jesus may also be manifested a christian therefore is one who bears in his or her person and life the mark of the paschal mystery the mark of jesus 's death and rising to new life and let us be reminded it is not a physical mark like the color of the hair or like the mole that i have here on my chin it is a spiritual mark it is a spiritual principle that defines a whole way of being human and of living in the world and if it is true that the christian lives by the power of the paschal mystery i think we can say also that it applies to every community that claims and wants to be christian including the family a christian family must live by the mark and the power of the paschal mystery of jesus but then we ask what precisely is the paschal mystery now many theologians pastors and spiritual writers through the ages have given us valuable insights into the paschal mystery but for our purposes i would like to present the paschal mystery as god 's desire coming from pure love to gift the world with fullness of life let me repeat the paschal mystery as god 's desire coming from pure love to gift the world with fullness of life and this gift of life is offered through the crucified jesus who is raised back to life life freely and lovingly given in death brings forth new and abundant life for the world i repeat life freely and lovingly given in death brings forth new and abundant life for the world and if we notice the paschal mystery described the way i just described it follows the very movement of love an offering of life so that others may have life i don't know what you think but i think this is an acceptable understanding of the paschal mystery what do you think  pwede na ba ahh pwede na audience laughs  okay so we shall use this particular though limited understanding to reflect on dialogue within the christian family so now let us inquire about dialogue now again so many philosophers psychologists and spiritual guides have explored the reality of dialogue but for this conference my working description of  dialogue is a mutuality of interiority it is an exchange of what is most intimate between two or more persons so dialogue happens when the gift of self freely shared is freely received and results in an equal gifting of self so if you notice again the movement of dialogue is the same movement of love so i will try to demonstrate now how in the paschal mystery the so-called drama of jesus 's cross and resurrection we find a supreme form of dialogue in the supreme manifestation of love i move now to my second part the paschal mystery as dialogue par excellence and here i invite everyone to meditate i will dwell on three aspects of the paschal mystery interpreted from the perspective of dialogue first of all the paschal mystery is about jesus 's eternal love towards the father a love that enables him to engage in a dialogue with the father characterized by availability a dialogue of availability the father has a dream for the world it is the dream of a lover it is a plan to bring life and love to every creature so that all may be united to god and to each other let us imagine the divine dream as love flowing from the very heart of god and it reaches every creature it is love flowing from the heart of god to every corner of the world to every moment of history to every stratum of human life to every thought of the mind to every beat of the heart to every tear of a poor person to every burden of a parent to every smile of a child imagine love becoming everything in everything and for this love god did not spare the only son but gave him up for us all but let us not think that god the father coerced first the son the way an abuser handles a victim no jesus makes himself available to abba for the fulfillment of the father 's dream jesus himself says that no one takes his life away from him but he lays it down freely this is jesus 's obedience that comes from a heart that truly loves the father is fascinated by the father and the father 's plan of love so for the father and for the plan of the father jesus makes himself unconditionally free and at the disposal of the mission given to him by the father from the incarnation up to the resurrection jesus surrenders himself fully to the rule guidance and prompting of the holy spirit of mission so that as the son he could be one with the flow of the father 's love for the world and humanity this dialogue of availability this being at the disposal of the fulfillment of the father 's will was maintained by jesus even when he could hardly see the very meaning of his mission do you remember his agony in the garden there the meaning of his mission becomes dark escapes his grasp he is thrown into confusion loneliness and aloneness and in a pathetic way jesus begs his disciples to stay with him to assure his confused soul with their presence he was inviting them to dialogue but they failed but at that point when all meaning seems to have disappeared what keeps jesus going is his option in favor of the fulfillment of the will of the father it is simply love that enables him to persevere even where meaningfulness is elusive and on the cross where the father seems to have abandoned him jesus in turn abandons his spirit to the father even in the silence of the father jesus continues his dialogue of total availability all for love all for mission some of you might say maybe at that point in jesus 's life he was probably engaging in a monologue rather than a dialogue the father was silent and the disciples could not care less huh but for jesus the cross was not a monologue but a dialogue with the father waiting for fulfillment in jesus 's cross we realize that dialogue is never interrupted where there is love where there is love there is no end to dialogue secondly the paschal mystery manifests also jesus 's love for humanity that takes the form of a dialogue of solidarity with and compassion for erring sinners a dialogue of solidarity with and compassion for erring sinners yes it is true the paschal mystery speaks of jesus 's love and availability towards the father but on the other hand it is also jesus 's active gift of life for us sinful humanity in the gospel of saint john it is said having loved his own who were in the world he loved them to the end  it is as much obedience to the father as love for us that impels jesus to suffer and die on the cross this love for humanity takes concrete form in the son of god 's humility his voluntary decision to empty himself of the glory and splendor of his divine state in order to share in humanity 's condition break in recording which is the apex of human aloneness furthermore as though this act of humility were not enough the son of god even chooses to die not in the intensive care unit of some fancy hospital but he chose to die humiliated on a cross all through self-emptying there is a preference for defenselessness as the way of establishing a dialogue of solidarity with human beings he empties himself totally in order to give himself totally the more complete the self-emptying is the more complete is the self-giving indeed self-emptying is the other name of self-giving by this dialogue jesus no longer distances his condition and destiny from those of sinners he freely embraces the horror the loneliness and the poverty that we human beings know only too well because of our sin without him committing sin for our sake god made him who knew no sin to be sin  so this is another aspect of the dialogue of solidarity namely compassion by solidarity he who has no sin becomes a co-sufferer of sinners compassion drives him to go to the place of the dead not as someone alive but as someone who has died the paschal mystery tells us how much jesus loves us in freely embracing the suffering that is ours due to sin our sinfulness blocks us from dialoguing with jesus but he pursues the dialogue by suffering our suffering crying out our cries dying our death for jesus the cross was not a monologue but a dialogue with us waiting for fulfillment in jesus 's cross we learn that dialogue cannot be interrupted where there is solidarity and compassion and finally the paschal mystery is completed in the resurrection and glorification of the crucified jesus the father receives jesus 's life offered on the cross resulting in the father 's sharing of that life to the world as the fullness of life in the resurrection the father and son engage in a dialogue of mutual acceptance which leads to their dialogue of sharing of life too with the world by the outpouring of the holy spirit so the death of jesus did not end on the cross it ended in his return to the father in order to live fully and eternally in the father 's presence and love the glorification of jesus signifies the father 's break in recording offered by the son on the cross in the resurrection the father affirms the son who on the cross felt abandoned and neglected in the resurrection the father justifies the life of jesus that was rejected by sinners in the resurrection the father proclaims to the world this is my son the resurrection is as it were the stage on which the father presents to the world jesus as the only begotten son the resurrection is the father giving to jesus the name above every other name and so the resurrection also reveals the face of god as a father after all he did not abandon his son so the dialogue of availability of the son on the cross has finally received a response from the father a response of acceptance in the resurrection and this consummated dialogue and mutual res acceptance brought forth the outpouring of the spirit to us the same spirit who led jesus to mission will now be given to us so that we could dialogue with god through the holy spirit many men and women will know jesus will receive jesus will follow jesus and be united with the father being able to cry out abba the way jesus does the three aspects of dialogue in the paschal mystery the dialogue of availability the dialogue of solidarity and compassion the dialogue of mutual acceptance and sharing of life finally the christian family and the spirituality of the paschal mystery let us now apply the three aspects of the fa paschal mystery that we have singled out to the family as a community of dialogue and let their spirituality be that of the paschal mystery first and here i am calling on families that have come from different parts of the world to be here let me propose these ideas first a christian family must bear the mark of jesus 's dialogue of availability i believe that members of families desire profoundly to be available to each other am i right in saying that crowd replies yes  do parents really like to be available to their children  clapping  i believe that i believe i believe that that is what everyone in the family desires to be available to each one i believe that even if people in our time have the habit of saying mind your own business even if that is our habit i know deep down we still want to be available but we have to admit that caught up in our own battles concerns advancement we see painfully the spirit of dialogue and availability being sacrificed in in society and even within families 1
