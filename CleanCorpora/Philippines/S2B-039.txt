mr president distinguished colleagues of the senate i vote for
concurrence and may i explain my vote
""
mr president in this chamber i was among the first if not indeed the
very first to announce support for the r p - u s visiting forces agreement
""
this is a matter of record
""
and it was long before i had been asked to co-sponsor this
resolution of concurrence
""
i have not always been an advocate mr president
""
reading the text for the first time and reading it as a stand-alone
document without reference to anything else i felt the agreement would be
easier to attack than to defend
""
and the opposition tried to prove it
""
one had to read the visiting forces agreement within the context of
our r p - u s mutual defense treaty and the vast net of security treaties
between the united states and its allies including seventy-seven status of
forces agreements in order to see its real meaning purpose and usefulness
""
that did not require revealed knowledge only a less disinterested
view of our security and the larger security environment of the asia pacific
""
since then i have had the opportunity of reaffirming my support for
the agreement and sharing some of the insults and abuse heaped upon its
supporters by its most rabid opponents
""
mr president distinguished colleagues as we concur in this
agreement i wish to make of record my sincere appreciation and thanks to the
chairs of the committees on foreign relations and national defense and
security for asking me to share the burden of moving this measure on the
floor
""
the honor was unexpected unsought and undeserved
""
but i was more than pleased to accept the challenge
""
i hope i have not been unhelpful in trying to make our people see
why we need the v f a as much as the united states and the asia pacific
region need it why it will do us more good than harm and why concurrence is
the right thing to do for this senate
""
but i have said enough and our people have heard enough from me on
this subject
""
i will not tax their patience or their good will by repeating what
i said earlier in the debates or by adding another ten thousand words
""
we need sixteen votes to concur in this agreement
""
that number has just been reached
""
the vote i cast is the seventeenth vote in favor of this agreement
""
all that is needed now is for the chair after the next speaker to
gavel the end of the voting and to declare that the senate has concurred in
the agreement and our government can then inform the united states government
that it has completed the constitutional process required for the visiting
forces agreement to come into force and effect
""
mr president vanity may tempt us to call this a resounding victory
for our side or cause
""
that would be exceedingly self-congratulatory self-indulgent and
over-simplistic and i would not walk into it
""
for me this is a victory for the entire senate and for the entire
country regardless of what position everyone took during the debate
""
it is a victory for the democratic process
""
specifically it is a victory for the joint committees for steering
the measure patiently on the floor after months of study public hearings and
committee debates
""
it 's a victory for the majority of the senate for standing by the
agreement despite all types of pressure including warnings of death and
damnation from the most unlikely sources
""
it 's a victory for the majority of our people for expressing
themselves clearly and soberly through countless resolutions in support of
the agreement
""
it 's a victory for the opposition in the senate for examining
every provision phrase and particle of the agreement for any possible
imperfection blemish or defect
""
despite their lack of numbers they used every parliamentary and
legal device in a brave if unsuccessful effort to stop the clock sway the
senate thwart concurrence
""
they lost in that bid but they won our admiration for giving it
their best shot up to the very end
""
and it is a victory for the motley opposition in the street for
waging a spirited campaign despite the odds
""
some of their more exuberant numbers managed to interrupt our
proceedings and managed to explode a few pill boxes or fire crackers
""
some of them resorted to the return of political graffiti on the
streets but all that has added vibrance and vigor to the debate
""
and we are none the worse for it
""
our only regret my only regret mr president is that while we sought
support for the v f a for reasons of national security and external defense
we saw some of our dearest friends trying to mobilize the church or being
mobilized by some people in the name of the church against the agreement for
reasons that had nothing to do at all with the ministry or practice of their
faith which unhappily happens to be ours as well
""
even as we vote this political mobilization is going on outside in
a last-minute effort to sway the senate to reject the agreement
""
these are brothers and sisters of ours in the faith for whom we
have nothing but love and respect
""
with them i have been pleased to be associated on many great moral
issues
""
with them i have prayed fasted and marched for some great cause
""
with them i would march to the very ends of the earth for any of
the great moral and religious issues and causes that bind us in one communion
and one church
""
but this time we stand unhappily on opposite sides
""
we driven by principle public duty and conscience and they invoking
a special if not exclusive use of a faith that is common to most of us on
both sides of the debate
""
for reasons of  prud  prudence mr president i have tried not
to talk about this at all during the debates
""
but a couple of days ago i received on the telephone an unexpected
and most unusual request
""
it was a stranger who called friendly and respectful yes but a
stranger nevertheless and with a deep anguish in her voice she said 
kit huwag mong pabayaan ang ating simbahan huwag mo siyang tatalikdan ikaw
ang aming pag-asa at inaasahan sa senado
""
mas mahalaga ba sa 'yo si erap at ang v f a kaysa ating cardinal at
mga kapatid mong katoliko 
""
it is one of the saddest and most difficult conversations i 've
ever had in my entire life and i didn't quite know what to say
""
i tried to explain that my catholic faith which is more important
to me than my public office or anything else in my life had absolutely
nothing to do with my position on the visiting forces agreement or on any
other non-moral non-ethical and non-religious issue which i have had to deal
with
""
and that i was supporting the visiting forces agreement only
according to my best lights as god has given me the light to see what is best
for our country and people in the area of national security and external
defense
""
neither was my position a result of my having made a choice between
my support for president joseph ejercito estrada and my loyalty to my bishop
his eminence jaime cardinal sin
""
that is a completely absurd and unexistent choice
""
one has nothing to do with the other
""
one does not cancel the other out
""
the v f a as i have just said is not a moral ethical or religious
matter
""
and my desire to help president estrada succeed despite my being a
member of a different political party and despite my previous criticisms of
him before he became president does not in any way alter or diminish my love
respect and best wishes for the good health and good humor of his eminence
the cardinal archbishop of manila whose loyal parishioner i am
""
in all my public life mr president i have always kept a strict
distinction between my personal and professional interests and those of the
nation
""
i have never confused one with the other and i have never put my
interests above those of the nation
""
in the case of the visiting forces agreement i have no personal
interests at all
""
it is all for the nation which deserves a future infinitely better
and brighter than what would otherwise be possible where we to leave it
solely in the hands of those who would have us standing naked in the wind
without anything at all to protect us against the storm
""
as a roman catholic i have always known the distinction between the
clergy and religious on the one hand and the laity on the other between
church authority and personal freedom
""
again i have never confused one with the other
""
i have some close personal associations and friendships with many
priests and bishops of long standing but i have always behaved as a layman
aware of the rights and duties of a layman and with no ambitions of ever
becoming a cleric or of ever behaving like one
""
i go to a priest as often as i can for my sins but never for
counsel on anything political for i do not believe it is right or just or
even in good taste or good form for an elected official or anyone at all to
ask a priest whether or not he should run for this office or that vote for
this candidate or that to support or oppose this treaty resolution or bill
""
all this i tried to explain to our good sister on the telephone
""
but nothing i said seemed to make an impression
""
our conversation had become a dialogue of the deaf
""
to everything i said she answered with something that sounded like
a buddhist chant  makisama ka makiisa ka 
""
she seemed more determined than the duke of norfolk trying to
compel thomas more in robert bolt 's play a man for all seasons to give his
assent to the king 's marriage since all the other great men of england had
already given theirs
""
do we remember that scene
""
says norfolk  but dammit thomas look at those names
""
 you know those men
""
can't you do what i did and come with us for fellowship 
""
""
and thomas answers  and when we stand before god and you
ascend to paradise for doing according to your conscience and i 'm damned for
not doing according to mine will you come with me for fellowship 
""
like everyone else in this chamber mr president i am a citizen in
the service of the state
""
but i am first and above all a man
""
a man who for all his sins tries to practice his faith and serve
his church as best he can as i aspire not so much to have a good name in
history as to have a place in eternity face to face with our god
""
i would not for anything in the world put my politics above my
faith
""
i would not use my faith in the service of my politics
""
for i know that while i belong to my faith and to my church my
faith and my church do not belong to me as material possessions to be used
for any reason whatsoever
""
and i would be pained as i am pained now to see any brother or
sister of mine in the faith use that same faith or the church or for any
personal or political purpose and in such facile manner
""
in my own small way mr president i have fought every attempt on the
part of the state for state authorities to propose their own religion or
their own morality in order to encroach into the rights of the church
 in
the past  in the past this went by the name of  caesaro popism
 a word that combines the words  caesar  and
 pope  to designate a phenomenon or a time when the
emperor also tried to act as pope
""
it will continue to be known as such until we give it a new name
""
in my own small way i have denounced this evil wherever i 've seen
it and i 'll continue to do so for as long as i live
""
but i do not believe i can in good conscience oppose and denounce
the slightest hint of  caesaro popism  wherever and
whenever it appears while accepting by default the opposite disorder arising
from a sad and mistaken desire on the part of some of our dearest friends to
pronounce a church position on a morally neutral ethically neutral and
religiously neutral document
""
the visiting forces agreement is a technical document
""
it seeks to provide a legal mechanism to facilitate the visit of u
s forces for purposes and activities previously approved by the philippine
government in the spirit of the nineteen fifty-one mutual defense treaty
between our two countries  1
