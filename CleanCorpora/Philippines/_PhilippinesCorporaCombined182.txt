from ayala makati meanwhile from makati we move on to the luneta area i believe the mood remains festive there as more and more  el shaddai members flock for tonight 's celebration karmina constantino is there and she gives us this update karmina thanks ron roasted cows and pigs are not the only one from the menu today it seems like members of the el shaddai charismatic movement have also developed an appetite for roads and any available space there is no stopping them from flocking to the quirino grandstand today to celebrate their founder 's birthday and the group 's fifteenth anniversary we 're here at the tenth floor of the manila hotel where we 've been closely monitoring the influx of followers of el shaddai  and let me tell you ron they 've been pretty consistent in furthering their number they 've already taken over a great portion of roxas boulevard let 's talk some figures here the western police district estimates the grandstand to accommodate about four hundry or four hundred and eighty thousand people and that 's only talking about the immediate environs of the grandstand alone that 's about four people per square meter and if the crowd spills over to roxas boulevard which it has already the figure according to the w p d estimates will only amount to half a million that 's five hundred thousand and judging from what we 're looking at over here that 's i think uh a rough estimate is about five hundred thousand people we 're looking at right now and that 's a far cry from the three to five million mark estimated by the el shaddai group but see it 's still quite early in the day also sporadic rains may have delayed the arrival of some groups but ron whether it 's a crowd of five hundred thousand or five million w p d director chief superintendent efren fernandez assures there are more than enough policemen securing the area aside from the one thousand four hundred policemen from the special action force the western police district and the regional mobile group have also deployed an additional uh two thousand policemen to strategic points in the area to make sure any untoward incidents will not disrupt today 's event ron we 're about an hour and a half into today 's celebration and so far no arrests have been made however our roving reporter macel ingles uhm have has told us rather policemen downstairs are already having a hard time patrolling the  lechon lines as some members of the el shaddai  charismatic movement are trying to get into to get in front of the line to take part of today 's feast now in spite of that chief superintendent efren fernandez is optimistic it 's gonna turn out to be a peaceful day their main concern right now is traffic and crowd control  interview clip  alright traffic enforcers from the traffic management bureau have already begun re-routing traffic the portion of roxas boulevard going to pasay has already been taken over by members of the el shaddai charismatic movement and north bound vehicles are also having a hard time going through the crowd and judging from the way it looks up here i think ron we 're only counting minutes before the whole of roxas boulevard is gonna be taken over by members of the el shaddai charismatic movement reporting live from the manila hotel i 'm karmina constantino back to you ron karmina constantino from the manila hotel now we move closer to the festivities we have miranda de quiros reporting from the quirino grandstand miranda music  thank you ron the rains will not dampen the spirit of the members of the  el shaddai  they are on their feet now singing and dancing to their favorite gospel songs they call this part of the celebrations the joyful worship and they are literally expressing their happiness as they praise their yahweh el shaddai  earlier we also heard some members deliver their testimonies on how their lives were touched by the lord while the program is going on other members are still lining up to get their share of the roasted calves and pigs brother mike velarde had in store for the el shaddai members in his sixteenth in his sixtieth birthday thanksgiving salu-salo  the el shaddai members have been

can't move uh people are drenched already umbrellas spring up whenever the rain falls and they come down like they 're down now when it 's just drizzling confetti has been showering since this morning we came here at around four this morning to set up the  sarimanok news network live coverage there was no one here early this morning except the media but people started trickling in at around six o'clock this morning from various parts of the philippines even even people from saudi arabia as uh pinky earlier reported have come home to attend this rally the rally according to organizer noel tolentino he is just one of the organizers was was uh was organized to bring to the attention of president estrada certain issues because allegedly according to them they could not get these issues straight to the president i guess an audience would be in order uhm some of these issues are of course uh charter change uhm uh the economic provisions of the charter change and uh there are provisions specific to certain sectors of society there are provisions from the farmers provisions from uh proposals from fishermen proposals from businessmen a little while ago we interviewed uh pastor saycon who was a vice-president of the management association of the philippines and who just resigned from that association due to circumstances that have been uh that have been uh uncontrolled circumstances that have been coming his way the past days but he resigned and we had that interview this morning this program is scheduled to go on until four o'clock this afternoon we will stay with the program until four o'clock this afternoon we 'd like now to turn you over to the stage where the program is in progress break in recording   missing words venues at the same time so you can see for yourself what 's going on here in makati and what 's going on at the luneta uh to give them an ultimate ano  okay uhm karmina constantino had earlier told us that the crowd  daw in uh luneta is reaching about five hundred thousand that 's a big crowd yeah but a far cry pa rin daw from the three million expected doon sa luneta okay okay on the other hand naman here in ayala avenue  padami ng padami ang tao   oo a little while ago i said there were thirty thousand but i took a short walk because a short walk is all i can take because you can't get too far that 's right and uh there are there must be around fifty to sixty thousand people here already they were expecting something like fifteen to twenty thousand to come here today that 's right oo ang sabi pa maximum thirty thousand but as it is now it 's doubled yeah uhm there are so many people they have overflowed into the cordoned-off area that we have right here pinky and i are on top of a platform that is around six feet high uh that 's the only reason we 're not crowded in but a lot of our countrymen are shoulder-to-shoulder literally uhm and at this height from the platform we could feel the body heat coming off the crowd and coming through the air uh yellow confetti has been permeating the air since this morning what is going on right now at the stage is that they have been saying prayers pinky has been following the prayers uhm they we they are at the prayers you see what they 're doing is they 're delivering the issues to president estrada in the form of prayers so ever since we started we started with the national anthem and then ecumenical opening prayer from a catholic representative a protestant representative a muslim representative and then uh we had opening songs and then the prayer petitions from sectors and groups  yan mga various sectors yun mga   mga mambubukid uh mananalakal all all all the sectors what they uh noel tolentino is actually briefing us in all these is uh briefing us on the media what actually is going to happen today uh and sabi nga niya is that they decided  daw kasi jing uhm medyo nahihirapan silang i- penetrate si presidente erap so ang ginawa nila   instead of tongue lashing  they wanted to do it through a prayer kind of like a prayer  sa various sectors may representative  kunwari ang mambubukid meron silang prayer na sariling kanila yung mga mangaga mangangalakal meron silang sariling  prayers para sa kanila   oo   oo nga raw   yeah   oo oo si joey cuisia yung nag-  deliver ng prayer para sa mga negosyante mangangalakal at propesyunal  i 'd like to stress a point here which was conveyed to us by the organizers earlier today it 's noisy here so we we can't hear nahihirapan din kami  we can't hear the the commands from the control van uh anyway like i said various prayers are are now being delivered right here in makati uh what we 're looking forward to is the singing of   ama namin the reading of the sacred scripture uhm the
