 words now the vice-president gloria macapagal-arroyo welcome back on-line madame vice-president and thank you for your time thank you also madame vice-president the question we would like to ask among others is that was your decision to break away from the estrada cabinet as uh social welfare and development secretary a personal one or a party decision a combination uh uhm gene because for a long time now certain party leaders and leaders of other parties and other groups uh uhm have been pressuring me to resign but it is my practice it has been my practice throughout my political career uh uhm to always to be consulting with the people on the ground and in the earlier months when i would be having this pressure from certain party uh uhm colleagues and others to resign when i would check it on the ground that was not it was not jibing with my feedback from from the common people what the common people then wanted was that because the government was in trouble the country was in trouble then i should help uh uhm i should help by the by from from the inside but in the last two weeks that feedback changed uh uhm uh uhm and the people that i consulted asked said that it is time for me to leave the administration because my being inside does not help uh uhm bring about stability at all and in fact uh therefore it is time for me to take my role which my colleagues had been asking me to take we always love to ask the question whenever a decision is made or whenever a decision is about to be made is this is it always hard or did you did you have a hard time deciding to leave the estrada cabinet you know gene what is always hard is to disc to discern what is the will of god because that 's always been my my tradition and part of the will of god is expressed through the people uh uhm because of course they voted for me and they can dictate to me words the confluence of events  yes  uh uhm so it 's really you know this is a lot like sin where you can discern the will of god i mean you choose will you will you commit adultery or will you not will you steal or will you not those are very black and white decisions yes, the choice between right and wrong is very clear yes uh uhm yes, but when you talk about do i resign or do i stay uh uhm then then you really have to go through a process of prayerful discernment which which i went through because you don't know you don't know whether what is going through your mind is really what is the right thing to do so you pray and you wait for the confluence of events to guide you and that 's what i had to do  uh uhm  if i got your statement correctly the statement in which you declared your resignation from the estrada cabinet yes you said something like it is now untenable for you to be with the estrada cabinet or it is untenable for you no i did not to stay in the cabinet i did not use the word untenable  uh uhm i can no longer continue to serve in the cabinet  okay  uh uhm so by staying in the cabinet before you want to help the government   yes yes that 's right now it 's a different story things have turned from the ma from the point of view of the people who voted for me as vice-president because you see gene i also have this attitude  uh uhm  okay that as cabinet member i was accountable to the president and i and i like to believe when i was cabinet member i was accountable to him and and i was a good team player but as elected vice-president of the people i am accountable to the people as well  uh uhm  directly to them and the time came when there was a conflict between my accountability to him uh uhm and my accountability to them uh uhm and so therefore i had to choose the higher accountability which was what i was elected for before you were pressured as you have pointed out by your political party mates  yes   yes   yes  many colleagues yes   the people  some people in the government   some people some people no outside government outside of government yes some but but not you know in my process of consultation not with the vast majority you were called names and yet   when you were in that position and yet i stuck to my posi my point uh uhm because i was confident uh uhm that i was i i i i had been listening to the people uh uhm and they agreed with me in fact i i get i got my signals from them yes that 's why as long as i know that i 'm doing right uh uhm and as long as i know that what i 'm doing is what is dictated by the people they can call me names but that 's the way it is is your decision in any way linked to the controversy as exposed by ilocos sur governor luis singson in a se  the jueteng issue in a sense gene yes because prior to the prior to the controversy that was raised by governor singson uh uhm uh uhm the people said continue to serve  but when singson came up with his expos&eacute; the people were so enraged that they didn't want me to serve anymore okay by saying that would it be fair to conclude that you believe governor singson you believe the charges or you still doubt it well i wa i want to try to be sober and to say that it 's not what i believe that matters uh uhm there are investigations going on uh uhm the more independent they are the the more we will know the truth but the thing is it is between the peo the people and and what i should do my proper role in government uh uhm so it is not what the president should do  it 's what i should do   yes   yes  and the people wanted me to get out and join the opposition rather than stay in the cabinet where i was not contributing anymore to stability how do you describe the pulse of the nation now because if you look at surveys and there were two surveys  oo  which came out just recently pulse asia incorporated and then we have the social weather station and both surveys show that there is still support for the president well yeah   they still believe in the president but well you have decided because you heard the people  yeah  because it was i mean i 'm not saying that you see they 're two different things  they they maybe the majority may not want him to resign  uh uhm uh uhm  uh uhm but they wanted me to resign from his cabinet okay uh uhm so there is no conflict between between those findings no those findings by survey groups the scientific uh methods determining what the people think and what you heard from the people  yes  yes that brought you to decide and leave the estrada cabinet  that 's right  yes okay perhaps what they want now from me uh uhm is to invigorate the opposition because in the past that was what that 's what they were saying the opposition was in doldrums because they had no leader  uh uhm  uh uhm and perhaps though the people might still as the surveys show want him there perhaps they want somebody who will take the lead in being more in bringing vigor to the opposition madame vice-president allow me to mouth yes the uh well the words of malaca&ntilde;ang that your resignation from the cabinet the situation we are in now the expos&eacute; of governor singson is part of a grand conspiracy to destabilize the estrada administration i i 'm not aware of any such con  that you are playing into that conspiracy by resigning well if it stutter if it was a question of playing into some conspiracy or other then i should have done it before done it before okay uh-huh but this is coming from the people and not from any particular at this point in time uh uhm party member who whom i could not say no to uh uhm but are you surprised to hear those kind of response from malaca&ntilde;ang to the uh situation now no i 'm not   is that uh an effort in futility in desperation because they can't find anything else to   well i don't want to judge uh uhm because they have their answer and and all i can say is from my knowledge uh uhm i 'm not aware of uh any from personal knowledge i 'm not aware of any move to destabilize former president ramos former president aquino manila archbishop jaime cardinal sin have demanded the resignation of president estrada but you haven't issued a statement on that explaining that you cannot make a statement on the resignation because you would be the benef you would benefit from such act  yes  but have you thought about this whether you would really make one or not a statement yeah as long as i 'm in support or as long as i 'm the beneficiary i don't think it 's proper it 's it 's delicadeza  i don't think it 's proper to make a comment except to say that i will follow the constitution uh uhm speaking of propriety or or or or courtesy some people hit back at you for for resigning abroad you should have considered courtesy on the part of the president to say it in front of him or when you 're in the country well i was i talked to him on the phone uh uhm so so i did uh resign personally uh uhm okay the thesis of this discussion is is there a caesar 's wife in this government that could take over in the wake of the questions on the morality the leadership and the kind of governance governance of this uh incumbent administration and well i don't know where it 's coming from but there are rumors and i 'll be more bordering on rumors speculations or even libel or even black propaganda exactly how it is  words  yeah but it is public interest and people want to know they 've always said that if it 's the vice-president who will replace president estrada then it would be worse because no not they 've been pointing out the jueteng connection not the not they have always said gene uh president aquino does not say that cardinal sin does not say that reforma = political party does not say uh uhm  promdi = political party   promdi  does not say that so it 's not they have always said uh uhm well i 'm referring to the detractors your detractors   well okay the detractors yes because what can they find about me except that i am a town mate of bong pineda and his wife who is the mayor of my home town and many years ago i was ninang in in the wedding of her son one of four that i attended that day uh uhm which i couldn't even stay for the ceremony because i had to go to the next one uh uhm and i also asked cardinal sin about that what what is the what is a christian 's role if you are asked to be the ninang  uh uhm of the son of somebody with a dubious dubious reputation and he said it is your christian duty to accept because the sin of the father is not the sin of the son uh uhm but your your uh but your being there yeah brought on or gave this kind of of talks but uh i was doing my christian duty and if i must suffer black propaganda because speaker a starts laughing i did my christian duty it will be the lord who will protect me  uh uhm  uh uhm but this appears to be a uh i don't know the word i 'm lost i 'm lost for words  recurrent  uh recurrent it 's a recurrent it 's i would i wouldn't say it 's a stigma on your political career because this has been going on ever since you were senator and then when you ran for vice-president yes you won and still there were allegations that you got jueteng money
