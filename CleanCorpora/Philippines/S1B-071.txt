""
""
i had so many many buyer of this property
""
but i had been so much embarrassed and disappointed because in spite
of so many uh most of them had no money
""
so i make it a point  na  i will not uh anymore give
an authority to anybody because i am very much disappointed
""
in this case uh because of the high recommendation of mrs galido to
you of of this transaction i am agreeing with the price as well as the terms
whatever he wants she wants provided you can bring your buyer here and we can
evaluate
""
now your buyer i will make it more easier for her if uh we if we
will be used to have an  word  of her or his money i 'll
be accepting the the arrangement  ha 
""
but i will make this a very very easy terms for her provided you can
bring them here and we can size up the situation
""
now the time is very very important  phone rings  for us the
time frame of our transaction because we are going to have election
""
as i for one if i can sell this property before the end of the month
i 'll have to take leave with my company because i will be one of the
campaign manager of a certain candidate
""
so you know i am a politician uh so i want to participate on this
election 'cause this might be our last election
""
uh last election because the military said that if we will have no
good election then they will annul the election and they will take over the
government
""
and if the military will take over the government most of us will
dislike the military there will be civil war
""
and if there will be civil war the communists will expand their
number and they will take over on our government
""
that will be the end of the story of our democracy  laughter
""
""
so you better rush this thing because i am in need of money i want
to go to politics
""
yes okay okay  maski  sixty days ninety days 
o  one hundred twenty days balance
""
""
before elections
""
""
yeah uh okay
""
""
 nagmamadali rin ho itong    buyer
 natin 
""
""
  oho   kailan ninyo dadalhin dito 
""
""
uh
""
""
 bukas kaya hindi n'yo madala 
""
""
 sige ho tatawagan natin 
""
""
 sino kaibigan mo ba 'yon na  buyer
""
""
 uh ano ho  trustee  ng  buyer
""
""
you better talk to him personally 
""
uh  give it to him  tells the secretary to give the phone to
speaker c   so we cannot be delayed  phone rings and speaker a
talks over the phone 
""
if possible tomorrow or thursday because my  asset  will be
moving for abroad if they will be successful to get our money there i am not
going to sell this property anymore
""
as a matter of fact i really don't want to sell this property but
just a matter of challenge to everybody that property is good and had been
sold
""
i will sell this if somebody is going to pay me immediately 
""
""
golf course  ho kasi ang balak nilang gawin dito
""
""
""
 ang totoo ngayon uh uh  the one that 's buying
mr  chanco  is making that into golf course
""
as a matter of fact everything now is already fixed everything the
planning the topographic everything has been  ano  by them
""
they had spent already hundreds of thousands of pesos on their
planning
""
but there are they get around two hundred thousand two hundred
million loan from the bank
""
and the president of the bank is their partner
""
i but you see our agreement is he is supposed to give me thirty
million equity
""
they start uh developing the property and getting everything in the
property but they don't give me the money 
""
so as far as i 'm concerned i do not have any agreement with them
""
they are spending hundreds of thousands of pesos already but they
had not given me yet the money
""
therefore our transaction is not yet finish
""
they should have given me the first agreement of thirty million
pesos uh equity that is uh last week
""
but the  pa  they continue developing the property making
some ground planning and operation but yet  ha  they had not
paid us yet
""
uh i had been informed that this buyer is interested of the
property because they want to give give uh get that as golf
""
""

hundred million now approved
""

""

ano 
""
this is  i see mr gozon is very very happy here that you uh that
the transaction is closed  laughter 
""
yes yes i will take good care of it
""
okay follow this up for me okay
""
thank you very much mr uh bye
""
 talking to people in office  first concern  niya
 we are the one who make the project study and feasibility study of
mr  chanco  who submitted it already in bank and there is an approval
of the two hundred million already for this property 
""
so that is the situation at present
""
""
sir what will happen to the letter of authority
""
""
now uh look never mind  mr  chanco  want to develop
the property into golf
""
if he will not pay me i 'll sell it to  manzano  
""
the same plan okay because i do not care for mr  chanco  as
long as he doesn't pay me
""
""
yeah first come first served
""
""
yes yes if uh you you tell mr  manzano  if he will mr
 chanco  will not pay me until tomorrow morning the the deal is off
""
""
so mr  manzano  can buy my property okay
""
he pay me twenty million thirty million pesos tomorrow i 'll i 'll
sign the agreement
""
""
it 's not  manzano  who is the buyer
""
""
yes whoever is the  ano  uh 
""
according to him it is a uh  ano  uh  siguro
uh sa nangyayari dito ngayon  mr  chanco  is  lalabas
dito  mr  manzano  is the developer
""
now they had made an arrangement with the bank and according to mr
 manzano  there is an approval of the two hundred million
""
that is to confirm also  chanco  told me two days ago
""
now with  chanco  now entertaining the japanese that might
be with our plan with  chanco  because we become here a partner with
mr  chanco  as long as he give me the thirty million pesos requirement
equity
""
now if the japanese will pay him this twenty million dollar of the
finished golf then the obligation we got with the bank will be paid
automatically and  manzano  might be there inside
""
now if mr  chanco  will not make good on his commitment to
me i can deal directly to  manzano  with this authority through you mr
gozon okay
""
so i am not afraid with anybody i 'll give you the authority
""
first come first serve
""
five percent uh over price    
""
there must be this  phone rings  and is only for one week
""
 talks to secretary  you give mr gozon only one week time to
transact we cannot wait that much  ano uh kwan  only one week
uh nette  ilagay mo   this authority is only good for
one week  uh
""
because if it is true  na   manzano  is
inside and he they are going to buy me out because of the loan approval uh
okay  lang yan sa akin 
""
 words  okay  lang 'yan sa akin 
because uh the way i look at it they they make me as a  the pawn of the
transaction  hindi ba 
""
the most important to me i can use my money for another purpose
okay
""
 ngayon  only five days
""
""
 commission  
""
""
five days
""
""
uh five days only five days
""
i mean mr gozon that will also drive everybody to close the
transaction
""
remember  na  i gave you this authority because of
 pakiusap ni  mrs galido
""
""
yeah
""
""
i do not give that authority anymore
""
now  kapag nagkaipitan tayo ng panahon at nakita kong
maganda ang lakad ng inyong  transaction i can extend it to you okay
""
just for the meantime place there only five days
""
so today is twenty-two it will terminate on the twenty-seventh 
okay
""
""
to twenty nine
""
""
twenty nine no five days uh  wala namang kwenta 'yon
tingnan no binigyan ako ng  special authority  dito mabasa man
ni  chanco  'yon hindi ako mapapahiya 
""
because  sabihin ko sa kaniya eh hinantay kita na bigyan mo
ako ng kuwarta kahapon hindi di  i opened it to the market again
""
no okay
""
that will be the situation okay five six only five days
""
""
 hindi pa tapos  laughter 
""
""
 hindi pa tapos tatapusin natin 
""
""
sir  nagmamadali rin naman si  mr  manzano
 so five days is okay
""
""
yes you see the advantages of this five days  conse 
 kuwan  authority is uh upon presentation of that authority to
your buyer the that will be in black and white that you are only given five
days as a concession of mrs galido
""
now without them to execute uh we lost the transaction
""
now  kung halimbawa naman nasa  in  na kayo
 we are we are there are just a little thing to be ironed out and the
five days had run out i will be kind enough to extend you another uh so many
days
""
""
 iniisip ko sir baka si mr  chanco  baka isa
siya sa  group  kasi  mr  manzano  is only a
trustee
""
""
uh i the way i look at it he told me  nga 
 he is one of my partner and besides we had been to lunch today and uh
we are the one making his project study 
""
""
 kasi ho gusto ho naming gusto ho naming pasyalan 'yung
lugar kasama namin si     
""
""
 mr  chanco   
""
""
mr  manzano 
""
""
mr  manzano  no mr  chanco  just come in
 mga  fifteen days ago     with his wife and
children 
""
because he is associated i think he is the  balae 
of of uh george  see  of the  philippine bank  the owner of the
ano and then he has an arrangement also with the philippine national bank
through  lopez 
""
so  there might be some sort of arrangement so what is
important to me is to finish the transaction
""
uh  chanco  will call for me because mr  manzano 
will contact  chanco 
""
i told him  let  chanco  know that i am only giving
him until tomorrow for the ten million if not i will accept anybody uh
  ano 
""
if they will see your authority then i he can i can tell him
 na   well i gave that authority first come first serve
uh because i need the money very badly 
""
""
 fifteen days ago  ha
