thank you mr president mr president we gather here today in search of peace security and welfare of the filipino people they elected us to this august chamber to discharge our constitutional duties one of the most important of which is to ratify or reject treaties or international agreements that have vital influence in their lives and fortune mr president and distinguished colleagues outside this hall are rallies demonstrations and loud protests of our people holding divergent views seeking to sway our decision in a democratic institution like ours we encourage them to do so because the people must be free to choose their own future without fear or favor without dictation or domination without suppression or subversion but guided by our obligation to secure their safety freedom and progress as divine providence gives us to see the light we cast our vote today in accordance with our conscience unafraid of the indictment of posterity let history be the final judge of our deeds we are called upon to accept or reject senate resolution number four four three under committee report number forty-two which declares its concurrence on the visiting forces agreement between the government of the philippines and the government of the united states it must be pointed out that we have an existing mutual defense treaty with the united states signed in nineteen fifty-one we could have renounced it after the senate rejected the proposed treaty of friendship economic cooperation and security with the united states in nineteen ninety-one but we did not because that was not our intention despite the bases pull-out we chose to keep the m d t because the need to maintain the security alliances with the most powerful nation in the world must remain in the present circumstances prudence dictates that we give substance and effect to the r p - u s mutual defense treaty through the concurrence of the senate in the visiting forces agreement the v f a is not crafted to recolonize the philippines or to resurrect the foreign bases that we had discarded voting for it does not mean a surrender of our sovereignty it simply permits the short troop visits upon approval by our government for purposes of joint military exercises to ensure our security relationship under the aforesaid treaty to ordinary citizens this gey this gathering may have little or no real impact on their daily struggle for their survival yet in the life of our beloved nation today 's event holds surpassing meaning and unprecedented significance destined to etch in our country 's history mr president distinguished colleagues in the senate i stand here today on behalf of seventy million filipinos whose future depends on the security of our shores and the sustenance of their livelihood i come here today to cast my vote a vote that embraces the lesson of history and takes careful consideration of learned opinions of legal and political experts on this agreement requiring our sound judgment we are at a time of relative peace we are not a country at war but we should not let this lull us into a false sense of security because the string that holds this peace is weak for while we are peace-loving people willing to go the extra mile for peace there are also those willing to go the extra mile to disturb that peace the greatest threat to this fragile state of security in fact lies in slumber only a few hundred nautical miles away from our shores mr president today we make another hard and momentous decision for our people one that seeks to guarantee that peace continue to reign a peace that is crucial in sustaining our gains as a nation and leading us toward the next millennium where we can match stride with most prosperous economies and countries of the world deciding the fate of the visiting forces agreement i believe is a choice between preserving that peace or treading the path toward a future of uncertainty people say that our decision today would either set us back to the time when we were ruled by foreign colonizers or affirm the independence we have achieved when the last warship in subic bay the helicopter carrier  bella wood sailed out of philippine waters it is the obligation of the senate according to the critics of the v f a to preserve the gains we have achieved in nineteen ninety-one when we threw the military bases out of the country and finally ended the last form of foreign domination in our country mr president i am all for keeping and fighting for independence and sovereignty a brief look of history would show that my family had been deeply involved in the elusive quest for freedom from foreign rule my grandfather fought the americans during the philippine war for independence the centennial of which we are celebrating this year my father was a delegate during the passage of the hare-hawes-cutting law and the tydings-mcduffie law which paved the way for philippine independence from the united states my brother ninoy who was erroneously tagged as an amboy by his detractors maintained his position for philippine sovereignty although the  u the united states provided him refuge from the dictator another brother butz as a senator cast his vote against the continued stay of the u s bases in nineteen ninety-one despite the pro-bases stand taken by our sister-in-law the former president now it is my turn to make a choice mr president every generation must write a new kind of history times have changed today 's challenges are different they are of a broader kind they are of a global nature the choice i am about to make and the circumstances that surround it differ from those on which the members of my family based their option but we are one in principle we are entering a new millennium when there is a great economic competition fueled by the dizzying pace of technological advances but with progress comes more threats to our national security these threats have to be confronted now not with a narrow nationalism but with a broader perspective of cooperation and mutual support this is where alliances treaties and agreements like the v f a will come in but before we talk about what the v f a can do for us it is necessary first to discuss what it cannot do the v f a alone cannot provide us military dominance the v f a alone cannot bring us economic progress and more importantly the v f a alone cannot prevent any foreign act of aggression regional security will largely depend on the number of bilateral alliances and agreements the u s presence in the asia pacific is anchored on treaties and security agreements with countries like the philippines thailand singapore indonesia malaysia and brunei with similar arrangement on the status of forces one thing is certain mr president we need friends we need allies with friends and allies we can collectively guarantee our regional security and stability not many will agree with the idea of a superpower like the united states extending its reaches in our region i am one of those who believe that our security as a nation our sovereignty should be defended and upheld by the filipino people neither through the might of a superpower nor the cover of a military alliance mr president i realize that we are fifteen years and several billions of pesos away from becoming truly able to defend our borders and protect our people from external aggression we lack the time and resources to assure our people that we can uphold our sovereignty in the complex environment that exists today and it is our responsibility to make sure that our people be provided the means to make to have a secure future that is why i have opened my mind to forging military alliances with the united states it is in the larger context of peace that we have to ratify this agreement the r p - u s mutual defense treaty is an ef is an effective deterrent against ambitious neighboring countries every potential aggressor is put on notice that any aggression against the philippines may result in armed confrontation with the united states our respective forces armed forces should be given the opportunity to train together so that there should should be should there  be exigencies they can effectively work together as one fighting unit that is what the v f a seeks to accomplish we share with the americans a passion for democracy and human rights we fought side by side with them when our freedom was threatened during world war two the senate has put in place enough safeguards that would allay fears and abuses are bound to take place one of which is the creation of legislative oversight committee that would monitor and oversee this its implementation we have fo poured our undivided attention and spent urgent critical deliberation on the v f a two years were spent by the government of the philippines and the government of the united states in negotiating the v f a let us give the agreement a chance and let us give the filipino people a rare opportunity to pre to prove their capability to uphold this treaty while the agreement took such a long time to study and prepare we also recognize that the v f a is not permanent when we are ready we can do away with it and when that time comes i will be one of those cheering at this great achievement of our people of taking complete control of our security fears have been raised mr president over the possible resurgence of prostitution rings with the ratification of the v f a nothing ranks higher in my consideration of the v f a that may  should be than my concern for the fate of the women when we rejected the u s bases treaty in nineteen ninety-one it was a rejection of the commodification of our women in angeles and olongapo ratifying the v f a does not mean that we are allowing our women to be exposed against the same humiliating vi vices i say ratify the v f a and pass senate bill number fifteen sixty-two or the anti- prostitution act that proposed measure would decriminalize the prostitute and would penalize the reason for the crime the pimp and the buyer pass this bill into law and enforce so whoever engages the services of prostitutes be they filipino american or any other nationality will be prosecuted and charged accordingly rejecting the v f a will not solve our country 's problem on prostitution whether the v f a is here or not we will we still have to work very hard to provide a solution to this moral and social problem mr president and my dear colleagues i would like to make an appeal a rejection of the v f a would not give the country the respect it wants from other independent nations rejecting the v f a would be an act of cowardice and fear a fear of the past and a fear of the unknown rejection would be a silent admission that we are still unable to stand on equal footing with other independent countries such as the united states mr president the time has come to show to the whole world that we can hold our own in the community of nations now is the time to prove that we can see eye to eye with other countries match them stride for stride we determine our own destiny we can only be dominated if we choose to be dominated in nineteen eighty-six we as a people rose against the domination of an oppressive government and despotic ruler in nineteen ninety-one we again as a people decided against the continued stay of the u s bases in the country in nineteen ninety-six we collectively rallied against any form of charter change that would bring the country back to the throes of dictatorial rule and only last year through our votes we reaffirmed our commitment to democracy and put in place a government truly representative of the people 's will a government which truly is our own in closing mr president the v f a will not eliminate conflicts it will not put an end to war it will not secure freedom for all but i cast my vote in favor of senate resolution four four three concurring in the agreement between the governments of the philippines and the united states regarding the treatment of u s armed forces visiting the philippines i cast my vote in favor of v f a because it will help preserve peace and the peace that we seek does not rest in treaties and agreements or charters and covenants alone it is the peace that lies also in the hearts and minds of the filipino people let us therefore ask them to fully support and totally commit to preserve our peace and freedom to assure a stable and bright future  mabuhay ang pilipinas  thank you mr president 1
