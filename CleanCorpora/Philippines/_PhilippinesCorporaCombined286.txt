your eminence alfonso cardinal lopez trujillo papal legate for the fourth world meeting of families your eminence jaime cardinal sin archbishop of manila your eminences members of the college of cardinals your excellency archbishop antonio franco our apostolic nuncio your excellencies the most reverend archbishops and bishops reverend sisters and brothers the delegations from the various countries of the world and the forty-two babies officially registered in this world meeting of families my brothers and sisters in the lord good morning audience replies good morning  when our holy father announced that the world meeting of families will be held in the philippines the bishops conference of the philippines said it is very difficult so we passed on the job to archbishop to the archbishop of manila cardinal sin who performs miracles we begin the fourth world meeting of families with the celebration of the holy eucharist the sacrament of love that jesus left for us his family of faith the household of god the family of god how profoundly meaningful and immeasurably without price is god 's gift of the eucharist for us and for every family let us reflect briefly on the eucharist and the family the eucharist tells us what kind of love god has for us and how we in turn must love one another the cross of jesus and the holy eucharist are the ultimate symbols of authentic love for on the cross jesus himself fulfills the word he had declared to his disciples there is no greater love than this for one to lay down his life for a friend his body broken on the cross his blood being poured out as an offering to god his father for the sake of all jesus demonstrates the nature and extent of his love completely unconditional utterly sacrificial totally self-giving it is from the cross my brothers and sisters that a new people of god a new family of faith was born born in the pangs of the passion and death of jesus born in god 's incomparable love the promise in jeremiah the prophet that we read this morning of a new covenant and a new law written in the hearts of god of god 's people is fulfilled at the last supper jesus gives a new commandment love one another as i have loved you so you also should love one another our second liturgical reading from the first letter of john adds if we love one another god remains in us the blood that jesus shared with his apostles at the last supper is the seal of a new and everlasting covenant every time then that we celebrate the eucharist we also celebrate the new covenant and our birthday as god 's people god 's own family and if the commandment of love is at the heart of the new family of god we did not wonder that the ri at the rite of holy matrimony with which a new family a new human family begins the new husband is reminded of the words of jesus and later the words of saint paul to love his wife as christ loves his church today 's gospel reading is the beautiful story of the boy jesus in the temple it tells us what it is to be a family of love in the story mary and joseph bring their son of twelve years old on the regular pilgrimage to jerusalem on the feast of the passover the same feast that jesus would trans later transform into the new passover of the family of god the mystery of his passion death and resurrection the cross and the eucharist and in jerusalem mary and joseph leave jesus to follow devotedly and faithfully the religious traditions of israel traditions that they had taught him at home traditions of believing of praying and of worshiping at the end of the celebration mary and joseph discover that jesus is not with them they search for him with great concern and anxiety but with the intuition of parents who know the hopes and dreams of their son they go back to the temple and there they see the young son astounding the teachers of the law with his intelligent answers and questions to the concern of his beloved mother jesus lovingly and respectfully responds why were you looking for me did you not know that i must be in my father 's house did you not know that i must be about my father 's work in his heart jesus hears the call of god to go beyond his home beyond his village in nazareth but now he must yet return home with his parents mary and joseph saint luke sums up the life of jesus with mary and joseph very simply jesus was obedient to them obedient to their teachings break in recording  the love and life of jesus revolved most obviously around mary and joseph but most of all his love and life was centered on god it was also true for mary and joseph life in the holy family is a lesson for every family in every family life must be a life of love shared generously to overflowing love that is finally expressed in service life in the family must be centered on god this is the secret of advancing in wisdom and grace before god and man and this too is the key to confronting the many challenges families of the world face today from the very beginning then my brothers and sisters the family as founded on the totally self-sacrificing love of god is fundamental good news for the third millennium but today you and i know that the family is facing the grave challenge of a materialistic and secularist culture that is bringing bringing in a new morality with no religious foundation and this emerging global culture attacks fundamental scriptural and ecclesial teachings and the very nature of life nature of death love and marriage men women and children it is a challenge that the world has never known before because especially because it is so quickly disseminated through the tools of social communication in the multicultural and multireligious asian environment where the church is a tiny minority of less than two percent and in a democratic social order such as the philippines sometimes the church seems to be but one feeble prophetic voice against many contrary voices even more strident and sometimes better heard than that of the church we hope therefore that the fourth world meeting of families will inspire encourage and strengthen the filipino family and the asian family we in the philippines we are a poor country but rich indeed in religious faith but sadly however we sometimes tend to separate faith from life and that is why at the beginning of the third millennium in january two thousand one the church in the philippines has deliberately chosen the filipino catholic family as the focal point of evangelization concretely this pastoral thrust of the church in the philippines means that all diocesan and parochial pastoral programs of evangelization will be directed toward the renewal of the family in this way the filipino catholic family as the domestic church will become an evangelized and evangelizing cell of basic ecclesial communities of covenant communities village chapels and parishes all over the philippines at this point then my brothers and sisters may i express some hopes not only for filipino catholic families but also for all the families of our world hope with me we hope that the fourth world meeting of families will deepen strengthen and quicken the faith of every family help transform every family into a faith that into a family of faith that loves shares and serves a faith that does justice we hope that every family would be a true sanctuary of love and life ever alert and committed to defending and promoting human life in that seamless continuum that god created it to have from the very beginning we hope that all families would be totally imbued with the values of the gospel and of the kingdom of god so as to be a powerful gospel leaven in society we hope that every catholic family would be a school of faith of love and prayer guiding the hearts of parents and their children to holiness in the kingdom of god and to participation in the whole mission of the church we hope that every catholic family would be a fertile seed bed of vocation not only to a socially transformational lay state but also to the priestly and religious life while renewed in its sense of mission to its milieu even extending its missionary concern ad jentes ad dextero and ad vitam  and finally we pray that the fourth world meeting of families would assist the church in the philippines to realize these hopes it is in this light my brothers and sisters that we filipinos are truly honored and privileged to be the first asian host of the firth fourth world meeting of families we are deeply thankful to our holy father pope john paul the second and to his personal special legate his eminence alfonso cardinal lopez trujillo and to them both mabuhay  our country is one that is wonderfully devoted to our blessed mother mary whom we invoke in the litany as the queen of the family and we beg today our mother and queen to be with us to intercede for us and keep us united with her son my brothers and sisters in the one family of god the world over with the joy and peace of our lord jesus and in behalf of the more than one hundred bishops of the philippines break in recording and into the one break in recording heart of the filipino family break in recording mabuhay
