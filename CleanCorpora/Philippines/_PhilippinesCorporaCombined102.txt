you 're free to ask questions and comments throughout the talk words  as i get older i find these three-hour sessions more difficult yeah i feel fine with two hours but three hours we 'll have a break in the middle okay i was asked to speak with you or tell you what i know on child language studies in psycholinguistics is this what you want yes brother yes okay so i 've divided my presentation into two parts uh one is the uh uh in general and then we 'll have the break and then after that we 'll have the uh uh the second part which is the field as it is uh uh found in the philippines you know what what i can now share with you some of the uh literature in the philippines okay uh i have been away from the field for some time now uh as you grow older and you have many other duties you find that much as you would like to pursue interesting places for research you can no longer do it this is one of the most painful things for me in terms of uh leading the life of a scholar i 'm doing a lot of administrative work i 'm one of the few administrators i think in the world that has tried to keep up intellectually with his field of research while doing a lot of administrative work well i find that i 'm happy to be words in the area now which is the area of sociolinguistics specifically i 've been doing a lot of work on national uh language development i suppose if you ask me who 's the most knowledgeable person in national language development probably i would say it 's between dr sibayan and myself he is a dear friend he 's eighty-two and i 'm fifty-seven so i hope that tish would be our successor laughter  hey we 're all getting old uh but this is part of the uh again the culture of rise and fall of the human beings and their self-actualization because i find the topic of child language fascinating i like children although when they grow up they turn out to be horrible laughter in the sense that they don't follow anymore what you tell them to do and they keep making mistakes it seems the present generation needs to make mistakes before you can really do before they learn and i 'm hoping that in their middle age they would pick up wisdom but uh it 's a fascinating field uh i guess if i if i weren't an administrator i would certainly devote half my time to child language uh research because i find it fascinating uh plus the psychic reward of being with children is something since i 'm celibate i don't have any children they 're very nice until about words laughter they 're about school age and then they become colossal pains in the ass then you you appreciate what it is to be a celibate but that 's neither here nor there laughter  but anyway uh uh but i cannot now i 've been trying to get people involved in child language because this field is wide open you can do it all you need is time and intelligence it doesn't need expensive equipment and yet really i 've had no takers the ones i tried to train in the beginning have not continued in child language they 've gone on into other fields and but in the states and in europe especially in the states it 's fantastic the field is only about thirty years old really serious research on child language began in the early sixties and now it 's thirty thirty-seven years the literature is vast uh there is a quarterly journal on which i 'm on the editorial board you can find this in the linguistics library uh of a bibliography of uh applied linguistics uh it 's a and if you want to see the entries the last three months or the last six months on child language acquisition language acquisition in general you find piles and piles of entries on the thing because there 's a tremendous amount of research going on and what i don't i guess here in the philippines the biggest drawback to research is the fact that people don't really have time  everybo if you have if you 're in any way halfway talented you are asked to do ten thousand other things then you end up uh not really words  if nobody asks you to do anything consider that a form of an insult because it means you 're not talented for anything laughter  uh but the moment you show any kind of talent in a school or institution they keep piling you with work   i know that  so anyway uh so the long and short of it is uh i 've been trying to train people for child language studies and uh i 've not succeeded there is nobody right now on this campus for example who is seriously pursuing child language studies i wish i could get somebody i 'll hire that person on the spot uh to fu because to create a good department you need subspecializations in the department so you know this person will handle literature the literature of a special kind this person will handle child language this person will be your psycholinguist this person will be your sociolinguist that 's how you build excellence in your department uh you cannot build that uh you know the way things are going unless you have this vision beforehand so the the field developed around late fifties early sixties and the pioneer was a harvard uh psychologist by the name of brown roger brown and he gathered with him a group of disciples the most outstanding of which was a woman by the name of ursula bellugi who subsequently moved with her husband to santa barbara and there continued their work there although i presume she must be close to retirement by now alright uh side by side with brown and a contemporary a very old man now is a marvelous universal linguist by the name of charles ferguson who is now at stanford but he 's officially retired as far as i know and he had a disciple by the name of catherine snow who did a lot of work and then i studied under a second generation person by the name of dan slobin who is at berkeley and a very fine man and then later on there was a whole spate of disciples after that the most productive of whom at one time was a pair called uh heidi dulay a filipina but you know natio naturalized american citizen and then a woman by the name of marina burt they did some pioneering studies in child language studies in the states and now it 's impossible there are so many specialists all over the place but these are the pioneers you 'll find all their books in my library actually if you 're interested in this field almost every issue of language which is the official journal of the linguistic society of america has a very good one or two very good articles on child language either a regular article or what you call a review article so you can pretty much gauge what is happening in the field and you 're very welcome to look at that if this is the kind of thing that uh turns you on and if you 're a linguist and you have your own child uh or co-produce a baby uh uhm chuckle  to study uh to study your child and some have done that but i have to see the results you know yeah i just have to words  brother what 's the bibliography you mentioned that 's in your linguistics library the index of applied linguists i mean  bibliography of applied linguistics you can ask my secretary in fact i 'm looking at it right now bibliography now therefore it 's become a subspecialty in psycholinguistics and in general for language theory because i would like to show part of the reason people get interested in studying how language emerge emerges in the human species is a fact that this has serious implications for language theory and for the uh what chomsky calls the theory of mind  in other words the brain  and if you look at the field the way it has developed there are different kinds of studies you can study what we call cross-sectional you get children more or less of the same age and you study uh what they have in common what they have that 's different you can do longitudinal studies and these are mostly case studies you study two people one or two people and see how they evolve from the time they 're merely producing babble like uh infants you know to the time they start talking which is roughly about twelve months to the time they start using sentences which is roughly uh eighteen months and the first full sentences grammatically correct uh are about twenty-four months so that by thirty-six months the child becomes fluent in the native language this is the normal schedule of human beings but there are individual differences of course uh then there are case studies of individuals uh especially bilinguals multilinguals children who grow up speaking more than one language which most of us belong to that category we grow up in the philippines bilinguals uh we normally speak the home language and then we speak filipino or tagalog and then if you come from an affluent home you begin with english even as a baby depending on the uh on how often your parents talk to you in that language and depending also on the yaya the child has alright uh then you have uh ethnographic descriptions you know of how language language is used in a community which could be a modern or an ethnic community up in the mountains you know like the kalinga-apayaos and some of the non-low land people who still pretty much live a restricted life alright so uhm now uh depending on the uh uh growth of the discipline and the number of people working in it uh the there is a historian of science whom i who died only about two or three years ago who wrote one of the minor classics of the twentieth century by the name of thomas kuhn you 'll find the book it 's called the structure of scientific revolutions  and uh of course not everybody accepts what he says now but i think basically the outline is still good he says in all the sciences there is what we call a prevailing paradigm where everybody who does that science is expected to follow that paradigm or model of doing things now what happens then is after a while that paradigm shifts you change the model completely but as long as the model is there it 's pretty much assumed by all the practitioners that that 's the way we do psychology that 's the way we do guidance and counseling and there are paradigms you know that 's the way we do things in physics that 's the way we do things in chemistry and so on and so forth the way we do things in child language studies is we make certain assumptions which i call the frame of reference because i don't want to call it a paradigm p a r a d i g m because some people don't feel comfortable with that uh with that term they get confused they get threatened a word that is easier is model a mental model of something or if you want something neutral say so you don't get upset uh frame of reference  when people 's we have a frame of reference for everything  that 's one thing modern psychology and modern cognitive psychology especially has shown us it has tremendous repercussions in philosophy especially what we call epistemology or the theory of knowledge  i don't know if any of you took up epistemology in college well if you went to santo tomas i 'm sure you did chuckle okay and uh the epistemology they teach you at santo tomas uh epistemology they teach you in seminaries the epistemology they teach you in about ninety percent of uh cat catholic colleges or colleges taught by former seminarians is really out of it in other words the paradigm is about one thousand years old and it 's really pass&eacute; but when i was taking epistemology i had to study that when i was i took up epistemology about nineteen fifty-seven nineteen fifty-eight okay uh the there are modern theories we now know more about the theory of knowing that 's what epistemology is how people learn things how people think how people perceive very often what you see is not what is there outside but what you expect to see  and when it comes to approaching reality there is really very little that can be called objective you approach reality uh with the uh the paradigms of your uh discipline  and you have a mental model of everything that you do uh whether in the field of morality in the field of literature in the field of ethics in the field of human relations in how you treat human beings and so forth and so on everything we are inter-subjective people we 're not really objective people  and the thing is unless you obtain a liberal education and you become aware that you think this way because you are what you are because of your history then you think that your point of view is the only point of view that 's valid and you become very narrow-minded  but on the other hand you have the other extreme if you have no center of your own you have no shared convictions then you 're the victim of whoever talks to you last i have met individuals like that they tell you whatever they heard last there is no center part of education is you form your own center and then you judge future encounters against your own center and while your center can continue to evolve it doesn't mean that you pick up every single new idea that comes into the scene uh as if you are a tabula rasa  nobody 's a tabula rasa  you sort of uh eventually uh form your own convictions
