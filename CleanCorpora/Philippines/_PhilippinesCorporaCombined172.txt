at it how long have you had it  uh kasi this happened to me last term and i thought it was when i was wearing headbands so i stopped wearing headbands and it just came back yesterday it was so painful e  it 's painful it 's not itchy it 's painful uh it 's painful parang bukol  this one no no not yan  okay i 'll tell you what you have you have enlarged lymph nodes uh we call it uh in medical parlance we call it lymphadenopathy now in in the local vernacular that 's what you call kulani now do you know what what what 's the reason why it swells up uhm do you know the function of your lymph glands  no the lymph glands are supposed to contain lymphocytes  now what are lymphocytes lymphocytes are supposed to be the soldiers of the body okay you have the white blood cells and the red blood cells remember now the white blood cells and the lymphocytes etcetera etcetera these are the soldiers of the body in other words when there is an infection going on there is an invading or microorganism like the bacteria these soldiers of the body attack the bacteria they fight there 's a war going on  that 's why it swells up there 's a fight going on in that area  that means you 've had an infection in the area near that area have you had any wound near that area no you never had o baka you had a bump in the head or something no in the ear have you had a cold ear infection no it just comes in yeah it just came without any reason there must 've been some infection somewhere the only treatment would be antibiotics if it persists otherwise leave it alone okay okay if it persists for a couple of days then you have to take antibiotics yeah okay otherwise you leave it alone it might disappear in a couple of days i i think it 's a mild infection okay yeah thank you break in recording  you were absent only for one session for the r o t c because of influenza this is your medical certificate since we did not see you i cannot issue my own certificate because i did not see you i cannot certify something i did not see when you were sick i did not see you so we 'll just make do with this certificate of yours i 'll just notate it okay today is the sixteenth you have a p e session today yes you are just recovering from flu so you want to be excused yes i still have a cough and a flu you still have a cough and flu and flu are you on medication already uh yes what medicines biogesic what 's your name jason jimenez jason jimenez jason jimenez break in recording  miss you 're sick what 's your name uhm glorife soberano i beg your pardon glorife soberano glory yes glory soberano glorife glorife yes soberano  what course are you taking   commerce b s a  commerce b s a what year first year freshman what 's your temperature the nurse took your temperature  thirty-nine thirty-nine thirty-nine you have a fever that means you have an infection what do you feel what are your complaints uhm headaches you have a headache what else headaches muscle pain muscular pain muscular pain muscular pain what else uh uhm and uhm i feel extremely hot feverish and you 're sick of school ha  uh i have a cold uh you have a cold you also have a cold okay let me take a look at your throat say ah ah are you coughing uhm a bit a bit  i 'll take a look at your lungs uh turn around your back you have to breathe hard inhale exhale ha  go ahead okay okay  results are okay you have no other signs and symptoms so most probably you have what you have is the flu influenza now let me explain what is influenza influenza is a viral infection  now when you say you have a viral infection there are two connotations okay one connotation is it 's contagious  and that 's the reason why i 'm going to give you a note and you 're supposed to go home to see your doctor okay  now another connotation of influenza would be it means that there is no medicine that can kill the the causative organism the virus because it 's a viral infection therefore the treatment would uh be the treatment is geared only towards alleviating your symptoms if you have a fever take something for fever if you 're coughing take something for cough and uh you have to rest and take plenty of fluids so i 'm sending you home with one slip i 'll give you the slip okay now when you come back get the slip from us i would want to make sure it 's no longer contagious at any rate see your doctor  now sometimes your doctors will give you antibiotics now you may ask why  antibiotics are supposed to kill bacteria not viruses but the reason why your doctor might sometimes give you antibiotic is to prevent bacterial complications that might kill you like bronchopneumonia meningitis okay so by the way the longer you stay in campus the more people will get your disease  so this is the note okay break in recording  i have a sore throat doc you have a sore throat do you think you have the flu just a sore throat have you had your temperature taken by the nurse yes i how how high how high is it  sabi niya sa 'kin thirty-seven it 's thirty-seven eksakto   thirty-seven that 's not a fever probably it 's beginning the beginning of something may i see your throat  say ah is it painful when you swallow  uhm  yes it 's your tonsils that is inflamed sir i have a test i have to get the ano  i should get an excuse you have a test you 're not coughing ha no i 'll just check your lungs i 'll just check your lungs turn around your back have a seat have a seat have a seat just turn you around okay inhale exhale again inhale exhale  breathe  your lungs are okay your tonsils are inflamed and they 're swollen  so most probably you are coming up with an acute tonsillitis now what is it it is supposed to be a bacterial infection now the treatment for that is the antibiotics  we do not carry antibiotics in the clinic so you have to get them yourself so see your doctor ha  and i 'm sure your doctor will prescribe some antibiotics  uh uhm antibiotics  sir in the meantime what you can get from the nurse are lozenges we have some lozenges that will allay the pain how about the certificate certificate for what certificate for what sir i 'll be excused from my quiz in my subject you have one more subject actually i have a class uh you go to your doctor right away ha  sir so would this be valid i don't know an absence is an absence  uh sir how about the although this is uh i suppose this will justify your being absent but you 're still absent yeah yes so you 're going mumbling not clear on tape  yes before you leave you ask for a a lozenge from the nurse ha and then see your doctor right away okay  break in recording  and what and we would like to uh make an interview about uhm the thing the things that uh that surrounds us our health and uhm  word  the common the common layman 's belief is even hepatitis b is ang kamalian nila they think if you have hepatitis b it 's fatal it 's not fatal only less than five percent die of the disease even hepatitis b even hepatitis more so in a a is the mild form usually they 'yon atang pumatay  naku sira yata 'yong ano yong tinape yon ba ewan ko kung yan  it 's not a fatal disease what makes it serious especially hepatitis b is statistics will show you that if you have had hepatitis b especially b ha  although a is included twenty to twenty-five years later twenty-five percent will develop liver cancer or liver cirrhosis these are incurable diseases in other words you die hmmmh so in other words if you have a history of hepatitis a or b more so in b one out of five will develop eventually later in life twenty or thirty years later they will develop liver carcinoma or or uh liver cirrhosis these are fatal diseases so that 's what makes it serious that 's what makes it serious is it incurable not cirrhosis is a liver disease that 's incurable cancer is incurable di ba  cancer is well cancer is curable there 's a com mistaken belief that cancer is not curable cancer is curable but the point is you 've got to catch it at the beginning at the start tumor but usually uh cancer you you only spot it or you discover it when it 's already in the advanced stage benign because usually if it 's beginning you don't exhibit any symptoms so you will not know you have it uh karamihan lang nasi- save na kanser sa babae kasi ang sa babae madaling ma- discover e kagaya ng kanser ng breast nakakapa mo yan kapag may maliit na bukol   ang sa lalaki nasa loob paano mo mapa palagay mo  cancer of the lungs paano mo makakapa kung maliit lang  wala ka namang maramdaman di ba   kaya malalaman mo lang pag malaki na madami ng  symptoms advanced stage  kaya magpapa- physical eksamen yan gagamitin itong kwarto  i could not sleep at night nahihirapan akong huminga  and i have uh had asthma for some time  i had it when i was a child but it recurred about ten years ago then sometime in november i got hospitalized but recently i got better until the last past day uh with regards to your difficulty of breathing now do you have accompanying symptoms like cough fever or sweat uh night chills uh do you have it no uh simple breathing problem  when when you were hospitalized last november what uh laboratory parameters were done to you well i had uh an x-ray and then uh uh i i don't recall if my blood was taken and then i had an x-ray uh huh what was your blood pressure then i think it was normal uh huh but uh i i remember they took my uh my breath a a breathing test maybe they they counted how many times uh what my pulse rate was but i don't recall anymore uh-hmmmh so what was your blood pressure then i think it was normal 'no about a hundred forty to ninety only okay i have to examine your chest   maybe a little less than that   i have to examine your chest right now   less than that  it looks like you 're having some wheezes on your chest so it looks like you 're still having some episodes of asthma  your heart looks okay regular heart beat breathing okay so we 'll still consider this is still an asthma oh i 'll give you what what medications did you take in  what medications   i am taking budesonide initial spray and mouth uh medication like what it 's like a spray budesonide also uh budesonide okay so okay this is what i we will do we 'll recommend you and i 'll write this all here for your instructions so you will do it continue with this and you need
