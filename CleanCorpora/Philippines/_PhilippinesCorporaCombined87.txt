simone de beauvoir who was allegedly mistress of jean paul sartre hmm speaker b laughs  so i was walking with her one day on the champs elysee and i said  ma cherie come with me to see beautiful city

course literature course  starts singing a song full of names of philosophers; speaker b laughs throughout and the rest of this song has been forgotten where 's victor gojocco he went home why why i don't know why don't you know because he doesn't because he didn't tell me why i see  well i don't do you i don't do you call this a discussion i suppose so no it isn't yes it is i think so it is not yes it is it 's not no of course not yes it is come on let 's have a discussion bugger off jimmy stop it stop it victor cool it will you i 'm trying to sip on this coffee how many more minutes to go perhaps now we can begin uh if you feel it is appropriate so jimmy what do you think about this issue that mcintyre talks about in after virtue  interesting that 's a very boring answer jimmy  you 're not risking anything by saying that exciting it 's very boring as well well remember what i told you in the faculty canteen you made me think about something else words  yeah like yeah you know like he starts off by saying by giving out all the examples words  can you speak up please i can't hear you and why there seems to be no standard by which to weigh the rival premise of the other do you remember what i replied to that theory of yours not quite i said it was just a load of senseless drivel speaker b laughs totally incoherent speaker b laughs and absolutely wanting in sense well you see that 's your opinion well that 's that you 're taking the emotivist  position right now jimmy the point is how so how can we say who is right how do we overcome the incommensurability of these uh-hum premises more premises well i think we have to discover the luminon  huh well then we 'll have the rational basis but then again it 's unknown so what the heck right the  luminon aha the luminon is dead the luminon  well no need to drift into this luminon  realm of reality mr guevara yes dr brias i suppose you 're very right about that so where do we drift into oh prof guevara take freudian example you might say we might be drifting back into the coughs excuse me uh but uh jokes aside please continue with your theoretical expos&eacute; but as of now they 're very incoherent which they  my ideas i guess how many more minutes to go hey uh jimmy should i say prof guevara since this is a serious discussion   yes yes dr brias what is it  don't you think that life is beautiful aren't these beautiful feelings so wonderful  don't you just feel like rising up jumping and saying  praise the lord hallelujah i 'm saved  yes i do victor i really do i mean i believe in god you know point well taken speaker b laughs  what a life what do you think jimmy yes but a woman has a right to her own body yeah of course that means if she 's pregnant does she uh does that mean she is permitted to abort the baby that she has ahh good point  you think uh you think that a woman is only as old as the man she feels as a what  i 'll repeat the question you think a woman is only as old as the man she feels  or to say that chauvinistically do you think the man is only as old as the woman he feels i think that is said more appropriately now dr brias i think so hey jimmy could you ask your wife to cut her nails my back 's a mess speaker b laughs  that 's a good joke vic good joke you know jimmy 's wife likes to talk while she has sex so she called him up the other day from her hotel room and then what happened you tell us speaker b laughs  i believe that god is everywhere where everywhere where 's that all around where 's all around in heaven and in hell as st augustine would say  you know   is he in you also i suppose so yeah anyway getting to more serious matters hey leny i hope this thing works for whatever you wanna do with it huh yeah leny i i hope it works well five forty-five i don't think i 'll ever be happy what 's leny taking literature for uh 'cause she likes writing she likes lit she enjoys it she 's studying she 's studying yeah her doctorate program

little woman dying to come out speakers b and c laugh  ahh coffee yes please enough enough did you take marcel in louvain i took valium speaker b laughs and marijuana  speaker b laughs  patty valium

ahh psychosis no not psychosis schizophrenia schizophrenia and uh old victor had this vocabulary so we had to learn it foreign words and then numbers we had numbers uh foreign words  all numbers that 's the only thing i remembered from my first lessons in baluchistani baluchistani and we would go to this bar it was called uh jesus christ what was it called it was called uh uh now i forget i used to hang out in this place called the metropole and it was right across the street it was uh it was really the bar of these uh people from limburgh  and it was really a very packed bar it was uh it was uh old victor would call it a hetero bar you see it 's one of the few bars you could actually go to pick up girls and uh it was kind of funny 'cause uh we would always start speaking baluchistani it was always packed this place was always packed and we would all start speaking baluchistani and then people would always listen to us really yeah they thought we were speaking 'cause you know old victor did it really well like words old victor would throw in flemish old victor was my friend victor van fracken he 's an older guy so i used to call him old vic i was young vic anyway old vic he he
