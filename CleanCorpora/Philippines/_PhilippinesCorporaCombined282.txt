mr president on a speck of land in the blue waters of the mediterranean in the greek island of corfu lies the grave of a young man and on his headstone is carved the epitaph i want nothing i fear nothing i am free  and when i was in the military stockade of the dictator where i spent almost five years of my life exacerbated by having to listen day in and day out on radio and television to pompous and pontificating propagandists spew forth lie after lie half truth after half truth phrases like sa ikauunlad ng bayan disiplina ang kailangan or there is not a single political prisoner in this country i found courage and inspiration from the words of the great mahatma gandhi who said the first condition of freedom is freedom from fear  and it was only then and when i was able to inten internalize this dictum that i began to realize that prison bars do not enslave a man it is his fears that do man 's most basic instinct is the instinct for survival and corollary to that man 's greatest fear is the fear of destruction of death thus it became my personal program to face the issue of dying and the fear of death first i came to acknowledge that life is a matter of trade-offs and that there were certain things in life which are so unendurable unbearable that death or the risk of dying would be preferable the immortal ninoy aquino was able to capsulize this powerful feeling in a single sentence when he declared i would rather die on my feet like a man than continue to live on bended knees like a slave and it was this precept which spurred my cellmate geny and i to go on a hunger strike in november nineteen seventy-four to demand the release of political prisoners and when one thousand and twenty-four detainees were given their release on december fourth geny and i broke our fast the hunger strike lasted for ten days and it was this belief this passion to be free that on september thirty nineteen seventy-seven gave us the courage to risk death and undertake a daring escape from the maximum security unit of fort bonifacio mr president during the past several months the filipino people have been bombarded with half truths and outrageous lies wittingly or unwittingly by pro-v f a propagandists quarter page ads in news dailies had been paid by whose monies we still do not know to instill fear in the filipino people that the nation now faces the immediate threat of an invasion by chinese hordes from the mainland as proof they cited the construction of a small unsightly building on a tiny atoll one hundred and thirty-five miles from the shores of palawan a building that is so small that it would be unable to contain a garrison of more than fifty soldiers in cramped fashion the presence of a tiny chinese garrison on mischief reef combined with the passage by the national people 's congress of a law declaring that the entire south china sea belongs to china has been utilized with a limited amount of success i must admit to cause a number of filipinos to support the return of american soldiers modified by the vague and nebulous adjective  visiting forces  the visiting forces agreement is necessary the proponents say to operationalize the mutual defense treaty of nineteen fifty-one they insist that our soldiers need to be trained by american soldiers in the use of the latest state-of-the-art weaponry as if the philippines could afford to buy destroyers and frigates and submarines and laser-guided bombs delivered by f eighteen hornets or f sixteen falcons p three orion planes anti-submarine patrol helicopters tomahawk cruise missiles hawkeye missiles and much much less an intercontinental ballistic missile or maybe a fourth-hand aircraft carrier because this is what it will take to stop a chinese invasion or even neutralize them in the spratlys roughly i estimate in my amateur defense way one hundred billion u s dollars it is like your neighbor teaching you how to drive a ferrari but when you go home you have no ferrari in your garage to drive the proponents have continuously and loudly alleged that the presence of the chinese on mischief reef constitutes a clear and present danger to the free and unhampered passage of commercial ships in the area and to the security of the east asian region even while the u s assistant secretary of state for east asian and pacific affairs otherwise known as america 's point man in asia mr stanley roth declared in davo switzerland only last february nineteen ninety-nine that and i quote mr roth it is important not to overstate the situation referring to the spratlys dispute between manila and beijing while at the same time not to underestimate the need to get some resolution  there has been a lot of publicity recently which might suggest that freedom of navigation is at risk because of new construction by chinese at mischief reef in fact the building is in no way a fundamental threat to security   and i repeat mr roth said this the building on mischief reef is in fact no way a fundamental threat to security  the fact is that the united states navy transits the region all the time it is disappointing that china chose to build he said  it appears to be at odds with commitments they have given the philippines previously and certainly with a notion of resolving by peaceful means the many disputed claims  the proponents of the v f a have continuously pounded away at us their belief that the mutual defense treaty must now be strengthened by the approval of the v f a in order to provide our country with the security shield that will protect us from china in spite of the fact that the mutual defense treaty does not repeat not contain an automatic retaliatory clause in case the philippines is attacked that it is in fact an empty promise which american propagandists have used to their advantage for forty-eight years to gain concessions from the filipinos indeed only last week the pentagon 's equivalent of assistant secretary roth break in recording the commander-in-chief of all u s armed forces in the pacific better known as cincpac admiral dennis blair declared in singapore that the v f a and i quote in his thinking it is not a security guarantee or a big signal on the issues mentioned i have repeatedly maintained that the proponents of the v f a have been making promises on behalf of the americans and have been exaggerating the danger posed by a tiny chinese garrison at mischief reef or by the commitment of the united states to come to the defense of our country if and when attacked it would seem to me and to many that if the proponents of the v f a utilized these arguments in america they would be laughed out of the united states senate the officials of various departments who testified during the hearings have maintained that because the philippines has not had to invoke the mutual defense treaty in the past is proof enough that the m d t has been effective and one official even said that even if the philippines is able to bluff the chinese that the possibility alone i 'm not talking about probability but possibility alone that the u s might might come to our assistance because of the fact that we have the m d t should be enough to deter the chinese from engaging in more aggressive actions in the spratlys well the candid comments of admiral blair threw off any pretense of u s intentions although ambassador hubbard was quick to deny that uhm that admiral blair did not say what admiral blair indeed said and how else do we did we expect ambassador hubbard to react admiral blair up to now has not corrected his statement last week in my turno en contra i like the small boy in the hans christian andersen tale declared the emperor has no clothes today as i listen to the various explanations of votes by our distinguished colleagues i could not but come to the conclusion that the chinese know we are bluffing that we know that the chinese know we are bluffing but that we hope that the filipino people do not know that the chinese know that we are bluffing about the m d t but as a philosopher once said in war truth is the first casualty and since the proponents of the v f a have engendered in our people the fear of impending war with china all logic reason common sense and balanced judgment have been thrown out the window the problem i have always maintained is not whether we should operationalize the m d t but whether america has a real commitment to our defense the problem also is whether v f a costs too much in terms of our national dignity and honor the debate is not over the need to maintain security alliances with friendly countries like the united states or australia or the united kingdom or france or canada but to maintain such alliances while maintaining our self-respect it is the responsibility of the senate comprised of only twenty-three men and women elected at large to play a countervailing role to the executive department in matters of treaties it is our role to play the bad cop to the executive 's good cop i possess some amount of sympathy for the members of the executive department who have been bullied by almighty america into ratifying such a one-sided agreement the pressure must have been tremendous our pending structural adjustment loans from the world bank the approvals of the i m f for our financial plans loans from the asian development bank our sugar and garment quotas must have been bashed over the heads of our leaders and as lyndon baines johnson so aptly described his philosophy if you 've got them by the balls their minds and hearts will follow  and i guess our decision is now limited to two options to either have our balls fondled by the americans or crushed by the chinese but as the revered nationalist and former light of the senate jose w diokno once asked if we have to give up our virtue can we not at least check if their dollar is counterfeit i had also asked the senate not as an eleventh hour excuse to derail the v f a but to protect our children in pampanga and zambales our distinguished colleague the senator from batangas and antique has already articulated the heartaches and the miseries that toxic and hazardous wastes have caused are causing and will continue to cause poor families most of them already victims of mount pinatubo 's lahar over twenty thousand families have lived in the cabcom  evacuation center for an average of one to four years and considerable harm from toxic and hazardous wastes had been done to them especially to pregnant women the americans did not even inform the philippine authorities of potential risk of water contem contamination if they had only warned us many deaths could have been prevented and so many lives would not have been destroyed because we would not have allowed the evacuees to occupy that particular area in clark earlier the distinguished senator from laguna from cagayan i 'm sorry repeated the final lines of our national anthem and perhaps in honor of all past present and future victims of toxic wastes especially the innocent children we should rephrase our anthem silang mamatay nang dahil sa kano  in concurring in the ratification of the v f a we are waiving the rights of our children to a happy and healthy life in the future the senate can still prevent this by using the v f a to get the united states of america to own up to their moral responsibility to make things right and to prevent more children being born mentally retarded with physical deformities with cancer leading to a life of misery and a painful death let not the u s continue to bluff us into believing that trade and investment will suffer if the v f a is not concurred in by the senate it was after the bases were closed in nineteen ninety-two that investments in our country grew by leaps and bounds nobody in the senate has so far disputed those statistics the american businessman my friends like any investor will go anywhere where he can make a profit regardless of what his government policies are in america my friends it is the businessmen and not the politicians who dictate policy i have read much researched much studied much analyzed much in preparing for the v f a debates i have tried to perform my duty as a senator of the republic as god gives me the light to see that duty i wish to express my appreciation to the leadership of this chamber who have conducted proceedings with fairness dignity and decorum and also to the distinguished sponsors and co-sponsor who have been kind patient and understanding i 've been privileged to interact with all of you but i must vote no to a one-sided agreement that is an insult to our national honor and which will remove from us the one single trump card that will save thousands of children in pampanga and zambales as a statesman once said i would rather lose in a cause that i know someday will triumph than to triumph in a cause that i know someday will fail  it is obvious to us that the concurrence of the senate in the ratification of the v f a is inevitable and if we were to take the path of least resistance we may perhaps follow the advice of a former secretary of foreign affairs who said  if rape is inevitable relax and enjoy it  but mr president the senate has no right to make that answer on behalf of filipino women and children and i shall not relax and enjoy i shall continue to fight for our people especially women and children for the right to live lives of dignity and good health if not happiness the scottish philosopher thomas carlyle was once asked by one of his students if you could encapsulate the wisdom of the ages in one sentence how would that sentence read  carlyle thought for a few minutes and he answered i cannot give it to you in one sentence but i can give it to you in four and they are one whom the gods wish to destroy they first make mad two the bee pollinizes the flower that it steals the honey from three the wheels of justice grind exceedingly slow but they grind exceedingly fine and four it is only when it gets dark enough that you can see the stars  and at this beginning of another benighted period in our country 's history i shall take time from now on to peer up into the heavens to look at the stars because to me they are the filipino children thank you mr president
