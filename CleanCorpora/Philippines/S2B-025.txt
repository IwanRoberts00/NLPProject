may it please the honorable chief justice and the honorable
members of the impeachment tribunal  i will take only  five minutes or
so simply to draw attention to certain legal propositions which i take to be
relevant to the controversy at bar and certain political dimensions attending
the same
""
and i will do this by way of laying the predicate for the
presentation in chief of former solicitor-general mendoza my esteemed
colleague
""
many of us here present will doubtless recall the story of a man of
ancient rome named julius caesar whom the masses admired and wanted to be the
head of their nation
""
he was assassinated by a group of plotters who considered him unfit
to rule
""
those plotters by spreading rumor and gossip had poisoned the minds
of the people against him
""
they said julius caesar was ambitious avaricious corrupt and they
enlisted the aid of well-meaning citizens like the noble-minded brutus who
was deluded into believing the sly insinuations of the plotters and had thus
come to think that caesar was indeed unfit to rule
""
and so julius caesar was slain
""
caesar 's friend mark antony having learned of the conspiracy and
how easily the people had been made to believe the lies and innuendoes of the
conspirators was moved to cry out as he mourned caesar 's death  oh
judgment thou art fled to brutish beasts and men have lost their reason
""
""
today two thousand years after that tragic event we take part in
these impeachment proceedings to pass judgment on another leader joseph
ejercito estrada a man also admired by his countrymen who had elected him by
an overwhelming majority to the highest office of the land
""
we are here to determine whether he should continue to lead the
nation as its president
""
but unlike in julius caesar 's case we are assured that in this
forum judgment will not flee to brutish beasts and reason will not be lost
but will attend every aspect and incident of these proceedings
""
for in the many centuries that have passed from julius caesar 's
time to ours principles and tenets have developed and come to be engraved in
every enlightened society foremost among which is that the guilt or innocence
of a person accused of some wrong shall be determined not by passion or
prejudice nor hearsay or rumor but by such evidence as the universal
experience of mankind accepts as satisfactory proof of facts presented in
accordance with procedures that best conduce to full and free ventilation of
a controversy and ultimately to a fair and honest judgment
""
it is our good fortune that in the course of time and in the full
fruition of human wisdom definite rules and standards for conducting trials
and hearings as well as for determining all questions of evidence including
questions of its materiality relevancy competency have been formulated and
met with general acceptance in democratic states and that these specific
norms have been adopted in our country
""
it is our good fortune that this country of ours is governed by a
constitution and a set of laws that guarantee to every person the fundamental
right to due process and other inviolable human rights and otherwise command
full commitment to the rule of law
""
it is in light of these familiar norms and precepts which we are
certain this honorable impeachment tribunal will uphold and apply that the
respondent the president of the philippines now confidently faces his
accusers
""
by your leave and with many thanks for your kind attention i now
ask my colleague atty estelito p mendoza to outline the case for the
respondent 
""
""
""
mr president my fellow senators prime minister indira gandhi
of india once said  you cannot shake hands with clenched fist 
""
the issue of the v f a or the visiting forces agreement boils down
to whether it is in our country 's interest to continue its good working
relations with the united states on the matter of defense and security
""
how each of us will cast our vote will send a clear signal whether
or not we as a people have set aside and put behind us the emotions and hurt
that were felt during the nineteen ninety-one military bases debates
""
are we now ready with maturity objectivity to address our present
and future security needs as a democratic society in partnership with another
democratic society
""
decision-making involves more than the inputs of the debates we
have gone through though they have helped us gain viable knowledge from my
experience and  profound colleagues  as elected officials seek the
opinion of the people whom we respect and we serve
""
more often the inclination of society would be a good basis to
start the process
""
decision-making requires a broader perspective
""
that is why we had the plaza miranda during the nineteen fifties
that is why we have the respected social weather stations surveys and other
polling groups of our generation to enable us to listen to and appreciate
social and political issues
""
 vox populi vox dei 
""
our democratic society dictates that the voice of our people the
silent majority the average filipino the ordinary juan should serve as the
light that would guide our path in arriving at a decision such as this
""
a recent survey by the s w s gives us some enlightenment on the
real sentiments of our fellow filipinos
""
according to the survey conducted from march one to nineteen this
year more than half or fifty percent fifty-six percent of the respondents
strongly feel that the mutual defense treaty of nineteen fifty-one with the
united states is still appropriate
""
furthermore eighty percent of the pro-mutual defense treaty
respondents approved of the visits of the american forces to the philippines
for joint military exercises
""
these statistics indicate that the v f a has gained more popular
support since it became a vital national security issue in the light of
recent regional security concerns
""
our country has been host to a number of similar although low
profile visits by armed forces personnel of other countries especially those
of our asean friends
""
we have not heard any objections to such visits
""
but now that the president president estrada and his administration
seek senate approval for such a simple request to strengthen our external
defense we hear many oppositions
""
we find nothing wrong with this as it is the democratic way and
freedom of expression truly works well in our society
""
the american society is not a stranger to us filipinos
""
i do not wish to delve into the issue of how and why almost two
point five million filipinos have migrated to north america during the
greater part of this waning century nor should i again state that our country
tops all other asian countries in the number of immigrants to the u s every
year
""
may i digress briefly to read into the record that in our own
country in our trade and commerce that the philippines benefits from trade
with the united states
""
let me read into the record also that the u s is the 
philippines'  top export market
""
in nineteen ninety-eight last year the u s bought thirty-four
percent of the total philippine exports to the whole globe more than double
what japan bought from us with japan 's share at fifteen percent or less than
half
""
for nineteen ninety-eight the philippine surplus with the u s
totaled five point two billion dollars
""
that 's the trade surplus that means in our favor
""
that 's much higher than in nineteen ninety-seven surplus of three
billion dollars
""
this demonstrates that the philippines continues to be a very
successful competitor in the world 's most competitive market and that is the
united states
""
the five point two billion dollars trade deficit the u s had with
the philippines in nineteen ninety-eight is our thirteenth largest bilateral
trade deficit up from sixteenth in nineteen ninety-seven
""
by comparison the u s deficit with malaysia ranked number eight
thailand number nine and indonesia number eleven
""
the philippines ranks in fourteenth place as a supplier of u s
imports ahead of hong kong indonesia brazil and all european countries except
germany the united kingdom italy and france
""
philippine exports to the u s are growing much faster than
philippine exports to japan
""
in nineteen ninety-eight philippine exports to the u s were up over
sixteen percent compared to the same period in nineteen ninety-seven
""
by contrast exports to japan from the philippines were up only
three percent as against sixteen percent to the u s
""
high tariffs in japan are barriers to important philippine exports
such as fish and forest products
""
let me also mr president read to the record of filipinos who have
made a successful entry into u s politics
""
of course among these we know that the nephew of our colleague here
senator tito guingona michael guingona was mayor of daly city i think until
last year
""
i think michael guingona was born in the philippines grew up in the
philippines and went to the u s and became mayor of daly city the 
pinoy  town in uh outside of san francisco
""
then we had the governor benjamin cayetano of hawaii the state
senator robert bunda state legislator of hawaii and then lorraine inouye
state legislator of hawaii
""
then we have the state representatives john amores he must be from
zambales state legislator of werst west virginia david valderama of maryland
vilma viloria of washington ron menor of hawaii and some others
""
pete fajardo mayor of carlson city california henry manayan mayor
milpitas california teresita santiago must be a niece of uh miriam
defensor-santiago of delano california joventino fajardo glendale heights
illinois and various city councilors
""
i 'm mentioning these mr president because it shows you what kind
of society the united states is
""
it is a society of immigrants
""
it allows even foreign-born but already u s citizens to run for
public office and this doesn't happen here
""
also mr president in terms of manufacturing in the philippines
there is a report by the american chamber of commerce as of nineteen
ninety-seven the multinational companies contributed one hundred sixty-four
billion pesos to the philippine economy and had forty-five thousand three
hundred eighty-four employees each with an average annual income of three
hundred seventy thousand pesos
""
now of course these are just words you can say
""
but what is the problem of the country mr president
""
it 's economic
""
there are so many poor people in this country
""
maybe that 's why people are going all over the place and just
doing their demo because they have nothing better to do
""
but we cannot hold that against them it 's part of democracy
""
the  bangko sentral ng pilipinas  reported that u s
based filipinos continue to remit annually the largest amount of dollars from
overseas helping to prop up our gross national product to respectable levels
""
in global trade as i mentioned earlier we continue to ship
thirty-four percent of our exports to america
""
our fellow filipinos have likewise found their place in the united
states armed forces
""
there are currently ten thousand filipinos in the armed forces of
the united states
""
and right here in our own country seven thousand filipino u s
veterans have retired in their own old country
""
in the field of higher education many of  elec  of our
elected and appointed officials received their training in that country of
many opportunities
""
despite occasional strains and stresses mr president which after
all are present in all basic relationships our two countries continue to
manage good working relations with each other
""
why then can't we keep a positive attitude and confidence in our
own future
""
why do we choose to nurture our imaginary fears and pessimisms
""
let us give our officials in the executive department headed by our
president and the cabinet the opportunity to protect and preserve the
sovereignty of our people
""
i know all of them will rise to this great challenge
""
alliances and strategic partnerships are the way to go as we enter
the new century
""
countries that reject this policy will be the have-nots of the
twenty-first century
""
and finally mr president i vote strongly  yes 
for the approval of the v f a knowing that a strong regional alliance with
other democratic countries anchored on interdependence will signal our firm
determination to preserve peace and security in our region
""
thank you
""
 mabuhay ang ating bayan
