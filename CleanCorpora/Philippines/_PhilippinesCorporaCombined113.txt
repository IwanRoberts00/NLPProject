what we should do this morning is to just recap what we had discussed last meeting uhm arrive at some form of synthesis as to the the interests the leading interests of adolescents so probably what i can do is add more to what we have shared we had an interesting sharing last meeting about concerns and interests of adolescents uhm and i think predominant in our sharing last time was uhm  what was it uhm boy-girl relationships that particular area has been shared with i mean shared about extensively as well as parental overprotectiveness as far as that area is concerned now it leads me to another interest another leading interest of adolescents which is self-direction and in that area okay in that area we have expressed some of our major concerns for example uhm let me just go through uhm some of the uhm expressions of uh assertiveness of adolescents and uh i think uh one of the ways by which we one of the forms by which we express that assertion is our demand that we have privacy as far as males our males are concerned our private properties laughter are concerned our desire to be allowed to use the telephone and no extension no extension lines being opened when we are on the phone okay we we assert this and this is part of our desire to be i mean desire for self regulation okay so if this is not respected by parents it can become an area of dispute a source of dispute alright one other way by which i think this was shared last time one other area by which we ex we express our assertiveness is in the choice of our activities okay choice of our activities choice of companions choice of course vocation okay uh where we would like to go to school education and again if this is if this is uh not respected by parents or if parents encroach on this it becomes a source of an area of irritant as far as uh parent-child relationships are concerned this was mentioned last time okay uh another area which i think you also experience but which was not shared at all last time is the freedom to use your allowance the way you want okay is that still uh is that still uh what looked into by your parents do they do they investigate how you use your allowance at least that much i think many of you experience freedom greater freedom to spend your allowance the way you want to alright the wish for your own room okay di ba  and then the desire to lock it when you want to and open it when you want to di ba  yes rachel long question but microphone didn't catch it, about sharing a room with a sibling  okay so you 're saying that that 's a good a good way by which you can establish or foster better relationships with siblings  and uh well uh of course not sharing it with parents and i think that 's a uh sharing your room with parents at the adolescent stage is i think out of the question it 's unhealthy and uh you wouldn't want to do that laughter  okay alright one other way by which we we assert assert our our desire for self-regulation is uh yeah this was shared last time we feel very much distrusted if we feel very much distrusted if they ask us where are you going with whom are you going and uh where will you be going okay what time are you coming back okay uh in other words bottom-line the adolescent is saying trust me so that i can i can manage myself better if you don't trust me then all the more probably i will foul up okay so adolescence really is a time where we are most concerned about managing ourselves and testing the grounds for self-regulation just a minute teresa and if these are not allowed by parents then you have a rebel in your house yes just like uhm rooming in words sa  family namin words mom i have this party to go to 3 words i 'm gonna wear this dress  laughter  including that oo lahat set out lahat  okay  o sige  alright in other words you 're saying that uh if all the information all the data needed by your parents are already provided for or provided by you then it makes uh it provides 1 word  it will assure you words still  nasa 1 word ka na   1 word ka na of 'no  being given information okay let us add some more input these were the things shared last time 'no  let us add some some other leading interests and concerns and maybe you can check it out whether this really was a concern of yours uh primary and foremost is appearance isn't it okay adolescents are very concerned about appearance because from experience you know that it is a major factor in what in being accepted by others so there is this concern as to how you look uh body build skin complexion uh breath how you smell laughter okay isn't it uh also uh following latest fashion and style in fact you know some some adolescents uh worry a lot about you know being in  you see that adolescent culture can exert a lot of pressure on us don't you experience that what to wear uh if i wear this i am i feel i think i look baduy and i 'd rather not so there are two there are two courses of action one either one will withdraw or exert a lot of effort go go through uh a lot of uh maybe go out of your way to really be in  as far as your crowd is concerned what else what are other concerns as far as appearance is concerned body measurements i was talking about it legs waist arms di ba if you 're tall or short or things of that kind hair on the body you know so girls in particular go through a lot of inconvenience just so they will be good-looking okay one case in point those of you who wear braces di ba it 's such an inconvenient uh what is that it 's such an inconvenient appurtenance you know uh but i know of somebody who has been wearing braces for thirteen years some reactions from the students  thirteen thirteen more than two years now who has who wears braces here who can tell us do you know that who wears braces  dati wala na  uh anna how was it three years three years ano lang 'yon corrective  lang ano  okay lovelyn uh giselle laughter  how many years three and a half three and a half was it fun laughter okay that 's a case in point you know uh it 's you know you go out of your way to a lot through a lot of  nagsa suffer i mean a lot of inconvenience so your teeth will look nice okay uh and also a lot of expense laughter very expensive but but be but because you know there is a lot of premium attached to good looks uhm in other words one major obsession of adolescents is looks what about the guys what what are the what are the what are the concerns of the guys as far as as far as appearance is concerned oh don't tell me vic you are not interested in uh following fads and teenage what do you call that teenage fashion laughter  you did not think about it never thought of it with all your friends student answers but inaudible   ha  nothing out of the ordinary anyway uh this this is a major area of concern and worry of adolescents you want to look good you want to be accepted and you want to be you want to be uhm have a nice appearance because it is at this time that the opposite sex is also another major area of interest all right appearance i don't think there is any question about it all of us have gone i have gone through that you 're going through it and uh it is uh for me a an established fact now second another area of interest check this out uhm creative self-expression did you at one point write poems students answer in chorus  yes no laughter  uh going back now try to read your poems that you have written you know how okay poems uh letter writing uh stor short story writing and uh well another another outlet for self expression is the diary uh the diary now so do you think this is a lot okay let me put it this way a lot of creative work of adolescents are mainly attempts at self-expression emotional self-expression rather than sheer talent do you agree do you agree all of you did it 'no all of you went through it now do you think that you have talent laughter  there is the talent that really uh the real thing actually this is uhm our creative work our creative writings are of course indications of cognitive maturation okay they are signals you know they are signs that we are going through the cognitive maturation phase but at the same time it is serving us a very important function and that is emotional expression now do you ever wonder uh you have a question there rosa okay do you ever wonder why you also talk a lot during this stage adolescence particularly the early adolescence there is so much you know talking you just you know when you see friends parang you can't stop talking why there is just so much to talk about well again this is one form of expressing oneself when you talk on the phone it 's just endless and you know to the dismay of parents parents you know uh get very much irritated get very much uh uh pissed you know by by burning telephone lines but of course if you look at it from the perspective of emotional expression you know developing conversational skills and the like which is a need and interest of adolescents then perhaps parents can become more understanding about this now uh do you also wonder why televiewing okay is a very important occupation preoccupation movie going alright uh some did did some did you listen also to soap operas  laughter okay okay soap operas now what what is the function of this well do do you know what the function of it watching television romantic stories etcetera etcetera word i recall watching soap operas words they are able to distinguish the good and bad side of it well okay the good and bad side of it but you know we 're talking of adolescents what is the what is the function performed or played by this uh by watching television you know you like you like going to the movies it 's a very important activity a primary activity in fact why ina do you see what this is you know do you know that this is also a form of ventilation for adolescents a form of ventilation when you see let 's say your problems being acted out here you know by uh by by sharon cuneta by sheryl cruz and the like laughter  or uh you know uh on television for example manilyn reynes on uh  young love sweet love  you know that is one form by one way by which you can express yourself emotionally well it is not expression in the real sense of uh the term but it is one way of ventilating things that are already being experienced by the adolescent okay all right uhm a question from a student not caught on tape oh vocation choice of a course yes this again is one very important interest and concern of the adolescent maybe at this point you have made a decision already have you are you settled in the course that you are in or you 're still entertaining second thoughts about continuing on in the course or wanting to shift to some other you know some other uh areas of specialization it 's not uncommon though you know to hear of some some teenagers who in their second year have not at this at that point decided on a course i have seen adolescents who move from one course to the other fortunately probably for you here in la salle it 's not easy to shift okay it 's not easy they don't make it easy for you but in some other universities you know you can shift from one course to the other so that many are in the university for several years without finishing a course because they move from one they shift from one course to another i know of some people who even in their third year fourth year are still not happy about the course they landed in mainly probably because of the lack of intelligent decision-making process or lack of assistance you know in the in the uh decision-making process for a for a course 1
