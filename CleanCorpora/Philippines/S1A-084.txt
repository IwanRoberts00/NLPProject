""
""
 we are known   for the
""
""
the   the bread 
""
""
 the bread   known as   what do you call this 
""
""
  monay ba-y   
""
""

""
""

""
""
so that 's where they cook all the donuts uh around metro manila
""

""
""
uh uhm they uh produce all those dunkin donuts uhm only here  sa  only here in laguna for different stores that they have
""
""
i see

so you go home every day   and the  traffic in los ba&ntilde;os i think is really very bad uh
""
""

""
""
like that   and 
""
""
 by   the way uh you studied in uhm metro manila or in uhm
""
""
i studied at f e u far eastern   university 
""
""
 okay  
""
""
in recto in manila
""
""
do you so you you you what do you  board   boarded  there or what
""
""
 yeah  
""
uhm i used to live in a dormitory   when  i was in college
""
""
 okay  
""
i see
""
well when i was in college i lived with my parents and uh by the way i i took up uh engineering   industrial  engineering
""
""
 where  
""
""
at uh la salle one of those uh
""
""
la salle
""
""
 laughter  why you have uh a notion for la sallites or   what 
""
""
 uhm   well-off uh students  laughter 
""
  you 're known  for that  laughter 
""
""
 well   not really
""
uh   it 's not 
""
""
 and i   i remember when we 're fighting for the u a a p  laughter 
""
  uh uhm 
""
""
 well   uh my time was n c a a so
""
""
n c a a  laughter 
""
""
so you probably could guess how old i am  laughter 
""
""
uhm so during my time  laughter 
""
""
okay
""
""
uhm u a a p
""
so when we 're cheering for f e u   the  la sallites would just simply tell us that our tuition fees are your allowances  laughter 
""
""
 uh-huh  
""
oh come on
""
i don't think that 's the case probably 'cause in i in engineering uh where i belong   uh  really most of our classmates came from the  deep  provinces
""
""
 uh uhm  
""
uh uhm
""
""
you know but sometimes meaning well-off probably they have some a few cattle and
""
""
 hacienda   laughter 
""
""
no no no not a  hacienda  probably a small piece of land
""
the usual uh townspeople with you know a few square meters of land that they they till
""
""
  okay 
""
""
 and   it 's always a joke during uhm semester payments that oh my father has has to sell     you know a cow in order to you know
""
that 's the normal joke among those   people  from batangas  a beeping sound  especially with the oops that 's my cellphone
""
""
 uh uhm  
""
 uh uhm  
""
""
excuse me uhm are cellphones uh a fad here still a fad or what
""
""
yeah it is  laughter  and most of the teenagers uh have them
""
""
really it 's
""
""
when you when you ride a jeepney when you look at the right side or the left side they use to  laughter  hold this a little gadget and sometimes they smile sometimes
""
""
is it   still 
""
""
 they are   shocked
""
""
is it still a fad or is it a it 's becoming a social status or or a necessity
""
""
uhm i don't think it 's a necessity for youth
""
""
for the youth
""
""
yeah
""
""
well actually it could be a monitoring device of the parents  speaker b laughs  that 's one reason why why these people have it
""
some
""
""
but they can off the cell
""
""
yes but of course they must have a very good reason why they switch it off
""
 oth  otherwise it should be kept open and uh it should be always on  waiting for messages or calls
""
""
there are so many alibis of the youth  laughter  when it comes to gimmicks so i don't think the parents can use that for   a monitoring device 
""
""
 do you   do you go on gimmicks i mean here in this area
""
""
me
""
  uhm 
""
""
 so   what 's the new place here or what
""
""
there are several uh   places  that you can
""
""
 jers  
""

""
""

""
""

""
""
 uh uhm  
""
two  hun  two hundred
""
""
but it 's i think consumable
""
but still uhm i haven't been to the place
""
uh we dropped by but uh when we learned that there was a two hundred cover charge we backed off and settled for well i not really cheaper place but somewhere uh a place that you know you you don't have to pay cover charge
""
""

""
""
well actually i live in makati
""
""
in makati
""
""
yes   uh 
""
""
 and   you  u  you used to go here   in calamba 
""
""
 no   i i work here
""
i work in   canlubang  so most of my officemates uh it 's part of my job  'no  i 'm i 'm with h r
""
""
 okay  
""
h r
""
""
it 's my or one of my responsibilities to look around uh where are the places that people can go so where are the  peo  uh where are the places where people should not go
""
""
okay
""
""
so
""
""
so you 're really interested in people
""
""
well uh as part of my job i uh i have to have interest
""
it 's not uh a requirement that i follow it 's more of that uh i enjoy uh not really meddling into people 's lives but i i would like them to uhm watchacall this uh to do what they like to do
""
okay 'cause some people they like to do something but uh it 's very hard for them to do it 'cause uh they don't know how to do it
""
""
uh uhm so what do you find uhm interesting or uh what is the best thing in uh people management
""
""
well uh it 's a very nice question
""
uh the best thing i would say uh well they have different problems
""
""
yeah
""
""
they have different priorities
""
uh there are different ways to make them smile
""
you know like like texting you know some
""
""
oh
""
""
some people laugh at these types of joke
""
""
okay
""
""
you know you don't know you don't see why  the  why it 's funny or what
""
""
okay
""
so you find it uhm uh interesting to know the uniqueness of a   human being   laughter 
""
""
 wow really  ha   
""
it might get developed  ha   laughter 
""
well to in a sense   it 's uh 
""
""
 the   individuality
""
""
yes 'cause each person has his own idiosyncrasies and uh each person has uh well you say the likes and dislikes
""
""
yeah
""
""
it 's very basic  'no  but uhm what i 've learned through my years of being in h r is that there are ways to  cough  excuse me to get to people uhm there there there are different ways
""
each person has a different   approach 
""
""
 okay  
""
so can you cite some ways that you have learned before
""
""
some ways well there 's some people that uh you ask about their family and you know
""
""
yes
""
""
suddenly they they 'll open up something about work or about a suggestion
""
uh i believe in bonding
""
""
bonding
""
""
yeah
""
you have to bond with people and uh well like like for example now you know there 's a certain level of bonding that uh we 're doing
""
""
really  laughter 
""
""
 laughter  it doesn't mean anything but uh i 'm not a a psychologist actually i
""
""
you graduated as
""
""
i graduated as industrial engineering
""
""
okay   sorry i forgot 
""
""
 but my   industrial management engineering   it 's a  management engineering type and uh well we have subjects about uh human behavior and uh
""
""
 i see  
""
sociology perhaps
""
""
well all those -ologies and everything  speaker b laughs  but uh the most important in the one i remember was on human behavior
""
""
human behavior
""
""
'cause uh basic human behavior is like uh hand gestures the hand gestures and the the the eye contacts   and everything 
""
""
 eye contacts  
""
""
like you you have very good eye contact  speaker b laughs 
""
sometimes you you know i i get bothered when people have very direct eye contact
""
""
why
""
""
uh i don't know
""
maybe something 's wrong with my face or something 's  laughter 
""
""
oh
""
but do you find it uhm sincere and honest when people look at you straight in the eyes  laughter 
""
""
yeah but uh i like it the other way around that i i look uh
""
""
look at your nose look at your  laughter 
""
""
i like it the other way around that you know i i 'm the one looking at the person
""
""
but how can the person respond   naka   uh
""
""
if uh well i don't know it it 's different uh sometimes uh people are more comfortable not looking
""
there 's some people that are more comfortable looking
""
""
but i learned from a friend that when you talk to someone it is ethical to look at their eyes direct
""
""
uh well of course yes to show your sincerity it 's very basic but sometimes staring  speaker b laughs  too much uh you know you 'd  glan  there 's what you call glance a stare and uh i don't know
""
but but most of the people i talk to uh i look at their eyes
""
but of course to show some respect sometimes i i glance away it 's actually a sign of respect glancing away
""
""
a sign of respect
""
""
yes
""
""
okay
""
""
it 's not a sign of uh indifference
""
it 's more of a sign of respect like especially if you look downwards
""
if you look upwards that that 's a sign of disrespect  laughter 
""
okay
""
anyway so what what do you do on sundays i mean   if you 're not  working or what
