""
""
and we can tell this by the amount of mud flying in all directions
""
some are smarter than others according to the book
""
some are also meaner than others judging from the amount of black propaganda that has surfaced in recent days
""
tonight uh to evaluate the campaign and the election in its final stages we have representatives of three leading presidential contenders
""
we have maribel ongpin representing the people 's reform party and miriam defensor santiago we have vic limlingan representing the  laban ng demokratikong pilipino  and house speaker ramon mitra and we have congressman jose de venecia representing  lakas  edsa and uh defense secretary fidel ramos
""
maribel excuse me for being ungallant but we will begin with the gentlemen because
""
""
okay it 's fine with me
""
""
we have a hot topic with congressman de venecia who will tell us about the  batasan  the  batasan  raid last saturday
""
joe what happened and what 's going to happen now
""
""
actually i was in pangasinan just completed a rally at dawn and then i got a call from congressman amante and from raffy alunan to come to manila from pangasinan because they received a very hot tip from one of the employees of the congress printing press that uh millions of sample ballots and propaganda materials of speaker mitra were being printed there and they wanted us to go because we are members of the house and we could make a quick inspection
""
and i said okay i 'll come along so i came to manila went with congressman amante of agusan and congressman lopez of manila to the  batasan  to find out if it is if it 's true that uh these things are happening there
""
besides it is our moral obligation and our legal duty to do so because these are funds of the republic of the people and when we went there we asked permission from the two guards who were there if we could enter
""
they reluctantly agreed after about fifteen minutes
""
""
they agreed so this was not a raid uh barging into a   premise that 's closed 
""
""
 no no   we 're gentlemen congressmen we are members of the house
""
this is our house this is our common house
""
""
but what was the reason for the ten fifteen minute delay
""
""
they were a little bit apprehensive so we were we began we became suspicious
""
then they allowed us to go in and uh congressman amante saw some uh sample ballots in the waste basket carrying the mitra-fernan ticket
""
and uh well i thought that it could be just somebody put it there but then when we opened some of the uh tons and tons of boxes of uh propaganda materials completed there
""
but we didn't know it was propaganda materials because they were sealed with uh brown paper and then when we opened it my god we saw there uh millions of uh propaganda materials of mitra-fernan in english in tagalog in ilokano in cebuano and uh that was the time when uh congressman amante called in the newspapermen who were having breakfast because there 's something to show    words  
""
""
 but the news   reports had it that you know these uh these newsmen were gathered by raffy alunan    words   restaurant in quezon city circle was this raid pre-meditated   as suggested by some newspapermen 
""
""
 it was not a raid  
""
 we were going   to see and check whether it 's true that there were any anything hanky panky going on there
""
if there was none then we 'll just call it a day
""
""
and you contend that this is hanky panky
""
""
i was praying that nothing would happen because we did not want to bring any impairment to the reputation of the house
""
we 've had already so many problems in the house we did not want uh this thing to happen
""
and when uh we found that this this uh illegal massive misuse of government funds being happening there in the  batasan  in the uh parliament of the people then congressman amante called in the newspapermen and when they came in they blocked the doors
""
""
who blocked the doors
""
""
the guards there blocked the doors and some of the employees blocked the doors
""
""
how many employees were in the premises
""
""
there were about seven or eight
""
""
seven i thought only two
""
""
no two were outside but inside the premises inside the printing establishment there were    words  
""
""
 actually printing   were they running the machine
""
""
running the machines
""
""
and they were printing campaign materials
""
""
campaign materials   campaign materials 
""
""
 or the uh   according to the employees it was the omnibus
""
""
well that that 's what i was going to say in twenty-four hours they have issued four or five versions of the story there
""
well when this was happening by the way let let me just complete the story after we made this inspection we were satisfied that a crime was being committed there we were going home make the statement and call a press conference by god the    words   and the marines locking the steel gates of the  batasan  compound the complex
""
""
  words  
""
""
on whose orders on whose orders
""
""
we believed it was on the instruction of the sergeant the sergeant-at-arms who was taking direct orders from speaker mitra who happened to be in pangasinan in san fabian pangasinan
""
""
was the speaker or was the sergeant-at-arms in the premises
""
""
no that time he was not there
""
""
so they were communicating
""
""
and they were communicating with him and we were detained there for about three to four hours
""
""
uh uhm
""
""
we were detained when i said  we  congressman amante congressman lopez and myself and about twenty-two other newspapermen
""
""
what was the reason for the detention
""
""
i don't know we were uh they said that no you cannot leave you you 're not permitted to leave
""
""
uh uhm
""
""
and so we argue with the marine guard and then he says he 's waiting for instructions from his senior officer
""
by the way the marine guard the marines are administratively under the marine commandant but operationally under the control at the sergeant-at-arms who takes his orders from the speaker of the house
""
""
let 's ask the
""
""
let let me just say that uh  we begged to to to leave the premises
""
they did not allow us and then finally i called on on chairman monsod and on commissioner yorac and said please come and see for yourself or for himself if it was going to be chris monsod and see this major massive uh misuse of government funds by a major presidential candidate and uh finally they came at about four o'clock
""
and when they came at four o'clock they said the key was lost for more than an hour
""
so yorac was stopped there for another hour and finally she was allowed to come in with the major general of the police force uh at about five o'clock and i left at about five thirty and in the meantime i was saying that they have issued five versions
""
speaker mitra issued a statement from pangasian that it was a burglary
""
banayo the spokesman of the l d p said that uh that we planted the evidence
""
how could you plant the evidence by god there were tons of propaganda materials there and the marines are guarding the place and then you have the security officers of the house
""
and secondly that means that proves that we are not in cahoots with the marines
""
as a matter of fact they detained us
""
they would not let us go
""
thirdly they said  'no  that these uh sample ballots and these propaganda materials were misdelivered by a printing press in quezon city to the printing press of of the
""
""
that 's the version of ofelia cruz
""
""
this is the version of uh deputy secretary general of the house ofelia cruz
""
the final version is of uh secretary general sabio   last night  who said that these are the booklets of the omnibus uh local government code
""
so they have done four versions in less than twenty-four hours
""
""
 uh uhm  
""
""
uh uhm
""
and there are no fifth version sixth version
""
""
what really happened vic lim
""
""
yeah as uh as i am not personally and emotionally involved in the issue i would like to look at larger perspective
""
and i just have two comments to make
""
the first comment i 'd like to make is to contrast the behavior of my party the l d p when we discovered that government funds were being misused
""
we went through due process
""
we did not consider ourselves to be the investigator the prosecutor or the judge
""
what we did is we filed a complaint with the comelec
""
we went to the supreme court in order to stop the payment of the nalgo and bago funds
""
we did not arrogate unto ourselves to be everything which i suppose is the habit of the military mind and the martial law
""
what we would like to state therefore is in this particular case what they should have done is that if they felt that there was something wrong is to have gone and filed a case with the comelec to have gone to the authorities
""
it is very difficult in this situation to say that they are a disinterested bystander and therefore it is in the eyes of the law it 's quite important that they do not act as doing everything else
""
the other thing i would like to make is this seeming obsession to eliminate the candidate by technical knockout
""
again it is uh it is a strategy which is used only in dictatorships
""
what we would like to stress is that for these things to let the people decide
""
if you feel that speaker mitra has misused his funds let the people not vote for him
""
that is why we will have the election on may eleven
""
why are we going to try to eliminate speaker mitra and disenfranchise what we feel would be about the eleven million voters who will vote for him
""
why what is the point of all those
""
""
but let me just point out one thing to you uh why is it that uh i think almost all the other presidential candidates called on uh the speaker to withdraw
""
i mean it is not just ramos
""
it includes cojuangco salonga uh laurel uh miriam defensor-santiago
""
""
well if if uh
""
""
you think he is being singled out
""
""
well as they say he 's he 's the front-runner so if you can get the front-runner to leave  laughter   all discussants are talking at the same time 
""
""
if we go then through the course of action what is uh where do you go from here uh
""
""
well melinda we uh we uh signed the complaint today congressman amante congressman lopez and myself
""
we filed our uh administrative complaint with the commission on elections pursuant to the provisions of the election code that there has been a violation of the election code punishable by six years imprisonment and permanent disqualification from office
""
whether this progresses or not it is our duty to file this uh with the commission on elections
""
""
so basically your your having gone to the  batasang pambansa  was part of a course of action completing what might be called a process
""
meaning you found evidence on which then you are now filing a case
""
""
uh uhm
""
""
but realistically joe can we expect uh speaker mitra to be disqualified from this election
""
""
uh i personally do not wish uh speaker mitra to be disqualified
""
""
so why file the disqualification request
""
""
but it is our duty it is our duty it is our duty under the election code to report a uh a crime committed and we filed this case with the uh comelec under the and then there is a criminal aspect of this case which now the the fiscals will not handle but the comelec will handle and the comelec will itself file the case with the ombudsman
""
as to the final action of the comelec we leave that to uh commissioner yorac
""
uh she said yesterday that she felt that uh there is a serious case here and that she is waiting for the proper cases to be filed with the comelec
""
and this we have done
""
""
apparently uh the process will take longer than five days
""
and uh speaker mitra will continue to uh participate in the election
""
