""
i don't know when maybe next week
""
""
people from colegio san agustin will come august twenty-five
""
""

""
  here 
""
""
 here  
""
""
here
""
""
they 'll visit  s  uhm students in grades six and seven
""
""
uh okay
""
""
good thing they will not be coming here
""
""
they will
""
""
  they will 
""
""
 they will   be visiting our classrooms
""
""
yes just the campus  maybe
""
""
i think just the corridors not really inside the classroom
""
""
thank god
""
""
so they 'll be observing you
""
""
yes classrooms
""
  classes  in grade six and grade seven
""
""
 for  
""
for a period
""
""
i 'm not sure 
""
there are teachers who are assigned
""
""
assigned to be observed
""
""
i do not know
""
they were mentioning about that a while ago in the faculty room
""
""
okay  clears throat  that 's on august   twenty-  five
""
""
 twenty-five  
""
""
friday that 's friday
""
""
this friday already
""
""
twenty
""
""
five
""
that 's on friday already
""
""
uh yeah   that 's on friday 
""
""
 you should   prepare then
""
""
i 'll be absent  speaker a laughs 
""
""
that 's a good idea
""
""
i 'm not feeling well
""
i 'll be absent on friday
""
""
 laughter  i think so too
""
your voice is not that good
""
""
yes
""
""
so that would be your excuse
""
so who will   handle your class 
""
""
 so tomorrow i 'm not   uh on friday
""
""
yes
""
who 'll handle your class
""
""
i guess jet will
""
""
which one
""
""
jet jet the filipino teacher
""
""
uh jet
""
he doesn't have any advisory class
""
""
none
""
""
good for him
""
""
good thing they are not uhm asking us to to substitute for them anymore   because last time 
""
""
 imagine you would   travel from here to
""
""
not to the main building     that 's so far
""
really
""
yeah
""
that was the what do you call that the procedure before
""
""
 to the new kingdom  
""
uh uhm
""
""
but now it changed
""
""
yeah
""
""
good thing
""
""
by the subject
""
""
by the subject and by the level
""
""
i think no
""
uh if there will be nobody who 's going to substitute from the subject areas that 's the time they get from the level other levels
""
""
it 's a form it 's a different procedure here right
""
we get substitute teachers by the level not   by the subject  area
""
""
 uh by the level  
""
""
like if there 's an absentee from the senior prep you cannot  right prep
""
actually junior prep because they don't have classes in the morning
""
in the afternoon when we have absentees or absent teachers the senior prep substitutes for them
""
""
uh so only the prep substituting for the prep
""
""
yeah prep for prep and then grade one two and three i think
""
""
so you have the same subjects anyway
""
""
yeah because it 's self-contained
""
""
same thing with grade one
""
""
uh uhm grade one is also self-   contained  but grade two and grade three they are semi-departmental right
""
""
 grade one  
""
yeah
""
""
so they substitute by the level by the subject
""
""
i think by the  lev 
""
""
by the level
""
""
just the same thing
""
""
there
""
""
so how about your let
""
""
oh  chuckle    don't remind  me
""
""
 it 's coming by  
""
  it 's coming by  this august
""
""
 this uhm   this august twenty-seven
""
""
sunday
""
""
yes whole day because i got secondary could you believe that
""
i 'm in prep and they gave me secondary
""
""
but your training is in high school
""
""
yeah
""
i graduated b s biology
""
""
uh uhm
""
""
so that 's why
""
""
good thing it 's only for it will only last for the whole day because last time     when we took the test
""
""
 yeah  
""
two days
""
""
right yeah we took it for about two days
""
""
two days
""
""
uh uhm uh uhm
""
""
one whole day for all the general education thing and then the second day which is half day
""
""
for specialization
""
""
yeah for our   specialization 
""
""
 specialization  
""
""
so you mean
""
""
that 's two years ago
""
""
you mean for the general you have one day and then another half-day for the major
""
""
yeah your   major subjects 
""
""
 major subjects  
""
""
oh my goodness
""
""
but it 's different in the elementary
""
""
why
""
""
we only have one day
""
""
uhm even today
""
uh no half-day
""
""
uh for the   elementary 
""
""
 yeah  
""
for the elementary they have half-day
""
secondary we have a whole day       to do the test 
""
i think it 's draining
""
is it draining
""
""
 so it 's the same thing  
""
training for
""
""
draining for us
""
""
uh okay
""
""
'cause we have to do the test for the whole day
""
what do you think
""
""
  maybe a bit 
""
""
 you can manage  
""
""
uh uhm
""
""
that 's what you 're here   for  laughter  
""
""
 with grace  
""
""
no  laughter 
""
""
with grace i doubt
""
""
oh my goodness
""
it 's   quite scary 
""
""
 but don't worry   you 're going to pass
""
""
i hope so
""
we 're praying for that
""
  that 's what 
""
""
 i saw you reviewing with   uh
""
""
with   whom 
""
""
 with   chloe
""
""
with chloe and anne
""
""
uh anne
""
""

""
""

""
""

""
p r c is nothing yet before it 's uh what was it
""
""

""
""

""
""

""
""

""
""

""
""

""

""
""

""
""

""
""
yes
""
""
they didn't mail you
""
""
they did but they only gave me the a notice of passing   not the real thing 
""
""
 without the percentage  
""
so you want to see the percentage
""
""
of course
""
""
 laughter  so how did you   fare 
""
""
 the yellow   the yellow card
""
""
how did you fare
""
""
don't ask  laughter 
""
""
why
""
i bet you got high
""
""
uh nah   just average 
""
""
 maybe you 're even   the topnotcher  laughter 
""
""
how i wish
""
""
yee
""
  you even made a  courtesy call in metro bank  laughter 
""
""
 it 's not possible  
""
""
i bet you received fifty thousand pesos  laughter 
""
""
if only those things are true i would probably uh buy you what hamburger  laughter 
""
""
 ay  so cheap
""
""
plus coke
""
""
uh hamburger plus coke
""
""
plus uh
""
""
add french fries and i 'll be happy
""
""
fries what fries the curly
""
""
no the regular ones
""
""
the regular ones 
""
what else
""
""
what else
""
well right now
""
""
are you going there by
""
""
carpool
""
""
uh okay
""
""
we 'll be going there by carpool
""
""
with the others
""
""
yes with   anne and chloe 
""
""
 how many of you are taking the tests  
""
""
at p u p we 'll be three   anne  chloe and i
""
""
 chloe  
""
okay
""
""
and then in lyceum there 'll be   i think  four no three ruby uhm b j   and olive 
""
""
 uh lyceum  
""
 ruby will   still take the test
""
  i thought she had 
""
""
 yes   secondary english
""
""
no i thought she had already taken one last year
""
""
no she didn't
""
""
uh
""
""
because she already uh no she didn't have the education units then so that 's why
""
""
uh that 's uh okay
""
so she has to complete first the   eighteen units 
""
""
 eighteen units   of education which we finished last summer actually
""
""
for the t c p
""
""
yeah t c p
""
""
and you 're done with your t c p
""
""
almost because we specialized
""
""
what do you mean
""
""
we took uhm six units for the major because it 's teacher 's certificate program right
""
and then you can get six more units so that you 'll have specialization like we got six units of early childhood
""
""
uh that 's why you 're taking early childhood with ruby also
""
""
yes
""
we 'll finish this term
""
""
so how many units have you earned already
""
eighteen plus six
""
""
actually we got nineteen because of profe one unit
""
profe 's just one unit
""
""
what 's that
""
""
uh professional ethics
""
""
in education
""
""
yes and then nineteen plus six so that 's twenty-five
""
""
uh okay  twenty-five units for the t c p
""
""
yeah t c p with special   training in early childhood 
""
""
 that 's before you take   the uh board exams
""
""
before uhm before we take the board exam you have to get eighteen units right
""
""
but that 's more than eighteen units already
""
""
yeah that 's more than eighteen units already but we opted to take specialization so that it will jive with our present job
""
""
but if you have only eighteen units
""
""
it 's okay
""
""
it 's okay
""
""
it 's fine
""
as long as you get the requirements
""
""
uh uhm
""
""
we have these requirements in the p r c so
""
""
for secondary education
""
""
no no for licensure
""
""
uh okay  for the exams
""
""
yeah for the exams 
""
that 's it
""
""
i hope you 're going to uh  to bring the bacon  laughter 
""
""
no that 's pressure already
""
you know what
""
did you  have packed lunch during that time
""
""
uh  what  i didn't have
""
""
why
""
""
but we were asked to buy because there was a canteen anyway in the school
""
""
uh   is  it open
""
""
 so  
""
""
it 's sunday 
""
""
there was one in our school uh in the in that was i forgot the name of the school but it 's in quezon city also
""
so we were allowed to take the lunch outside
""
""
uh-huh
""
""
then uh we were asked to come back one o'clock i guess or one thirty
""
""
for the test
""
""
for the remaining tests
""
""
uh uhm i think we 'll not be allowed to go outside
""
""
just bring your own  baon  so  it will not be a big problem
""
""
you know i don't think i 'll be able to eat anyway
""
""
anyway you 'll have what uh eight o'clock
""
you 'll be starting at eight o'clock
""
""
no we have to be there before six thirty
""
""
uh it 's too early
""
""
maybe it 's seven o'clock
""
""
seven
""
""
i think it will start at seven o'clock and
""
""
the test itself
""
""
it will end about four  maybe or three
""
""
uh okay
""
""
i don't know yet because i didn't have the notice
""
""
so you will have uhm seven to maybe eleven thirty
""
""
i think so and then twelve
""
""
to
""
""
i think one to three or one to four
""
it depends   i think it depends on the proctor 
""
""
 just bring your packed lunch    and  merienda  maybe
""
""
uh-huh candies
""
""
i can't remember we were given time to have  merienda  that time
""
what i remember is we only had lunch
""
""
i think you can take
""
""
i think yeah
""
""
you can take  merienda  during the test
""
""
but since you 're so nervous
""
""
engrossed
""
""
or engrossed with the test you won't have the appetite to eat
""
""
in my case i didn't remember any  merienda  i just remember the lunch
""
""
okay
""
""
that was nineteen  kopong-kopong   laughter 
""
""
in my case i can't take drinks during the exam because by that time i will go outside to go to the comfort room
""
""
no don't take it so seriously
""
anyway you know yourself if uh you 'll be able to make it or what
""
and with the kind of review you 're doing my goodness
""
""
because we 're panicking
""
""
that 's it
""
that 's the very point
""
don't panic
""
