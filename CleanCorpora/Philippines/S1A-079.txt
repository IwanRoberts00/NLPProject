""
i 've heard that her mom asked her to study there you know just try for a sem or something
""
""
what course is she taking
""
""
i don't know
""
but whatever it is i think she 's finding it very easy because she stayed there
""
""
uhm maybe she 's  fa  she finds it a lot easier   to  study there

what
""
""
annabel and wheng had a little misunderstanding
""
""
no what happened
""
""
uhm i don't really know the bit by bit fact about the story just 
""
annabel told me that she was kind of  she was kind of  off
""
""
what
""
""
uh  sh  she 's kind of    she 's kind of 
""
""
 wait wait uhm   what  wait wait wait
""
i can't get you 
""
she and louella had a fight because of 
""
oh she was annoyed
""
""
yeah
""
""
at louella
""
""
yup
""
""
why
""
""
i don't really know because annabel just told me that she 's very annoyed with wheng
""
and wheng told me that annabel 's reaction of telling other people like me rachel
""
""
oh i remember that story
""
""
uh she 's kind of childish she told me
""
""
isn't that about when annabel came to louella 's class and she wanted to sit in but then louella told her to get out or something but louella meant it as a joke but then annabel
""
""
took it seriously
""
""
yeah   i know  that story
""
""
 yeah  
""
uh we met at the library and i was kind of shocked i was studying and then annabel just told me that she was very annoyed with wheng the way she reacted to her
""
annabel told me that she wasn't there for her but she was at least she was trying to see a classmate for a second just gonna ask something but then just wheng told her to get out
""
it was like  there really is no love lost between the two of them
""
but you know what when i talked to louella she didn't know that annabel was amanda 's friend
""
""
yeah she had no idea until until i think until rachel told her
""
i think i told her
""
""
oh
""
""
yeah because
""
""
so you 're the one
""
""
well well it was out of my mouth i mean i can't do anything to take it back so she asked me you know how persistent she can be
""
""
i think sometimes wheng is out of line  you know i mean
""
""
yeah
""
""
well she has some problems right now
""
""
what problems
""
""
i think she has so many things to do
""
she 's so busy so pressured then she ran she ran for the student council
""
""
yeah
""
""
and she had so many  jobs  right and she felt that no one is supporting her 
""
""
maybe she doesn't need support from but then i mean we 're in college now
""
""
come on i mean you could get old as a hundred and one but you still need friends
""
""
yeah i i don't mean it you don't need friends
""
what i mean is that you can't always count on your friends because they have some some uh some things they are some they have someone else they have   other things to do 
""
""
 other things to do   but still
""
""
they have other friends too
""
""
yeah but still  louella needs a friend you know you know she 's uh often   a sensitive  person
""
""
 i think  sh   
""
well she does not have a constant friend in u p
""
""
oh
""
""
i i think so
""
""
but i think she always  go with cathy
""
""
cathy
""
""
yeah 
""
""
well i don't think so
""
""
well i heard they also had a small misunderstanding
""
""
what misunderstanding
""
""
well
""
""
i don't know that
""
""
yeah it 's something new it still is a new thing you think well it seems it seems that louella wanted to use cathy 's computer
""
""
yeah
""
""
then  cathy has to go somewhere
""
""
yup so louella can't use the computer
""
""
yeah then on the day that cathy is supposed to go marites went to cathy 's house and used the computer
""
""
okay
""
""
then cathy left the house since  mar  is going out is going to type a document but louella was supposed to program something and she doesn't know anything about it
""
""
okay
""
""
that 's why cathy was able to let marites use the computer so 'cause she can beep her anytime
""
""
yeah
""
""
and when she returned cathy to her house she and marites went bar-hopping or something
""
then when louella heard it i think she got annoyed
""
""
well i think louella should understand it  it 's not  it 's not for cathy to entrust her with  ano 
""
""
yeah  so many misunderstandings with louella  laughter 
""
will louella ever learn to understand
""
""
oh no maybe she 's just have some issues
""
""
i think she 's trying she 's trying to change but it 's not enough
""
sometimes it 's hard to get  word  to understand her
""
""
that 's right but still we have to give her leeway
""
""
yeah 
""
""
well
""
""
remember when she went there
""
""
with
""
here   oh 
""
""
 yeah   i i find her i was kinda annoyed
""
""
why
""
""
she was she was telling this joke i don't remember it
""
i was really very annoyed and  we went we went out to buy some coke and then she was  ac  she was acting very very you know you know how she acts
""
""

""
""
