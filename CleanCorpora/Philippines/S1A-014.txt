""
""
yes why
""
""
well yeah
""
""
i can the  rea    the 
""
""
 two   in the morning three in the afternoon
""
""
yes the only reason why i got so tired before was it was
every day and i couldn't prepare i didn't have any time to prepare  
my  yeah my lessons
""
tried to  pre  prepare during the night or in in between
but sometimes you know i just   i 
""
""
 lessons  
""
 just   before  laughs 
""
""
yeah just before  laughs  and i feel so bad  laughs
 because the lesson is not going well and i think it 's my fault because
i didn't plan it
""
that 's why i think it 'll be okay if i get five this time around
""
""
five is good
""
two four five yeah  laughs  five is good  laughs 
""
""
 laughs  what are you doing counting how much i 'll
get     a day?  laughs 
""
""
 yeah  
""
of course  yawning 
""
i need to finish some of my drawings
""
""
what are you planning to do with them
""
you only have two right
""
""
no
""
""
are you planning   to 
""
""
 consign  
""
""
uh consign the drawings
""
or are you just uh the drawings itself    words
 
""
""
 the drawings  
""
""
okay with whom
""
""
with the  west gallery 
""
""
okay but  don't they isn't paintings    
more  ano      sellable
""
""
 well    words  like it
""
 yeah  
""
no drawings are cheaper  laughs 
""
yeah they 're sellable
""
paperwork is  i have works on paper not necessarily paper but
on paper easier to sell
""
""
but the one you had consigned with them that was
""
""
paintings
""
""
that 's a  paint  what uh painting
""
""
paintings yeah small paintings
""
uhmm smaller than bond paper size
""
""
anyway you know i 'm wondering if if chuch has already called
the   peo 
""
""
 guests  
""
""
yeah the guests but she has to she has to instruct them that
""
""
""
not to invite others  laughs 
""
""
 laughs  well yeah yeah one thing not to to invite
others that the invitations are very limited and then she has to tell them
not to park in front of our house so ma so mama won't be suspicious 
laughs 
""
she 's gonna ask them to to park in front of the neighbor 's house
so that when mama i think i think i think mark arranged uhm for the
association remi to invite  to to have a meeting that day  laughs 
""
well not really a meeting so a small   mock meeting 
""
""
 mock meeting  
""
""
yeah a  mo  a small group meeting just this person
that she needs to meet with mama
""
""
ahh
""
""
and that person is invited to the party
""
""
okay
""
""
so there so that mama will be out for the day  laughs 
when mama comes home then she sees all the cars in front of the house that
will be funny so i think they instructed they 're going to instruct the
guests to park their cars there in our neighbor 's house
""
""
uh hum
""
""
anyway
""
""
far walk  laughs 
""
""
it 's not it 's not that far
""
anyway it 's okay 'cause they 're hardly there anyway they 're
always in pangasinan only the only the  bantays  are there
""
""
who 're we talking about
""
""
the sorianos general
""
""
uh ahh okay
""
""
most of the time they 're not there
""
""
i see
""
good idea
""
""
for every time when when she calls a guest she has to
instruct them
""
""
 snickers 
""
""
well better than the first plan
""
""
what was the first   plan 
""
""
 the   first plan is  because we were planning
to have it on a sunday  e  mama doesn't usually go out on a
sunday she 's  lazy
""
when she gets home she doesn't want to go out anymore so tong was
 well she usually on a sunday mama just stays in her room and watches t v
and she hardly goes down
""
""
uh hum yeah
""
""
you noticed
""
""
uh hum
""
""
she only goes down for  merienda 
""
""
and dinner
""
""
and dinner  laughs 
""
""
and chit-chat
""
""
there so so we were planning we were planning to have them to
have the guests go to the basement directly to the basement
""
""
huh
""
""
 laughs  imagine they 'll be staying there for a long
time uh might be a long time depends on the rate  laughs  they come
""
""
then anyway after they gather enough they 're going to go up and
surprise mama
""
""
uh huh
""
""
then but mark was saying that 's why he suggested  to have
it on a saturday
""
what if  syempre  mama will just be wearing her
duster  'di ba   laughs      so she
might feel   and  she won't be fixed up so she might look 
laughs    funny 
""
""
 yeah  
""
  1 word   
""
 saturday 's   better
""
""
i know i want saturday  laughs 
""
""

""
""
