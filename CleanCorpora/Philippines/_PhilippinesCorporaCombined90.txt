earlier that there are foreigners also studying there well how how 's the atmosphere over there uhm meaning the locals and the foreigners yeah there are we 're doing fine with with the foreigners you know they 're uh they 're friendly also and uh you know you can learn from them uh the way their culture are the way they they value things and they uh the way they uhm treat us you know uh yeah you can you can uh be friends with them oo  yeah like what kind of foreigners are there uh most of them are the koreans and uh uh malaysians the burmese yeah we also have uh americans argentineans  it 's like uh uh an international school that you 're in  oh i see laughter ha ha i 'm in that you 're in if you 're there laughter o  well all of you talk in english you mean that 's the common language that you use that 's the common language to use in in the class but uh if you 're talking with fellow uh filipinos then you can you can converse in tagalog oh i see but if you 're talking to a foreigner but some of them you know uh the foreigners can also understand uh filipino so uhm they they would like to learn also our language so yeah they you can talk to them in english then with uh some filipino words to help them also to learn well how about how about the age i mean are they all the same age as you   you 're still quite young   the age   oh you mean you  yeah you know uhm uhm some of them maybe i can say that they are around forties the thirties the from thirties forties to fifties uh only a few are uh in the line of twenties oo i  oh i see  so some can pass as your grandfather words   laughter yeah you know the first time i was in the class uh the the first day of my class in a t s uh they thought i was the youngest in the class yeah looks can be deceiving looks can be deceiving laughter and my height too yeah you can pass as a 'no just cute as a what as a grade schooler yeah a grade schooler it 's a compliment by the way laughter  yeah that 's a compliment okay thank you laughter   o so you are planning to enroll this sem this coming sem yes well actually i have here a brochure or a catalogue of another school of another school yes it 's quite near our office it 's around it is also in makati uhm i 'm kind of thinking which school would be best suited for me of course our school is the best laughter  well of course laughter whatever you say but you know what uh what kind of uh degree program would you like to be into  i mean would you like to be a missionary or a pastor maybe you can get uhm m div masters in divinity in mission or m div in pastoral studies something like biblical studies well uhm well i really like to work in a school as a counselor or even as a teacher even a seminary teacher you know i enjoy i enjoy teaching  a school  teaching maybe you can get the same uhm degree program as i am uh as i am into okay which is uh that 's m a in christian education but you can get the the m div in christian education which is uh a higher you know a higher program because you you learn uh greek the hebrew oh you learn the greek language you mean they teach greek yeah they teach greek and hebrew in m div courses but in m a courses they don't teach we don't have to uh we don't require to get that uh subject oh i see okay uh yeah but uh you know m div is much uh uh it 's much difficult but uh it 's more challenging if you are in that uh course so those courses uhm mold you into a pastor or uh more likely yeah more likely into a uh pastor or a church church leader type yeah church leader sounds interesting well what other courses do your school offer  yeah   we also have uhm master of arts in laughter interruption by another person  hold it ha  sure  laughter chris chris so uhm yes where were we where were we laughter  you were talking about we were talking about the uh m div in counseling right i 'm telling you about another degree program called counseling oh hey that sounds very interesting yeah you can enroll in that uh field if you want to if you have if you feel you have the gift of being a counselor oh you know i always imagine myself talking to uh high schoolers teenagers about matters of you know the heart or whatever their schooling i really enjoy their company you know that might be a very good field for me yeah maybe you can you can uh enroll in that course the thing that uh your school and this school that i have a brochure with offers the same courses does it offer uh counseling program also in that school you uh the one that you 'are saying counseling program yes i think so they have yeah it says here that they have actually they already have a schedule a schedule for the year yeah uh-huh  uh uh is it uh the schedule is uh uh only in a m i mean in morning and afternoon well i 'm planning to go to that school tomorrow tomorrow morning to inquire about to inquire more about it okay it 's quite interesting because in our school we also have evening classes in some subjects particularly the the old testament survey or new testament survey but it 's very quite far from where i am yeah it 's quite far from your place of work in makati right 'no but uh uh the joy of seeing me there speakers a and b laugh the joy of seeing me there and uh with uh some of my classmates you know we can make you happy that definitely makes me feel wholesome laughter  what it makes you feel what  wholesome  handsome no well yeah that too laughter  ahhh so uh it 's nice that you are planning to enroll 'no  hopefully that in five years time you 'll be a pastor five years oh that long  yeah   that 's long i can't wait for that long you can't wait ha so if you are going to study you should uh resign from your job i can't i 'm sorry but i can't you can't also so how is that well i 'm planning to uh take my classes during lunch break laughter  oh that 's not possible laughter because uh one or a subject is uh most of the subjects are three-unit courses uh uh three-unit subjects i mean and uh you need three hours per subject  i know   yeah just kidding just kidding
