remember where you were in the early evening of february three two thousand   uh on february three two thousand i at about six o 'clock six thirty p m i was at the anvil restaurant which is uh at the

of our former chairman george l go   and who were at this party mrs ocampo   uhm senior officers of the bank uh from the head office and some guests the senior officers ranking from assistant vice-president and up   at this party did you get to meet a person by the name of atty fernando chua   yes sir   how did you get to meet atty fernando chua   mr go called me uhm uhm and introduced me

personal funds to a corporation and wants to use the bank uh for assistance   was the sum of the loan mentioned   yes sir   how much   five hundred million pesos   and the proposed borrower was the name mentioned   mr chief justice at this juncture we have to interpose a vigorous objection to these uh questions because they are not covered by any of the articles of impeachment they are objected to for being immaterial and irrelevant mr chief justice   what 's the response of counsel for the prosecution   mr chief justice i think that has been ruled upon by the   yes i i beg your pardon your honor   i think mr chief justice   now we have agreed already on who will be the examining counsel   oh no i thought that the   and the assisting examining counsel   i thought that it has something to do with the articles   i think it should be the examining counsel who must respond pursuant to the agreement   i respectfully disagree your honor first of all the evidence that will be presented through mrs ocampo as i said in the formal offer will show that the president and jeso jose velarde are the same the amounts that are involved in the accounts are very very substantial far more than the declaration of assets and liabilities which were submitted by the president we submit your honor that by showing that the sums involved in these accounts are very large tha that in itself is indicative that the president committed violations of the anti-graft law he has ill-gotten unexplained wealth and that is covered by article two of the complaint   atty flaminiano   mr chief justice the charge in article two of the articles of impeachment reads as follows president joseph e estrada violated the constitution and stands guilty of graft and corruption when he directly or indirectly requested or received for his personal benefit one hundred thirty million pesos out of the two hundred million released by secretary benjamin diokno of the department of budget and management allocated under republic act seventy-one seventy-one in violation of section three c of r a three zero one nine as may be seen from the affidavit of luis c singson provincial governor of ilocos sur dated twenty-five september two thousand annex b hereof  now the next paragraph reads president joseph e estrada violated the constitution and stands guilty of graft and corruption when he participated directly in the real estate business through a family-controlled corporation which constructed thirty-six town houses in vermont park executive village antipolo city as shown in the p c i j in the article on president estrada 's family and financial interest  he also violated the anti-graft law he is sworn to uphold he filed his statement of assets and liabilities for the year nineteen ninety-nine stating therein that he and his wife and children have business interests in only the three corporations the president by that sworn statement also committed perjury and the offense of unexplained wealth because records show that he and his his wife and mistresses and their children have other interests in other companies outside of the three firms listed in the statement of assets and liabilities annex e hereof  there is nothing in this charge under article two of the articles of impeachment which mentions this so-called five hundred million peso transaction your honor   and for the just for the guidance of atty bautista   yes your honor   under the preliminary conference order on uh the issues agreed upon by the parties the parties agreed that insofar as article two of the articles of impeachment is concerned the only issue is this whether on the basis of the facts alleged therein the president could be guilty of graft and corruption how would you be able to relate that kind of testimony to the agreement as to the issue involved   as i said your honor the complaint already alleges the ultimate facts constituting the offense the statement here he also violated the anti-graft law he is sworn to uphold  the fact that five hundred million pesos will be presented in evidence today as belonging to the president among other large sums as i earlier mentioned   the the the question of the uh presiding officer is uh whether or not uh that kind of evidence that you seek to introduce now would really relate to what the parties had agreed as the issue under article two and i repeat whether on the basis of the facts alleged therein the president could be guilty of graft and corruption   most definitely your honor   mr chief justice   atty flaminiano   there is an allegation that uh there was a transaction involving five hundred million pesos now there is no allegation of an ultifat ultimate fact regarding this five hundred million pesos your honor even if we read the articles of impeachment several times as we have done before we cannot find any specific allegation that will support the conclusion that uh this five hundred million pesos is part of what has been alleged in the articles of impeachment   we submit     it speaks of five hundred million pesos in cash whereas in these articles of impeachment your honor the allegation is that the president his wife and mistresses have other assets in other companies outside of the three firms listed in the uh statement of assets and liabilities  that definitely your honor is outside the scope of these allegations in these articles of impeachment   your honor please it is settled that allegations which are evidentiary in nature need not be alleged as ultimate facts in the complaint   in the   in the matter of   i 'm sorry uhm   five hundred million pesos being owned by the president is not an ultimate fact it is an evidentiary fact which will tend to prove that the president violated the anti-graft law the ultimate fact that is material is the one i just read he also violated the anti-graft law  how did he violate the anti-graft law mrs ocampo will tell us   if your honor please the allegation that the president violated the anti-graft and corrupt practices act is a conclusion of law it is not a statement of an ultimate fact   i disagree your honor   uh uh the chair would rule that uh while it may be a conclusion of law it is precisely a conclusion which could be developed only out of proof by facts but the only issue really is how could you relate that to the ultimate facts alleged under article two unless you can satisfy the mind of the presiding officer on a particular relation between that ultimate fact and what you claim to be evidentiary on the basis of what the parties had agreed as the sole issue under article two then i don't think uh the presiding officer may be able to clearly clarify its own position on the matter  in short show to the court the relationship by by stating by by showing exactly facts which we may be able to elicit from the witness  if at all it has some kind of materiality to the issue agreed upon after the preliminary conference and during as a matter of fact that conference     thank you your honor   yes     mr chief justice may i kindly point out that apparently the private prosecutor was not aware of what has been agreed upon previously he might be completely unaware of the parameters of what has been agreed upon in order to expedite the trial of these cases where the issues have been specifically delimited in the pre-trial conferences mr chief justice   one one simple question in relation to that uh is the examining was the examining prosecutor present during the preliminary conference   your honor please before yesterday i was a passive spectator to this i haven't had sleep for twenty-four hours i definitely have no information or knowledge of what was agreed upon   of what has been agreed upon during preliminary conference    yes your honor  yes and uh   would would you need time to to confer with uh the panel of prosecutors because indeed uh indeed parties should be bound by what they have agreed upon unless you could really justify how you would proceed on this witness to establish by evidence its relationship to the issue agreed upon   we will try to prove your honor through the witness that the president had accumulated unexplained wealth and this is indicated with the amounts in the accounts your honor   but uh there had been uh the the defense had read into the record the allegations precisely under article two so if uh were you aware of uh the allegations under article two   are you referring to the allegations on page five   yes the allegations of ultimate facts under article two so you could be properly guided    yes your honor  yes your honor
