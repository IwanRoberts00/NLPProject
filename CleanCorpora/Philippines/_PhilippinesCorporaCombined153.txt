mr speaker  what is the pleasure of the gentleman from isabela   will the gentleman yield to a few questions he still has the floor if he wishes to yield willingly mr speaker uh thank you mr speaker this uh insurgency problem has been the problem that has been confronting us for the past uh two decades  and uh i believe that uh the present uh insurgents uh the so called n p a c p c p a no n p a c p c p p uh are the offshoots of uh the hukbalahap movement uh which uh rose after the second world war and uh since then up to the present this has been the problem of uh our government uh do you think your honor that uh the bills that you have mentioned and uh which are still pending in the house would help in the solution of uh this problem i believe so mr speaker your honor because uh the three bills i filed deals with the uh the surrenderees which will encourage them to surrender to the fold of the law because they are given incentives and they are uh they are given amnesty aside from the amnesty they will be given livelihood projects that will uh propel them towards economic uh stability economic uh development so that there will be no more reason for them to be staying in the hills which is a life of hardship uh being uh hunted forever by uh our military uh thank you your honor and uh i am one who had uh some uh lengthy talks with uh surrenderees n p a surrenderees in my province in isabela and the the reasons why they joined the movement or the insurgencts are uh varied  some uh say that uh they were uh just invited to attend a seminar or a so-called meeting and uh after that they were uh not allowed to get back to their homes anymore some are uh there because they are uh lazy to work on their farms  instead of uh working in the farms they prefer to join the movement because it is an easier life for them although they would uh reside or stay in the forests  and uh some are uh are what we call uh ideologues or the those who are uh in the movement because uh of a desire to fight this democratic form of government your honor would these uh three bills which you filed uh covers these uh matters which i have uh presented yes uh mr speaker your honor these three bills will really cover the the varied reasons why there are so many uh being attracted to the n p a c p p side  but i think uh although you have mentioned some of the reasons why they are uh joining the n p a the c p p i believe however that the main reason is really uh economic uh difficulties being encountered by these people you know it is uh it is uh better for them to join the n p a because at least they are provided with food they are provided with what they need uh for their daily livelihood and they don't have uh the problem of uh trying to find this uh daily living uh uh things that they need in their uh daily life so that by joining the c p p n p a they are uh provided with their uh livelihood so if the government will try to to give them amnesty and uh at the same time after they have surrendered they are given the proper uh incentives like uh livelihood programs which we can very well afford i think uh there will be no more reason no more overriding reason for these people to still continue fighting the government i don't believe that uh these people are imbued with the ideologies of communism that uh they cannot uh part with it there are i wou i would say there are a very few number that are uh really dyed to the wool in their skin uh because of the ideology of communism but uh it is an exception rather than the rule so that i would say that generally speaking the n p a people now uh who have uh turned away from the government can easily be uh urged to come back to the fold of the law by giving them the proper incentives uh giving them livelihood i fully agree with the gentleman and uh i would say that uh principally there are two kinds of uh n p as or c p p the ideologues and those who have joined the movement or the insurgency because of uh economic uh necessity for those who have joined word economic necessity your honor i believe that they are more in number than the ideologues or those who believe in communism that 's true would you uh agree with me your honor i fully agree uh mr speaker your honor because i mentioned that already that uh there are uh i think the biggest number of them are due to economic hardships economic difficulties that they are encountering in uh our present uh economy in the country there are so many people who have no jobs at all so that uh they find it difficult uh to support their family that is why that is the very compelling reason why they have joined the c p p n p a because at least by joining this uh rebel unit at least they are uh assured of their daily livelihood whereas if they will continue to earn their living they cannot find jobs they will find really serious difficulties trying to support their families uh i must confess to the honorable gentleman that uh i did not have uh time to read very well the bills filed would the bill three bills uh cover incentive that would uh give uh proper uh invitation to the members who to these people who are shall we say we call uh misguided for them to come back to the folds of the law i am uh more or less certain about that mr speaker your honor because uh aside from giving them full amnesty if uh the rebels are sincere this will be of course uh through a screening committee they will be determined whether their uh surrendering is really genuine or sincere in their effort and then uh aside from giving them full amnesty uh as i mentioned already they give uh they are given economic support in the form of livelihood projects which uh is being called under house bill number two three two eight zero which is entitled an act providing full amnesty to surrenderees and economic support in the form of livelihood projects  so that coupling these all these things which are all in favor of the surrenderees i believe that there is no reason why they will not uh come back to the fold of the law there is no reason for them to stay in the hills because it 's very hard for them to be staying in the hills away from their families and uh to be roaming around being hunted by the military wherever they are uh situated uh your honor uh usually the reasons they give in rising against uh the government is because this government is a capitalist uh economy because this government is full of uh corruption and graft and the this government is not uh uh serving the people as they should be served uh do we have uh enough reasons to combat or to say answer these uh allegations or contention of these insurgents  well at least on the aspect of uh graft and corruption i would say that uh as a matter of fact i was the principal author of the bill which we passed which was uh entitled the anti-red tape bill which has already passed by which has already been passed by this house on third reading and it is uh with the conference committee with the senate as they have also passed uh a similar measure in the senate uh uh ano aside from that we have already passed also the code of ethical standards uh prescribed for government officials and employees which is a guideline for uh the government officials and employees to follow so that they will not be tempted to commit any graft and corruption so these two measures alone are uh enough if they are being uh implemented by our government to stop the graft and corruption which is uh which is rampant now in our government i nobody can deny that the rampancy of graft and corruption in our government is really real not only imaginary but real uh yes your honor i made mention of this because this has been the issue raised by the insurgents ever since uh this movement was uh there as a problem and so i was thinking there that there must be something wrong with this uh system don't you think so your honor i cannot pinpoint uh mr speaker your honor the exact cause why there are so many people being tempted to commit graft and corruption uh whereas before uh during the time of the late president marcos the corruption was only observable and uh seen in the higher echelons now it is creeping to the very lowest limit or level of our uh government offices and agencies so i would say i cannot pinpoint really what is the cause but maybe it is also due to uh economic difficulties being uh uh experienced by our government employees uh having uh only very meager salaries which are which are even below poverty line and probably this must be the reason why uh they are uh indulging in this uh graft and corruption business uh do we get it from your honor that uh graft and corruption is more rampant uh under this administration than in the previous uh one well if you consider that as more rampant when we speak that uh during the time of president marcos graft and corruption was limited to the higher echelons of government and now it is seeping to the very lowest level of uh uh government then i would say that it is even more now uh uh this graft and corruption as i said is one of the reasons why the n p a c p p insurgents are uh fighting the government do you think uh your honor that uh this graft and corruption is a necessary evil or part of this system of democratic form of government no mr speaker your honor i don't believe that this is a necessary part of our system of government as a matter of fact president aquino has been instituting uh measures uh implementing measures to fight graft and corruption i think she is uh sincere in her efforts uh against graft and corruption but it 's only that uh that i think it has already seeped into the mentality of the filipino working man especially the government employees that uh for example a certain uh individual goes to a certain office and asks for a certain document he will uh purposely delay the production or uh completion of that document in order to have some uh grease money to be ba given by the one seeking the document so that uh probably that is the reason why uh he is tempted to commit graft because of the inkling to have the money before he can accomplish anything what he thinks in his uh service is no longer a he does not consider anymore that uh a public office is a public trust but rather that a public office is a means wherein he can enrich himself that is the very reason why some of our government employees are uh indulging in this to help them economically solve their uh problems
