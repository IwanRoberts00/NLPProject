joe about your uh your perception of the future after the elections
""
""
well uh there is no doubt that uh what we must uh safeguard today is the uh canvassing of the votes to be it 's now being done at the municipal level and at the provincial level
""
we must preserve its integrity so that these elections will truly become credible and let 's get the support of our people so that we can move our country forward

dr mangahas
""
""
well from my standpoint uh regarding the surveys  i just hope that uh when all the results are in that the public will have a look again at so-called uh  surveys such as the radio veritas survey
""
they need to have a big big uh size and try to see really whether it 's accurate at all
""
""
uh uhm
""
""
the radio veritas survey was predicting that a that mr cojuangco  3 words   for example
""
it 's not happening at all
""
""
uh uhm but uh insofar as the uh surveys of the s w s are concerned they 're more or less accurate
""
""
yes i would say
""
""
uh uhm
""
""
i would say i would say
""
""
well thank you very much gentlemen for uh having joined me in the panel tonight uh
""
we have other guests
""
uh for example secretary of foreign affairs raul manglapus will be uh called to the panel after this uh live report from cebu city
""
come in cebu  break in the recording 
""
""
so you 've mentioned earlier in the coverage uh the sample that we have the that the data that we have uh is uh because of limitations in transmission uh professing a very large urban bias
""
we broke down uh our data into uh regional sources and and we 've established that forty-nine point six percent of uh the numbers that we have are generated from the national capital region
""
that is the largest uh segment of uh of the sample data that we have
""
and uh the second uh largest sample that we have comes from uh uh region six
""
uh now the sample size that we have so far posted uh amounts to only about five percent of uh the total vote or less
""
and it is insufficient to extrapolate from this sample considering the size of that sample and considering the variance in the representation of of the regions
""
although we do have uh samples from all the regions the sample sizes are not uh at all even
""
""
yes and uh and we uh we are still trying to say that it 's too early to say that there 's any trend
""
uh there are some uh who say that uh one candidate is leading uh by a big margin but uh again it 's too early to say that anybody is winning by that large a margin
""
in any event we 'd like to ask uh secretary ramos here uh how he feels about the conduct of the election in general
""
uh what is his reaction
""
""
i do believe that uh the may eleventh election was uh on election day one of the most peaceful and uh violence-free i mean comparatively speaking
""
i 've been into many of these things in the past as a deputy of the commission on elections
""
and uh  uh i am surprised uh as to how the level of violence was brought down and uh certainly the comelec uh its deputies the uh philippine national police and the armed forces of the philippines the uh other deputized agencies the comelec volunteers the uh uh pastoral parish council for responsible uh voting uh p p c r v uh as many as well as many others should be congratulated for uh a job well done
""
however uh we 're now into phase two and uh this is the period where even greater frauds and anomalies can be perpetrated
""
since just by the stroke of one pen you can change the cipher at the end of a report or the number in front of a number
""
and change uh the uh the totals significantly
""
so our people must continue to watch this
""
the old political pros are adept at this game and uh those of us who are into politics for the first time and who are also non-traditional uh would want that uh the entire process be kept as clean as uh credible and as orderly as possible
""
""
uh mr secretary during the campaign there were a lot of scare scenarios being uh peddled by uh uh parties uh uh all over
""
uh we 've had the a an  elec  electoral process that uh uh defied the expectations as to peacefulness and turn-out and uh even the quickness of the count in spite of some delays
""
uh how do you assess the uh the prospects for a continuation of this uh of this orderliness into the next few days
""
""
well i uh think that if we apply the continuous uh monitoring process that has already been started uh meaning that the people themselves through the uh people 's organizations the n g os as well as uh us individuals continue to keep watch then uh i think this process can uh  be maintained as uh one that is really remarkable uh in nineteen ninety-two
""
but uh understand that uh as candidates find out that they are losing and have no more chances of catching up then they uh just fold up and they go home bringing with them the the poll watchers assigned to those precincts or to those uh uh municipal uh tally areas
""
so uh i would then recommend uh in fact appeal to uh the citizenry to maintain the watch because there are still many more days of this
""
media also should be commended for uh for maintaining this sort of reportage because uh the people should be informed
""
this is part of the transparency also of the entire process
""
""
sir as one of the front runners in this uh uh election uh that we just had how do you feel about the way the results are coming in
""
uh is it still anybody 's ball game or is it yours
""
""
uh-huh well uh of course there are many versions and we have a variety to choose from at any particular time
""
uh which is good 
""
uh in my particular case i uh  knew right away that uh the very first reports would come from metro manila and this happens to be the uh bailiwick of uh miriam santiago
""
uh these facts were established in uh various surveys in the past
""
so we know more or less we know more or less the distribution of uh each one 's strengths in our fourteen regions
""
in my case uh i 'm running second to miriam in the surveys in metro manila but i 'm seeing also that uh  the big difference which uh appeared in the surveys insofar as metro manila was concerned is not appearing in the tallies
""
uh in other words i 'm gaining here in metro manila
""
uh in one of the surveys uh miriam was credited with some thirty-three percent of the possible vote in uh manila but i had only seventeen percent
""
but in the actual tally so far uh she 's running at about twenty-eight percent and i 'm running at about twenty-one percent so that 's just seven percent difference
""
meaning i gained here
""
""
which will you which will you consider your bailiwick uh    words  
""
""
 well uh in the in the   previous surveys again and this is by s w s and  crystal  which is our in-house survey uh i am running either one or two in all the fourteen regions
""
uh but those that are especially strong for me include uh region one of course which uh of which pangasinan my home province is a part
""
uh the uh  the two visayas regions region seven which is uh lito osme&ntilde;a 's home ground  and also region eight uh samar leyte plus uh  three out of the four regions in mindanao where i  was running first but in the fourth one i 'm also running a close first or a close second there
""
so those are my bailiwicks roughly uh  six uh sure three regions
""
""
we we have a very very small sample from uh region one uh point one four percent uh due to some problems in transmission which will be corrected tonight
""
uh but in the very very small sample that we have you ranked fourth uh uh in in the region one sample that we have
""
it 's too small of course
""
""
well i 'll tell you what i got from uh  some of our leaders in pangasinan who called up this uh afternoon
""
they 're really working on a sample also because  uh they don't have uh the complete returns yet
""
but uh i am getting uh eighty percent of the vote there
""
and i think this should be expected because uh    words  
""
""
  words    in pangasinan is your biggest province
""
""
well it 's third really
""
but it has one point one million registered voters
""
and assuming that eighty percent voted or turned out
""
then we have the potential of uh roughly uh eight hundred eight thousand votes
""
so it comes after uh cebu and negros occidental
""
""
since pangasinan is part of region one can your votes in pangasinan uh overwhelm the votes in the ilocos provinces
""
""
oh yes because uh the combined votes of uh ilocos norte ilocos sur and la union abra is not considered to be a part of region one
""
but even if you throw abra into region one although it 's part of the cordillera administrative region a combined vote of those four provinces will not exceed those of uh pangasinan alone
""
uh in any case uh i am not uh i agree with bong that uh at this early stage considering the sample which is about three or four percent  'no 
""
uh this is not enough on which to base any trend much less the claim of victory uh
""
 medyo malayo yata 'yon 
""
and uh i think we should await uh as you said uh a greater number of votes as well as a more even distribution within the regions
""
""
we have always emphasized here at a b s c b n that uh our count is uh not producing a trend and uh and if people misread it it 's really their lookout you know
""
i mean people like to see what they want to see
""
and i understand some candidates are uh you know are so upset about how it 's going on
""
but uh but it 's it 's a question of uh you see what you want to see  laughter 
""
""
just relax and enjoy yourselves  laughter 
""
""
another question that i have for you mr secretary is uh what are the lessons that you have learned in the campaign
""
are there some insights that will help you if and when you win this election
""
""
well i uh must uh consider this a very valuable learning experience
""
going through the campaign for ninety days all over the country
""
i think we missed uh just three provinces uh batanes and aurora although we had representatives from those provinces joining us
""
uh there was one more province that uh oh just two because we visited uh tawi-tawi
""
but uh to me the most uh valuable  insight uh could should be uh an important uh basis for action in the future so that we could provide some remedies is the continuous dependence of our ordinary people on a political patron
""
how even for the very small things our people in the rural areas especially seem to be uh so dependent on a recommendation from somebody that is important
""
that they uh seem to have lost all initiative of trying to lead themselves  'no 
""
uh precisely this is what uh we are trying to to fight in our party and that is uh the situation of the ordinary filipino continuing to be just a puppet or a pawn in the hands of uh the political uh masters in the community
""
uh i just think that our ordinary people have the capability and the talent given some encouragement and some training and uh maybe some  cre  credit assistance to grow up and themselves become uh self-reliant and productive uh uh economic uh components of our society
""
""
then will government will your administration give them the uh economic support to do this like credit
""
""
yes uh that is what i call the second phase of the edsa revolution which is the economic empowerment of our people
""
the political is finished and we should credit president aquino for that plus all those that helped her
""
but uh certainly we should uh try to give supplemental income opportunities to our uh household for instance
""
it 's being done there in negros occidental
""
uh i 've seen it
""
