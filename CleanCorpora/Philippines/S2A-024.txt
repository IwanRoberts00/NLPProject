""
i apologize most abjectly for coming late
""
it was i assure you uh something that i could not control 'cause of the hearing uh in in the senate
""
anyway uh we are here today as students of economics and as interested citizens interested especially in how the economy is performing and i would like to tell you that my talk is going to be in the following manner
""
first i 'm going to say what i think the potential of the economy is
""
second i 'm going to say how the economy is being poisoned
""
and third i 'm going to say how we can remove the poison from the economy so that we can get back the economy on a sustained growth path which is the objective that is most desired by everyone 
""
so my first statement is  the potential of the economy
""
i can stand here and unambiguously say that there is absolutely nothing wrong with the economy and the potential of the philippines that a dose of good old  economic policy proper economic policy can  uh  will be able to attain
""
what do i mean by that
""
if you look around at all our neighbors you will find out especially the asean you will find out that the philippines in nineteen sixty was second only to japan as far as its economic development was concerned as far as position in the economic in the developing economies of the world was concerned
""
that position has deteriorated steadily since then
""
so that although in nineteen sixty we could be compared favorably with thailand by the time we reached nineteen eighty-nine economists from abroad had already said that it was not fair to compare the philippines and thailand any longer
""
thailand is just too much out of our league
""
that hurts
""
why
""
because as far as the resources of the philippines are concerned as far as the human resources especially the natural resources name it we 've got what it takes
""
so the next question that can be asked is where did we go wrong
""
we went wrong simply because always economic policy and good economics has taken second place third place and fourth place to every other particular perspective of concern of the filipino people
""
this has got to change
""
and i think it is changing because where before economics if there was a lecture on economics we would have maybe two three four people uh coming in
""
now everyone is interested to find out what in heaven 's name is wrong about our wrong with our economy and what can be done about it 
""
the prospects the immediate prospects for the philippines are very gloomy
""
but that does not that should not give us any cause for depression or for a or for giving us the the incentive to crawl into a hole and die
""
that should rather elicit in us the response that we are fighting mad we are going to do something about it
""
if we can't do something about it right now where by god by the time we get to be responsible citizens and in positions of power we 're going to do  abou  something about it then
 there is always hope while there is life
""
the question only  be  is must we have so much more problems to resolve in the future as a result of the compounding of the  pres  of the problems of the present and the past
""
why do i say that the prospects are gloomy
""
well if you will notice or if you have read in the newspapers the text of the memorandum of economic policy which contains the stabilization program that the philippine government has submitted to the i m f for approval you will find out that while the targets  there are so many specific targets with respect to revenue with respect to expenditures  etcetera etcetera  very little mention is made about what the growth prospects of the economy are
""
in fact in the text of the memorandum of economic policy you will find out that they all all they say is that for nineteen ninety-one the growth of g n p will be quote slow unquote
""
what  slow  means i don't know
""
i just attended a hearing this morning where they said well about one and a half percent one and a half to two percent
""
the question is is that good bad or indifferent
""
i was just in thailand last week or two weeks ago and a thai economist very good economist who also happens to be one of the leading economic managers in thailand was pulling my leg when he said when he said in answer to my question what 's the growth prospect of thailand this year
""
and he said very bad very bad
""
we 're only going to grow by six and a half percent  laughter 
""
that hurts especially since because at the beginning of the term of president aquino the government had put forward an economic plan that targeted a growth rate of six and a half percent on the average for the medium term
""
everybody at that time said that was too ambitious
""
and i said no that is just absolutely mediocre because that was going to be the growth rate of the rest of asia on the average for the medium term 's eighty-seven eighty-seven to ninety-two
""
now not only are we not talking about the six and a half percent we 're not even giving a numerical magnitude to it
""
one and a half percent was taken out of the out of the as a as a grudging admission on the part of our economic managers because one and a half percent growth rate of g d p will mean that on a  per capita  basis we will have contracted by negative one percent
""
and even that ladies and gentlemen of the audience seems to be an overestimate given a close study of what exactly the features are the other features are of this memorandum of economic policy for this economic stabilization program
""
now as students of economics for example just as a  for example  to to show you why i think that one and a half percent may be too much of an overestimate given the specific measures that are in this memorandum of economic policy
""
there is a relationship economic relationship between for example the money supply and g n p
""
m is equal to p q for all those who have forgotten
""
in other words the growth of money the rate the growth rate of money is equal to the growth rate if you talk talk about it in logarithmic terms is equal to the inflation rate plus the real growth rate of the economy
""
well  what do we have in terms of the targeted increase in money supply
""
this has not been published and i don't know why but the growth rate in money supply according to confidential sources and i sincerely hope i am wrong the growth rate of money supply in terms of base money has been stated as a ceiling by the i m f agreed to by the philippines or  vice versa  whichever way you want to it 's the same at ten point eight seven percent for nineteen ninety-one
""
 gawin na nating  eleven  puwede ba 
""
i mean this specificity up to the second decimal point really awes me especially since they ignore completely what the growth target is for the economy as a whole
""
so that 's eleven percent that 's the growth rate of base money
""
inflation is really projected to be about fourteen to fifteen percent this year
""
so if growth rate of money supply is equal to inflation rate plus the growth rate of g n p that means that g n p more or less will contract by three to four percent this year
""
how they came up with that one and a half percent is beyond me
""
it must either be because they have made the wrong assumptions with respect to inflation or they actually think that the filipino people will sit will take this sitting down
""
i certainly hope that we don't
""
but until and unless we see the entire memorandum of economic policy not just the text but the tables and the accompanying appendices we are not going to be able to make a judgement
""
but one thing sure even at the present uh even given all consistency one and a half percent should never be acceptable
""
if that is what we mean by stability then my only answer to that is what is good about stability if being stable means being dead
""
death after all is a stable condition
""
it 's about the most stable condition of all  words  and that we do not want 
""
why is it that we are accepting these kind of measures  cough 
""
well so what how do i know what are these measures all about
""
these measures essentially say you 've got to decrease your deficit the public sector deficit and by the way you 've got to decrease your national government deficit
""
you also and in order to do this you are going to have to increase your revenues and or decrease your expenditures or both
""
we are doing both
""
exactly how much are we supposed to decrease our public sector deficit
""
it is supposed to go down from what it was last year five point two percent of g n p to supposedly nineteen ninety notice how specific they are to three point seven percent of g n p that 's the public sector that includes the national government the local governments the government corporations the government financial corporations the central bank  etcetera 
""
so you must decrease it by essentially one and a half percentage points of g n p
""
but they say that the national government which is part and parcel of this public sector deficit must decrease this deficit by two percentage points of g n p
""
in other words the entire burden of the deficit reduction is must be borne by the national government to the extent by the way of even more than the reduction of the deficit of the public sector
""
in other words they 're expecting that the public sector deficit the rest of the public sector deficit will increase but that 's all right the national government is going to bear the brunt
""
well folks the national government means you and me because we are talking about taxes from the taxpayers i i mean revenues which are going to be paid by you and me and expenditures on the people that are supposed to be spent on you and me
""
so the first thing that can be said about this memorandum of economic policy about this particular measure is  sobra naman ang kanilang pagkahigpit 
""
why do i say that
""
because as far as comparisons with other countries are concerned the really the government deficit the national government deficit is less than the average deficit of countries of a comparable size comparable income comparable debt structure  etcetera 
""
we have actually less
""
why we did not fight for a uh for a more uh for a less contractionary policy is something again that is beyond me
""
because mexico in nineteen eighty-six was given an i m f program with a deficit of g n p of the national government of mexico of more than fifteen percent
""
 binigyan pa sila 
""
 e tayo e  we are being asked to decrease our deficit from three point eight percent of g n p national government to one point eight percent of g n p and you say well so what
""
that 's two percentage points
""
let me tell you how that deficit is going to be decreased
""
there are ways and ways of decreasing deficits
""
one by increasing revenues and the other by decreasing expenditures
""
but even in increasing revenues there are ways and ways of increasing it and in decreasing expenditures also
""
the problem is we are increasing revenues the wrong way and we are decreasing expenditures the wrong way
""
wrong in the sense that it is going to be down or be inimical to not only the development targets of the philippines in the short term which is this year but also in the medium and long term
""
why do i say it 's the wrong way
""
revenues  they say uh you 've got to increase your revenues
""
therefore until and unless congress passes all these alternative measures you have got to  introduce  or to impose an import levy of nine percent
""
folks a nine percent import levy is essentially a sales tax it is an indirect tax
""
we have been fighting since nineteen eighty-six to try to reform the tax structure of the philippine economy so that it is less regressive and more progressive
""
we do not like the regressivity of the tax structure because it is more burdensome to the poor
""
so we have been fighting since nineteen eighty-six to increase this  progress  uh a this progressivity of the tax structure and in one fell swoop we are bringing it back to what it was in nineteen eighty-six
""
it is as if all our efforts at reforming a uh a tax structure at implementing it very much needed structural change in the economy which is to increase the equity of the economy has just been completely neutralized by this one revenue measure
""
