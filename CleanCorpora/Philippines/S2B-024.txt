 the presiding officer calls on the speaker  mr chief justice your honors twenty-nine months ago president joseph ejercito estrada right hand raised left hand in the bible took an oath the sacred vow before god and country  i do solemnly swear that i will faithfully and conscientiously fulfill my duties as president of the philippines preserve and defend its constitution and consecrate myself to the service of the nation so help me god 
""
your honors joseph ejercito estrada willfully  cons  consciously and maliciously violated that sacred oath by his acts of committing bribery graft and corruption in all its forms betrayed public trust and culpably violated the constitution
""
i have been assigned together with congressman oscar rodriguez to prove that respondent president joseph ejercito estrada betrayed public trust
""
today mr chief justice distinguished judges in this impeachment tribunal we write history
 last november twenty-eight when this august body made a resounding denial of the defense motion to quash a significant page in history was written
""
expectations and hopes of our people were raised to the skies but it is in this trial where we will write whether or not in a thousand years the senate will have its finest hour
""
during these historic eventful days the senate will have the singular privilege never tested in our nation 's history which hopefully future generations of filipinos will read with pride that during the eleventh congress the senate in fulfillment of  const  constitutional duty rose to the occasion and guided only by duty and conscience and the truth left partisan loyalties behind in the side against the president
""
your honors permit me to say that none of us in this hallowed hall relish the task before us
""
but we did not choose to be involved in such reckless and  word  misconduct as president joseph ejercito estrada is accused
""
it is thus a duty be it painful one that i speak to your honors to find judgment against the president
""
indeed the impact to the constitution must be felt that if the president commits any or all of the cited charges against him the constitution and our people must be served
""
hence we are today to do our respective duties we to present the case against the president and you to rule under your best lights
 your honors by voting these articles of impeachment the house of representatives is not attempting to raise the standard of ethical conduct to perfection for our political leadership nay for all of us
""
such person does not walk the earth today even after jesus christ redeemed mankind from original sin
""
everyone can sin but when the constitution provided for impeachment as a mode of removal of the president it is our bounden duty to prove the president guilty and your honors to uphold that guilt as evidence will show
""
indeed the impeachment since the days of the english kings and ministers has been called the most powerful weapon in the political armory short of civil war
""
it played a continuing role in the struggles between king and parliament that resulted in the formation of the unwritten english constitution
""
in this respect impeachment was one of the tools used by the english parliament to create more responsive and responsible government and to redress imbalances when these occur
""
in our jurisdiction we borrowed from the u s constitution with some minor modifications are impeachment grounds
 in the u s the framers sought to create a responsible though strong executive
""
they hoped in the words of  ellwoods gerry  of massachusetts that the maxim would never be adopted that the chief executive could never be wrong
""
no man is above the law and no man is below it
""
nor do we ask any man 's permission when we require him to bring it
""
obedience to to the law is demanded thus the maxim  ignorance alleges  non facit excusam  
""
in the case at bar the president took a solemn oath before god and country to uphold the law and preserve and defend the constitution
""
section one article eleven of the constitution states that public office is a public trust
""
public officers and employees must at all times be accountable to the people serve them with utmost responsibility integrity loyalty and efficiency act with patriotism and justice and lead modest lives
""
in many decisions of the supreme court it has been ruled that any government office is a trust  for it is created for the sole purpose of effecting the end for which government has been instituted which is for the common good and not for the profit honor or private interest of any man family or class  of being kin 
""
jurisprudence adds that a public official employed therefore occupies a very delicate position which exacts from him certain standards which are not demanded from or required of ordinary citizens
""
he 's truly the servant of the people and as such he is enjoined to serve his office with the highest degree of responsibility integrity loyalty and efficiency and at all times be accountable to the people
""
mr chief justice your honors we will prove to you by competent credible and relevant evidence that president joseph ejercito estrada is guilty of betrayal of public trust
 in fact  words  has opined that betrayal of public trust covers any violation of oath of office involving loss in popular support even if the violation will not amount to a punishable offense
 its inclusion is more a reaction to past experience than an exercise in logic
""
it was the  consen  consensus in the constitutional commission that culpable violation of the constitution as the main ground for impeachment would hardly prosper in congress even against an unpopular president
""
this new ground  betrayal of public trust  serves to stress the desirableness of having a president who truly regards public office as a public trust
""
how has president joseph ejercito estrada spent the fund of public trust
""
who benefited and who was deprived
""
your honors we ask you to decide this case on the bases of law and the evidence
""
we ask you not to be swayed by the pomp and the power of the office or the political interests involved but to look at the evidence that will be presented and the magnitude of the betrayal in the public trust
""
the violation is very clear the evidence overwhelming in fact consistent corroborated and more than substantial
""
the defense constantly harps on the fact that the defendant is an elected public official or  vox populi in vox dei 
 but mr senate mr chief justice your honors so did all the dictators of the world
""
the voice of the people is the voice of god
""
yes
""
but that voice is also spoken in the constitution
""
the constitution is the expression of the people 's sovereign will
""
the constitution lays down the framework of government the powers of the president the different branches of government and the limitations thereto and what is important the principles of accountability mandate and accountability power and public trust
""
what the people make and elect they can unmake and remove through impeachment in conviction for the elected legislators in the mechanism set forth in the constitution
""
the constitution is supreme and the people 's voice sovereign
""
mr chief justice your honors the  procs  the prosecution shall show that president joseph ejercito estrada has not cherished the public trust
""
he squandered it for his benefit and for the benefit of his cronies and kin
""
president joseph ejercito estrada has placed public interests private interests above the interests of the public in violation of that oath of office
""
we will present overwhelming detailed and corroborated evidence that on september six nineteen ninety-nine president joseph ejercito estrada has ordered a quasi-judicial agency insulated by law from political pressure and influence not to perform its function in accordance with the law of its creation
""
he issued the directive to the securities and exchange commission not to allow an independent department of that body  to conduct investigations without the prior clearance of the commission  en banc 
 for what ulterior purpose and for whose benefit this directive was issued was made apparent by subsequent events
""
president joseph ejercito estrada 's crony businessman dante tan became owner of controlling stocks of a corporation called b w resources corporation at the time when the shares of stock in the said company was undergoing a price surge never before seen in the history of the philippine stock market
""
on january nineteen ninety-nine the price of b w shares was about two pesos per share
""
by october ten nineteen ninety-nine the price surged to a high one hundred seven pesos per share
""
when dante tan first bought b w shares in nineteen ninety-eight its price was only eighty centavos per share
""
b w shares rose from the sixteenth most heavily traded stock in the philippine stock exchange in january nineteen ninety-nine to the number one among the top twenty companies by june with a total value turnover of seven billion one hundred thirty-nine million nine hundred seventy-two thousand one hundred seventy-five pesos
""
later the philippine stock exchange would report that dante tan earned a profit of some eight hundred twenty million pesos during the period from january to may nineteen ninety-nine alone
""
the total value turnover of b w shares in october was twenty-one billion six hundred ninety million one hundred seventy-five thousand and seven hundred twenty-five pesos record that will never likely be surpassed decades into the future
""
after october ten nineteen ninety-nine the prices of b w shares underwent an abrupt and ignominious fall
""
last one week from october ten b w shares had plunged to as low as twenty-two pesos per share and now very much lower
""
these dramatic events pertaining to trading of b w shares in the philippine stock exchange alarmed responsible officials of that body as well as the securities and exchange commission which oversees the former
""
both bodies undertook their investigations which necessarily inquired on whether the meteoric rise and sudden fall in the prices of the shares was a natural occurrence dictated by market forces or was the result of illegal schemes or manipulation
""
while these investigations were being carried out  by these agencies and in relation to the very subject of such investigation president joseph ejercito estrada made several questionable phone calls to the heads of both agencies and made representations in favor of his crony dante tan
""
through less than subtle suggestions the president applied pressure on the chiefs of the p s e and the sec to shield mr dante tan from any unfavorable findings that these agencies may come up with
""
the president would constantly remind his officers that mr dante tan was a friend is my friend
""
the president clearly interfered with the discharge of the duties of these officials by suggesting by ordering that mr dante tan be exonerated even as the investigations had yet to be finished
""
we have evidence to show your honors that the president ordered the president of the stock exchange that before the report of each investigation would be submitted to the board of governors the same should first be submitted to him
""
and we have proof to show that indeed the president of the stock exchange and  the head of the investigating agency were called to malaca&ntilde;ang to present the advance report of that investigation
""
when the investigations were concluded the reports had one clear conclusion
""
all evidence that the p s e and sec gathered had pointed to the culpability of mr dante tan for price manipulation and insider trading
""
president joseph ejercito estrada said dante tan was a victim
""
the evidence said dante tan was the culprit
""
the investigators found that illegal transactions involving dante tan were committed not once not twice not thrice but hundreds and thousands of times in myriad forms and ways
""
it is in the interest of the public to bring dante tan to court and make him face the rigors of trial
""
the president showed interest in dante tan 's immediate exoneration and obstructed the course of justice
""
why
 did he have as evidence seems to suggest more than friendship with mr dante tan but has pecuniary interests in b w shares which went beyond mere cronyism
""
the prosecution will show that the president 's interference did impair the course of justice despite the fact that the evidence against dante tan surfaced in the report
""
it would be noted that both the p s e and the sec reports were partially incomplete in the sense that the reports didn't cover all individuals and persons who had been involved in illegal transactions or benefited therefrom
""
the president 's obstruction of justice prospered because he succeeded in cutting short the investigations
""
in striking fear in sec and p s e officials he succeeded in confining the reports to incomplete results
""
he succeeded in having possible damning evidence against the president mistress guia gomez his favorite son j v ejercito and his other friends and relatives obstructed
""
the denials of officials willing under the awesome demonstration of coercive power weighed at a time when the president appeared omnipotent hardly qualifies as evidence of lack of pressure
""
mr chief justice and honorable judges it must be remembered that many traders in the stock market are small businessmen and ordinary people in a country where majority of the people live in abject poverty while a small middle class struggle to survive allowing the few to amass billions of pesos in profits through  manipulat  manipulative schemes further widens the disparities the few rich and the many poor and the middle class  1 word 
""
the facts we will prove before your honors pertaining to president joseph estrada 's interference in the affairs of the stock market do not even come close to the gravity and extent of the issues being raised by the workers and peasants and the protesters outside these halls
""
price manipulations and insider trading fraud seem sophisticated and technical when compared with joblessness hunger and displacement from farmlands all concrete symptoms of a deep crisis that the president exacerbates by staying in office and imposing himself upon a people who has withdrawn confidence in his administration and policies
""
and what is worst your honors there now appears substantive proof that respondent president joseph ejercito estrada did not only pressure the sec and the p s e to clear his crony dante tan but violated his own memorandum to government financial institutions not to approve or release loan applications in excess of fifty million without his without his prior imprimatur
 but in what appears like a manifest behest loan of six hundred million pesos p n b then government-controlled granted b w resource this  ho  huge six hundred million loan on collaterals of almost now practically valueless b w shares in a tagaytay property said to be valued at not for a few millions of pesos
