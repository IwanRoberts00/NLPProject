uhm next question what do you think is the more effective review method the self-study approach or or what 's this or the form and the formal thing where you go to class and all of you review self-study or class i think it 's important to have a mixture of both what did you do uh self-review and then go to the review class but actually what i did e i chose the subjects where i was weakest and so with those subjects where i 've not had a good background i would attend review classes  pero those subjects where i felt i i had a strong background i studied it on my own and then i just referred to the notes which my other batchmates ha took when they attended review classes but i think uh most people no i think most people i know who really did well in the bar exams they studied on their own oh yeah that 's what i did i just attended the preview yeah you were always in the gym no i know i regret that now but uh laughter i was uh i i studied at my own pace decided not to keep up with everybody and yes because i wanted to do other things while i was reviewing and then i attended the pre-week pre-week is that week right before the sunday that 's where they give you the areas which uh poss  they feel yeah from which possible questions may arise and which they feel you must concentrate on examiners may change every year 'no  yeah yes you have no way of knowing who the examiners will be  next year no  no  we don't even know the examiners now we only have guesses  now  we only have guesses we don't know for sure who they are like we just know the chairman of course because he 's justice davide he 's appointed by the the kwan 'no by the chief justice chief justice appoints the   appoints him and then usually it 's the most junior justice who becomes the head of the bar exams committee and then the chairman justice davide chose the examiners rumor has it that he chose some of his kwan his close friends cebuanos so political law i well i don't know i don't really care so we have guesses like rumors na naman and you rely on rumors usually some of these rumors are really true like last year i know that they anticipated it that pascual will be the examiner for labor  yes yes  so a lot of people really prepared for that exam yes 'cause he 's very exacting e  he wants you to to phrase it phrase the law accurately and he has his own way he has his buzz words  if you don't write down   what 's buzz words  words that he thinks are important ahhh things are you know which you give it a specific meaning so he wants those buzz words so they had to study his book and he was really the examiner these people are they have they become your teachers before pascual was my teacher he teaches in u p so uh some of them like our senior partner what rene cayetano was the examiner rene cayetano the senior partner of this firm yeah in nineteen eighty-nine labor also uhm labor eighty-nine nineteen eighty-nine most of them didn't know even pia because pia is my batchmate or classmate  she 's the daughter of rene  his daughter  and before the nineteen eighty- nine bar exams there were rumors that he was the bar examiner but pia was saying of course not if he was the bar examiner i 'm good at i should know this is my dad he didn't tell us word  uhm do you think that like you need parang you need to devote like a part of the test to psychological exams also parang just to parang you know to know if speakers c and d speak at the same time  if you don't have the right frame of mind if you 're you won't do it you you can't you can't do well in that exam you it requires a lot of mental energ ano 'yon mental well-being e just to survive that exam and there words perhaps also yeah the tension and the pressure create the psychological tensions that uh normally  pressure  break anybody who 's not   yeah yeah they would unrav yes of course and of course   and there were cases right yes people cracked after the uh yeah during the exam itself they break down and cry or they drink ink or they scream   oh you 're kidding   yeah there are some girls word   no uh   during your exam yeah during our exam what do i didn't know anything about that i remember about the girl who ano who had to be carried out in a stretcher  well  uh no i didn't know about that but i knew about the girl who drank the ink because my classmate was her roommate uh we were so words  oh many of those every year anyway uh law school should be the primary meeting of uh word like we start out in ateneo we start out with five classes we only graduate two  so there there you should already get the the wackos out  yeah  but seeing if you look at many practitioners na you see plenty of weirdoes walking around also that means that uh the practice of law and schizophrenia are not necessarily incompatible 'no laughter  in fact when i when i was in my freshman year we had this batchmate turned out to be a wacko she turned out to be insane at first we but she 's very intelligent e and she writes really good in in poems  uh uhm yeah  poems it turned out we thought she was just weird she was just an artist yeah parang eccentric until she started fantasizing about burning a classmate or saying that she was the wife of a certain person and then she 's being pursued by th the new people 's army and the yellow army and what was this the clincher was that she was the daughter of jackie onassis  uh uhm  uh yeah that was the clincher she would stay out in the rain and then oy chari come in you 're going to be you 're going to get sick sabi niya no i 'm used to the cold i was born in connecticut and my mother was jackie onassis until cory aquino kidnapped me and brought me to this damned wretched place ganon  but when they found out she was you know mentally off-balanced it was really true ha  she passed the entrance exam she passed the interview with flying colors and she turned out to be did they ask her to leave they did uh i see because you 'll pass the bar even if you 're crazy as long as you autistic people can take that bar and pass it and then uh well whether uh whether he is qualified to be a lawyer or not later on is decided by what either the clients who choose him or firm that he works for yeah people who would like to commit him later on word crazy that bar exam is not going to indicate your psychological world view uh uhm uhm joyce you wanna choose a question uhm okay it says that quality of preparation you underwent do you think that having been educated in an elite and di ba yung elite institution gave you an edge over other like other aspirants that 's what i thought the bar exam it was an equalizer some sort 'cause nothing ewan ko feeling nga nothing ever prepares you for the bar exams e   kasi it 's not it 's not the usual di ba yung the technique what do you call that in teaching that you have one professor and then you learn from him parang   socratic method no no it 's the pavlo quer query query  what do you call that  pedag  pedagogic yeah pedagogic method na you parang you share the same universe di ba that there 's one teacher the teaching is not it 's not that way e di ba  it 's this outside you 're a stranger who didn't teach you anything who 's going to choose the question now your his universe is different from yours like you may be ha have been taught different things like in u p kasi i 've noticed we were taught the kwan e complex questions yung each question must you must you must analyze it because it 's not as easy as it seems na parang you don't trust a simple question ganon na you always think no there is a trick in this  kaya during the bar exam i was i was also thinking ganoon no this question is too easy there must be a catch ganyan ganyan 'yun pala it was just it was just simple   simple  just asking me uh you know a fundamental question but i answered in a complex way uhm so you see the training is different and the emphasis is different so that 's the that 's the problem   did you you have to do some adjustment then when you get there  yes yes  speaker b says something but unclear well i thought that uh going to my school was worth the trouble and the expense because no the bar exam is a measure of basic knowledge they 're not supposed to measure uh unusual or obscure uh questions of law now that basic knowledge is something like a common universe all lawyers must share see if you don't know that then you should not become a lawyer  that 's the whole logic of the bar exam  yeah but is the writ of amparo well there so you have isolated you have isolated exceptions to the rule  common universe  but as a general rule the bar exam is only supposed to ask you uh to measure a minimum threshold of knowledge which you must possess in order to be qualified to serve as a lawyer now there are only how many months before the bar exam  that 's the ideal  six months six months it 's impossible for you to go through everything that you 've read during the four years that you uh went to law school but conceivably they can ask you anything about what you learned during those four years and if your school was not very good then that review would be all that you would basically you have to rely on  you have to rely on  i i i recall that as you know my preparation was spotty  i did not devote one hundred percent of my time to the study studying for the bar because i was also busy engaged in other activities like uh physical training so i noticed that when i was taking the exam already i knew the answer to the question not because i had read it during the the months prior immediately uh preceding the bar exam  immediately  well i still remember what my professor told me during the four years during some obscure day when i was sitting in his classroom and i think that is a crucial em they consisted the bulk of my answers they call what they call stock knowledge i 'm sure you noticed that also i did did you yes i did but  stuff that you did not use   i think the question well my personal opinion is that the questions some some of the subjects the examiners were not able to phrase the question correctly okay accurately   uh well   also true  it 's so hard to to know what is he asking for i don't understand he 's asking  what exactly that he wants  that is a common that 's the difference and i really felt because of the ambiguity in the question i was having a hard time trying to de to figure out what he was asking for so i was always in because i was trained in u p i was always i would always think that he would was asking a hard question and he wants me to analyze   can you ask the proctor   no you can't   no you can't  you can't because the proctor does not know uhm he does not know yeah yeah he 's just like personnel in the supreme court he probably doesn't know the answer and he doesn't understand the question he understands it even less so unlike uzoy i i really think that the bar exam is an it 's an equalizer but but of course we have an edge okay in the sense that we have been trained better because there are a lot of law schools you could see a lot of people from the provinces uh uhm and i remember in my in my one in my room there were people who took the exams three times already and they were comparing the paper  yeah
