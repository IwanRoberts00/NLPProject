 first part not taped operating independently but in coordination with the armed forces of the philippines uh uhm  alright uh perhaps you can comment on what we have asked general abadilla about the rumors that uh word the no el = no election is already a thing of the past that is already an obsolete word because the elections are proceeding comparatively uh peaceful but the no proclamation is still hanging like a sword of damocles and uh of course we don't want that to happen we want that the voice of the people will be heard and duly registered in the uh in the uh proclamation of uh the rightful winners what can you comment on this general i share the optimism of our chief-of-staff and uh we are also convinced that the entire leadership of the armed forces of the philippines together with the rank-and-file are convinced that there will be a proclamation come twelve noon of june thirty nineteen ninety-two  and uh we are convinced that after twelve noon of nineteen ninety-two june uh june thirty nineteen ninety-two we will have a new commander-in-chief of the armed forces of the philippines to whom we shall uh give our loyalty and service and uh we don't believe that uh there will be a situation where there will be no proclamation at all as uh mentioned by general abadia this morning and uh also uh the statements of the comelec uh commissioners there will always be or there will be a winner to be proclaimed by june thirty nineteen ninety-two even if that winner will only win by a mere uh uh plurality vote there will be one who will be proclaimed as president i i i think that if the elections are clean and orderly as they are showing signs that they will definitely be we have no one to congratulate but the people ourselves 'no  yes because i think uh the people have been very vigilant especially the volunteer groups like the p p c r v the uh parish pastoral council for responsible voting there are about almost a million of them eight hundred thousand they think of sort and uh they are out in the in the fields and uh they are in tandem with the civic action group and we have never noted this such enthusiasm as we note now amongst these volunteers 'no  they 're not being paid and uh in fact uh they 're risking life and limb but uh uh they are rest assured that these elections are going to be peaceful then another volunteer group is uh the uh integrated bar of the philippines uh who will extend uh on the spot legal advice if they could uh  react  and also uh you you said something about the react uh is this another communications group yes this is the regional emergency action group 'no communication action group 'no and this is also working in tandem with the civic action group we have set up a monitoring system in camp aguinaldo and by the way uh ray i would like to to just inform our public that uh in case there are rumors about uh anything that you would like to be clarified you can call up uh the rumor alert center in camp aguinaldo and this is uh collocated with the monitoring uh center and the telephone number is seven zero five three eight eight or you can fax your message to seven zero five one eight one there is always an officer responsible to clarify any rumor that you would like to be clarified okay you got those numbers again they are seven zero five three eight eight and if uh you have a fax machine seven zero five one eight one and they can call up the trunk line of uh camp aguinaldo which is seven two one nine zero zero one and seven two one nine zero three one and ask for local six seven six three six seven five two and six seven four three and there are always people who will attend to your query or uh information general gaby uh comelec is ready now and so we have cielo villaluna there i think uh she has the very popular and the very colorful commissioner haydee yorac cielo music  thank you very much ray and gaby we are now back at the commission on elections and we 're coming in live with me is the very popular commissioner haydee yorac who is who will be off to the mindanao province at twelve noon today and uh she said that she 's quite in a rush so we will go through this interview as fast as we can okay cielo i would like to take the first crack at the question first i like to bid her godspeed in her trip to mindanao and then uh very quickly now uh ms commissioner uh how do you make an assessment of the ongoing elections up to this time from seven a m up to this time i uh voted at eight thirty this morning and i went to the pi&ntilde;ahan elementary school and then i went to the quezon city hall and the office of the election registrar and uh just uh uh went uh by different precincts in metro manila and uh my general impression up to this point is that the elections are proceeding smoothly naturally if you are managing an elections as massive as we are conducting now there will be a few hitches music  i think that 's one of the few hitches that uh commissioner yorac is uh talking about uh well it 's a technical problem beyond our control in the meantime back to the panel here uh gaby and i have uh several phoned-in complaints from our televiewers and uh just as soon as ms yorac is installed back and uh she 's able to uh go on the air we will be able to refer these questions uh to her in the meantime back to what we we 're talking about about volunteer groups and these accredited groups let 's not fail to mention the media assistance quick count uh you 're aware of this of course and uh you know how massive uh this uh agrupment is aren't you general yes yes uh we have also some linkages with them as a matter of fact we have uh several meetings with ms tita de villa and some representatives of the media citizens quick count and uh we have linkages with them and uh we are working very closely with them let me ask gaby roldan here if uh she has in one way or another any involvement in these volunteer groups because i have uh i 'm uh one of the p p c r v active member in in my parish uh do you ever or did you ever join any of these volunteer groups no not recently uhm i was supposed to join the the group for the parish pastoral for responsible voting except that uhm we 've been quite busy preparing for the elections so i think this is my uh small contribution towards ensuring a you know orderly elections by way of information to our viewers vi via channel nine 's coverage of the elections okay uh i 'm very excited about uh seeing commissioner yorac all over again i think she is uh on now and then our technical facilities are a-ok so come in comelec okay we are we on okay we are now back at the comelec we just had some difficult problems a while ago as commissioner yorac was saying there have been reports of uh unconfirmed reports of massive disenfranchisement and commissioner yorac is warning media to first confirm reports prior to reporting she has made the rounds of the different polling precincts in the quezon city area and to give a recap commissioner yorac will you give us once more your update yes uh in uh barang barangay pi&ntilde;ahan where i vote at the pi&ntilde;ahan elementary school voting was proceeding quickly and smoothly and uh there was only one precinct where there was a minor hitch the ballots did not arrive but the chairman of the board of election inspectors has gotten the registrar 's office and the office of the treasurer that by this time i am sure that the problem has already been addressed uh there were also reports about uh the uh delays in the delivery of uh paraphernalia in district two and uh this is explained by the fact that we were solving the problem of misallocation last night uh certain uh uh bags had to be uh repacked redistributed and uh but uh on the whole the elections are going very very smoothly and whatever reported incidents are really very small incidents compared to the general orderliness peacefulness and uh enthusiasm about the elections also joining us this morning is the honorable chairman christian monsod who will give us an update later on but first we shall continue with our interview with commissioner yorac because she will be soon flying off to the mindanao province ma'am you will be your first stop will be jolo and it will be followed by zamboanga and tawi-tawi do you have an initial assessment of the conduct of the voting in these areas uh well uh my my reports so far is everything is uh going smoothly the critical leaders of these provinces which we have placed under comelec control have accepted uh special procedures that we have set up in these places among which are the uh designation of the armed forces of the philippines as the lead agency in helping the elections implement uh election laws and rules uh the p n p 's only secondary in these areas second is the clustering that we have done and third the uh safekeeping of uh of uh critical election uh supplies such as the uh indelible ink the uh election returns and the certificates of canvass word the military commanders for delivering only at the time of counting at the start of canvass the election hot spots in mindanao are the so-called critical areas and the comelec has been very vigilant in ensuring orderly honest and peaceful polls and over the past weeks we have met with the political leaders who in turn have given the assurance that they will abide by the by the election laws can you give us an update on the participation and the behavior of the political groups is peace and order running in the area well uh yes while we 've had a few incidents in the last few days for example there was this bombing in cotabato city uh which uh resulted in the death of a number of persons there was also a bomb explosion in isabela which is the capital of basilan province and this is the reason among others which uh made the comelec cluster the voting in the uh province of basilan uh the uh marine commandant there uh sent us a uh a uh rush telegram saying that he could not assure the peace and order situation in the course of the voting unless the elections uh were clustered and so we uh clustered the voting i understand that there have been some reactions on the part of the of some political leaders uh i got a telephone call from governor salapudin last night uh asking me to postpone the elections but i said that it is the sense of the uh commission en banc that we should continue with the national elections and we will take it from there there is an unconfirmed report that uh voting did not push through in marawi city would you clarify this point i think the point has already been clarified we have been in touch with the regional election director for region twelve atty teresita llaban and the confirmed fact is that there is voting in marawi there was a slight problem in the municipality of masue  but there is voting in marawi and i 'm really amazed with that kind of report because i was speaking with atty omar umpar who is running for vice-governor in the province of marawi at one o'clock this morning there was no indication at all from him who should be most interested about the process in marawi city because he votes in marawi city but uh he did not give me any indication that anything was remiss about the delivery of supplies and materials in marawi city and we just have it now the final word of the matter marawi is voting and voting is going on peacefully and in an orderly fashion alright commissioner yorac may i butt in please go ahead ray how much time do you still have how much time do you still have for us another two minutes
