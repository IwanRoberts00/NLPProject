number two of the semi-finals  the world record holder in this event is ian thorpe with the time of uh one minute eighteen point eighteen seconds that 's a very fast time i think and uh he holds also

uh for australia yesterday anchoring the four by one-hundred meter relay and beating the united states in this particular event so two golds one individual and one team for ian thorpe  remember this is four lengths of the pool the world record is one minute forty-five point fifty-one seconds there should be a correction of what we have seen earlier here a split and we see that the swimmer on lane four lane four is hoogenband of the netherlands together with josh davis and it 's the netherlands' hoogenband with twenty-four point fifty-one at the first fifty-meter mark  and uh we see that josh davis of the united states is trailing in third place james salter of great britain as we hit the first one hundred first two lengths of this pool and uh it 's hoogenband of uh the netherlands with the time of fifty-one point twelve seconds josh davis fifty-one fifty-four james salter of great britain in third place van den hoogenband starting to spread the field while josh davis is just

point fifty-one uh what we mentioned earlier was the first hundred uh uh fifty and we are approaching the homestretch of this race and hoogenband of the netherlands no doubt is going to win this very easily over josh davis of the united states and the battle for third is either on lane number three and lane number five but hoogenband of the netherlands winning with the time of one minute forty-five point thirty-five seconds and josh davis of the u s with the time of one minute forty-seven point o six seconds very slow record and that is a world record i think that 's a world record for you yes a world record by hoogenband breaking the record of uh ian thorpe with a with a swim of one minute forty-five point thirty-five and breaking the record the world record and the olympic record set by ian thorpe this morning so pieter van de hoogenband winning the first heat of the semi-finals with a time of one minute forty-five point thirty-five there 's the dive and josh davis of the united states one forty-seven point zero six it 's gonna be very interesting to see how the race will develop later on between ian thorpe and hoogenband of the netherlands and we 'll be back with semi-final heat number two in the two-hundred meter freestyle featuring ian thorpe of australia winner already of two gold medals  and there 's the reaction from hoogenband after setting the world

of canada looking very strong also on lane four but ian thorpe is leading comfortably not yet and rick say is in lane number three and first to hit the wall is ian thorpe twenty-four point ninety-five twenty-five point ten by rick say of canada and ian thorpe just taking a very easy swim he might be on world record pace after the first one hundred and we can see that ian thorpe just taking it very easy as we go for the final ten meters and just spreading his uh strokes and first one hundred and here is ian thorpe with the time on his side uh right now uh hoping to break the record done by

ian thorpe jumping to the pool very relaxed swim actually in the first one hundred and it was only in the last fifty that he he increased his pace and there is ian thorpe holder of two world records
