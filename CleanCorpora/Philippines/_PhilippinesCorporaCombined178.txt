female married from bataan was admitted with the presenting symptom of severe gastric pain the accompanying signs and symptoms were fever nausea and vomiting physical examination revealed fever tachycardia hypotension the lungs were positive for basilar rals  abdominal examination revealed tenderness diminished bre  bowel sounds and there is a positive collin sign pertinent past medical history revealed that the patient has mumps two weeks prior to admission uh we are entertaining a case of acute pancreatitis to rule out the following conditions namely acute cholecystitis cholelithiasis pyclonephritis and hepatic abscess abscess we are also ruling out peptic ulcer disease as well as acute appendicitis with uh epigastric pain noted on this patient is there any association association to meals does it occur uh thirty or ninety minutes after meals or is there any radiation of the pain to the right scapular area or at the back ah this patient has a localized epigastric pain it is not related to any food intake or ano any radiation at all that 's why we ruled out cholelithiasis disease   since in cholelithiasis the symptoms occurs only when the stone produces an inflammation or an obstruction of the cystic or the common bile duct but on physical examination the abdomen can be noted to be normal or there is only a rap an uh a right upper quadrant pain uh huh in your case the patient presented with an abdominal tenderness a diminished bowel sound and collin 's positive  collin 's signs which is uh likely not found in the case of cholelithiasis and one thing more on a simple ultrasonography of the abdomen in you will right away note a stone formation in the gall bladder so we can easily rule out the existence of cholelithiasis in this case how about considering uh a case of uh the existence of pyelonephritis in this case uh break in the recording the past medical  his history of this patient was negative for any urinary tract infection which is usually true in pyelone pyelonephritis break in the recording  and on physical examination the kidney 1 word  were also negative which is usually true in pyelonephritis that 's why we tried to we ruled out pyelonephritis in this case  break in the recording  because of the did you note any ab break in the recording on your physical examination did you note any uh ichtricia of the conjunctiva or any fever it was negative the ichtricia is negative but the patient was febrile on admission was there any uh profuse sweating during the night any weight loss or any any loss of appetite or any changes in bowel movement uh it was negative all of these were negative according to the patient so the the possibility of an existence of uh of a hepatic abscess is very nil since the history of this patient points uh rules out the existence of uh hepatic abscess on the basis of the absence of the severe abdominal pain the palpable mass on the right upper quadrant which was not noted in this case yeah that 's true break in the recording  the epigastric pain noted in this case is not associated with meals so peptic ulcer diseases is easily ruled out how about uh the obstetrical clearance and the surgical clearance of this case when was the last menstrual period uh the last menstrual period was uh june ten june ten of this year   so the existence of any ectopic pregnancies in the uh intrauterine tumors or whats whatsoever that causes that will manifest as an acute abdomen in this case is also ruled out   is also ruled out  how about the coexistence with uh an acute appendicitis an acute appec appendicitis as first at first was entertained however we immediately ruled it out uh after doing some physical examination because uh in acute appendicitis the pain is uh located at the  mcburnis area as well as the rebound tenderness which is all negative in this case ahhh so we easily ruled it out with all the differential diagnosis fully discussed in this case the manifestations noted really points out to an acute pancreatitis we are left with uh the laboratory diagnosis we will be guided if we request a serum amylase and serum lipase determination and other auxiliary procedures like uh complete blood count and if the patient can afford it would be much appreciated if we can do a c t scan which can confirm the diagnosis of pancreatitis and will be useful for predicting in predicting the outcome and identification of late complications we will manage the case as an acute pancreatitis we will be compelled to give analgesia preferably meperadin if it warrants we will put on i v intravenous fluids we will be placing the patient on a nasogastric intubation and n p o we will treat the hypocalcemia if we note a presence of this case antibiotics is also necessary when we if we will be able to establish a concurrent infection and we 're obliged to give cimetidine or any antacid to prevent a stress ulcer from developing so this is a frank case of acute pancreatitis   tape does not record what the other person is saying, just pauses so may twenty-three today is june fifteen seven plus fifteen twenty-two twenty-two days old he or she  girl good lucky you ha one boy and one girl  hoy albert is already three years old 'no  three three and a half oh good  you know how to space your children good family planning is there any problem  oh i see so this is your first well-baby check-up she 's cute okay she 's big and very active good suck ha  it looks hungry are you breastfeeding  why not  no you just have to be patient just let your baby suck so flow will improve you know the stimulus to improve i mean increase your secretion is sucking now every time your baby sucks she is sending a signal to your brain to produce some more milk it 's just like saying mom i need some more milk  so you produce some more milk whereas if you bottle-feed your baby at the time when you 're supposed to give her your breast there will be no more sucking and you will be sending a negative feedback so you stop producing milk because she doesn't need your milk anymore now in order that your secretion will increase all you have to do is let your baby suck it 's really sucking that improves the secretion  yes it may be painful but that is only temporary after some time you learn to adjust and there will be no more pain you know it will be very unfortunate if you stop breastfeeding your baby now because there 's just too much too many advantages not only do you establish a good maternal bonding that is a close relationship between you and your baby it is also very economical although i know you can afford to buy these expensive formulas but that is not enough your baby is a human being and you are supposed to give her human milk not cow 's milk then not only that 'no  the most important thing is your milk contains a lot of antibodies and these will help protect your baby from common infection well you know even if you have cough or colds if it is contagious whether or not you breastfeed your baby she will get it but if you breastfeed her you 'll be giving her antibodies so her resistance will improve and she will recover faster you see i 'm speaking from experience ha  more than a doctor i am a mother breastfeeding mother i have five kids and i breastfeed all of them funny 'no  you know every time i get pregnant a lot of these uhm medical representatives offer me their their formulas they 're giving it for free and yet i still breastfeed my baby and you know the feeling is terrific there is a feeling of contentment  you know another thing if you are breastfeeding you don't have to sterilize bottles you don't have to worry about formulas getting out of stock or your source of water you know a lot of mothers now are already using this what do you call this mineral water and it 's quite expensive you know and not only that you don't even have to get up at night to to prepare formulas your milk is there safe and ready available any time you need it but of course you you also have to take care of yourself you have to eat and drink a lot and take note ha it is not true that breastfeeding while you 're you 're depressed or you 're tired is bad there 's no such thing  well have i convinced you say yes because if not i will not stop unless you do okay oh by the way do you have a baby book  not yet okay i will give you one you know you 're really lucky ha  i just got it yesterday it 's been out of stock for several months already hmm she 's alright you can start with her vitamins now and be sure to burp your baby after each feeding ha and give sterile water in between feeding  gas pains hmm you know you will minimize gas pains if you let her burp every after feeding and if she still does you may try turning her on her abdomen like this okay like that and then gently pat or stroke her back like this okay and later on she will pass out air good okay bring her back on july eight oh july five for her immunization she will start with b c g then at two months o p v and d p t and so on okay
