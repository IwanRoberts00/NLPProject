""
""
   one of my classmates 
""
""
 except except    cutting all the wires
""
""
you know what one of my classmates told me that i 'm the muse of micpro one

""
""
 'cause i 'm the only girl    yup
""
""

""
""
i don't care
""
""
really
""
""
i don't care as long as one guy thinks
""
""
you 're the cutest
""
""
yeah one of my classmates told me
""
""
can you picture yourself being classmates with  joseph 
""
""
i don't know  chuckle    parang  it 's like i don't know
""
""
you 're going to be very shy about it
""
""
yes
""
""
and you 're going you 're not going to uh you 're    not going  to talk
""
""
 yes    i 'm not going to talk 'cause with all his  barkadas  there i don't think i 'll be able to make you know be the usual
""
""
you 're not going to be your usual talkative self
""
""
no i 'm not talkative i 'm usually quiet
""
""
really
""
""
yes
""
""
i really thought  na  you 're a chatterbox
""
""
no you 're the chatterbox
""
""
me
""
""
yes
""
""
even though i constantly get uh the best conduct in high school
""
""
that was in high school that was in high school  that 's different   
""
""
 i am quiet    i am quiet in my class
""
my teacher in english can say that
""
""
oh
""
""
i really don't talk i really don't talk that 's why i know  na  she 'll never give me that five bonus points 'cause i never talk
""
""
you never talk but this is the proof that you talk
""
""
this is the only proof this is our only proof  i mean when she when she asked me in in class sometimes i talk in one sentence i mean it 's the limit
""
""
one sentence only
""
""
 ha  you should see reynolds he doesn't talk i mean when when my teacher in english class calls him  it 's as if he 's at a loss
""
he 's always like that i mean my teacher looks at him  incredib  i mean incredulously
""
but you know what my english teacher looks like my auntie you see she really looks like my auntie
""
""
really
""
""
yeah
""
""
do you have a demo
""
""
when
""
""
for your english class
""
""
no
""
she just wants us to submit the revised paper on april eight
""
""
uh uh uhm in our class we have
""
""
well she she told us  na  she 's implementing a different syllabus in our class
""
""
uh
""
""
but you know it 's better  pero  it 's so slow 'cause when i proposed my thesis proposal this term  ano  i passed i passed it i passed the paper long before my teacher discussed about r r land abstract
 that 's why i 'm at a loss
""
""
you are at a loss
""
""
at a loss
""
so when so when my teacher in thesis  propos  in the thesis proposal asked me if i 'm going to propose that my proposal i declined
""
well when i look at my  propo  at my  re  review of related literature it looks like one whole paragraph then loose paper
""
it was segmented to something it was divided into sections  kaya  i didn't know how to make 
""
""
how to make
""
""
an r r l alright then
""
""
oh i see
""
""
i 'm getting hungry let 's go eat
""
""
okay i 'm getting hungry too
""
""
but we have to go home right away right
""
