 maraming maraming salamat po't maraming salamat po't magandang umaga sa inyong lahat 
""
uh in behalf of the department of environment and natural resources it is a gle great pleasure to be here with you today especially since i 'm among the youth the very people who will inherit this land this planet from our generation and the people responsible for humankind 's ecological future
""
it was the mistaken notion molded by an education of the past era that has led us to the problems which we face today in environment
""
this mistaken notion that man can subjugate nature and his environment has led us to the destruction of our forests the pollution of our air and our waterways and the general despoliation of the natural quality of life on earth
""
one of the most revealing lessons learned during the past two decades of environmental awakening in the philippines is that the maintenance of the earth 's delicate balance by the prophylactics of pollution control and other ecological mitigation measures cannot ensure environmental harmony
""
there is now a compelling need to overhaul existing concepts of development with its traditionally exclusive focus on economic principles and political economy of natural resources and marry marry these concepts with the imperatives of nature and the environment
""
the evidence of our failed delusions is all around us
""
the disappearance of our once lush forests has resulted in floods or on the other extreme a soon to be expected drought again
""
because of such phenomena we have seen the destruction of our crop lands and the attendant problems such as famine and greater poverty 
""
pollution on the other hand has killed many of our rivers and streams
""
in metro manila all of our rivers are biologically dead destroying our fishpond habitats and aiding the multiplication of disease vectors
""
air pollution and this you see very often has likewise thickened the atmosphere of our urban centers creating the health problems previously thought of to exist only in highly industrialized countries 
""
the main causes of deforestation alone are socially and economically rooted
""
the demographics of the uplands have changed tremendously from those of a quarter of a century ago due to the migration of marginalized lowlanders to the last frontiers of the uplands
""
many of these lowlanders were forced to migrate to the uplands because of low farm incomes caused by inappropriate food pricing policies increasing costs of farm inputs and by the diminished soil fertility
""
then too we should not forget the social conditions caused by a deeply rooted feudalism whose grip continues its hold in our rural areas to this very day
""
the flight of these hapless farmers to the uplands has swelled the numbers of uplanders all over the country to as many as eighteen million filipinos imagine that eighteen million filipinos in the uplands that 's the forests and the mountains
""
and they have put an equivalent and even growing pressure on the fragile upland ecosystem
""
imagine the kind of pressure that eighteen million filipinos will bring to our uplands for housing and infrastructure for firewood for slash-and-burn agriculture and of course the lure to participate in the profitable illegal logging activities
""
this has in turn created more problems for the lowlands resulting in floods and siltation which has robbed our croplands of their vitality thus exacerbating the already marginalized small farmers
""
this situation has only encouraged more migration either to the uplands or to the already crowded urban areas and even to the even more fragile coastal areas
""
thus a vicious cycle of poverty and degradation has been created feeding into itself and locked in place by social inequity and injustice
""
and yet we suffer all of these things without the material progress achieved in the developed quote unquote west but only with the poverty that the depleted and despoiled natural resource base brings
""
quite obviously the answer to this vicious cycle is a systemic one solutions that will drive wedges that will break this cycle
""
we have found out that traditional concepts of economic growth of development at all cost caused environmental degradation
""
however this unbridled pursuit of progress has for many developing countries including the philippines resulted in quite the opposite where the degraded environment in turn causes poverty resulting in an ever descending cycle of penury and ultimately death
""
the perceived solution is the concept of sustainable development which calls for use of natural resources for development in such a way that the current generations will not foreclose or preclude the use by future generations of the same resources
""
harvesting only the increment without touching the base
""
expending only the interest without touching the capital
""
in the face of these the government has gradually integrated this concept into pertinent policies affecting the environment through the philippine strategy for sustainable development
""
sustainable development stresses the need to view environmental protection and economic growth as mutually compatible and in third world countries mutually reinforcing even inextricably linked
 this implies that the growth objectives should be compatible not only to the needs of society for greater equity and social justice but also to the natural dynamics and carrying capacity of the earth 's ecosystem
""
following the p s s d therefore government and society are called upon to look back to the root cause of this problem which among others is the inequity that continues to fan discontent in the rural areas
""
there are three root causes of environmental degradation that we have found
""
one is great overpopulation and continuing increase in population
""
second is the pervasive poverty of our people
""
and third most important and systemic difficulty is the lack of social equity 
""
the uh concepts like land reform rural industrialization agricultural pricing policies that are not biased towards the wants only of the urban population should therefore be pursued
""
you have to remember that whenever you in the urban areas  req  require demand for lower prices of rice for example you rob the marginalized farmers in the uplands and in the rural areas of due profit 
""
so  we say that  in rural development that could help seventy percent of our population catch up with the opportunities and resources available to their luckier urban brethren should be made a reality
""
and to those already in the uplands we should offer opportunities that will make them realize that planting trees and nurturing forests are more rewarding both in the short and the long term than cutting them down
""
we need to show these upland farmers that the opportunities they have come to look for in the forests in the mountains in the uplands can only be obtained if the forests are still there
""
for the last four years this has been the crux of our department 's policies and programs for the uplands to offer security of tenure and better livelihood in exchange for security of forests
""
such programs for example as the national forestation program where large swaths of denuded forests are being planted are now being used in order to contract families who are in the uplands
""
marginalized families who would otherwise not have any income contracted out in order to plant trees for the government and get paid for it
""
so that we no longer wait for the trickle-down effect of the economy but we insist that at the very first instance the profit and the benefit of the economy should go directly to the upland farmers
""
the integrated social forestry program for example
""
we have eighteen million filipinos who are potential  kaingeros  in the forests
""
in the integrated social forestry program this calls for granting every family in the uplands who are now squatters or considered squatters 'cause they do not have uh rights or access to that land would be given three hectares or thereabouts for twenty-five years  renewable for another twenty-five years
""
so they could plant a little  fo  vegetable or whatever they want
""
in return they should keep the forest intact at least the forest within their three hectares
""
and the community forestry program this is the most important program we are going into because this would transfer large areas twenty thousand ten thousand hectares of forest land from the private sector uh usually the timber license agreement holder or the t l a holder now considered the loggers they are called
""
from the loggers to be transferred to the community who are really better protectors of the forest
""
it is hoped that with the  communi  community forestry program the farmers would understand that if they keep the forests intact they will be the ones to be able to extract rather than the foreigners or the rich people from manila and the other urban areas
""
so that they will be reinforced they will be given incentive to really protect the forest because nobody else can protect it
""
government cannot protect it
""
government does not have money
""
therefore these programs have been revitalized and implemented complementarily in order to help the uplanders fulfill their dreams of land to till of a place to live in livelihood through reforestation and future opportunities through small scale logging and agro-forest and agro-forestry activities
""
as i said wedges to break the vicious cycle
""
but still this is not enough
""
as we have said again before the greater changes lie in structural solutions
""
these are the better  1 word  that we must take now or forever resign ourselves to an impoverished and despoiled country
""
this requires changing attitudes about wealth about development and even about day-to-day habits in other words moving towards sustainable development as a way of life
""
though interventions can begin today toward reforming our lifestyles and our conventions complete transformation to sustainable development can only be realistically achieved during the next generation
""
this is the reason why we always take time out to talk to the youth for it is your generation which will complete this transformation
""
it is your ideas your concepts of equity and justice your concern for the poor your concern for the environment your selflessness rather than selfishness and your untiring efforts upon which a new order a sustainable society can and will be built
""
seek the truths now
""
for we of the older generation shall soon hand over the baton to the next generation who will lead us hopefully to a bright prosperous and environmentally secure future
""
thank you and good day
""
""
""
""
 thank you uh allan for that wonderful introduction
""
mr rex villareal president of uh   words  who invited me and the officers of the la salle 's business management society 
""
good afternoon fellow la sallites and friends
""
i 'm back here in our campus after a long absence and i 'm happy to be back
""
i have come this afternoon upon the invitation of some of the de la salle leaders to have an exchange of views to de la salle community
""
and i am looking forward to our discussion
""
i welcome this opportunity to have this dialogue with you
""
i have come to realize that the learning process never ends
""
and so i have come today not only to be able to present some of my views on matters which affect all of us  but also to listen and learn from each and everyone of you
""
i hope you will make this brief visit a fruitful one by your active participation in the open forum which should follow my very brief remarks
""
de la salle will always hold pleasant memories for me  coughing 
""
this is where i grew up and was the scene of my formative years
""
but i did not join you today to talk about the good old days nor dwell in the past
""
i came to talk a little about our future as a people and as a nation
""
there are few unaware that these are not the best of times for virtually every filipino
""
the country remains poor as ever
""
three out of four filipinos are living below or close to the poverty line
""
crisis confronts our people in virtually every aspect of their existence whether it be economic political or social
""
even college graduates are no longer assured of jobs once they are through with their studies
""
tens of thousands of our professionals now have to seek employment abroad in order to be assured of a decent life
""
the prospects for our economy are not nearly as bright as they used to be
""
philippine business would have to contend with the shortages of money energy and credit
""
in the meantime  the labor force would have to grapple with less employment opportunities and high prices which erode the meager savings of our people
""
and yet despite the many problems we face as a people i have not yet given up on this country
""
i am still hopeful that we can carve out for ourselves a better future and a brighter tomorrow
""
but we must get our act together as a people
""
i urge you the students of de la salle to be more aware of our national situation and to be more involved in our efforts to set things right in this country
""
it is our obligation yours and mine to do what we can to get this country back on its feet
""
i am sure you realize you belong to a privileged class for indeed you do belong to a privileged class
""
everyone who gets a chance to have a college education and graduates belongs to an increasingly small minority
""
i am told that only eighteen percent of those who enter grade school finally finish college
""
that is a drop-out rate of eighty-two percent a statistic that we must attempt to change if we have to have the people to manage our growth or uh our growth and development in the future
""
but along with this privilege comes responsibility because you belong to this group which is better educated and possesses the skills which will prove valuable to philippine society
""
you must therefore be prepared to take on greater burdens
""
among the many things we must do as a people in order to move ahead i believe the most important among them would be to focus on three things
""
first we must try to focus our energies and our resources bringing about the recovery in our economy
""
our people need jobs
""
government needs more revenues
""
students like you and the fresh graduates need more opportunities and avenues for  1 word 
""
our people must be productive rather than idle
""
the way to our survival is creation of new and more than
""
second we need reforms in our government
""
reforms that would reduce corruption
""
reforms that could assure the people particularly those who have less in life that basic services would be available to everybody without fear or favor
""
reforms that would make government and public officials more responsive to the needs of every citizen
""
and finally we need leadership
""
we need leaders who could organize our people motivate and inspire them to take on the burdens of rebuilding this nation
""
leaders who could form governments which in turn could impose order and restore stability so that we could live peaceful and eventually prosperous lives
""
politics has become too important to be left to politicians alone
""
all of us must now be involved
""
our prospects for the future are at stake
""
i wish to remind you that your destiny is really in your hands
""
two out of every three filipino voters come from the ages of eighteen to thirty-nine
""
it is you who will determine who will be our leaders in nineteen ninety-two
""
it is through your activism that a new era in philippine politics could come about
""
so be conscious of your role
""
be aware of what you can do as a group and be reminded of your responsibility not only to yourselves and to your parents but of your higher responsibility to this nation
""
i have already taken up some of your time
 let us now proceed to the real substance of my visit
""
let us begin our dialogue and i will be privileged to hear your views and to answer your questions
""
all i can say is i will try to answer your questions as frankly as i can as a friend and not as a politician
""
thank you fellow la sallites
