mr chairman mr chairman mr chairman uhm i would like to reiterate uh the statements uh propounded by the honorable uh escudero of sorsogon and uh with due reference also to the statements made by the lawyers uh earlier uh by saying that we would see that the the law word is suddenly word so in that sense the uh support of the statement of the honorable uh congressman from sorsogon i would read the law the last paragraph of section twenty-nine of republic act seventy- one sixty-six republic act seven one six six is an act to provide for the synchronization of the national and local elections and to provide electoral reform that is the title of the law and in section twenty-nine last paragraph if i may read the certificate of canvass prepared by the commission board of canvassers shall be supported by a statement of votes by municipality and the original copy of for the congress shall in addition be supported by statement of votes by precinct as submitted to the provincial board of canvassers by city or municipal board of canvassers  very clear in the law that you see a board of canvassers is mandated to place in this ballot box not only the c o c the municipal uh the s o v by municipality and as well the s o v by precinct it is mandatory unlike the requirement to submit election returns  on site . this one is very specific that it should be included here in this ballot box and therefore this is in line also for the uh word  with section thirty of the law that whenever we discover there are erasures and there are uh alteration we have to refer to these documents and when we discover erasures and uh or alterations in an s o v by precinct if it is not words  so may i may i suggest in the same way as the honorable escudero suggested two days ago that in the meantime we defer this uh ballot uh ballot box uh uh for uh the province of uh quirino while we are producing the uh the s o v after all this will just be uh reported uh in the same way as we have summoned the witnesses for the comelec candidate without delaying let us proceed to the other the other ballot boxes in that way we will be able uh to have an understanding of  word and not necessarily delay this canvassing mr chairman  thank you very much mr speaker mr speaker uh i have been wondering why there shall be an adjournment really uh since uh this has even caused the delay in the in the canvassing we have already made a headway and suddenly surprisingly uh notice were sent to us and for purposes of uh adjournment uh as been uh said as provided in the constitution that mr speaker i dont quite agree that we should adjourn considering the fact that we are also mandated at this instance to do uh the canvassing the constitution does not make any distinction whether we are functioning as a legislative or as a canvassing the uh the word uh the house of representatives is is in session is  to say that there are certain responsibilities there are certain activities that must be performed by congress when it is in in session contrary to when congress is in recess where members of the house are not doing its regular work and canvassing is part of the regular work of congress being enshrined in the constitution now this adjournment by the looks alone of the members uh not in agreement with each other might create a crisis might even uh be raised in the supreme court because we might not be able to proceed mr speaker i m afraid that there must be an or there was a reason why this adjournment is called and i m afraid that with this the agenda is not to continue the canvassing and i m afraid that if we dont continue this canvassing there will be no proclamation especially fernando poe is already leading so therefore i am for the continu continuing of the session and that we will be able to canvass the uh  thank you mr speaker if i may add uh my unsolicited two cents  worth of opinion to this uh proceeding mr speaker if we do adjourn sine die this afternoon we are not adjourning congress we are adjourning the regular session of congress which is provided in section fifteen of article six of the philippine constitution note mr speaker that section fifteen speaks of congress convening once every year on the fourth monday of july for its regular session unless a different date is fixed by law and shall continue to be in session that means in regular session for such number of days as it may determine until thirty days before the opening of the next regular session i agree mr speaker with the honorable flo majority leader that it is not congress that is adjourned when we adjourn our regular session we do not terminate the existence of congress after we adjourn our regular session we can be called to a special session before the termination or the expiration of the term of office of the members of this house on june thirty now when we do meet again in joint public session in order to proclaim the winning presidential and vice-presidential candidate that joint public session mr speaker i submit is in the nature of a special session it is in the nature of a special session that need not be called by the president of the philippines because section four of article seven specifically calls congress precisely to that joint public session for the purpose of canvassing and later proclaiming the president-elect and the vice-president-elect then there should be no controversy it is not mr speaker that congress is schizophrenic that it has multi- personalities even as it does have multi-duties and functions the matter of legislation is taken up in its regular and special sessions the matter of canvass is taken up in this joint public session which uh uh is provided by section fourteen true there are man there are different functions of congress but this does not at all detract from the fact that congress must as a legislative body perform its function and so mr speaker i hope that i have contributed a bit to clarify the matter  thank you mr chairman mr chairman to underscore the fact that congress continues to exist as a body congress may be called to a special session by the president of the philippines if it is called to a special session that is recognition that congress is still existing all the way up to june thirty now is it necessary for the president to call congress to a special session in order that it may sit as a national canvassing board i submit no because the constitution itself in section four of article seven already calls congress to sit as a special session it would be superfluous for us to ask the president of the philippines to call congress to a special session since after all when the president calls congress to a special session it is in order that the congress may take up legislative matters in this particular instance we have the constitution itself calling congress to sit as a national canvassing board independently of any call for a special session by the president thank you mr chairman  uh mr presi mr chairman clears throat i think uh we should distinguish the various rules we have here there can be no question that both the congressmen and the senators all of us here should remain in office up to june thirty so up to june thirty we re still senators we re still congressmen nobody can deprive us of that so as senators and congressmen what will we what are we supposed to do now so much has been uh raised about section fifteen the rule on legislative powers which reads that congress shall convene once every year on the fourth monday of july for its for its regular session unless a different date is fixed by law and etcetera etcetera what s referred to by section fifteen is regular session so under our legislative calendar our regular session ended in i think july uh june june eleven that is our regular session so the question is is congress deprived of other things my respectful submission mr chairman is that no  if you scan the powers of congress you will notice that if the president of the philippines should declare martial law or suspend the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus congress is duty-bound within forty-eight hours to meet to approve or disapprove of the action of the president without need of call in fact and then whatever congress does cannot be changed by the president so that even now if should the president of the philippines suspend the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus or impose martial law we can meet and approve or disapprove what the president has done so with that mr president we have powers continuing powers which cannot be deprived by even an adjournment of congress adjournment is nothing more than adjournment and as i alluded to earlier assuming that there was adjournment that adjournment referred to the regular session but more directly to the point mr president mr chairman in our role as canvassers we should look to section four on the executive department which is the canvassing powers little noticed is this provision the person having the highest number of votes shall be proclaimed elected but in case two or more shall have an equal and highest number of votes one of them shall forthwith be chosen by the vote of uh a majority of all members of both houses of congress voting separately  what does this mean mr chairman it means that should in the remote possibility that there is a tie we are called upon to break the tie as legislators not even as canvassers why because that is a power a sovereign power vested in us to choose or break the tie and the moment we break the tie whoever we favor becomes president of the philippines that is a reserve power so even now should our canvass say that there s a tie we can meet and break the tie i i ve brought two ins uh uh two instances mr uh mr chairman clears throat why the pres why congress has still continuing powers to convene even after the adjournment last june eleven because there are certain powers that we must exercise if the exigencies arise that s why mr chairman all of this all of this uh debate is not really to the point because we have still reserve powers which we ll have to exercise i i so it s my respectful submission mr chairman that uh we continue to have powers we can convene any time up to the end of our terms because our powers are not diminished one whit up to june thirty we are not deprived of anything we only followed the rule of rule uh i mean section fifteen which says that thirty days before the end of session we have to uh uh we have to adjourn but that is refers only to regular session so mr chairman i think we proceed and uh go on on with the canvass because uh uh i dont think that the uh uh assertion that uh we have adjourned uh i think has no uh constitutional leg to stand on thank you mr chairman  mr chairman while i agree with the uh recommendation of senator pimentel that uh following section fifteen and also following the ruling we made on the biliran case that uh those uh missing documents if ever should should should be produced uh within the day that is provided in our rules but at the same time strictly speaking uh uh mr chairman going by the standards that uh is are provided for in section fourteen uh the c o c of capiz uh is is authentic and duly executed and the discrepancy noted on the face of the c o c is not uh the discrepancy that is uh uh described or of  wh in section fourteen cause in section fourteen it says no discrepancy in other authentic copies of uh the certificate of canvass or discrepancy in the votes of or of any candidate in words and figures in the same certificate so strictly speaking we did not go through that exercise in the determination of authenticity and due execution but yun  just for the sake of sat satisfying ourselves about this seeming uh uh inconsistency in the phase we went through that but i dont think that it is necessary in the determination of due execution and authenticity therefore mr speaker i think it is in order for us to proceed with the canvass of uh the uh capiz c o c while at the same time you know uh i as i said that i agree with the recommendation of uh senator pimentel as provided for in section fifteen and as we agreed upon in the uh biliran case mr speaker
