it 's saturday afternoon a gorgeous afternoon for basketball welcome to the u double a p second game today between two bitter rivals de la salle university green archers and the university of santo tomas growling tigers that 's your second game today and of course today cyrus baguio comes back against la salle the last time cyrus met the green archers was way back in nineteen ninety-nine and of course we all know that he missed all of last year since nineteen ninety-nine the tigers didn't win over the green archers cyrus baguio and the growling tigers will meet the green archers this afternoon live from the rizal memorial coliseum i 'm mico halili with of course mr randy sacdalan to bring you today 's big game well good afternoon to you mico and uh you know la salle and u s t whenever they play it is always a rivalry partner and tonight today we 're gonna see that rivalry again here at the rizal it 's overflowing here at the rizal memorial and boy it 's so difficult to get a parking it 's so difficult to get inside the rizal memorial what is not difficult is to find out if these two teams are considered the top teams going into this tournament as we look at the team standings of course la salle with an immaculate three zero slate tied up with arch rival ateneo and then u s t not far behind with two wins and just one loss oh yeah u s t wants to tie up uh la salle at three and one after this ballgame and wants just to keep ateneo on top with a three and zero rating but the way u s t is playing you know it 's very difficult really to take u s t this is a different u s t team mico that we 're watching this year compared to last year certainly they have an inside track to get to the top they almost did it against ateneo uh but against la salle i think they will try again and see and continue and break away the pattern of a win then they lose and then they win and hopefully today they 'll try to avert a loss against la salle so they 're tigers are trying to go for a winning streak there but that will be hard against this balanced la salle offensive attack now many people felt that going into this year la salle would be a mike cortez team but that 's not the case you have to guard people like mac-mac cardona joseph yeo and adonis santa maria if you wish to stop the green archers but partner easily the fifty-five points for uh de la salle cardona yeo santa maria and cortez it 's so easy for them to score but you know that this plan of attack just makes it difficult really for the comp  uh other opponents to play against a team that is so explosive inside out in well for santa maria and yeo this is really a surprise to cardona he 's leading the pack for de la salle of course so that 's la salle 's balanced attack now for the growling tigers what uh their fans are very happy about is the return of the dunking duo as you look at the cool cat mike cortez there 's joseph yeo uh green archers really leaning on the scoring production of uh these uh players oh yes and uh you know if it 's not for the shot of yeo a lot of people say la salle could 've been over in that game against n u but in the case of the u s t growling tigers if you go by numbers mico they have five as compared to the four of la salle i think u s t at this end would have the advantage but look espiritu one of reasons for espiritu and for baguio i 've never seen him with the fire in the eyes of cyrus baguio gelig hubalde and loanzon would just complement how u s t is so potent this year and so far that potential has turned out to be a reality for coach aric del rosario so keep in mind uh everyone uh u s t the last seven meetings they 've had against the green archers they haven't won so total combination for the green archers uh since nineteen ninety-nine and the dunking duo alwin espiritu of the growling tigers they are eager to get back at the green archers this year we 'll bring you la salle versus u s t after this very short break  commercial break  uh u s t growling tigers coming into this game with two wins and one loss they defeated adamson on the op uh on the opening weekend then lost to ateneo and then blasted u p just days ago and of course the u s t fans coming into this game full force because they know this they have a very very good chance of finally beating la salle after seven straight losses as we look at the starting line-ups well they 're trying to break the spell this afternoon mico and for ev for any las la salle u s t game it 's an event both in along taft avenue and along espa&ntilde;a and they brought the challenge here along vito cruz you know this is the probably the best probably for for u s t to hack out a win over la salle la salle after uh three games has been exposed in that game against n u and for u s t they know they have a chance against la salle today green archers coming into this game with a perfect three wins and zero loss record nico vainio can't pick up the loose ball and it 's with iago raterta so here 's the u s t starting line-up gelig manansala raterta espiritu and baguio a goal quickly to the big man against manny ramos who and is tapped almost stolen by vainio loose ball picked up by gelig five on the shot clock gelig fires and it 's no good rebound goes to cortez it 's cortez cardona santa maria vainio ramos standard issue starting five for coach franz pumaren manny ramos top of the key looking at santa maria there 's a long pass and he cannot be stopped for that easy two the two big men passing around u s t employing the zone santa maria getting that uh ball and the two points for la salle noisy background and so to another part of the ball game  well so far this season cortez is fifty percent from the line he was last year 's uh recipient of the sportsmanship award misses two free throws but the offensive rebound goes to the archers  now here 's cardona zigzagging through but gets lost that is a match-up to watch mico cyrus baguio blocking mac-mac cardona this early they 're paying attention to the leading scorer of de la salle check out this rexona solid defense play brought to you by the twenty-four hour rexona your best defense against odor and wetness rexona it won't let you down there are two players down on the floor and it 's an offensive foul against nico vainio well he saw the opening go to the basket but the defense was steady against him first foul on nico vainio ten all is the count we can really feel the sixteen drums of u s t behind us mico  laughs well you know you talk about la salle and u s t you 're basically talking about the two most dominant teams in the last ten years in the last ten seasons u s t had four championships la salle four championships and then f e u with the two championships in ninety-seven and ninety-two and you know what u s t doesn't want to happen is for la salle to break that four-peat for the four straight championships for u s t la salle is attempting its fifth straight and that would eclipse the record of u s t of course u e with a win earlier of course they 're smiling saying well try to beat our seven-peat back in the seventies b laughs okay let 's take this time-out the ballgame is tied at ten all between the archers and the tigers we have a time-out we 'll be back after this short break noisy background and so to another part of the ball game  wait a minute who 's in and who 's out so raterte sits down not baguio baguio thought he 's the one who 's who 's gonna be seated but he 's maintained on the floor for u s t with a score at twenty-one sixteen five-point lead for u s t and tang loses the ball against edsel del rosario it 's always a challenge for la salle when mike cortez sits down t y tang comes in he needs to be warmed-up to take control of that leather de guzman was part of the all-rookie team last year here 's gelig from the right side they go to espiritu at the post the pull-up is no good sharma with the rebound archers down by five and the xavier boys are in the back court tang and yeo  tang on the right side over to sharma from seven feet  words with that important shot from sharma for de la salle sharma now with four points in the game a three-point lead for the tigers time is running out in the first quarter gelig shaking and baking and pulling ten points in the first quarter for ni&ntilde;o gelig so it 's as if he has already hit his total for the game and ni&ntilde;o still has so much to give for u s t tang to sharma on the right side again to gelig sharma goes to yeo nine on the shot clock yeo couldn't pass air ball goes to cabatu the rebound but he lost the ball picked up by words there 's the rebound  cheering drumming noises  tigers up by five gelig he slightly overshoots two seconds to go tang needs to hurry up and he needs to launch it buzzer  but he wasn't aware of the time so that 's how we 'll end the first quarter of the play the growling tigers are certainly roaring ni&ntilde;o gelig with ten big points to lead the tigers and give them a five-point lead twenty-three eighteen we 'll be back with the second quarter in just a while  commercial break  the former green archer dindo pumaren of the pumaren clan is here supporting uh their brother franz pumaren who is coaching the green archers hopefully to a fifth straight round the perennial tip-in that 's settled yes partner joseph yeo has has the intentions but of course he had the advantage over caba alvin espino partner ni&ntilde;o gelig was really a soaring tiger for u s t he 's had ten points and he 's given the uh the energy to give them the five-point lead over the archers after one quarter so welcome to the second quarter friends between u s t and de la salle as de guzman misses that time espiritu with the rebound the power hook that won't go in but look at the tigers go for the board vizcarra is fouled and sharma says enough is enough 3 words by espiritu  laughs oh my gosh what a game inside again u s t having trouble the same trouble they had with ateneo look at the block here posted by carlo sharma vizcarra would somehow get that rebound and then sharma would just wait in and there 's the block without even jumping brought to you by rexona your best defense against odor and wetness rexona it won't let you down joseph yeo spins fires all the way difficult shot and it goes in and out edsel del rosario so far words twenty-foot shot at the point for the tigers they set up 3 words  ready to double team vizcarra with a deadly three-point shooter but he misses the basket so the archers start the second quarter with yeo tang jun-jun cabatu wilson and sharma and here 's jun-jun cabatu with an air ball loose ball picked up by wilson a looping shot a veteran move there for willy wilson just a dribble soft touch inside the shaded area to push la salle within three twenty-three to twenty tigers meantime start the second quarter with uh vizcarra del rosario de guzman espiritu and villamin del rosario on the left side again they go to the big man espiritu who is averaging fifteen points per game wilson with the rebound archers still down by three wilson to cabatu this is santiago cabatu jr who goes to william wilson  oh   wilson is blocked and de guzman gives it quickly to vizcarra vizcarra is zigzagging through goes to tonton villamin for three he loves the three-point shot this tonton villamin la salle better watch him out against ateneo he pumped two three-point shots all in the first period with now a six-point lead for the growling tigers their biggest lead of the game a foul is called against mon espiritu you know that 's something they have to watch out he was just trying to screen out nickname tang second foul on nickname espiritu
