""
""
the political capital he used to have also had eroded
""
""
uh-huh
""
""
and the problem here is that uh uh the rate of erosion may start slow but then it could accelerate if nothing is done to uh to uh well uh attend to the basic concerns of the public and these concerns i identified earlier as being largely economic
""
""
yeah and on the part of the president himself it serves as a wake-up call for him and his government
""
""
well i 'd like to think not on the part of the  gov  of uh the president alone but on the part of the  peo  people immediately around him
""
""
immediately around him
""
""
the cabinet members and to a great extent even those who would comprise his administration beyond his cabinet senators who have been working with him congressmen also may be said to  co  comprise his official family
""
and to some extent in a very basic sense the general public will have to be interested too in how the president responds to the feelings of the people as for instance expressed in a survey like this
""
""
on top of the list of complaints by the people against the president is he 's insistent 
""
some describe it as his stubbornness to amend the constitution 
""
now in your survey forty-two percent is against amending the constitution at any time
""
""
yeah
""
""
and we believe that it is one of the factors that brought him down
""
""
well uh we checked for that
""
""
uh uhm
""
""
but it seems not to  swim  we looked into uh whether the people who uh who feel that the constitution must not be amended at any time your forty-two percent     or even a higher proportion fifty-seven percent who feel that constitutional amendments at this point in time right now uh are not quite right
""
""
 uh uhm  
""
""
now among these people we checked how many of them would still be uh approving of the president  and how many of them would express disapproval, we were quite surprised to find out that a majority     even within this group who are of     yes of the forty-two percent or of the fifty-seven percent are still expressing approval for the way he has run the presidency the administration the government
""
""
 uh uhm  
""
 the forty-two percent  
""
despite his opposition to  words 
""
""
what this means is that the constitutional issue the issue of amending the constitution is not really all that salient yet not all that important yet and we tested for that
 out of sixteen issues socioeconomic and political and public safety issues uh people rated the issue of constitutional amendments as number uh fourteen
""
""
of the concerns
""
""
 oo  with number one being the most important therefore this is something that to them is not all that salient 
""
that is why even when they disagree with the president on this matter since it is not all that salient yet from their point of view then this president 's capital is not eroded all that much
""
""
uh-huh uh-huh the most the most urgent personal concern as listed on table eight of the survey uh is to avoid being sick and to stay healthy
""
the september two to sixteen survey indicated fifty-four percent considers this
""
""
the number one priority
""
""
now  yes  what does this say
""
""
this is a very this is a very understandable thing 
""
when you are speaking of a people who are largely poor  and people who are threatened by by unemployment  and when they are employed they have low wages  then to them the  bet  basic concern the most basic concern is that one should not get sick
""
but uh that is for most of the public or poor
""
what is interesting is also that among those who are better off this is also a major concern 
""
and when we looked into that we realized that uh even among those who are better off uhm when they do get sick they require medical attention that uh could cost them quite a bit and therefore   there 
""
""
  words   
""
""
that 's right 
""
okay  therefore there is really a universal concern about uh about one getting getting sick
""
""
uh-huh uh-huh if we look at table nine  the most urgent national concerns  on top of the list is the low pay of workers which represents fifty-eight percent on the september two to sixteen survey
""
in the last survey of may twenty-one and june seven it was sixty-one percent
""
why did it go down
""
""
it did not
""
actually those proportions the fifty-eight percent and the sixty-one percent would be roughly the same
""
""
uh oh yeah
""
""
roughly the same
""
""
 extrapolation 
""
""
yes  oo 
""
""
the second is high prices of people 's basic necessities
""
and then the  povert  the poor people the the recovery of the economy
""
well the constitutional change is way down below with only eight percent  for this particular survey
""
""
yeah yeah
""
""
so it 's not the issue of the day  laughter 
""
""
yes i think that is why when people put uh quite a bit of uh importance on the constitution this is something that we personally may believe in that the constitution is always important 
""
but uh given you know the priorities of what may be considered more urgent than just urgent among a series of concerns that are all urgent  then the constitutional issue is less urgent  the low pay is the highest concern
""
""
uh uhm  the rising prices of commodities  the low pay  uh the peace and order situation are tops on our concerns
""
""
in that order yes
""
""
in that order
 now professor  let me first take on this comment on line from malabon mr archie santiago
""
 dapat huwag unahin ni presidente sina lucio tan danding cojuangco at imelda marcos ginagamit niya ang mahirap para sa kaibigan niyang mayaman 
""
did the cronyism issue came out uh come out on this survey
""
""
 uh meron tayong  issue  riyan ng uh ng ano yung  coddling
""
""
yeah  coddling  at seventy-eight percent coddling of well known people who dominated and gained much during the marcos era
""
""
we even have also graft and corruption
 graft and corruption would be fairly well addressed about half of the public would say that this is a major concern it is an urgent concern for the public to address for the government to address
""
""
the flip-flopping on the politics of government
""
did that have a a toll on on the popularity of the president for example his change of of the death penalty decisions from life to death uh the commutation of sentences and all
""
""
in this survey uhm these specific very specific issues had not been tested for but uh i i think i can say with some degree of uhm confidence that uh when all of these issues are put together  then in the public mind they register some idea of uh perhaps indecisiveness 
""
also the idea that uh there is not quite that needed constancy or consistency  in decision-making and therefore you do find some some people  basically those who are better off who would still be supportive of the president let 's say  last june  by a majority of uh what sixty-two sixty-four percent  this level would still be majority but it is now at fifty-two 
""
now these are the people who would demand much more consistency and much more clarity much more transparency of the administration
""
the bulk of our people however  are not all that  ano  are not all that driven  as it were to worry about constitutional issues about transparency about uh freedom of the press 
""
they are really overwhelmed by the day to day demands of uh continuing to live to the point where you speak of urgent personal concerns not national
""
""
not national  oo 
""
""
personal concerns  then you 'll find out that the third best uh the third uh best rated that is to say the greatest number of people  would say that their urgent personal concern has to do with simply being able to eat   enough 
""
""
 self-preservation  
""
""
yeah  being able to eat enough every day  and nothing else can be more basic than that 
""
when you are confronted by that problem  then all the other problems become really secondary
""
""
professor i don't know if we can call malaca&ntilde;ang 's reaction to this survey as expected or  pro forma  because it has issued a statement saying that the survey rating of thirteen percent decline in the popularity of the president was attributed to the decisions the president made to keep the republic afloat
""
let 's say the decisions on the oil prices the decisions on on labor  the the call for higher wages these are hard decisions as malaca&ntilde;ang would put it but it has to be made by the president and those are the decisions that pulled him down
""
""
uh yes i think
""
""
is that a correct interpretation or reaction to the survey
""
""
i think some  of the uh some of the depreciation  the decreases  in uh the approval rating of the president may be also attributed to decisions that he made which would not be popular decisions 
""
for instance last year you might remember that uh that uh the president uh uh had a statement to the effect that uh there was not going to be salary increases 
""
and then uh the president also had some statements to make regarding constitutional amendments or provisions of the constitution that would have to be changed
""
there were also quite a few other statements with did not sit which did not sit well at least with some  sectors of our of our uh public 
""
now every time part of the public gets to be disaffected with some statements that the president makes then that costs him  but his uh his core his support is holding and so it is not as if he had become unpopular on account of those decisions which had hit some sectors
""
i think uh the danger that uh may be uh may be discerned in the combination of figures and analysis that could be brought to bear on these figures  is that uh what the president has now is a core that might erode so much faster  and when that happens that will really be a terrible thing
""
""
teresita reyes on-line from laguna  what are the bases of the survey to make it accurate and credible  reliable
 and somebody here is asking about the the percentage of sampling errors and the response errors
""
""
uh okay so 
""
well actually we supplied that  'no 
 uh to guard against to guard against uh inaccurate surveys the testing that is uh uh done and which might be the easiest thing to do is to construct a technically uh legitimate variable or acceptable from the point of view of academic methodology sample 
""
to ensure that you have a representative sample so that when you gather the responses you can actually tick off the entire you know adult population eighteen years old and over so that those inferences could be made 
""
 at  there is another thing and that is even more important that is questionnaire design  how you design the questions 
""
now what we do is we put together questions that uh we pretest for clarity and also which we make certain would flow logically in a face-to-face interview
""
these things are taken care of
""
it 's not the kind of survey where uh you know you uh you put up a question which has not been pre-tested  for clarity or for  lo  or for logic  and then you ask people to register themselves either via a questionnaire or uh via a telephone and you don't check really on how the selection of these people is uh is uh uh done
""
now  historically  surveys in the last uh fifty years have uh have become more and more reliable in terms of reading public opinion as well as uh electoral preferences
 this is not to say that uh that uh the surveys cannot be wrong 
""
there had been some cases when they have been terribly terribly wrong  but when they had been wrong  it was possible to find out why they had gone wrong and where they had gone wrong
""
""
if if i may professor   i 'd like 
""
""
 now may may i   just add as regards that last thing  'no  the sampling  errors 
 given this particular uh uh uh size of uh the sample about twelve hundred     and also given this specific design of the sample then you can read uh most of the uh most of the figures here uh close to fifty percent and down to forty thirty percent as within a margin of error so-called of plus or minus three    
""
""
 one thousand two hundred  
""
 minus three uh-huh  uh-huh  
""
""
that means to say that the figures  within the frame   ha  you come across a forty percent figure then you can read it as forty-three or as thirty-seven or fifty-three as uh if it is fifty it can it could be forty-seven
""
