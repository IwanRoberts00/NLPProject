""
""
 clapping  thank you very much
""
ten thousand apologies
""
it was my fault
""
i we  de  i had an interview with someone else and i didn't realize it was so late
""
so we actually left at five minutes to one
""
and i want to thank the they were so good they were sitting there so quietly you know and i didn't know it was so late already uhm
""
i 'm also happy this is the is this the first time  'no pala  this is the second time i 've entered la salle
""
the other time was somewhere else just before edsa i think it was
""
so i 'm happy to be here with you
""
uhm actually i 've been turning down a lot of the offers for talks  be  requests for talks because i 've been so busy but i couldn't say no to you because uhm our lady 's message is directed specifically to the youth
""
and it 's very important that you know this
""
because even in medjugorje she had one year that she called for all the youth to come
""
and then the next year she had an extension and she 's calling the youth because this is a message that you probably hear sometimes when you graduate whether from high school or college or what
""
and they 'll tell you you know the world is in your hands or you face a hall of life and you can do much to change what 's going to happen
""
but that 's precisely why she 's calling you because it is in your hands and you have to believe it
""
you have to believe it and you can take a hold of it you can grasp it
""
it is within your hands to change the world  wa  in what it 's it 's it 's rushing head long to today
""
and uhm i 'm very happy to hear that that you 're talking about the devil as if he really did exist because sometimes you know there are people who refuse to accept the existence of the devil
""
i have had friends who have told me don't talk about the devil because it 's negative
""
uh uh it 's it 's negative i don't want to upset my children and soon
""
and that 's when he works the hardest and he works the best
""
but when you recognize that he does exist and that you are aware of how he will uh of how he makes use of you and of things of the world then you are already halfway there
""
the key is recognizing
""
that 's what 's happened to this world today
""
and that 's what 's happened to the youth today
""
you see this world teaches you that the devil no longer exists is he or doesn't exist or never has existed
""
this world tells you in terms like positive thinking negative thinking etcetera and so on
""
uh the old ways in which even we were brought up and raised in you know we were brought up and raised into the fact that hey you know there 's a bogeyman out there
""
well it 's true
""
let me tell you there 's a bogeyman out there and he 's working and he 's working with you he 's working with us
""
the first thing that he has set off to destroy is the family and even this our lady has said very specifically in medjugorje
""
the family is the first thing that the devil will attack
""
why
""
because the family is supposed to be uh the haven for love for happiness security uh
""
i think when i think of jesus coming and i think of the fact that jesus came uh as he did many people point out you see jesus ' love for the poor because jesus himself was poor
""
there 's a deeper message than that
""
jesus came in a family
""
jesus could have materialized out of nowhere could have walked out of the desert and started doing all of his miracles and they still would have happened
""
but jesus chose to come in a family
""
why
""
because he wanted to show us that that 's the most important unit uh in the world that exists
""
the most integral unit is the family
""
if you don't if you cannot if people who love each other can't even live together in love meaning giving accepting being kind and and so on to one another sacrificing for one another how much more can you expect to love your neighbor your classmate how much more can you accept uh other people who are not of the same cultural background
""
and later on how can you expect other  count  to love other countries
""
and so that 's what happened
""
you dissolve this integral unit of the family and everything else starts to follow
""
and that 's exactly what is happening in the world today
""
and now you have uh just as your professor has pointed out you have you have women who have taken on to themselves the duties if not the duties or the rights of god
""
you have young women who have taken on the rights to decide on life whether they can choose in other words they now have what they call they fight for the right of choice
""
the there are millions and millions of abortion that have been taking place in this last decade alone uh
""
somewhere in the scriptures it talks about how streets are running red with blood
""
you don't have to see it flowing on the streets
""
they 're running on the canals
""
they 're running in the canals of all the great cities of the world
""
when i was in korea to see the uh apparition that was happening there a priest a belgian priest was telling me sis you know here in korea uh abortion has been legitimized by the government
""
and that 's just say he says for an example if you say that there 's one abortion just only one abortion that takes place a day that 's thirty abortions a month
""
and if it has the consent of both parents that 's sixty uh that 's sixty murderers that you have a month
""
but talk about it i mean this is what he was saying alright uh you have six hundred murderers in ten months
""
i mean these are people who will carry the burden and the scar of that in their souls
""
and you have women in the united states who will fight for the right to the life of a dolphin who will go after women who are wearing fur coats because it 's inhumane okay
""
they arrested a guy and put him in jail because he poisoned the tree in austin texas under which the constitution was signed
""
but they go ahead and they kill  their babies and nobody puts a stop to it
""
the elections ninth next year of nineteen ninety-two is a very pivotal election  even for the world
""
because next year the election in the united states is going to hinge on one very important issue  abortion
""
right now everybody has been making their moves
""
the the elections that took place last year for the governor and the state senators  etcetera  and so on was hinged on that
""
so much so that even men who didn't believe in abortion kept silent because they didn't want to jeopardize their political careers
""
and that 's what happens because we have uh careers to think of because uh we have other priorities we have kept silent and so the murder of the innocents goes on
""
and in the end we will have to answer for that
""
that 's why our lady is coming and that 's why our lady is crying and that 's why our lady is calling because i think you have to understand that we must participate in our own salvation
""
and we must participate also in the salvation of others
""
that 's her strongest message
""
she is saying that we have at this time lost all sense of sin
""
we 've learned to justify everything
""
husbands and wives split up because they are unfaithful to one another
""
or they don't they can't get along with one another and the lives of their children are destroyed
""
their children grow up broken-hearted embittered and so on
""
many of them go on to have broken families themselves
""
in fact there was a study that was revealed that was released in a newsweek magazine about two years ago where psychiatrists and psychologists who had done several tests on broken homes uh discovered that they were wrong
""
because normally psychiatrists and psychologists will say uh if the husband and wife or the parents start to fight and they fight uh intensively then it is best that they separate because the children suffer the trauma of hearing their families fight
""
well they discovered twenty thirty years later after they had propagated this message that almost ninety percent of the children who came from families that had separated have all got married grew up got married and had separated themselves could not keep their families together
""
whereas the children whose families have stayed together despite the fact that they were fighting managed to grow up and have families that stay together
""
and so they released this article and saying they were wrong
""
but in the meantime you have an entire generation of wrecked home lives because they were being taught what was wrong
""
what happens to the idea of sacrifice
""
our lady says we must learn to sacrifice for others that 's why she 's coming
""
she 's appearing in almost every country of the world
""
i just got a call this morning five thousand people in georgia in a place called conyers or something like that in georgia went out uh
""
she 's been appearing there to a white woman a very simple white woman in georgia and she 's been giving messages on the thirteenth of every month and jesus would appear too and five thousand people were there and they saw in the sky what looked like cloud formation but very very clear
""
this woman who called me told me she saw it herself
""
she says i saw it so clearly it was like you were watching on t v
""
it was etched so clearly the face of jesus our lady and the father
""
the signs are everywhere
""
go back to the bible and read what it says there
""
the signs are everywhere
""
it 's happening in the sun
""
it 's happening on the earth the earth is trembling everything is happening and our lady is crying
""
i don't wanna sound like a prophet of doom but you should know you should know that right now everything is making  tugma 
""
our lady is appearing in many places of the world and the and the  ap  and the and the messages that she 's giving there in some remote mountain or some hill or some poor village or what will tally exactly with what she 's saying somewhere else
""
and everything is coming together
""
and so she 's calling on the youth and she 's telling parents a lot of her messages now her latest messages
""
i didn't have time for my lipa i don't know how many of you saw my lipa show but uh i mentioned in the lipa show that the petals were falling again and that the messages that she 's receiving messages again
""
well the messages are directed at parents very strong that parents have to realize they have a responsibility to bring their children to god
""
that parents have to realize that they must give the good example for their children because many times it is the  par  the fault of the parents who cannot bring their children who don't teach  chi  the children that god is an intrinsic part of their lives
""
our lady says she teaches us in medjugorje she says begin and everything begin and end everything with god
""
she said you know the problem with you is that you you work too much and you pray too little
 she says you know if you reverse the process if you reverse the process she said you 'd see how easy it would go
""
and she was talking to people who are farmers
""
in medjugorje very poor very hard rocky country they grow tobacco
""
and you have to work hard for tobacco
