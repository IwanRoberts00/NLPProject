I think some of you who have  seen the last programme would
be 
""
So 
""
As you remember last time you saw 
and also saw  with
the stick 
""
Now 
kaata  would know what the
word 
""
But for those of you who 
kaata 
many marshal arts 
""
It is either done solo 
""
These exercises are repeated  till all the movements become
smooth  easy and spontaneous
""
Now 
or prearranged 
""
But  and the
different names 
let's 
""
Last time you saw  basic
steps
""
Now  a few
""
""
Here in this  or hit
 and
the left 
""
Note that only  in
all the four directions of the 
""
Incidently 
who travel from village to village  rarely staying more than a few months
at one place 
""
A few students 
mostly  for
teaching them 
""
There he is finishing off the 
""
That is the traditional  or salutation
""
""
Now 
 with the
stroke on the head 
""
Two more strokes  two more parallel to the
ground 
""
He does the same thing over again  this side also
""
""
Now  here he comes
forward  and
finishes the exercise 
salami 
""
But before the 
basic strokes again 
""
The 
each exercise 
""
Now  and
then does the same strokes which you saw in the last exercise 
""
But he adds one more stroke from down which was a powerful stroke
""
""
Then he turns 
""
Here this is the powerful stroke which starts from down  and
ends up 
""
Note how graceful and smooth the movements are 
""
The synchronization of  the hormony between
the hands and the feet 
""
For this reason  in
each new exercise till all the movements become  and
spontaneous 
""
Well though there are  in
the Udaygiri style 
""
Well in  all the
movements  before the movement
starts 
""
Watch  the
thrust or the poke starts 
""
There it is 
""
Note that the stick 
""
It keeps on moving 
""
This is 
""
The stick always covers the body 
""
And  salami
""
""
These are some 
""
After learning these  how to hit
""
""
Now here  is
important 
""
This is also done in a 
""
The reason is that  the
""
""
But 
then he could indulge in free fightings 
""
Loosening up or  Guruburakailu moves forward
""
""
This is his student 
""
There  and now
they move back 
""
Now he comes forward  usually
done 
""
And now the exercise starts which has got 
""
This time they do  kaata
""
""
First the  deceptic
""
""
One two  ten eleven
""
""
Now  other than the nine basic hits
 making a
total of 
""
And they finish it off 
""
Now  more difficult than the
previous one though there are only four blows involved 
""
The basic hit 
three 
""
Timing is very important in this 
""
Ah that was the reverse stroke 
""
Again 
""
This exercise is also the same  practically the same as before
but uh  or the stroke is
the 
""
And the same basic fourth blow 
""
Rhythm and timing is very important here 
""
There the 
from down 
""
Now 
two you saw  four
blows which you saw 
""
They have named it the 
""
Timing and a keen eye is very important here 
""
Well we can go on and on  many such exercises
but 
""
Uh 
that's 
""
Here they are finishing this  move on
to the 
""
Here nothing is prearranged or planned or fixed 
""
This is  and the
hits are spontaneous 
""
Now this type of practise or  when the
student has already learnt 
""
This is helpful 
when a 
""
Though competitions are very rare now- a-days and they are only
held in 
""
Uh  so
that 
ah that was the 
""
But the master is 
""
Though there is a lot more to stick fighting than what you just saw
""
""
These are a few  Udaygiricheda
school 
""
Now  in many
fighting arts of the east  play a very
important role 
""
Many masters are  or bone setters
""
""
One such master 
""
The tradition is being carried out  Khalifa
Gulam Rasool 
""
Mending broken bones 
""
He has learnt the secrets of  and healing
lotions 
""
And now he makes his own medicines 
""
Gulam Rasool is a  very busy man with a very tight schedule
""
""
Right from  he is at his
clinic 
""
Though sometimes when he is 
stick fighting also 
""
No matter what ones faith is  play an
important part in ones training 
""
Here Khalifa Gulam Rasool gets ready for an exercise 
""
 and he starts with
both the sticks rotating 
""
This  or a
bedsheet 
""
It is  sticks are covering
the body like a bedsheet would 
""
Both the sticks are moving 
""
This is used to keep 
""
And the 
traditional 
""
Gulam 
and Karim 
""
They are doing 
""
And now the work starts 
""
This is the simple exercise with just 
""
There they finish off 
""
Now 
""
Other than blows and thrust  Udaygiri
style 
to lock the joints  and immobolize the opponent without actually hitting
him 
""
These are known as 
let's 
""
Here the elbow has been locked 
""
Abdul Samadh  the elbow and the
shoulder 
""
The wrist also seems to be locked 
""
That is a good one 
""
 the neck has been
locked 
""
Now there are two sticks being used 
""
Well 
""
Both the arms are captured 
""
Well  on
the throat 
""
You have seen two  of stick
fightings 
""
Now  which could be
learnt  if the situation demands
""
""
But 
""
Do not misuse the sticks  it deserves
""
""
But uh  take a look at
what we did 
""
In  various styles there are various hits and blows
""
But  there are just seven hits with the stick
""
""
""
""
From your basic stance  and get your
hands down again 
""
This is the first 
""
It comes straight down 
""
The second hit is 
""
The third again 
""
Fourth is  fifth is also parallel
to the ground  and seventh is also
""
""
And of course  is also
used 
""
What you saw were the 
""
Now 
""
Now usually  stick is
brought over head  the leg also moves with the
stick  if the stick comes
from your  or if it comes
from the left side 
""
Now this is not a very hard and fast rule 
""
It is flexible 
""
Sometimes  when the stroke is coming from the other
side  the right leg is in
front 
""
Let us not think of this at the moment 
""
At the moment 
step forward 
""
So 
lift your hands 
""
Now  you have blocked the opponents stick
 and protected
yourself 
""
From here 
""
Take one more step forward 
""
Now what happens you can rotate to the  or the
right side 
""
Now 
""
Again 
""
What I have done is that I have taken a complete 
""
Now this circle could be  or
towards your 
""
""
""
Well 
we'll 
""
Now  of what
""
""
If  better
that you find someone  and who can teach
you 
""
Here I remember the  Swami
Shivananda 
several tons
