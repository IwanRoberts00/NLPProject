<I>
I think some of you who have seen the last programme would
be ready with your sticks 
So let's get started 
As you remember last time you saw how the stick was held 
and also saw a few basic steps and a few basic strokes with
the stick 
Now those of you who are familiar with the word 
kaata or familiar with Judo or Karate would know what the
word kaata means 
But for those of you who do not know the word kaata 
kaata is a fixed prearranged form of excercise done in 
many marshal arts 
It is either done solo or performed with a partner 
These exercises are repeated till all the movements become
smooth easy and spontaneous
Now in stick fighting also we have got these fixed 
or prearranged type of exercises 
But because of the different styles involved and the
different names at the moment for the sake of convenience 
let's call them kaatas 
Last time you saw Kanduraburakailugaru doing some basic
steps
Now let's take a look at him doing a few
 kaatas 
Here in this kaata only two strokes or hit
 or I should say hit are being practised the right and
the left but in different directions 
Note that only these two basic strokes are used but in
all the four directions of the one word 
Incidently Guruburakailu is one of those few masters 
who travel from village to village rarely staying more than a few months
at one place 
A few students pay him a small sum for his services but 
mostly rice or wheat is the only payment he gets for
teaching them 
There he is finishing off the kaata 
That is the traditional salami or salutation
Now in this kaata he start 
 starts the same way as before but uh this time with the
stroke on the head 
Two more strokes start from down two more parallel to the
ground and a stroke towards the back then he turns 
He does the same thing over again towards this side also
Now he is finishing the fourth side and here he comes
forward for the fifth time there he turns and goes back and
finishes the exercise with uh traditional salutation or 
salami 
But before the salami he is doing the 
basic strokes again 
The salami usually is done before and after 
each exercise in all the traditional art 
Now this time he add a double stroke to the head and
then does the same strokes which you saw in the last exercise 
But he adds one more stroke from down which was a powerful stroke
Then he turns 
Here this is the powerful stroke which starts from down and
ends up 
Note how graceful and smooth the movements are 
The synchronization of the movements the hormony between
the hands and the feet 
For this reason new movements are gradually introduced in
each new exercise till all the movements become effortless and
spontaneous 
Well though there are more than twenty such exercises in
the Udaygiri style we'll take a look at only one more 
Well in this final kaata all the
movements will be done in a circular way but before the movement
starts a poke or a thrust repeats the movement 
Watch he finished the circular strokes and now the
thrust or the poke starts with the throat as the target 
There it is the thrust and the circular movements 
Note that the stick never seems to stop 
It keeps on moving 
This is in defence as well as in offence 
The stick always covers the body 
And that's it that's the salami
 or the salutation 
These are some basic exercises 
After learning these the students learns how to hit
 that means he learns the blows and the hits 
Now here the need or the necessity of a partner is
important 
This is also done in a fixed prearranged form 
The reason is that if it is not fixed and prearranged the
 chances of injury are more 
But gradually as the skill of the person increases 
then he could indulge in free fightings 
Loosening up or warming up Guruburakailu moves forward
 to take the salami 
This is his student Ramalingaraju 
There they have done the salami and now
they move back 
Now he comes forward for the basic hits which are usually
done before the start of each kaata 
And now the exercise starts which has got nine hits 
This time they do fifteen hits in this kaata
 
First the basic blows that's the deceptic
 blow to the ankle 
One two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven
 twelve thirteen fourteen and fifteen 
Now in this exercise other than the nine basic hits
 there are twelve more hits which are added to this making a
total of twenty-one strokes or blows sound of sticks 
And they finish it off 
Now comparatively this set is more difficult than the
previous one though there are only four blows involved 
The basic hit and the exercise starts one two 
three four 
Timing is very important in this 
Ah that was the reverse stroke 
Again 
This exercise is also the same practically the same as before
but uh instead of the first hit the first blow or the stroke is
the thrust at the throat 
And the same basic fourth blow 
Rhythm and timing is very important here 
There the rhythm has been changed to a double blow 
from down 
Now this kaata is similar to the last 
two you saw but here there are ten hits rather than four
blows which you saw 
They have named it the Jhapak 
Timing and a keen eye is very important here 
Well we can go on and on for there are many such exercises
but let's not do that 
Uh we've to take a look at only one more 
that's from the Udaygiricheda school 
Here they are finishing this and now we'll move on
to the last exercise 
Here nothing is prearranged or planned or fixed 
This is something like free fighting sparring and the
hits are spontaneous 
Now this type of practise or fighting is done when the
student has already learnt the stick forms 
This is helpful in the actual use of a stick that is 
when a competitor fights 
Though competitions are very rare now- a-days and they are only
held in some villages and not in the cities 
Uh in competition the stick is sometimes coloured so
that if the stick touches it could show where it was touched 
ah that was the close one 
But the master is directing the students movement 
Though there is a lot more to stick fighting than what you just saw
These are a few kaatas from the Udaygiricheda
school or the Udaygiri style of stick fighting 
Now to some it may seem paradoxical but in many
fighting arts of the east medicine and healing play a very
important role 
Many masters are vaidya hakims or bone setters
One such master was the late Shafi ustad 
The tradition is being carried out by his student Khalifa
Gulam Rasool 
Mending broken bones is his profession 
He has learnt the secrets of herbs oil and healing
lotions from his late master 
And now he makes his own medicines 
Gulam Rasool is a very busy man with a very tight schedule
Right from dawn to late in the night he is at his
clinic where he looks after his patients 
Though sometimes when he is not very busy he teaches 
stick fighting also 
No matter what ones faith is devotion and prayer play an
important part in ones training 
Here Khalifa Gulam Rasool gets ready for an exercise 
 That's the salami and he starts with
both the sticks rotating 
This exercise is known as chaadar or a
bedsheet 
It is appropriately named because uh sticks are covering
the body like a bedsheet would 
Both the sticks are moving at the same time 
This is used to keep people away from you 
And the that's the finish of the exercise with the 
traditional salami 
Gulam Rasool's son Gulam Moiuddin is on the left 
and Karim is on the right 
They are doing salami 
And now the work starts 
This is the simple exercise with just four hits 
There they finish off 
Now here is something interesting 
Other than blows and thrust which you saw in the Udaygiri
style here the lathi or the stick is also used 
to lock the joints and immobolize the opponent without actually hitting
him 
These are known as bandish or 
let's call them locks 
Here the elbow has been locked 
Abdul Samadh his student and the elbow and the
shoulder is locked here 
The wrist also seems to be locked 
That is a good one the elbow has been locked 
 That's sure it's painful the neck has been
locked 
Now there are two sticks being used 
Well one arm the other arm has also been locked 
Both the arms are captured 
Well that's the strangle or a choke on
the throat with the elbow also locked 
You have seen two different styles or types of stick
fightings 
Now I would like to show you a few basics which could be
learnt easily by you and put to good use if the situation demands
But let me tell you something 
Do not misuse the sticks give it the respect it deserves
But uh before we start let's take a look at
what we did last time 
In various styles there are various hits and blows
But basically there are just seven hits with the stick
 I'll do them slowly 
From your basic stance lift your hands up and get your
hands down again 
This is the first basic hit on the head 
It comes straight down 
The second hit is sloping from up to down 
The third again from up to down slanting 
Fourth is parallel to the ground fifth is also parallel
to the ground sixth comes from down to up and seventh is also
 from down to up 
And of course there are point of the stick is also
used to thrust or poke 
What you saw were the seven basic strokes 
Now I'll show you a simple basic exercise 
Now usually in stick fighting when the stick is
brought over head or from the side the leg also moves with the
stick that is what I am trying to say is that if the stick comes
from your right side the leg also moves forward or if it comes
from the left side then the left leg moves forward 
Now this is not a very hard and fast rule 
It is flexible 
Sometimes even when the stroke is coming from the other
side the step may not be taken that is the right leg is in
front but the left stroke comes 
Let us not think of this at the moment 
At the moment when we get the stick out we will 
step forward 
So from here from your basic start or your basic stance 
lift your hands up over your head 
Now in this movement you have blocked the opponents stick
 or you have blocked a blow to your head and protected
yourself 
From here take a step forward hit 
Take one more step forward hit 
Now what happens you can rotate to the left side or the
right side or the back 
Now I'll move to the left watch 
Again I'll go towards my back 
What I have done is that I have taken a complete circle 
Now this circle could be towards your left side or
towards your right side depending on the situation 
 I'll do it again slowly watch 
Well that speed also is possible but to start with 
we'll do it slowly 
Now what you have just seen is just a fraction of what
 stick fighting is all about 
If you are really interested then it's better
that you find someone who knows stick fighting and who can teach
you 
Here I remember the saying of the late Swami
Shivananda who says An ounce of practice is worth 
several tons of theory goodbye
