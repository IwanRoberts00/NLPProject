<I>
My name is Madhu Purohit
 I'm an Automobile Engineer I've done my 
masters in Motor Vehicle Technology from Germany 
Uh I would like to talk about the topics that are
usually taught in uh the Automobile Institutions like Poly
Technique and even now some of the famous colleges like B V B college 
Uh they are adapting Automobile Engineering as one of the
subjects for Degree courses 
Uh I'm of the opinion that the topics that
these people use uh some of it is basically wasted because
they are wasting your time also and probably their own precious time 
Uh because they teach you so many things that are not directly
connected to Automobile Engineering 
And in order to probably create or get the best type of quality
of people that are there abroad 
In order to get that type of people you have to really have
subject concentrated to the subject that you want to specialise in 
You know we have Electrical Engineer or Mechanical Engineer 
who are taught uh the Production Engineering 
And say in what way is production quality control okay he
is going to be a design Engineer his job is to design not quality
control
It is upto each individual when he produces that part to
see that the quality is alright 
But this guy he wastes his time studying production
Engineering and quality control so many other things 
I feel that in Germany basically people are taught more
direct pertaining to the subject 
Yes we were also taught 
Now I'm an Automobile Engineer along with Automobile
technology we were also taught about Rocket Technology Jet Engine or
say Gas Turbine but we were not tested as such 
That was just given to us as a background so that if somebody
talks about Jet Engines or Gas turbines or High Breed Engines we
should know what he is talking about that's all 
We need not have any special uh you know theoritical know-how
and specification or any kind of thing like that 
So that made it only knowledgeable 
See we know of oh yes I know what Gas turbine is about 
I know what these things are about 
But basic thrust was on to our Automobile Engineering only 
pertaining to those 
And that is what I was talking or rather telling these people
that we should adapt more of that type of technology where in we can
get better types of people 
They need not then wait for gathering experience in some
Automobile Industry or whatever 
They need they could be immediately absorbed during their
 for their work the type of work they want to 
While as now here we have Automobile Engineers or
Mechanical Engineers they just taken in as Engineers and they don't know
much about practical aspects 
For that matter they don't even know much about theoritical aspects
 because what happens is uh the theory is so res so
restricted to their own this thing that they have they don't know 
here idea is the Institution place more emphasis on this type of
 uh retention power you have not this concept whether you
know the concept 
They say Alright I give you these notes and you see that
 you learn
So and you know if you don't write these notes and write the same
things what are in the notes you will fail probably 
And this is the biggest drawback 
People are not given the time and even the
opportunity to express themselves the way they want 
Now if I teach you something about one particular aspect I
teach you the principle behind it 
Now if the principle is known you can always explain back
phenomenon about that particular principle to anybody in any way you
like as long as you bring the gist of the subject 
And that is what you require 
Now I ask these boys who have done their diplomas and all that 
okay what do you understand by this
Yes we had learnt it I do not know what it is 
See because they are lacking that definition because they have
learnt it only as a definition they have not learnt it as a theory as
 a concept 
And it is so shocking you know now people who came here I was
 I had the opportunity of giving a lecture in K H K about four
times and there was a course for training the trainer 
So those people who are already training other people I had to
go and give a talk to them 
And I asked them casually how you know you will talk about Engine
 Four Stroke Engine what is the Four Stroke Engine ?
Can anyone of you tell me what a Four Stroke Engine is ?
And you'll be surprised not a single man was able to
tell what a Four Stroke Engine 
And they are all Automobile Engineers 
So what we lack is basics 
People like to draw graphs that is something if you meet an
Engineer he will suddenly draw a graph 
He says This is the talk and no power graph this
is this graph 
They are so much into this graphs and which is not necessary
 they should know what basics is 
Now we have somebody selling Maruti eight hundred 
What is this eight hundred ?
I don't know 
So this is what is required that we need to do it our people
should be given basic idea about all these then you go into details fine
When somebody asks you know if my mother asks me a four stroke four
stroke what is this all ?
I should be able to tell my mother who knows nothing about
technical stuff 
If I can tell her what a Four Stroke Engine is and if she
understands that is the way you should teach somebody
Because all of them are novice 
If you are teaching some technical student then I can afford
to give them some kind of a technical definition because if I say
 For every two revolution there is one power stroke 
only a technician will understand probably what I am trying to say 
If you are a non technical person if I tell you this it will
mean nothing to you and this is what this is what will happen to
students if you tell them this 
They only learn this what I have told them okay our teacher
has given our lecturer has given this if I write this I'll get
full marks 
Now this is bad 
What we have to do is come down to basics teach them basics 
So the subjects also that are chosen should be related
directly related to the subject
There are thing that the students are may be Mechanical
Engineering Electrical Engineering or Design Engineering whatever 
So it is very important that we also have those kind of subject
in oriental 
Then we have some people say What is the you know
 future for an Automobile Engineer 
You see we are looked down upon by the society at large 
Yeah I do not know really I'm also puzzled now how to
really change this thinking because people here basica 
 especially in small cities like Dharwad 
When somebody says Automobile Engineer they really don't
know much about it 
And then they feel okay Automobile Engineer means somebody
who does not have brains up there 
Somebody who is not fit for anything or any other profession he
has to be an Automobile Engineer this is the understanding 
And how wrong they are because now the Automobile field is
becoming so sophisticated 
Unfortunately we are about fifty years behind in our Automobile
field here in India 
But with the finance minister uh 
Man Mohan Singh plans you know for reducing tax or you know giving
free trade uh facilities to our business people probably we are
getting in some new technology 
And with the help of these tech these these newer
technologies the cars are going to be so sophisticated that an ordinary
man who used to think okay this is my thing you know that set up
something on the roadside and do it he will be absolutely nowhere
because he will not know what to do with these vehicles 
And only a person who has educational or lot of an
intellectual person with educational background in that particular field
will be able to tackle this job henceforth 
So but it is so difficult to tell now like you are
there or you are there now to come and tell them look I don't
mind marrying a guy who is an Automobile Engineer because he is also
like a degree holder like any other guy what's wrong 
Okay he has to deal with car and he deals with some machine
which you don't see 
But cars you often see and you have that picture in your mind you
know already preconceived 
When you go on the roadsides you see some of these fellows who got
no shoes they wear chappals some torn shirts and all
that they lie down and they are so filthy from top to bottom that is the
picture you have 
And the moment you think of an Automobile Engineer uh this fellow
also must be exactly like that and I don't want to marry this guy 
So this stigma we have to one word it you know 
There is a vast difference between a guy who has done his
Diploma and would like to work as an Automobile Engineer than 
the guy who is working on the roadside 
So the social stigma has to be of course like they say 
Charity begins at home 
We have a to start from home 
Take my parent when I got married I told my parents look okay you
don't tell the girl what my qualifications tell her what I'm
 doing exactly 
Because I don't want her to get a shock because when I got married
I was in Australia 
I had come here only to get married and she was in Bombay and
all that and I had to tell her parents and her that look I work on cars I
literally I am underneath and I do get filthy 
Because I don't want her to let me and say oh you are such you have
done your Masters and all I had thought you would be sitting in some cabin
somewhere and 
Nothing of that kind because this is what happens
Basically people tell something and there are some
 you know difficulty sometimes misunderstanding somethings then I don't
want her to repent her parents to repent 
Things should be very clear but like I say We
should start from home 
My parents okay they know exactly what I have done where I
stand and what I do 
That is what each person should start telling his parents and
his friends because this is the only way 
If I meet somebody directly and I tell them 
Look it will not appeal to them it has to start from home
You know you've got better ideas coming from home you
rather do things that your parents tell you instead of taking or making
your own choice and saying I don't care what you think I like to
marry this guy because he is an Automobile Engineer 
No this will never work because we are so you know far
behind still in these aspects 
And that is why to change peoples attitude and you
know it is very difficult 
Attitudes are something you can't change 
That is what I am trying here in my workshop now to change
attitudes their thinking of regular maintainance about cars 
They think service means just wash and grease and finish 
Those people who come here with that intention in their mind I
just send them away 
I just don't entertain them because this is not a place only
to wash and grease
I have got diploma people here working 
I would like to utilise them to utilise their know-how and
tackle some mechanical problems rather than just waste their time in you
know washing and greasing 
I say Why don't you fix up some mechanical substance there
is some noise here and some noise there why don't you rectify that 
But they don't have that 
Here we believe our Indian people believe in breakdown
maintainance 
Until the vehicle is running they just keep it running and one day
if it breaks down on you then you think oh I should go to a workshop now
There is no such thing called as preventive maintainance 
That preventive maintainance is yes it is expensive and
we do change or throw away parts which are still slightly good 
otherwise they would have run 
Then people say Why do you throw that it is still
okay 
So preventive maintainance yes if you want the down time
to be less that means you don't want your vehicle to be you know 
parked in the ga workshop for a long time because of non
availability of that part or whatever because you didn't change it that time
Now it's totally broken so you have to wait
