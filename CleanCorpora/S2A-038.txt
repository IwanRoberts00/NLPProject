My name is Madhu Purohit
""
""
masters in Motor Vehicle Technology from Germany 
""
Uh  that are
""
""
""
""
subjects for Degree courses 
""
""
these people use  because
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
subject concentrated to the subject that you want to specialise in 
""
""
who are taught uh 
""
""
is going to be a design Engineer  not quality
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
should know what he is talking about 
""
We need not have any special  uh you know theoritical know-how
""
""
So that made it only 
""
""
""
I know what these things are about 
""
But basic thrust was on to our Automobile Engineering only 
""
""
""
""
get better types of people 
""
""
Automobile Industry or whatever 
""
""
""
""
While as now here  or
Mechanical Engineers they just taken in as Engineers  and they don't know
""
""
""
""
""
here idea is the Institution  this type of
""
""
""
""
""
""
So and you know if you don't write these notes and write the same
""
""
""
""
People are not given  and even the
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Now I ask these boys who have done their diplomas and all that 
""
""
Yes we had learnt it I do not know what it is 
""
See because they are lacking that definition  because they have
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
So what we lack is basics 
""
""
""
""
""
is this graph 
""
They are so much into this graphs and  which is not necessary
""
""
""
""
What is this eight hundred  ?
""
I don't know 
""
So this is what is required that we need to do it  our people
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
understands  that is the way you should teach somebody
""
Because 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
students 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
directly related to the subject
""
""
Engineering Electrical Engineering 
""
So it is very important that we also  have those kind of subject
""
""
Then we have  you know
""
""
""
""
""
really change this thinking 
""
""
When somebody says Automobile Engineer  don't
""
""
And then they feel  somebody
""
""
""
""
""
And how wrong  they are because now the Automobile field is
becoming so sophisticated 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
man  you know that set up
""
because he will not know what to do with these 
""
""
intellectual person with educational background  in that particular field
""
""
So  now like you are
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
But cars you often see and you have that picture in your mind you
know already preconceived 
""
When you go on the roadsides you see some of these fellows who got
""
""
""
""
""
also must be exactly like that 
""
So this stigma we have to 
""
""
""
""
""
So the social stigma has to be of course 
""
""
""
""
Take my parent when I got married I told my parents look okay you
""
""
""
""
""
""
I had come here only to get married  and she was in Bombay and
""
""
""
""
""
somewhere and 
""
Nothing of that kind because  this is what happens
""
""
 you know difficulty sometimes misunderstanding somethings then I don't
""
""
Things should be very clear  We
""
""
""
stand and what I do 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
rather do things that your parents tell you  instead of taking or making
your own choice and saying  I don't care what you think I like to
""
""
""
behind still in these aspects 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
They think 
""
Those people who come here with that intention in their mind I
""
""
""
""
""
I have got diploma people here working 
""
""
tackle some mechanical problems rather than just waste their time in  you
""
""
I say  Why don't you fix up some mechanical substance there
is some noise here and some noise there why don't you rectify that 
""
""
But they don't have that 
""
Here we believe  breakdown
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
That preventive maintainance is  and
""
otherwise they would have run 
""
""
okay 
""
""
""
""
""
