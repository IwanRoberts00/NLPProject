My name is Madhu Purohit
""
""
masters in Motor Vehicle Technology from Germany 
""
Uh  that are
usually taught  like Poly
Technique and even now some of the famous colleges like B V B college 
""
Uh they are adapting  Automobile Engineering as one of the
subjects for Degree courses 
""
Uh  that
these people use  because
they are wasting your time also and probably their own precious time 
""
Uh because  they teach you so many things that are not directly
connected to Automobile Engineering 
""
And in order to probably create  or get the best type of quality
of people that 
""
In order to get that type of people you have to really  have
subject concentrated to the subject that you want to specialise in 
""
You know we have Electrical Engineer 
who are taught uh 
""
And say  okay he
is going to be a design Engineer  not quality
control
""
It is upto each individual when he  to
see that the quality is alright 
""
But this guy  studying production
Engineering and quality control 
""
I feel  basically people are taught more
direct 
""
Yes 
""
Now  along with Automobile
technology we were also taught about Rocket Technology  or
say Gas Turbine 
""
That was just given to us as a background  so that if somebody
talks about Jet Engines or  we
should know what he is talking about 
""
We need not have any special  uh you know theoritical know-how
and specification or any kind of thing like that 
""
So that made it only 
""
See we know of oh yes I know what Gas turbine is about 
""
I know what these things are about 
""
But basic thrust was on to our Automobile Engineering only 
pertaining to those 
""
And that is what I was talking  or rather telling these people
that we should adapt  that type of technology where in we can
get better types of people 
""
They need not then wait  for gathering experience in some
Automobile Industry or whatever 
""
They need they could be immediately absorbed  during their
""
""
While as now here  or
Mechanical Engineers they just taken in as Engineers  and they don't know
much about practical aspects 
""
For that matter they don't even know much about theoritical aspects
 so
restricted to their own this thing 
here idea is the Institution  this type of
 whether you
know the concept 
""
They say  Alright I give you these notes and you see that
 you learn
""
So and you know if you don't write these notes and write the same
things what are in the notes 
""
And 
""
People are not given  and even the
opportunity to express themselves the 
""
Now if I teach you something about  I
teach you the principle behind it 
""
Now if  you can always explain back
phenomenon about that particular  in any way you
like 
""
And that is what you require 
""
Now I ask these boys who have done their diplomas and all that 
okay what do you understand by this
""
Yes we had learnt it I do not know what it is 
""
See because they are lacking that definition  because they have
learnt it only as a definition  as
""
""
And it is so shocking you know now people who came here  I was
 in K H K about four
times 
""
So those people who are already training other people  I had to
go and 
""
And I asked them casually how you know you will talk about Engine
 ?
""
Can anyone of you  ?
""
And  was able to
tell what a Four Stroke Engine 
""
And they are all Automobile Engineers 
""
So what we lack is basics 
""
People like to draw graphs  if you meet an
Engineer he will suddenly draw a graph 
""
He says  graph this
is this graph 
""
They are so much into this graphs and  which is not necessary
""
""
Now we have 
""
What is this eight hundred  ?
""
I don't know 
""
So this is what is required that we need to do it  our people
should be given basic idea about all these  then you go into details fine
""
""
When somebody asks you know if my mother asks me a four stroke four
stroke what is this all  ?
""
I should be able to tell my mother who knows nothing about
technical stuff 
""
If I can tell her what a Four Stroke Engine is and if she
understands  that is the way you should teach somebody
""
Because 
""
If you are teaching some technical student  then I can afford
to give them some kind of a technical definition  because if I say
""
only a technician will understand probably what I am trying to say 
""
If  you are a non technical person if I tell you this it will
mean nothing to you  and this is what this is what will happen to
students 
""
They only learn this what I have told them okay  our teacher
has given our lecturer has given this  get
full marks 
""
Now this is bad 
""
What we have to do is come down to basics teach them basics 
""
So the  should be related
directly related to the subject
""
There are  may be Mechanical
Engineering Electrical Engineering 
""
So it is very important that we also  have those kind of subject
in oriental 
""
Then we have  you know
""
""
You see we are looked down upon 
""
Yeah I do not know really  also puzzled now how to
really change this thinking 
""
""
When somebody says Automobile Engineer  don't
know much about it 
""
And then they feel  somebody
who does not have 
""
Somebody who is not fit for anything  or any other profession he
has to be an Automobile Engineer 
""
And how wrong  they are because now the Automobile field is
becoming so sophisticated 
""
Unfortunately we are about fifty years behind in our Automobile
field here in India 
""
But 
Man Mohan Singh  you know giving
free  probably we are
getting in some new technology 
""
And with the help of these  these these newer
technologies  the cars are going to be so sophisticated that an ordinary
man  you know that set up
something on the roadside and do it  he will be absolutely nowhere
because he will not know what to do with these 
""
And only a person who has educational or  an
intellectual person with educational background  in that particular field
will be able to tackle this job 
""
So  now like you are
there  look I don't
mind marrying a guy who is an Automobile Engineer because  he is also
like a degree holder like any other guy 
""
Okay he has to deal with car  and he deals with some machine
which you don't see 
""
But cars you often see and you have that picture in your mind you
know already preconceived 
""
When you go on the roadsides you see some of these fellows who got
no shoes they wear  some torn shirts and all
that they lie down and they are so filthy from top to bottom  that is the
picture you have 
""
And the moment you think of an Automobile Engineer uh this fellow
also must be exactly like that 
""
So this stigma we have to 
""
There is a vast difference  between a guy who has done his
Diploma 
the guy who is working on the roadside 
""
So the social stigma has to be of course 
Charity begins at home 
""
We have 
""
Take my parent when I got married I told my parents look okay you
don't tell the girl  I'm
""
""
Because I don't want her to get a shock because when I got married
I was in Australia 
""
I had come here only to get married  and she was in Bombay and
all that and I had to tell her parents and her  that look I work on cars I
literally I am 
""
Because I don't want her to let me and say oh you are such you have
done your Masters and all I had thought you would be sitting in some cabin
somewhere and 
""
Nothing of that kind because  this is what happens
""
Basically people tell  there are some
 you know difficulty sometimes misunderstanding somethings then I don't
want 
""
Things should be very clear  We
should start from home 
""
My parents  okay they know exactly what I have done where I
stand and what I do 
""
That is what each person should start telling his parents  and
his friends 
""
If I meet somebody directly and I tell them 
""
Look  it has to start from home
""
You know  you
rather do things that your parents tell you  instead of taking or making
your own choice and saying  I don't care what you think I like to
marry this guy because he is an Automobile Engineer 
""
No this will never work  you know far
behind still in these aspects 
""
And  you
know it is very difficult 
""
Attitudes are 
""
That is what I am trying here in my workshop now  to change
attitudes 
""
They think 
""
Those people who come here with that intention in their mind I
just send them away 
""
I just don't entertain them  because this is not a place only
to wash and grease
""
I have got diploma people here working 
""
I would like to utilise  and
tackle some mechanical problems rather than just waste their time in  you
know washing and greasing 
""
I say  Why don't you fix up some mechanical substance there
is some noise here and some noise there why don't you rectify that 
""
""
But they don't have that 
""
Here we believe  breakdown
maintainance 
""
Until the vehicle is running they just keep it running and one day
if it  breaks down on you then you think oh I should go to a workshop now
""
""
There is no such thing called as preventive maintainance 
""
That preventive maintainance is  and
we do change 
otherwise they would have run 
""
Then people say  it is still
okay 
""
So preventive maintainance  the down time
to be less that means you don't want your vehicle to be 
parked in the  workshop for a long time because of non
availability of that part or whatever because you didn't change it that time
""
""
Now
