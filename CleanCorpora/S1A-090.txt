<I>
""
""
""
""
Both of you how do you find this  ?
""
""
Well  quite
interesting 
practical point of view 
""
Now at the moment we are just uh blindly studying  regarding all
the 
things that are mixed together 
""
And like  what are the materials that are used for dentures and
what are the 
mixing dying and then 
dental material 
""
Whereas this is a such a bore 
""
 started from
first year itself 
""
So that we get a  point
of view regarding the subject 
""
Then uhm  then regarding anatomy and then physiology and all
that we come to know  structures that are present
anatomically and then  whether the system are
""
""
Suppose for example  in digestive system like how does it get
disturbed  we
study in physiology 
""
And then  dry at
the moment  when we see the
patients and when we deal with the patients then  quite
interesting I mean 
""
""
So you have started dealing with your patients and all  ?
""
""
No no we are uh  just starting to face like
""
We are in first year 
""
So clinicals we start from third year onwards 
""
So we are looking forward for training 
""
""
So like your practical is still with 
what is the process of your practicals  ?
""
""
I mean uh 
every year every year 
""
""
""
""
""
Suppose for physiology also we have uh two practicals like 
amphibian 
""
In human physiology we take the samples of the blood and then we
test the blood and then we count  then W B C count then
 one word
""
""
All these things we count 
""
That is to we take on the  human blood
itself 
""
Then in 
""
Then we  then the oscillation
and then 
""
So that comes under physiology
""
And bio-chem we  how are this uh
 between the unknown
solutions 
""
They will give us some unknown solutions and we have to do the 
experiments until we found out whether  whether
it is carbohydrates  urea uh uric acid all those things
""
""
 ?
""
""
Yeah  chemistry
lab 
""
""
So how many  ?
""
""
How many practicals uh 
two practicals and  we have
dissection in anatomy 
""
And then uh  where we
 make
display 
 like
""
So those are some models like we have to  know from now onwards
""
""
So that is  for
physics 
""
""
So you are in second year now  ?
""
You are in second year  ?
""
""
Yeah 
""
""
Then  after you finish your
degree what is your  ?
""
""
Well if I get through perfectly you know  good
colours then  post
graduation in we have got seven different uh  departments
""
So  in each department we can chose whichever you want to do
""
""
Specialise 
""
""
Yeah 
""
So I want to do in ortho 
""
""
What is Ortho  ?
""
""
Ortho orthodentia  all
those things 
""
""
And what about Chandini  ?
""
So far 
""
""
Ragging  fine
""
""
""
""
No you just tell like how your seniors used to rag you your
classmates and 
""
""
No they used to ask us about our biodata no  ?
""
And they uh make us sing 
""
They are also enjoying uh 
""
""
So you also you enjoyed ragging
""
""
""
""
""
 they
used to  ?
""
""
Mentally 
recording broken or a long pause 
""
""
So uh  I mean what do you think about the people
in India  ?
""
""
I mean here in Hyderabad the people are 
okay 
""
I mean uh  used to
help me a lot in my work 
""
And  uh one month back time I am here in
Hyderabad 
""
So I have made friends with uh 
""
And uh 
""
""
Helpful yeah
""
""
Yeah helpful 
""
Usually the people here in  they
are very helpful
""
""
Yeah south
""
""
But 
""
""
According to  any
""
""
I mean only in south eastern they are  like in Bangalore
where the people are quite different like  they are helpful as well as
they are quite broadminded and  they are quite friendly with the people
and  environment is so different from
Hyderabad
""
""
Yeah
""
""
Whereas Hyderabad the people are more  conservative and
like  at the first move they
don't like to talk with people also 
""
But whereas when they really come to know the people they like to
help the people 
""
Then uh  for example like whereas in Bangalore you go out in
shorts or  anything like that
they don't mind 
""
I mean  they are more advanced in all those things and then
 then
they  back stare at you and you feel out of place
like when you wear all those stuff 
""
Then you feel that  okay somebody is observing me so much and
you feel 
""
Whereas in 
""
I don't think people will be  least bothered like even if you go
""
""
So  those are the difference according to the places also
""
And whereas in Madras when you can see  I
mean  in all
those things 
""
Atleast in Hyderabad  I mean they have become more
modernised  in
Secunderabad also  the girls and
the  than in Hyderabad
""
""
Whereas in Hyderabad they still have the old cultures and  so
many things that even  talk
with the guys 
""
It is hidden talking like  they get a good punch at home or
something like that 
""
But whereas in Secunderabad they are so fast they even go for 
pubs and discos and here and there clubs and then  I
mean extra 
""
But whereas in Hyderabad they are only  stuck with their books
and 
""
There is a lot of 
between these two twin cities itself 
""
So then  to see
in study 
""
Whereas in north  it's
 due to the influence of the tourist people from different countries and
""
""
So in  in
study point of view they are not that  in south
""
""
So  uh
north and south 
""
""
And what about ragging difference between north and south  ?
""
""
Well the ragging in  quite
cool I should say  torturement or
anything like that 
""
They just ask some  regarding your biodata
 or
dance 
""
""
""
But whereas in north  literally kill the person like
""
""
You know most of the  north for
medical studies they are really scared 
""
I don't want to go there because they are  physically tortured
like uh  at
midnight twelve 
laughs 
""
""
Yeah
""
""
And thinking about  dissection hall itself they really
get scared and that also in the midnight uh 
""
""
""
""
""
So they asked them to go to the 
in the morgery even the 
""
So  I mean they ask the students to go to
the 
""
At the same time  they
must be hiding  I mean lying down in the stretcher and they just wake up
suddenly so 
""
There  in
north that  two persons had died because of this type of ragging
""
""
Yeah yeah 
""
""
And then
""
""
It has been
""
""
So far yeah 
""
So far what I have heard is that in north  they have asked uh
 uh
soap and they asked him to  specific time and
asked him to take 
""
Well that  he was finding very difficult to do that
and 
""
So by the time he finished the soap he was  admitted in the
hospital 
""
""
""
""
""
That 
""
Then uh  done by the
seniors in north 
""
But whereas in south like I feel the lecturers and the professors
 controlling the
students in that point of view 
""
But in  they
just leave upto the students 
""
So the  and
 to stay there
""
So many  just because of
ragging 
""
""
""
""
""
 what I have heard about uh
""
""
""
""
""
""
Uhn the 
he has asked the  I mean the senior has asked the guy to go it
is  to go early in the morning and ask
her what did 
""
So 
""
So  with
the  panties alone
""
""
Uhn 
""
""
So that 
""
And he is really a  off the person now at the moment
""
""
So  badly
they are ragging in north and 
""
South how lenient they are 
""
""
So what you like  ?
""
Do you think that there should be ragging or not  ?
""
""
Well  in my point of view okay ragging means what they are
doing in the south 
""
Unless you  I mean
whatever you want to ask  hi
 when the college
goes on smoothly like 
""
So 
""
What I feel is  junior and the
junior comes to know who you are 
""
Then you can have a 
""
I mean the ragging should be  I
mean not unhealthy one 
""
""
So Champani you are new to this place  ?
""
""
Yeah 
""
""
How do you find the college and the ragging towards you  ?
""
""
The college is uh  living
in so far is  ?
""
""
Yeah 
""
""
The place is 
""
""
So first day of your dissection when you saw the dead bodies
how did you feel and  I guess they must have
have shown you the morgery 
""
How they are preserved  ?
""
""
Yeah 
""
""
So how did you find all those things  ?
""
""
On the first day I was very scared  even to touch the body
""
""
""
So how do you feel now  ?
""
""
Ah 
""
""
I am sure you must have uh  washed your hands at least
""
laughs 
""
""
""
""
""
Yeah 
""
""
Ah then how about now 
laughs 
""
Because now 
""
""
""
""
""
Yeah there are students who doesn't wash at all and eat food
because they are so used to it 
""
""
Ah ha
""
""
I mean just  an ordinary wash okay you rinse your hand in
the water end up  you know it become so casual like
""
""
Yeah 
""
""
But the first day when you go for a dissection or  when
you just touch the dead bodies  when you
go back home you  wash your hands in the dettol atleast for
ten times and you just  keep on rubbing your nails and clean everything
and  you
became like used to
