""
""
""
Well  quite
""
""
""
""
the 
""
""
And like  what are the materials that are used for dentures and
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
So that we get a  point
""
""
Then uhm  then regarding anatomy and then physiology and all
""
""
""
""
Suppose for example  in digestive system like how does it get
""
""
""
""
""
patients and when we deal with the patients then  quite
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
So like your practical is still with 
what is the process of your practicals  ?
""
""
I mean uh 
every year every year 
""
""
""
""
""
""
amphibian 
""
""
test the blood and then we count  then W B C count then
 one word
""
""
""
""
That is to we take on the  human blood
""
""
""
""
""
and then 
""
""
""
""
""
solutions 
""
""
experiments until we found out whether  whether
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
two practicals and  we have
""
""
And then uh  where we
 make
display 
""
""
So those are some models like we have to  know from now onwards
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Yeah 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Specialise 
""
""
""
""
So I want to do in ortho 
""
""
""
""
""
Ortho orthodentia  all
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Ragging  fine
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
And they uh make us sing 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
 they
""
""
""
""
recording broken or a long pause 
""
""
So uh  I mean what do you think about the people
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Helpful yeah
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
According to  any
""
""
I mean only in south eastern they are  like in Bangalore
""
""
and  environment is so different from
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
like  at the first move they
don't like to talk with people also 
""
But whereas when they really come to know the people they like to
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
 then
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Atleast in Hyderabad  I mean they have become more
""
""
""
""
""
Whereas in Hyderabad they still have the old cultures and  so
""
with the guys 
""
""
something like that 
""
But whereas in Secunderabad they are so fast they even go for 
pubs and discos and here and there clubs and then  I
""
""
""
and 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Whereas in north  it's
""
""
""
""
study point of view they are not that  in south
""
""
So  uh
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
anything like that 
""
They just ask some  regarding your biodata
""
dance 
""
""
""
But whereas in north  literally kill the person like
""
""
You know most of the  north for
""
""
I don't want to go there because they are  physically tortured
like uh  at
""
""
""
""
Yeah
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
in the morgery even the 
""
""
the 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
And then
""
""
It has been
""
""
So far yeah 
""
""
""
soap and they asked him to  specific time and
""
""
""
and 
""
So by the time he finished the soap he was  admitted in the
""
""
""
""
""
""

""
Then uh  done by the
seniors in north 
""
""
 controlling the
""
""
""
""
""
So the  and

""
her what did 
""
So 
""
""

""
""
Uhn 
""
""
""
""
And he is really a  off the person now at the moment
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Do you think that there should be ragging or not  ?
""
""

doing in the south
