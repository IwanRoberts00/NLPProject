<I>
 Laughs 
Both of you how do you find this your course ?
Well clears her throat it's quite
interesting I mean uh like uh when it really comes to 
practical point of view it's quite interesting 
Now at the moment we are just uh blindly studying regarding all
the uh how the uhm dental materials used and how are the 
things that are mixed together 
And like what are the materials that are used for dentures and
what are the materials that are used for fillings and everything 
mixing dying and then setting them everything we are dealing in 
dental material 
Whereas this is a such a bore 
 I'm in final year but like they have started from
first year itself 
So that we get a whole round uh must have point point
of view regarding the subject 
Then uhm then regarding anatomy and then physiology and all
that we come to know whether uh structures that are present
anatomically and then physiology means like whether the system are
 working and how how does it 
Suppose for example in digestive system like how does it get
disturbed or how does the liver works and all those things we
study in physiology 
And then though they are like we find it quite dry at
the moment but when it comes to the clinical when we see the
patients and when we deal with the patients then it's quite
interesting I mean 
So you have started dealing with your patients and all ?
No no we are uh just starting to face like
We are in first year 
So clinicals we start from third year onwards 
So we are looking forward for training 
So like your practical is still with like how is your 
what is the process of your practicals ?
I mean uh in third year or you mean in 
every year every year we have got different practicals 
 No right now so far 
Suppose for physiology also we have uh two practicals like 
amphibian and human physiology 
In human physiology we take the samples of the blood and then we
test the blood and then we count R B C count then W B C count then
 like uhm after that we see the hemoglobin one word
 and then differential count in W B C 
All these things we count 
That is to we take on the coughs our human blood
itself 
Then in amphibian practical we dissect the frog 
Then we try to see the models which then the oscillation
and then one word of uh nerves and everything 
So that comes under physiology
And bio-chem we have separately done like how are this uh
 proteins and nutrition differential bet between the unknown
solutions 
They will give us some unknown solutions and we have to do the 
experiments until we found out whether it's protein or whether
it is carbohydrates or sometimes urea uh uric acid all those things
 It's uh chemistry lab ?
Yeah it's done in separately in chemistry
lab 
So how many practicals you have ?
How many practicals uh like for physiology we have 
two practicals and bio-chem we have one practical and we have
dissection in anatomy that's also a practical like 
And then uh we have for physics practicals where we
 like finding the cast and out of cast we have to form uh make
display and although the display we equip with uh wax ring 
 like
So those are some models like we have to know from now onwards
So that is in practical practically in uhm for
physics 
So you are in second year now ?
You are in second year ?
Yeah 
Then like uh after your after you finish your
degree what is your further plans ?
Well if I get through perfectly you know I mean good
colours then I would like to go for my P G and that's post
graduation in we have got seven different uh like uh departments
So in each department we can chose whichever you want to do
Specialise 
Yeah that's specialise 
So I want to do in ortho 
What is Ortho ?
Ortho orthodentia that is uh they put braces and all
those things 
And what about Chandini ?
So far how is your ragging ? laughter 
Ragging laughs fine
 Cough 
No you just tell like how your seniors used to rag you your
classmates and 
No they used to ask us about our biodata no ?
And they uh make us sing and then dance 
They are also enjoying uh we are also enjoying 
So you also you enjoyed ragging
 Ah ha 
 What so what sort of ragging they
used to ?
Mentally not physically and not physically 
recording broken or a long pause 
So uh what I mean what do you think about the people
in India ?
I mean here in Hyderabad the people are it's 
okay they are nice 
I mean uh my friends they are friendly and uh used to
help me a lot in my work 
And this just a one uh one month back time I am here in
Hyderabad 
So I have made friends with uh some of my classmates 
And uh so so to say friendly and laughs 
Helpful yeah
Yeah helpful 
Usually the people here in I mean down in south they
are very helpful
Yeah south
But what I find the difference in 
According to any
I mean only in south eastern they are like in Bangalore
where the people are quite different like they are helpful as well as
they are quite broadminded and they are quite friendly with the people
and I mean I mean the environment is so different from
Hyderabad
Yeah
Whereas Hyderabad the people are more conservative and
like they don't like to go out even or at the first move they
don't like to talk with people also 
But whereas when they really come to know the people they like to
help the people 
Then uh for example like whereas in Bangalore you go out in
shorts or even the females go out in shorts or anything like that
they don't mind 
I mean they are more advanced in all those things and then
 whereas in Hyderabad if you even wear a skirt even like then
they give a good I mean back stare at you and you feel out of place
like when you wear all those stuff 
Then you feel that okay somebody is observing me so much and
you feel uncomfortable in all those things 
Whereas in Bangalore you are free like 
I don't think people will be least bothered like even if you go
 almost like a naked female and laughs 
So those are the difference according to the places also
And whereas in Madras when you can see the people are I
mean what to say uh they are still yet to build up in all
those things 
Atleast in Hyderabad it's I mean they have become more
modernised like in comparatively in twin cities like in
Secunderabad also the people are quite different and the girls and
the boys all they are more modernised than in Hyderabad
Whereas in Hyderabad they still have the old cultures and so
many things that even the parents they don't even let the girls talk
with the guys 
It is hidden talking like they get a good punch at home or
something like that laughs 
But whereas in Secunderabad they are so fast they even go for 
pubs and discos and here and there clubs and then so many other I
mean extra curricular activities are going on 
But whereas in Hyderabad they are only stuck with their books
and home and work that's all like 
There is a lot of different difference 
between these two twin cities itself 
So then comparitively to north south is quite to see
in study point of view south is quite good 
Whereas in north there is lot of activities may be it's
 due to the influence of the tourist people from different countries and
 all those things 
So in north I should say they are more advanced than in
study point of view they are not that uh good as good as in south
So I mean that is the difference I find between this uh
north and south 
And what about ragging difference between north and south ?
Well the ragging in south is quite I mean quite
cool I should say because you don't have any physical torturement or
anything like that 
They just ask some simple questions regarding your biodata
 then your hobbies then they may ask you to sing a song or
dance or ask for a treat 
 That's the maximum they do here 
But whereas in north they literally kill the person like
You know most of the people who who go to north for
medical studies they are really scared 
I don't want to go there because they are physically tortured
like uh sometimes they even ask them to go the morgery and at
midnight twelve O'clock whereas everyone is so scared like 
laughs 
Yeah
And thinking about dissection hall itself they really
get scared and that also in the midnight uh 
 Haan 
So they asked them to go to the morgery whereas 
in the morgery even the fresh bodies are I mean kept 
So sometimes they I mean they ask the students to go to
the dissection hall and identify so many things 
At the same time some of their same collegues they
must be hiding I mean lying down in the stretcher and they just wake up
suddenly so 
There was were two cases in
north that two persons had died because of this type of ragging
Yeah yeah 
And then
It has been
So far yeah 
So far what I have heard is that in north they have asked uh
 a guy they gave him uh a huge I mean piece of uh
soap and they asked him to they gave him some specific time and
asked him to take bath and finish that soap 
Well that guy he was finding very difficult to do that
and he tried his best to finish that soap 
So by the time he finished the soap he was admitted in the
hospital 
 Accha 
That that serious he became 
Then uh there are so many serious ragging done by the
seniors in north 
But whereas in south like I feel the lecturers and the professors
 whoever in-charge then the principal they are controlling the
students in that point of view 
But in north they are not bothered like they
just leave upto the students 
So the seniors really torture the juniors and
 I mean they find it difficult to stay there
So many students have left their course just because of
ragging 
 So 
 And so far like what I have heard about uh
 one college is that one guy was asked to go to the ladies hostel 
 Haan 
Uhn the warden was a spinster so like 
he has asked the guy to I mean the senior has asked the guy to go it
is panties along alone like to go early in the morning and ask
her what did she do with her husband the previous night 
So at the same time like he refused to do 
So they asked him to stand at the college gate with
the panties alone
Uhn 
So that that was when he became mad 
And he is really a mental off the person now at the moment
So those are the differnces you can find like how badly
they are ragging in north and south 
South how lenient they are 
So what you like ?
Do you think that there should be ragging or not ?
Well in my point of view okay ragging means what they are
doing in the south I really appreciate 
Unless you rag your junior by asking so many I mean
whatever you want to ask that junior never bothers to say hi
 even like in their later life like when the college
goes on smoothly like 
So in that point of view ragging is good 
What I feel is so that you get to know the junior and the
junior comes to know who you are and what a person you are 
Then you can have a healthy friendship I should say like 
I mean the ragging should be quite healthy not I
mean not unhealthy one 
So Champani you are new to this place ?
 
Yeah 
How do you find the college and the ragging towards you ?
 
The college is uh it's nice uh but living
in so far is not so one word no ?
Yeah 
 
The place is it's quite nice 
So first day of your dissection when you saw the dead bodies
how did you feel and when they showed you the I guess they must have
have shown you the morgery where they have preserved the dead bodies 
How they are preserved ?
 
Yeah 
So how did you find all those things ?
 
On the first day I was very scared even to touch the body
 na 
So how do you feel now ?
 
Ah I don't feel anything now 
I am sure you must have uh washed your hands at least
 ten times before eating after touching the bodies 
laughs 
 
 Yeah 
 
Yeah it's so smelly no 
Ah then how about now you wash atleast once ? 
laughs 
Because now we have one word 
 You don't wash you don't wash now 
Yeah there are students who doesn't wash at all and eat food
because they are so used to it 
Ah ha
I mean just an ordinary wash okay you rinse your hand in
the water end up but you know it become so casual like
Yeah 
But the first day when you go for a dissection or when
you just touch the dead bodies you feel something and then when you
go back home you specially wash your hands in the dettol atleast for
ten times and you just keep on rubbing your nails and clean everything
and you know that's how it happens but slowly you
became like used to all those things
