Alok Mukherjee gets to the ball 
""
""
""

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Long ball from Vijayan  Vijayan is quicker
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Dulal  the moment they could
""
""
But no 
""
""
""
""
""
""
the Nigerian 
""
East Bengal defence kept back 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
East Bengal goal keeper Athanu Bhattacharya  takes the kick
""
""
""
""
Ball to Ghosh 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
This time Tarun De aheads it away 
""
Butia 
""
East Bengal at the receiving end 
""
""
gone how to play 
""
""
""
""
""
""
Pushing forward 
""
""
""
""
""
Atanu quiet yet 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Rakshit 
""
East Bengal fearing to lose  which was evident
""
""
Tanomoi Bose 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
He will have to gather speed  he will have to give a long ball
""
""
""
""
""
""
Vijayan all over  he is like the human machine
""
""
""
Bagan 
""
Swaroop Das  and Tarun De have been outstanding in the deep
""
overlap on the left for East Bengal 
""
Here is Bernard  back passing you can see he is giving it away
""
""
Majumdar  Chatterjee here is Bernard
""
""
Gentle throw to Ancheri  but quiet
harmlessly 
""
Sushanu De 
""
There is a too long  one to one
""
""
Easily outwitted Satyajit 
""
""
looking dangerous now 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Here watch it again  a good piece of workmen Gautam Ghosh
""
""
""
And all Ancheri is to do is to kick it away with his right he
""
view 
""
And he had so much of time  angle as well
""
""
That makes the mess of it 
""
So East Bengal survive 
""
""
half 
""
Yes Mohun Bagans attack again there is going up Ancheri 
""
""
 in the thirty-first
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
This time he is not making any mistake he controls with his left
""
""
He outwit  the deep defence Swaroop Das as top on the wrong
""
""
""
""
""
""
Ancheri 
""
""
Throwing for Mohun Bagan 
""
""
""
""
""
So  going to be Mohun Bagan for the kick off
