 In Hindi 
Thank you Baldev East Bengal play a long ball stay
in their position Majeed Chapman Chapman playing away to
the left Sushanu Dey making room for Chapman 
And here Shanti Majumdar Sushanu replace Vikas Panje 
Few minutes to go 
Taking attempt to cross from the left 
East Bengal earn a flag kick 
Tushar Rakshit he is leaving for Sushanu Dey 
Dey is uh shirt number six as he positions the ball 
He will take that gentle left footer which will come 
swabing away 
And ball by Majumdar 
Up go Mohun Bagan Gunabir Singh 
Long ball on the right 
And going for a goal kick in favour of East Bengal 
Mohun Bagan got a couple of positive chances to forge ahead
 again they haven't succeeded 
Sushanu Dey moves here gently forward 
Pasha looks for Chapman 
He has in the world lot of uh coverage he darts very quick
 to this uh nimble feet 
And here is a long range shot in Hindi 
 It's going net across the stadium all through the
Feroz Shah Kotla cricket ground 
So a new ball has been requisitioned 
Alok Das who will take the goal kick now he instead gets
a pass from Tanomoi Bose 
Ranjan Dey back to Das 
Referee Gulab Chauhan blows the whistle to stop play because
 suddenly the old ball has also come back into the playing arena 
Now the referee will throw the ball he drops it 
And East Bengal move out with Sushanu Dey 
He is moving very acute on to the left full swing 
But the ball in any case had gone over 
Section of the spectators of the ground level 
Really that place of the ground level you you just cannot
enjoy the game of football at that uh level from that eye view 
than uh perhaps where we are in the commentators box and those on the upper
terraces laughter 
 In Hindi 
Ranjan Dey is header 
Butia 
Rakshit 
Sushanu Dey 
Oh God here the chance and Sanjay Majhi again ideally
positioned just above the one word he succeeds in getting the
angle pass Tanomoi Bose 
But that angle is a little too much and the goal just
rolled across the goal line 
Few uh metres away from the uprise 
So East Bengal's first chance in this second half to
have forged ahead 
Watch it again Sushanu Dey puts the ball ahead Sanjoy
Majhi runs in from the left 
Goal keeper Bose turns rushing out and that angle is
 wide by a few metres 
Majumdar leads the ball for Majhi 
Majhi slow Satyajit gets the ball 
Gunabir gets it to back down the line 
Foul committed before the ball rolled out 
Satyajit Ancheri doesn't trap cleanly 
Tarun De Biachung Butia Carlton Chapman Gunabir
kicks it out 
Iliyas Pasha for the throwing for East Bengal 
Swaroop Das won't let Vijayan anywhere close 
In the air the dole won by Alok Das 
This game is also has its highs and lows 
The sweet and sours both the teams having missed out one 
opportunities to Mohun Bagan as has had a better share 
Dulal Biswas Butia 
Butia tackled by Satyajit 
 It's Sushanu Dey in possession 
And it's a faulty forward pass looking for Majumdar
Swaroop Das got a very clean ahead Pasha clears 
taken by Gunabir waits for the bounce it's too long 
Chapman puts it out to play 
Gunabir Satyajit Chatterjee Suryan mark Akeel Ansari 
Ancheri very quick indeed 
To Ansari Ansari again coming down the middle cannot get
passed 
Tarun De 
Ansari very agile player 
Despite the fact that he looks lean and hungry 
Scrappy struggle on at the moment in the mid field ball
running left and right a few yards 
Now in Mohun Bagan's possession 
And certainly the crowd doesn't like that 
Supporters of both the teams present in thousands 
The score board is blank in the nineteen ninety-four Durand final
Butia 
Pasha 
Yes Sushanu Dey looking for the open and there is nobody
there for that pass played on the left 
Nil nil 
Foul there uh again Mohun Bagan referee Chouhan
going towards outside right Robin Ghosh giving him bit of warning 
Swaroop Das it shall be for the free kick 
Gently chipping it away onto the left flank 
Stopped by Dulal Biswas the big centre 
Alok Das 
Amitabh Chandra 
Back to Das 
Long ball played 
And Akeel Ansari in no mood to oblige Vijayan is on his own way
 Mohun Bagan forward constantly on the run 
Athanu Bhattacharya sensing a bit of danger in Vijayan did the
right thing to come up to the ball 
Foul was committed by Vijayan 
Here comes the a free kick 
Tushar Rakshit dispossessed Biswas backing up 
 It's uh stretches 
Twenty-two minutes of the game gone this is the near outpull
eastern stand 
Very popular with the football lovers of the city 
Oh comes inside the box 
Here is the chance for Chapman he raise for the second bounce
Alok Mukherjee gets to the ball 
Butia controls back passing to Swaroop Das back to Butia 
And Butia again attempt to pass Iliyas pasha who has gone two
yards ahead acknowledges to Butia saying well my fault my
friend in the meanwhile Mohun Bagan uh defender Alok Mukherjee
 is on the ground very close to his own penalty box 
Time off has been called by the referee 
And gives a little bit of time for uh two players to have
A gulp of water 
Those two the uh touch line is the Satyajeet Chatterjee 
A stretcher being called Alok Mukherjee going to be taken
out for first aid 
Chatterjee is throwing 
Ancheri 
Pasha now Chapman gets the ball Pasha again 
Butia for East Bengal he is quick but he hold
himself but it is given Butia moves upon to the right Chapman with
the first time pass 
And uh Vikas Panje 
Uh Sanjay Majhi that was unable to control Gunabir
Long ball from Vijayan Ansari is there Vijayan is quicker
Again with East Bengal positioned Swaroop Das 
Iliyas Pasha 
Sushanu Dey is ahead in the dual Ranjan gets the better
 off Majumdar 
Satyajit Chatterjee sets up Akeel Ansari 
Square pass Amitabh Chandra there is it for Gautam Ghosh
 the linesman flag goes up for off side 
Dulal Mohun Bagan playing with ten the moment they could
be looking for a substitution for Alok Mukherjee 
But no it's not Alok Mukherjee who is going out 
it's going to be Bernard who is replacing Gunabir 
So Bernard is one of the many important players today donning
 the colours of the Calcutta Football Club 
It started many years ago with the Iranian then came
the Nigerian and here is Bernand in position for Mohun Bagan 
East Bengal defence kept back 
Akil Ansari too much of time 
And Ancheri waits for that opportunity Swaroop Das rises to
the occasion but Mohun Bagan again come up 
Amitabh Chandra now takes a shot 
It goes wide 
East Bengal goal keeper Athanu Bhattacharya takes the kick
Rakshit fails to stop it 
Ball to Ghosh 
On the right flank gentle chip for Vijayan 
Vijayan will look for Ancheri 
Pasha gets to it no he cannot break the hold of Mohun
Bagan 
This time Tarun De aheads it away 
Butia 
East Bengal at the receiving end 
Slowly pull the ball out Chapman resting it ones the ball
gone how to play 
Alok Mukherjee back onto the playing arena with the throw in
Satyajeet Chatterjee Akeel Ansari now 
Pushing forward Amitabh to a good over lap 
In the ball and uh reverse bicycle attempt kick from
Ancheri 
Atanu quiet yet 
Behind it was not really in position not in the ideal
situation 
So even attempt trying that reverse meanwhile a foul
commited 
Rakshit playing square to Pasha 
East Bengal fearing to lose the stint which was evident
earlier on 
Tanomoi Bose rolling it for Alok Das 
Satyajit Chatterjee up come Chandra 
Ansari 
Ball to Gautam Ghosh Dulal Biswas in front of him 
Ansari again the ball went lose 
To the right back Chandra 
Passes it inside the box headed out 
Vijayan now and Butia gets it 
He will have to gather speed he will have to give a long ball
through gives it to Majumdar gives enough of time to the Mohun Bagan
defender to fall back in position 
Here comes the cross but the tall Alok Das will have
nothing go pass him 
Vijayan all over up and down he is like the human machine
He and Ancheri really haven't stop things going for Mohun
Bagan 
Swaroop Das and Tarun De have been outstanding in the deep
present as indeed Iliyas Pasha Dulal Biswas has been doing a good
overlap on the left for East Bengal 
Here is Bernard back passing you can see he is giving it away
to East Bengal 
Majumdar Chapman Chapman Chatterjee here is Bernard
now for Mohun Bagan 
Gentle throw to Ancheri Ancheri is crossing but quiet
harmlessly to Atanu Bhattacharya 
Sushanu De 
There is a too long Alok Das Sanjay Majhi one to one
situation 
Easily outwitted Satyajit Akeel Ansari 
Gautam Ghosh fixed it up closes attack on line Mohun Bagan
looking dangerous now 
What you say to that Ancheri with just a goal keeper
to beat 
With the out step of his left he doesn't collect to the
way and expectations of the Mohun Bagan team man 
Here watch it again a good piece of workmen Gautam Ghosh
 and look at Ancheri he is all by himself Vijayan has moved up
And all Ancheri is to do is to kick it away with his right he
prefers his left because probably it is the defender coming in his
view 
And he had so much of time and plenty of uh angle as well
 to beat the goal keeper wasn't very far 
That makes the mess of it 
So East Bengal survive 
Nil nil as we move into the thirty-first minute of the second
half 
Yes Mohun Bagans attack again there is going up Ancheri 
Well it's a goal applause Oh one word
 Ancheri gets the first goal for Mohun Bagan in the thirty-first
minute of the second half 
Movements again from the right warmed it and Mohun Bagan were
looking dominating looking threatening as you watch Gautam
Ghosh on the right pushes the ball forward and here is Ancheri
 number eleven 
This time he is not making any mistake he controls with his left
He outwit the deep defence Swaroop Das as top on the wrong
foot Dulal Biswas is left behind and here comes that whacker which
is narrowing the angle beating goalkeeper Tanu Bhattacharya and
 it's one zero for Mohun Bagan 
So luck eventully running out for East Bengal 
Ancheri scoring the first goal drawing the first 
two words in the final of the nineteen ninety-four Durand Cup 
Throwing for Mohun Bagan and for commentory Baldev 
 In Hindi 
So it's going to be Mohun Bagan for the kick off
with Vijayan back passing 
Akeel Ansari he is just behind 
Alok Das Ranjan Dey 
Vijayan Gurudas Gunabir Singh just to net 
East Bengal gain position Gunabir again now to Mohun Bagan
Gunabir is a link man 
Back passing Amitabh Chandra inside the box 
taken by Tarun De 
 It's there Sanjoy Majhi give there to Vikas Panje
Panje looks for Carlton Chapman 
Alok Mukherjee is there 
Ranjan Dey 
Alok Mukherjee the long left Vijayan will not get
through it clear 
Comes to Butia 
Butia for East Bengal in the Mohun Bagan half 
Short pass 
Rakshit 
Tushar Rakshit going into the open he is being tackled by
 Alok Das 
Gautam Ghosh Gunabir Singh now 
Mohun Bagan in position 
Up comes Amitabh Chandra right back 
To his right striker right winger Ghosh 
Tackled by Dulal Biswas as he crosses 
Iliyas Pasha was the men carrying away from there 
Satyajit Gunabir again looking for Satyajit Chatterjee
