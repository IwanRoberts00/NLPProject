Thank you Baldev  stay
in their position  playing away to
the left Sushanu Dey 
""
And here Shanti Majumdar 
""
Few minutes to go 
""
Taking attempt to cross from the left 
""
East Bengal earn a 
""
""
Tushar Rakshit 
""
Dey is uh 
""
He will take that gentle 
swabing 
""
And ball 
""
Up go Mohun Bagan 
""
Long ball on the right 
""
And 
""
Mohun Bagan  to forge ahead
""
""
Sushanu Dey 
""
Pasha 
""
He has in the world lot of  coverage he darts very quick
""
""
And here is a long range shot 
""
 all through the
Feroz Shah Kotla 
""
So 
""
Alok Das  he instead gets
a pass from Tanomoi Bose 
""
Ranjan Dey 
""
Referee Gulab Chauhan blows the whistle  to stop play because
""
""
Now the referee will 
""
And East Bengal move out with Sushanu Dey 
""
He is moving very acute on to the left 
""
But the ball in any case had gone over 
""
Section of the spectators of the ground level 
""
""
Really that place of the ground level you  you just cannot
enjoy 
than uh perhaps where we are in the commentators box and those on the upper
terraces 
""
""
""
""
""
Ranjan Dey is header 
""
Butia 
""
Rakshit 
""
Sushanu Dey 
""
Oh God here the chance  again ideally
positioned  he succeeds in getting the
angle pass Tanomoi Bose 
""
But that angle is  and the goal just
rolled across 
""
Few uh metres away from the uprise 
""
So East  to
have forged ahead 
""
Watch it again  Sanjoy
Majhi runs in 
""
Goal keeper Bose turns  that angle is
""
""
Majumdar leads the ball for Majhi 
""
Majhi slow Satyajit gets the ball 
""
Gunabir 
""
Foul committed before the ball rolled out 
""
Satyajit 
""
Tarun De  Gunabir
kicks it out 
""
Iliyas Pasha 
""
Swaroop Das 
""
In the air 
""
This game is also has its 
""
The sweet and sours 
opportunities to 
""
Dulal Biswas 
""
Butia tackled 
""
""
""
And  looking for Majumdar
""
""
Swaroop Das 
taken by Gunabir 
Chapman puts it out to play 
""
Gunabir 
""
Ancheri 
""
To Ansari Ansari again coming down the middle  cannot get
passed 
""
Tarun De 
""
Ansari 
""
""
Despite the fact that he looks lean and hungry 
""
""
Scrappy struggle on at the moment in the mid field  ball
running left and right a few yards 
""
Now in Mohun 
""
And certainly the crowd doesn't like that 
""
Supporters of both the teams 
""
The score board is blank in the nineteen ninety-four Durand final
""
""
Butia 
""
Pasha 
""
Yes Sushanu Dey looking for the open  there is nobody
there for that pass 
""
Nil nil 
""
Foul  referee Chouhan
going towards 
""
Swaroop Das it shall be for the free kick 
""
Gently chipping it away onto the left flank 
""
Stopped by Dulal Biswas 
""
Alok Das 
""
Amitabh Chandra 
""
Back to Das 
""
Long ball played 
""
And  Akeel Ansari in no mood to oblige Vijayan is on his own way
""
""
Athanu Bhattacharya sensing a bit of danger in Vijayan  did the
right thing to come up to the ball 
""
Foul was committed by Vijayan 
""
Here comes the 
""
Tushar Rakshit 
""
""
""
Twenty-two minutes of the  game gone this is the near outpull
eastern stand 
""
Very popular 
""
Oh comes inside the box 
""
Here is the chance for Chapman he raise for the  second bounce
""
""
Alok Mukherjee gets to the ball 
""
Butia controls back passing to Swaroop Das 
""
And Butia  again attempt to pass Iliyas pasha who has gone two
yards ahead  my fault my
friend in the meanwhile  Alok Mukherjee
""
""
Time off has been called by the referee 
""
""
And gives a little bit of time for uh  two players to have
""
""
""
A gulp of water 
""
Those two the uh touch line is the Satyajeet Chatterjee 
""
A stretcher being called  going to be taken
out 
""
Chatterjee is throwing 
""
Ancheri 
""
Pasha 
""
Butia  but he hold
himself  with
the first time pass 
""
""
And uh 
""
""
Uh Sanjay Majhi that was  Gunabir
""
""
Long ball from Vijayan  Vijayan is quicker
""
""
Again with East Bengal 
Iliyas Pasha 
""
Sushanu Dey is ahead  Ranjan gets the better
""
""
Satyajit Chatterjee 
""
Square pass  there is it for Gautam Ghosh
""
""
Dulal  the moment they could
be looking for a substitution 
""
But no 
it's 
""
So Bernard is one of the  many important players today donning
""
""
It started many years ago  then came
the Nigerian 
""
East Bengal defence kept back 
""
Akil Ansari too much of time 
""
And Ancheri  waits for that opportunity Swaroop Das rises to
the occasion 
""
Amitabh Chandra now 
""
It goes wide 
""
East Bengal goal keeper Athanu Bhattacharya  takes the kick
""
""
Rakshit fails to stop it 
""
Ball to Ghosh 
""
On the right flank gentle chip for Vijayan 
""
Vijayan will look for Ancheri 
""
Pasha gets to it  the hold of Mohun
Bagan 
""
This time Tarun De aheads it away 
""
Butia 
""
East Bengal at the receiving end 
""
Slowly pull the ball out Chapman  ones the ball
gone how to play 
""
Alok Mukherjee  back onto the playing arena with the throw in
""
""
Satyajeet Chatterjee 
""
Pushing forward 
""
In the ball  from
Ancheri 
""
""
Atanu quiet yet 
""
""
Behind it  not in the ideal
situation 
""
So even attempt  meanwhile a foul
commited 
""
Rakshit 
""
East Bengal fearing to lose  which was evident
earlier on 
""
Tanomoi Bose 
""
Satyajit Chatterjee 
""
Ansari 
""
Ball to Gautam Ghosh 
""
Ansari again 
""
To the right back Chandra 
""
Passes it inside the box 
""
Vijayan now 
""
He will have to gather speed  he will have to give a long ball
through  gives enough of time to the Mohun Bagan
defender to fall back in position 
""
Here comes the cross  will have
nothing go pass him 
""
Vijayan all over  he is like the human machine
""
""
He and Ancheri really haven't  stop things going for Mohun
Bagan 
""
Swaroop Das  and Tarun De have been outstanding in the deep
present as indeed Iliyas Pasha  Dulal Biswas has been doing a good
overlap on the left for East Bengal 
""
Here is Bernard  back passing you can see he is giving it away
to East Bengal 
""
Majumdar  Chatterjee here is Bernard
now for Mohun Bagan 
""
Gentle throw to Ancheri  but quiet
harmlessly 
""
Sushanu De 
""
There is a too long  one to one
situation 
""
Easily outwitted Satyajit 
""
Gautam Ghosh  Mohun Bagan
looking dangerous now 
""
""
What you say to that  with just a goal keeper
to beat 
""
With the out step of his left  to the
way 
""
""
Here watch it again  a good piece of workmen Gautam Ghosh
 Vijayan has moved up
""
""
And all Ancheri is to do is to kick it away with his right he
prefers his left because  coming in his
view 
""
And he had so much of time  angle as well
""
""
That makes the mess of it 
""
So East Bengal survive 
""
Nil nil  as we move into the thirty-first minute of the second
half 
""
Yes Mohun Bagans attack again there is going up Ancheri 
""
Well  one word
 in the thirty-first
minute of the second half 
""
Movements again from the right  warmed it and Mohun Bagan were
looking dominating  Gautam
Ghosh on the right  Ancheri
""
""
This time he is not making any mistake he controls with his left
""
""
He outwit  the deep defence Swaroop Das as top on the wrong
foot Dulal Biswas is left behind  which
is  and
""
""
So luck eventully running out for East Bengal 
""
Ancheri 
two words 
""
Throwing for Mohun Bagan 
""
""
""
""
""
So  going to be Mohun Bagan for the kick off
with Vijayan 
""
Akeel Ansari 
""
Alok Das 
""
Vijayan 
""
East Bengal gain position Gunabir again now  to Mohun Bagan
""
""
""
Gunabir is a link man 
""
""
Back passing 
taken by 
""
 give there to Vikas Panje
""
""
Panje looks for Carlton Chapman 
""
Alok Mukherjee is there 
""
Ranjan Dey 
""
Alok Mukherjee  Vijayan will not get
through it 
""
""
Comes to Butia 
""
Butia for East Bengal 
""
""
Short pass 
""
Rakshit 
""
Tushar Rakshit  by
""
""
Gautam Ghosh 
""
Mohun Bagan in position 
""
Up comes Amitabh Chandra 
""
To his right striker 
""
Tackled by Dulal Biswas as he crosses 
""
Iliyas Pasha was the men carrying away from there 
""
Satyajit 
""
Butia 
the left back
