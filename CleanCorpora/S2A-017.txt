Phalke award winners award winners of this year excellencies 
distinguished film personalities representative of the film industry the
media ladies and gentleman 
It gives me great pleasure to welcome you to this evening function
To honour the artists and technicians who have con
 contributed to cinematic excellence during the
course of the year 
Indian cinema has today carved out a place for itself in
popular imagination and convincingly left behind all other forms of
entertainment 
The credit for this goes to those innumerable artists who
constantly endeavour to attain success of perfection while adhering to
the Indian spirit 
Over the years as a number of films produced has gone up 
so has the number of national awards confer 
Three awards for feature films were given in the year nineteen
fifty-four 
Today one hundred sixteen persons involved in fifty-one
films will receive awards 
We do need to review regulations for these awards and make
further improvement to effectively encourage the best in Indian
cinema 
Shall we take this opportunity to greet all the award winners
who are assembled here 
We take justifiable pride in their achievements 
And I earnestly hope that this recognition of their merit will
act as an incentive to them to strive for greater excellence in their
chosen disciplines 
We have with us Shri K P Singh Deo honourable minister for
Information and Broadcasting to grace the occassion with his presence
I extend to him a very warm welcome 
The honourable President of India has also consented to join us

representatives of the film industry the media and special invitees
who all here to share the pride and joy of this momentous occasion 
Thank you 
 In Hindi 
Good evening 
Honourable Minister for Information and Broadcasting Mr K P Singh
Deo the Secretary Information and Broadcasting Ministry Mr Bhaskar
Ghosh Dadamuni Bhupenda Jairaj Saab Chairman of jury and
distinguished guest 
Perhaps it would be churlish to say that the entries received 
for the best popular cinema and this film criticism where by large
 mediocre and substandard 
On a more positive note let me state that it was an interesting
exercise 
To plough through the entries and separate the wheat from the
chaff 
A handfull of the books and articles indicate us that there is
hope yet for analytical and insightful writing 
The award wining book Nalu Nenu by the
veteran actress Dr Bhanumati Ramakrishna underscores the point that we
need more candid and informative autobiographies from film personalities
I need to hardly remind you that biographical accounts 
written in West have been important adjuncts to the process of film
making 
For instance many of us have cherished the life stories 
authored by the greats of cinema ranging from memorable biography of
Charlie Chaplin To the flashback on the life and career
 by Vanessa Redgrave 
Curiously very few of our own film luminaries have opted to put pen
to paper 
It would indeed be wonderful if directors technicians and
the acting fraternity recounted stories of their tryst with the art and
craft of film making 
At this point I must regret the tendency of most Indian publishers
to capitalise on the deaths of film personality 
Whether it was the legendary Meena Kumari or the grand showman 
Raj Kapoor scant attention was paid to the artistry during their own
lifetime 
In addition a note of caution has to be struck 
The year nineteen ninety-five will be celebrated as the
centenary of cinema the world over 
If the event becomes an excuse for sketchy and quickly
assembled books on cinema it would indeed be a pity 
Both research and reflection are essential before any major
endeavour in film writing is undertaken 
To come now to film criticism on the whole the entries in this
section displays a thorough lack of humour 
Most of the reviews and the report submitted were weighed down
 by excessive verbiage 
Without adding anymore verbiage of my own let me conclude with
a small request to the authorities from me and my colleagues on the
panel Miss Vasudev and Miss Uday Tara Nair could the cash prize in
the categories of the best book on cinema and best film criticism be
increased from the current amount of rupees fifteen thousand
each 
Dare we say to rupees twenty-five thousand each
That would be an extra incentive 
Here is ending then on the note of optimism 
Thank you 
Thank you very much Khalid for presenting your comments 
I now like to invite the Chairman of the non- feature film jury
 Shri K Vikram Singh to present his address 
Good evening 
Honourable Minister for Information and Broadcasting 
Shri Singh Deo Secretary Information Broad 
 Broadcasting Shri Bhaskar Ghosh fellow
film makers ladies and gentleman 
It has been a great pleasure for me and other members of the non-
feature film jury to see and select films for the non-feature film
awards 
I am happy with report that the documentary film in India is
in a state of good health 
And the short drama film is also picking up 
This is despite the fact that the number of entries in the
non-feature category has declined from one fifty nineteen eighty-five 
to only sixty-eight this year 
This decline I think is mainly on account of the fact 
that is lot of non-fiction work has shifted from the film format to
the video format 
This body of work on video format is still going largely
unrecognised 
This jury has therefore separately recommended that
documentaries and short films on the video format should be brought
within the fold of the national awards 
How that can be done is left to an expert committee 
But there is one field of documentary film which is facing
imminent death 
This is the yarn of political documentary 
There were very few political documentaries in this years
entry 
It is not as if the film makers have lost interest in this one
word 
Perhaps the real reason is that the culture of respecting
dissent is fast disappearing from our social political life 
And therefore the social funding political films have died
out 
If different and even clashing views are not battled and
sorted out on the floors of legislative body and in the media they
are bound to violently overflow on the streets 
There is an urgent need therefore for creating a framework 
on our statefunded television that is doordarshan 
within which voices of dissent can be responsibly expressed 
I would urge the government as a research step 
doordarshan should air off a weakly slot which may be called the
other vaults the other views
In this research oriented documentaries of the political nature
 should be shown 
These should be funded by doordarshan but the
overall thing is monitoring of this slot should be vested in a
non-political body of indepen of independent
 intellectual 
National film awards are a celebration of cinema as an art form
A beginning was made several years ago to name an award 
after Dada Saheb Phalke and another award after Nargis Dutt 
It is time we took another step in this direction 
I suggest that the government should name the awards for the
best film on social issues in the non-feature category after S 
Suth Ray who still remain inadequately recognised 
I would also suggest that the government should name the best
feature films award after Satyajit Ray who is without question the
greatest film writer and one of the finest mind that India has
produced in this century
