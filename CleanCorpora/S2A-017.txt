Phalke award winners

To honour the artists and technicians  con

constantly endeavour to attain success of perfection  while adhering to
""
""
Over the years 
""
""
Three awards for feature films were given in the year nineteen
""
""
""
""
""
We do need to review regulations for these awards  and make
further improvement  the best in Indian

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
act as an incentive to them  in their

""
We have with us Shri K P Singh Deo honourable minister for

The honourable President of India  has also consented to join us

Deo  Mr Bhaskar
""
distinguished guest 
""
Perhaps it would be churlish to say that the entries received 
for the best popular cinema  where by large
""
""
""
""
""
""
chaff 
""
""
""
""
""
veteran actress Dr Bhanumati Ramakrishna  underscores the point that we
""
""
""
""
written in West  to the process of film
""
""
For instance 
""
Charlie Chaplin  To the flashback on the life and career
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
At this point I must regret the tendency of most Indian publishers
""
""
Whether it was the legendary Meena Kumari or the grand showman 
""
lifetime 
""
In addition a note of caution has to be struck 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
section displays a thorough lack of humour 
""
Most of the reviews and the report submitted  were weighed down
""
""
Without adding anymore verbiage of my own  let me conclude with
a small request  from me and my colleagues on the
""
""
increased from the current amount of  fifteen thousand
""
""
Dare we say to  twenty-five thousand each

non-feature category 
""
""
This decline 
""
""
""
""
""
""
This jury has therefore  that
""
within the fold of the national awards 
""
How that can be done 
""
But there is one field of documentary film  which is facing
""
""
""
""
""
entry 
""
""
word 
""
Perhaps the real reason is  that the culture of respecting
""
""
""
out 
""
""
sorted out on the floors of legislative body  they
are bound to violently overflow 
""
There is an urgent need therefore 
""
within which voices of dissent 
""
""
doordarshan  should air off a weakly slot which may be called the
""
""
""
""
""
""
overall  is monitoring of this slot should be vested in a

""
""
National film awards are a celebration of cinema as an art form
""
""
""
after Dada Saheb Phalke 
""
""
""
""
""
Suth 
""
I would also suggest that the government should name the best

produced in this century
