""
Ladies and gentleman Mr Bhaskar Ghosh 
""
""
Honarary Minister of Information and Broadcasting  Shri
 different
Phalke award winners 
distinguished film personalities  representative of the film industry the
media 
""
It gives me great pleasure to welcome you to this evening function
""
""
To honour the artists and technicians  con
 during the
course of the year 
""
Indian cinema has today  carved out a place for itself in
popular imagination  all other forms of
entertainment 
""
The credit for this  who
constantly endeavour to attain success of perfection  while adhering to
the Indian spirit 
""
Over the years 
so has the number of national awards confer 
""
Three awards for feature films were given in the year nineteen
fifty-four

We do need to review regulations for these awards  and make

""
""
This years Phalke award recipient  Majrooh
Sultanpuri  distinguished
representatives of the film industry  and special invitees
who all here to share the pride and joy 
""
Thank you 
""
""
""
""
""
Good evening 
""
Honourable Minister for Information and Broadcasting Mr K P Singh
Deo  Mr Bhaskar
Ghosh  and
distinguished guest 
""
Perhaps it would be churlish to say that the entries received 
for the best popular cinema  where by large
""
""
On a more positive note let me state that it was an interesting
exercise 
""
To plough through the entries and separate  the wheat from the
chaff 
""
A handfull of the books and articles indicate us  that there is
hope yet 
""
The award wining book  by the
veteran actress Dr Bhanumati Ramakrishna  underscores the point that we
need more candid  and informative autobiographies from film personalities
""
""
I need to hardly remind you 
written in West  to the process of film
making 
""
For instance 
authored by the greats of cinema  of
Charlie Chaplin  To the flashback on the life and career
""
""
Curiously very few of our own film luminaries have opted to put pen
to paper 
""
It would indeed be wonderful  and
the acting fraternity recounted stories of their tryst  with the art and
craft of film making 
""
At this point I must regret the tendency of most Indian publishers
to capitalise on the deaths of film personality 
""
Whether it was the legendary Meena Kumari or the grand showman 
Raj Kapoor  scant attention was paid to the artistry during their own
lifetime 
""
In addition a note of caution has to be struck 
""
The year nineteen ninety-five  will be celebrated as the
centenary of cinema 
""
If the event becomes an excuse for sketchy  and quickly
assembled books on cinema 
""
Both research and reflection are essential  before any major
endeavour in film writing is undertaken 
""
To come now to film criticism  on the whole the entries in this
section displays a thorough lack of humour 
""
Most of the reviews and the report submitted  were weighed down
""
""
Without adding anymore verbiage of my own  let me conclude with
a small request  from me and my colleagues on the
panel  could the cash prize in
the categories of the best book on cinema  and best film criticism be
increased from the current amount of  fifteen thousand
each 
""
Dare we say to  twenty-five thousand each
""
""
That would be an extra incentive 
""
Here is ending then 
""
Thank you 
""
""
Thank you very much Khalid for presenting your comments 
""
I now like to invite the Chairman of the non- feature film jury
""
""
""
Good evening 
""
Honourable Minister for Information and Broadcasting 
Shri 
 fellow
film makers 
""
It has been a great pleasure for me and other members of the non-
feature film jury  for the non-feature film
awards 
""
I am happy with report  that the documentary film in India is
in a state of good health 
""
And the short drama film 
""
This is despite the fact  that the number of entries in the
non-feature category 
to only sixty-eight this year 
""
This decline 
that is lot of non-fiction work  to
the video format 
""
This body of work on video format  is still going largely
unrecognised 
""
This jury has therefore  that
documentaries and short films on the video format  should be brought
within the fold of the national awards 
""
How that can be done 
""
But there is one field of documentary film  which is facing
imminent death 
""
This is the yarn of political documentary 
""
There were very few political documentaries  in this years
entry 
""
It is not as if the film makers have lost interest in this  one
word 
""
Perhaps the real reason is  that the culture of respecting
dissent 
""
And therefore  have died
out 
""
If different and even clashing views  are not battled and
sorted out on the floors of legislative body  they
are bound to violently overflow 
""
There is an urgent need therefore 
on our statefunded television 
within which voices of dissent 
""
I would urge the government 
doordarshan  should air off a weakly slot which may be called the
other vaults  the other views
""
In this research oriented documentaries of the political nature
""
""
These should be funded by  but the
overall  is monitoring of this slot should be vested in a
non-political body  of independent
""
""
National film awards are a celebration of cinema as an art form
""
""
A beginning was made several years ago 
after Dada Saheb Phalke 
""
It is time we took another step in this direction 
""
I suggest  that the government should name the awards for the
best film 
Suth 
""
I would also suggest that the government should name the best
feature films award  who is without question the
greatest film writer  that India has
produced in this century
