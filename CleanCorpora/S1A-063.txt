<I>
Hello sir please sit down here 
Here 
 Haan 
I am M G Hegde from Kunta Karnataka 
 It's in north Canara district 
Kunta is in north Canara district 
You might have heard of Gokarna 
Gokarna 
Yeah my place is very near to Gokarna 
 Accha 
And you 
I am from Malkhed Karnataka 
It is in the Gulbarga district and uh you might have heard
about the Rastrakutas and all 
Oh ah ha Malkhed happens to be ah yeah 
happen to be the kingdom
 Ah yeah 
Capital uhm capital city of this Rastrakutas
 Uhm 
Uhm 
And uh it is at one time uhm it is said
that it is uh it was bigger than uhm it is a big city
 uhm of India what we see now uhm uhm uhm 
so bigger than that one 
 Uhm 
 Uhm 
 Uhm 
 Uhm uhm uhm 
Uhm 
It was said like that and uh some more historical places
are also there 
Uhm 
And uh another thing is that there is uh 
math Anandi Math 
Of which community 
Of Brahmin's community 
And uh you might have heard that there are two sects in 
uh among the Brahmins only
 Uhm 
Uhm
Uh usually there are many but primarily
Vaishnavites 
 Shaivas and Vaishnavites uhm
So acharya whose samadhi 
is there so he belonged to the Vaishnava sect
Uhm 
And just like how we see in one word 
sanjeevan samadhi uhm our Raghvendra 
Swamiji had taken
 Uhm 
 Uhm 
Uhm
Like that the one word say it is 
 uhm and uh he is called as the Tikacharya also 
uhm because he had written commentaries uhm on uh
 the works of Madhavacharya you might have heard about 
Madhavacharya 
 Uhm 
 Uhm 
 Uhm 
 Uhm uhm 
So in this way that Malkhed has got its own
importance uhm as being historic historical uh see
spot as well as uh religious sort of so
 Uhm 
 One word uhm 
Well Malkhed is mentioned in in many of the history texts
Yeah 
But uh my place is not so the history of North Canara 
 haan is not known at all 
Though uh probably uh from the religious point of view
Gokarna is rather known but for the bu but for that history of
the place is not really uhm uhm yet yet to be explored you know
 Haan 
Uhn
There is lot of scope for uh research 
For research 
Researchers because there were many kingdoms small
chieftains 
Chieftains 
Uh belonging to the Vijayanagara Empire
Uhn 
Uhm Chintanani you must know that one time it
was Chedas stronghold two words was Chedas
stronghold 
 Stronghold yeah 
And later uhm when Swadhi kings acquired the area uhm
mm they they were Brahmins mainly 
They convereted all these Jaina temples into uh 
into Jaina uh viharas structures 
vihars into temples
 Temples 
 Vihars 
In fact it is said even Gokarna Mahableshwar temple is one
such Jaina architecture 
 One word 
 O one is one is not very sure of it but 
 lot of research is uhn uhm is going on now-a-days 
 ah ha but uh and also pre-historical monuments are
found in the area 
That way it has acquired lot of significance ah 
from that point of view histo point of view of historical
research 
 Uhn 
 Uhn 
 Ah ha 
 Ah 
By the way where do you work 
I am working at malkhed only 
Malkhed there is uh one factory Rajashree cement you
might have heard of it
Oh Rajashree cement
At at Rajashree cement
Uhn 
And Bharti Vidya Bhavan has two words 
 one school there uhm and I'm I'm 
working in that school 
 Hey Arun please sit down 
 Uhm 
Uhm 
And uh that Malkhed is very nearby uhm 
it's seven kilometers away from Malkhed 
 Uhm 
Ah ha 
So even at Malkhed also one basti is
there Jain basti uhm at Malkhed 
And uh in that Jain basti there are
some models of uh ancient bastis 
 Uhm 
Uhm 
It is uh totally neglected by the department of archeology
Uhm 
Once uh I had gone to archeological department and uh
 I requested them to take care of all these valuable things
 uhm what all have remained there 
And the key the key of that basati is given to
 one of the persons who is not belonging to that sect 
 uhm I mean Jain
 Uhm 
 Uhm 
Uhm 
So there is possibility of happening anything at
any time
Uhm 
But they assured me that they will they would take care of
that one and then many times I took children also uhm 
to that basti to show them 
 Uhm 
Now one uh ruined fort is there fort is there
Uhm 
And it's uh illegally occupied by some of the
people uhm there and they have made homes 
There they have constructed homes there and one person is
living as if he is the king ah and his car you know it
goes upto the top of the fort
 Uhm 
 Ah 
 Laughs 
Ahn and he has used the the place where the
palace once palace might be there and that portion and the
remaining part he built uhm an antenna he has fixed it
there at the top 
 Uhm Laughs 
So his car goes upto that top of that uh 
mound
 Mound 
What all what all mound is there inside the fort
Uhm 
And uhm apart from this uhm recently one historian
visited that uh place
Uhm 
And uh he is conducting lot of research in this
regard 
He told that that fort it was actually not build by the
Rastrakutas the fort existing fort 
It was build by these kutubshahis 
Ah ha 
 Kutubshahis so the remains what all
are there uhn the partial portion uhm of
the fort outside and that is the ancient one you know what I mean by that
 it's such one word 
 Uhn 
 Uhm 
Uhn 
The remaining what all we find now that is all that
was all uhn constructed by the kutubshahis 
But uh inside there is there are some gates within
that fort 
But there we find that the image of Mahavira at the entrance
 and all 
So it means that some of the remains are there which
 are belongs to the rastrakutas 
Well how many teachers are there in the staff in your school
Uh we are uhm forty 
Oh quite a big school it is
Yes 
 It's affiliated to C B S E uhm C B S E
 its plus two uhm pattern school it is 
 Uhm 
 Uhm 
But you have the classes upto tenth 
Upto twelfth standard 
Eleventh and twelfth that's called higher secondary
school 
Ha ha it it includes uh plus two plus two
classes 
 Plus two classes yeah 
Junior colleges 
Not it is yeah it is 
 Junior college and and high shcool 
 combine 
 High school combined
Uh uh composite composite junior college
Composite junior college 
Uh uhm something like this
Yeah something like this 
We have very few of them that composite schools
Uhm 
Uh partly uhm in one word nearby well here
villages are all so near to the uh taluka place
you know 
They are not that far off 
Maybe because of that we don't have many junior colleges but
colleges rather over populated 
We have more than more two thousand five hundred students 
More than two thousand 
Five hundred students 
 Five hundred students 
And all sorts of courses are also available 
 Very considerable strength ahn 
Arts Science Commerce Polytechnic and uh so
many vocational courses so these are offered 
And staff consists of sixty-five plus fifteen plus fifteen
plus eight
Uhm 
Such a big staff and English department in the
English department we have seven plus two plus one plus one 
We don't have any separate departments but the thing is
that our school it is uh run by Rajashree Cement 
it's financed by Rajarshree Cement
Uhm 
And administered by Bharati Vidya Bhavan 
You might have heard about Bharati Vidya Bhavan 
Now this cement factory people have no business over your
administration
No 
 That's sort of
But local committee is there 
Uh ha 
They have formed our local committee but the thing is
that they they are financing 
But in the day to day administration
Administration it is all done by Bharati Vidya Bhavan 
So they don't interfere
They don't interfere but they have right to interfere
Uhm laugh 
That is there because they are financing
Uh that's what I am uh asking about
 Uh 
Another thing is that it is uh only uh it is far away
from uh our locality because it's our kendra
 our school belongs to our Kurkunda Kurkunda also one more
school is there 
Uhm
And
So one word the transferrable things then you can be
transferred
No no it is not our jobs are not transferable
Uh 
Once we get appointments means over
Uh 
We have to serve there only whenever we get the
appointment order if you want to transfer again you have to appear
 the interview
Uhm that would be a fresh appointment
Fresh appointment 
And your service will be not counted
Uhm 
If you seek any 
In the private colleges well this transfer business 
 uhn is possible but one one has to forgo uhm seniority
 Uhn 
Seniority 
You will be the junior most on the on the college that
you joins 
And uh but in salary he is protected and but for that 
both the management should agree
Agree 
Uh this management should be ready to relieve you and
that management should be uhm ready to uh take you in then only such
transfers are possible 
Uhm normally uhm well people are not transferred 
They don't want transfer now because they can
live a settled life 
 Now 
 Only only when the management has more than
one college probably transfers are possible uhn or
private colleges
 Uhn 
In fact we requested our management to transfer us
To 
To some of the shcools of Hyderabad and let
the people of Hyderabad come here and serve
 What what 
What advantage do you have 
No because at least there will be a change 
There will be a change because uh one way you get uh
fed up of the environment 
Hey
Uhn because it is uh factory area
Especially uh
Factory area and uh mostly polluted area it is
Uhm so one does not like the area 
 Due to the storm of dust and all so
One doesn't like to stay in the area
One doesn't one doesn't like to stay there and
Hyderabadi people are very happy
They are very happy or just because Kurkund in
Kurkunda also there is one cement factory C C I has opened uh means
set up one uh factory there cement factory there 
And our school okay it is also near to Rajashree Cement
Uhm 
So in this way the totally the environment is 
polluted
Uhm uhm
By these uh by these cement factories 
How many schools were there in Hydera one school
in Hyderabad
I know in Karnataka I think all over Karnataka only 
two schools are there
And in Andhra Pradesh 
 Whereas in Andhra Pradesh many schools are
there 
So there there also this factories must be in Andhra
Pradesh 
No no what I tell you I am talking about Bharati
Vidya Bhavan 
Uh
 Bhavan's schools 
Uh uh 
In uh Karnataka
It is financed by these uhn and else where
may be some other
 Uhn 
Else where some other factories industries
Uh ha uh ah 
So they finance
I understand I understand 
So Bharati Vidya Bhavan people have such type of persons
only 
Uhn 
Who can run the school laughs who can finance
Finance the school
And uh ah yeah run the school so that is the thing 
In this way because
And what about the salary and other things 
Salary and all as per the grade 
Government
Government central government as the teachers get 
 Kendriya 
Uh yeah in kendriya vidyalaya 
Grades are fixed as soon as you get appointment uh uh
when the document will be given to you and in that clearly it is
mentioned in which grade you are 
Ah you you are placed
You are placed that's there 
Uhm uhm 
And our Canara Bank is there 
Uhm 
In that Canara Bank we draw all our salaray so
 that system is good uhm well furnished quarters are
allotted 
 Uhm 
Uhm uhm 
To all the teachers 
You have cinema halls and all 
Uhn 
Cinema theaters 
No cinema theatres 
Uh the thing is that they have given this star plus
uh cable
 It is urban area 
Or a rural area 
It is urbanisation is taking place
Ah yeah 
The thing is that it is rural area only but uh the
people are from all over india uhm they are staying here
 Uhm 
Uh getting cosmopolitan
Cosmopolitan it is it is bit like that 
So in this way our colony uh Aditya Nagar is
 Aditya Nagar is just like a mini-India laughs I can
say
 Uh 
Uhm okay fine
