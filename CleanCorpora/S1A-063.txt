""
""
Hello sir please sit down here 
""
""
Here 
""
""
""
""
I am 
""
""
""
Kunta is in north Canara district 
""
You might have heard of Gokarna 
""
""
Gokarna 
""
""
Yeah my place is 
""
""
""
""
""
And you 
""
""
I am from 
""
It is in the Gulbarga district  you might have heard
about 
""
""
Oh 
happen to be the kingdom
""
""
""
""
""
Capital  capital city of this Rastrakutas
""
""
""
""
""
Uhm 
""
""
And uh  it is said
that it is uh  it is a big city
""
so bigger than 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Uhm 
""
""
It was said like that  and uh some more historical places
are also there 
""
""
Uhm 
""
""
And uh 
math 
""
""
Of which community 
""
""
Of 
""
And uh you might have heard that there are two sects 
uh  only
""
""
""
""
""
Uhm
""
""
Uh usually there are many  primarily
Vaishnavites 
""
""
 uhm
""
""
So 
is there  the Vaishnava sect
""
""
Uhm 
""
""
And just like how we see in 
sanjeevan samadhi 
Swamiji  taken
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Uhm
""
""
Like that 
""
uhm  on uh
""
Madhavacharya 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
So in this way  its own
importance  see
spot as well  sort of so
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Well Malkhed is mentioned in  in many of the history texts
""
""
Yeah 
""
""
But uh my place is not so 
""
""
Though  uh from the religious point of view
Gokarna is rather known  but for that history of
the place is not really  yet to be explored you know
""
""
""
""
""
Uhn
""
""
There is lot of scope for 
""
""
For research 
""
""
Researchers  small
chieftains 
""
""
Chieftains 
""
""
Uh belonging to  the Vijayanagara Empire
""
""
Uhn 
""
""
Uhm  one time it
was Chedas stronghold  was Chedas
stronghold 
""
""
""
""
""
And later uhm when  uhm
mm they 
""
They convereted all these Jaina temples into 
into Jaina 
vihars  into temples
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
In fact it is said  even Gokarna Mahableshwar temple is one
such Jaina architecture 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
 pre-historical monuments are
found in the area 
""
That way it has acquired lot of significance 
from that point of view  point of view of historical
research 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
By the way where do you work 
""
""
I am working at malkhed only 
""
Malkhed  you
might have heard of it
""
""
Oh Rajashree cement
""
""
At at Rajashree cement
""
""
Uhn 
""
""
And Bharti Vidya Bhavan has 
""
working in that school 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Uhm 
""
""
And uh 
it's 
""
""
""
""
""
Ah ha 
""
""
So  is
there 
""
And uh  there are
some models of uh 
""
""
""
""
""
Uhm 
""
""
It is uh totally neglected  by the department of archeology
""
""
""
Uhm 
""
""
Once uh  and uh
 things
""
""
And the key  is given to
""
 Jain
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Uhm 
""
""
So  at
any time
""
""
Uhm 
""
""
But they assured me that they will they would take care of
that one 
to that 
""
""
""
""
""
Now one  fort is there
""
""
Uhm 
""
""
And  illegally occupied by some of the
people 
""
There they have constructed homes there  and one person is
living as if he is the  and his car you know it
goes  fort
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Ahn  place where the
palace  and the
remaining part he built  antenna he has fixed it
there at the top 
""
""
""
""
""
So 
mound
""
""
""
""
""
What all  what all mound is there inside the fort
""
""
Uhm 
""
""
And uhm apart from this  uhm recently one historian
visited  that uh place
""
""
Uhm 
""
""
And uh  in this
regard 
""
He told that  it was actually not build by the
Rastrakutas 
""
It was build by these 
""
""
Ah ha 
""
""
 what all
are there  of
the fort outside  and that is the ancient one you know what I mean by that
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Uhn 
""
""
The remaining what all we find now  that
was all 
""
But uh inside  within
that fort 
""
But there we find  that the image of Mahavira at the entrance
""
""
So  which
""
""
""
Well how many teachers are there in the staff in your school
""
""
Uh we are 
""
""
Oh  quite a big school it is
""
""
Yes 
""
 C B S E
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
But 
""
""
Upto twelfth standard 
""
Eleventh and twelfth  called higher secondary
school 
""
""
Ha ha  plus two
classes 
""
""
""
""
""
Junior colleges 
""
""
Not it is 
""
""
""
""
""
""
 combined
""
""
Uh uh  composite junior college
""
""
Composite junior college 
""
""
Uh uhm  something like this
""
""
Yeah something like this 
""
""
We have very few of them  that composite schools
""
""
Uhm 
""
""
Uh partly uhm  well here
villages are all  place
you know 
""
They are not that far off 
""
Maybe because of that we don't have many junior colleges  but
colleges rather over populated 
""
We have more than 
""
""
More than two thousand 
""
""
Five hundred 
""
""
""
""
""
And all sorts of courses are also 
""
""
""
""
""
Arts  so
many vocational courses 
""
And staff consists of  sixty-five plus fifteen plus fifteen
plus  eight
""
""
Uhm 
""
""
Such a big staff and  in the
English department we have 
""
""
We don't have any separate departments  but the thing is
that 
it's  financed by Rajarshree Cement
""
""
Uhm 
""
""
And administered by Bharati Vidya Bhavan 
""
You might have heard about Bharati Vidya Bhavan 
""
""
Now this cement factory people have no business over your
administration
""
""
No 
""
""
 sort of
""
""
But local committee is there 
""
""
Uh ha 
""
""
They have formed our local committee  but the thing is
that they 
""
""
But in the day to day administration
""
""
Administration it is all done by Bharati Vidya Bhavan 
""
""
So they don't interfere
""
""
They don't interfere but they have right  to interfere
""
""
Uhm 
""
""
That is there because  they are financing
""
""
Uh  asking about
""
""
""
""
""
""
Another thing is that it is  uh it is far away
from uh  kendra
 our Kurkunda Kurkunda also one more
school is there 
""
""
Uhm
""
""
And
""
""
So  the transferrable things then you can be
transferred
""
""
No no it is not our jobs are not transferable
""
""
Uh 
""
""
Once we get appointments means  over
""
""
Uh 
""
""
We have to serve  whenever we get the
appointment order  appear
 the interview
""
""
Uhm that would be a fresh appointment
""
""
Fresh appointment 
""
And your service will be  not counted
""
""
Uhm 
""
""
If you seek any 
""
""
In the private colleges well 
 uhm seniority
""
""
""
""
""
Seniority 
""
""
You will be the junior most on the  on the college that
you joins 
""
And uh 
both the management should agree
""
""
Agree 
""
""
Uh this management should be ready to relieve you  and
that management should be  then only such
transfers are possible 
""
Uhm normally 
""
""
They don't want transfer  because they can
live a 
""
""
""
""
""
 more than
one college probably transfers  or
private colleges
""
""
""
""
""
In fact  management to transfer us
""
""
""
To 
""
""
To  let
the  and serve
""
""
""
""
""
What advantage do you have 
""
""
No because 
""
There will be a change  uh
fed up of 
""
""
Hey
""
""
Uhn  because it is uh factory area
""
""
Especially uh
""
""
Factory area  mostly polluted area it is
""
""
Uhm so 
""
""
 so
""
""
One doesn't like to stay in the area
""
""
One doesn't  and
""
""
Hyderabadi people are very happy
""
""
They are very happy  just because Kurkund in
Kurkunda also there is one cement factory  uh means
set up one uh 
""
And  okay it is also near to Rajashree Cement
""
""
Uhm 
""
""
So in this way 
polluted
""
""
Uhm uhm
""
""
By these uh 
""
""
How many schools were there in  one school
in Hyderabad
""
""
I know 
two  schools are there
""
""
And in 
""
""
