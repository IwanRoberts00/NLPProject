Reproduction is essential for continuation of species in nature
For this to occur sperm a male gamete and the ovum the
female gamete are necessary 
A proper understanding of a male reproductive system is
essential to understand the intricate mechanisms of nature 
The male reproductive system provides for the production and
subsequent delivery of a highly specialised male gamete called sperm
 which is produced in the testies 
 The ca the cell consists of
paternal genes and this genetic complement is transferred to the
female gamete during the act of fertilisation 
To facilitate the essential function a male reproductive
system forms a complet complete structure
The organisation of the male reproductive system comprises a
pair of testes epididemus vasaeference a complex array of
accessory male genetic glands penis 
In many animals the testes is a scrotal imposition just as
in the case of man 
But in some species testes occupy abdominal positions 
There are wide spectrum of variation in the location of the testes
The position of the testes in different groups of mamal shows
enormous variation in terms of its location 
For example in the case of elephant higher access the
testes lies just behind the kidney 
In the case of hedgehog and some other insectivores the
testes is located against the ventral abdominal wall 
In the case of pigs rats horses rabbits dogs
and cats the position of the testes is in non pendulum scrotum is
underneath the anus 
In dolphins armedillos cavity slogs the testes is
located at posterior end of abdomen 
In the case of moults shoos and some species of birds the
testes is located at the base of the tail 
In sheep cattle and other ruminants also in some primates
 the scrotum is pendulous 
The typical male reproductive system consists of pair testes
 which may be located in the scrotum or may be present in the abdomen
The testes are uh provided with a thick fibres cover 
called tunica alveginia 
The testes is divided into many compartments and consists of
many coil tibules which are called as semeniferous tibules 
In between seminiferous tibules lie special type of cells 
which are called as interstitial cells or the cells of leddes 
The semeniferous tibules in a section consists of large
number of cell types 
Basically these cell types are two the germs cells and
the cells of sattory 
The germs cells are concerned with the production of spermatozoa
 while the cells of sattory basically have the nutritive function 
If the cross section of the semeniferous tibule is examined 
one would find the upper pair of cells to be spermatogonia 
These themselves are of several types 
They have been classified into spermatogonia of the a b and
intermediate type 
Even the a and b type of spermatogonia are of several subtypes
 which are classified on the basis of their cytological
characteristics 
The first generation of primary spermatocites cells these
undergo myosis 
The myosis itself is of two types reduction division where
a number of chromosomes is reduced to half and myosis two which is an
equational division where there is an increase in the number of cells 
unaccompanied by further reduction in the number of chromosomes 
A primary spermatocites give rise to secondary spermatocites 
which I have n number of chromosomes and are therefore called as haploid
cells 
The secondary spermatocites grow into round spermatics 
These spermatics undergo a process of differentiation which
is called as spermeogenesis 
There are essentially four basic steps in this process one is
called as gorgie followed by a cap phase and agrosome phase and a
maturation phase 
The spermatozoa which are derive from spermatics are
highly organised cells 
From a genetic point of view these sperms are half cells
because they contain haploid or half the number of chromosomes 
If you take the example of human the deployed number for
dual number chromosomes is forty-six 
At the end of spermatogenesis therefore the sperm contains 
twenty-three chromosomes 
These sperms may contain either x chromosome or y and
genetically therefore they are dimorphic 
This text just enumerated above describe a typical structure of
the seminiferous epithilium 
However this should be understood that the cells present
in the seminiferous epithilium are in a stage of progressive development
All seminiferous epithilium cells do not show the same 
associations 
That is that the arrangement of cells in each seminiferous
tibules is different 
Sometimes a large variety of cells can be seen in
successive stages of development 
The cell association is the term used to describe the
arrangement of cells that is spermatogonia the primary spermatocites 
despermatates and the differentiation process that is seen in the
process of sperm formation 
In the case of man there are six cell associations and fourteen
different cell types have been identified 
The cycle of development in the seminiferous epithilium 
which leads to the formation of a completely differentiated sperm is
called as sex cycle of the seminiferous epithilium 
It takes about seventy-four days for a sperm to be derived from
 the spermatogonia 
The sperm formed in the testes are incapable of 
fertilization and therefore they have to be uh they
have to transit through o other 
parts of the reproductive system particularly the epididamus 
The root of spermatozoa is quite definite 
From the testes they go into the retitestes and from where they
go through a small ducts which are called as vasaefeverence 
The vasaeference lead these sperms into the epididamus 
The epididamus itself consists of three main parts 
The top part which sits as a cap on the testes is called as
cafort epididamus 
The second part which forms the main body of epididamus is called
as corpus and the terminal or tail part of the epididamus is called
as corder 
During their transit from cafort to corpus and finally to
corder this sperm undergo vast and complex maturational changes 
It can rightly be said that the epididamus is the main point
 where the sperm undergo morphological biochemical and physiological
changes which endorsed and the property of fertilizing the egg
The sperm principally uh undergo changes in their
membrane property in the maturation of uh the acrosome in the
 uh ability to be more motile as they come into the corder 
It has also been seen that the sperms on the cafort are
incapable of fertilizing the egg and at best the rate of
fertilization is about five percent 
Corpus sperm usually are better about twenty percent but by the
time they reach the corder epididamus they their fertilizing potential is
about ninety-five percent 
From the corder they are transported to vasaeference 
and from there they are mixed with secretions of the essentially male
genetic glands the prostate the seminal cycles the valbo electral
glands also called as scoupers and some other minor glands which are
found in some species but not in others 
The mamalian spermatozoa is a highly differentiated cell 
The typical mamalian spermatozoa consists of three main parts
The head the mid piece and the tail 
The head is not itself a simple structure 
It contains on its interior aspect a structure which is called
as acrosome 
 The under the acrosome lies the nucleus which
takes on the same shape as the head itself 
The second part of the sperm is called as the mid piece 
which contains the powerhouse of the cell called mitochondria 
These mitochondria helically arranged and contains the
necessary enzymes which can use the nutrients of the seminal fluid 
for maintaining the integrity and functional abilities of the sperm 
The acrosome itself contains three different types of enzymes
 which are used in the process of fertilization 
The tail consists of three main parts 
The principal piece the end piece and a place where
the mid piece joins the tail 
The tail structure consists of two central filaments and nine
peripheral filaments 
The shape of this spermatozoa is very variable in the animals
The number of sperms produced is also highly variable 
For instance in the case of humans the number of sperms
produced in one ejaculate is of the order of two hundred to four hundred
million 
The physiological function of the testes depend on a
complex interplay of not only environmental factors but also on endocrine
secretions 
In principle extrinsic as well as intrinsic factors are
involved with the stimulation of the nervous system 
A part of the nervous system called hypothalamus contains
special type of nerve cells which are called as neurosecretary cells 
These cells secrete hormone which is called as 
gonadotropin releasing hormone 
These hormones can be transported to the pituitry by a
vascular root or thorugh nural connections and it stimulate cells of the
pituitry which in turn produces two types of hormones F S H and
L H 
The F S H act from the seminiferous epithilium and brings about
 the development and differentiation of various egg cell types namely 
from spermatogonia to spermatocites of primary and secondary type to
spermatits and the formation of a differentiated sperm by spermatogenesis
The F S H also acts on the certoli cells which are the nongerminal
elements and these in turn secrete certain proteins which bind with
the androgene produced in the ladic cells 
Such bound androgene proteins androgene bound
proteins hormones are again carried to the testicular
germinal epithelium where they bring about sustenance of
spermatogenesis 
The second hormone which is produced from the pituitry is called as
L H 
But in the case of male it is called as interstitial cell
stimulating hormone 
This hormone acts on ladic cells of the testes and 
 cau causes the release of androgene 
Androgene are important for large number of functions 
For instance androgene which are bound to androgene binding
protein produce certoli cells are important for spermatogenesis 
Androgene are also important for accessory male genetic gland
functions 
Androgenes are also involved with the development and
differentiation of secondary sex characteristics and they are also
concerned with libido and sexual behaviour in the case of animals 
In many animals the these events of endocrine secretions
occur cyclically 
For instance there are many animals in which these phenomena
occurs only once a year 
In others where this events may occur twice a year or in
still others this event may occur several times in a year 
In the case of man the process of spermatogenesis once it has
started continues for a very long period of time to the age of
seventy or even eighty years 
However the limiting factors in the start of reproductive
activities in the endocrine elements as well as in the testicular and
ladic cells depends on the attainment of puberty which are complex
sexual maturational changes that are time dependent 
In the case of human male they begin to occur at the age
of fifteen years 
The testicular spermatozoa thus produced find a way into 
the epididamus where sperms undergo maturational changes 
described above as well as they transit into the vasaeference
 
The flow of sperms from epididamus to the vaseeference is
partly by hydrostatic pressure as well as by peristaltic motion 
From vaseeference the sperms are mixed with the seminal
secretions contributed by the accessory male genetic glands 
They come into the urethra and uh the terminal part of
the urethra is the penis 
This penis is of two main types 
In the case of humans the penis is described as a vascular
type 
Because the erection of the penis depends on congestion of
blood 
There are two main mechanisms for this erection 
One is reflexogenic by spinal stimulation and the other is
 by vasocongestion 
The vasocongestion in this case may be psychogenic in 
in the case of man 
The second type of penis which is found in dogs and many other
carnivores is called as the vibroelastic type 
For copulation the sperms are deposited in female genital
tract 
The sperm uh with the seminal fluid constitute the semen
This has an alcaline ph 
The place where the sperms are deposited also shows variation 
In the case of humans the sperms are deposited in the vagina
 but in the animals like horses and others the sperms are deposited in the
uterus 
Irrespective of the site of deposition the millions of sperms
 face very hostile environment in the vagina and in the cervix 
The ninety-nine percent of the sperms or even more are
destroyed 
In the case of human female the sperms are able to reach the
felopian tube where the egg awaits them and nearly one thousands to three
thousands such sperms may surround the egg 
Of these only one will one fuse with the egg and this
ensures the beginning of a new life
