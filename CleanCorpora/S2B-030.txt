Reproduction is essential for continuation of species in nature
""
""
For this to occur sperm  the
female gamete are necessary 
""
A proper understanding of a male reproductive system  is
essential to understand the intricate mechanisms of nature 
""
The male reproductive system  provides for the production and
subsequent delivery  male gamete called sperm
""
""
 consists of
paternal genes  is transferred to the
female gamete 
""
To facilitate  a male reproductive
system forms a  structure
""
""
The organisation of the male reproductive system  comprises a
pair of testes  a complex array of
accessory male genetic glands 
""
In many animals  just as
in the case of man 
""
But in some species 
""
There are wide spectrum of variation in the location of the testes
""
""
The position of the testes  in different groups of mamal shows
enormous variation 
""
For example in the case of elephant  the
testes lies just behind the kidney 
""
In the case of hedgehog  the
testes is located against the ventral abdominal wall 
""
In the case of  dogs
and cats  is
underneath the anus 
""
In dolphins  the testes is
located at posterior end of 
""
In the case of moults shoos and some species of birds  the
testes is located at the base of the tail 
""
In sheep  and other ruminants also in some primates
""
""
The typical male reproductive system consists of  pair testes
 or may be present in the abdomen
""
""
The testes 
called tunica alveginia 
""
The testes is divided into many compartments  and consists of
many coil 
""
In between seminiferous tibules 
which are called as interstitial cells or the cells of leddes 
""
The semeniferous tibules  consists of large
number of 
""
Basically these cell types  and
the cells of sattory 
""
The germs cells are concerned with the production of spermatozoa
""
""
If the cross section of the 
one would find 
""
These themselves are of several types 
""
They have been classified into spermatogonia of the a  b and
intermediate type 
""
Even the a and b type of spermatogonia  are of several subtypes
 their cytological
characteristics 
""
The first generation of primary spermatocites cells  these
undergo 
""
The myosis itself is of two types  where
a number of chromosomes is reduced to half  and myosis two which is an
equational division 
unaccompanied by further reduction in the number of chromosomes 
""
A primary spermatocites give rise to secondary spermatocites 
which I have n number of chromosomes and are therefore called as haploid
cells 
""
The secondary spermatocites 
""
These spermatics  which
is called as spermeogenesis 
""
There are essentially four basic steps in this process  one is
called as gorgie  and agrosome phase and a
maturation phase 
""
The  are
highly organised 
""
From a genetic point of view  these sperms are half cells
because they contain 
""
If you take the example of human  for
dual number chromosomes is forty-six 
""
At the end of spermatogenesis therefore 
twenty-three chromosomes 
""
These sperms may contain  and
genetically 
""
This text just enumerated above  describe a typical structure of
the seminiferous epithilium 
""
However this should be understood  cells present
in the seminiferous epithilium  are in a stage of progressive development
""
""
All seminiferous epithilium cells 
associations 
""
That is  that the arrangement of cells in each seminiferous
tibules is different 
""
Sometimes  cells can be seen in
successive stages of development 
""
The cell association  the
arrangement of cells 
despermatates and the differentiation  in the
process of sperm formation 
""
In the case of man there are six cell associations  and fourteen
different cell types have been identified 
""
The 
which leads to the formation of a completely differentiated sperm  is
called as 
""
It takes about seventy-four days  for a sperm to be derived from
""
""
The sperm formed in the testes 
fertilization  they
have to transit through 
parts of the reproductive system 
""
The root of spermatozoa is quite definite 
""
From the testes they go into the retitestes  and from where they
go through 
""
The vasaeference lead these 
""
The epididamus itself consists of three main parts 
""
The top part which sits  is called as
cafort epididamus 
""
The second part which forms the main body of epididamus is called
as corpus  the epididamus is called
as corder 
""
During their transit  from cafort to corpus and finally to
corder 
""
It can rightly be said  that the epididamus is the main point
 biochemical and physiological
changes  fertilizing the egg
""
""
The  changes in their
membrane property  in the
""
""
It has also been seen  that the sperms on the cafort are
incapable of fertilizing the egg  the rate of
fertilization is about five percent 
""
Corpus sperm usually  are better about twenty percent but by the
time they reach the corder epididamus  they their fertilizing potential is
about ninety-five percent 
""
From the corder 
and from there they are mixed with  secretions of the essentially male
genetic glands  the valbo electral
glands also called as scoupers  and some other minor glands which are
found 
""
The mamalian spermatozoa is a highly differentiated cell 
""
The typical mamalian spermatozoa  consists of three main parts
""
""
The head 
""
The head is not 
""
It contains on its interior aspect  a structure which is called
as acrosome 
""
 lies the nucleus which
takes on the same shape 
""
The second part 
which contains 
""
These mitochondria helically arranged  and contains the
necessary enzymes 
for maintaining the integrity and functional abilities of the sperm 
""
The acrosome itself  contains three different types of enzymes
""
""
The tail consists of three main parts 
""
The  place where
the mid piece joins the 
""
The tail structure consists of two central filaments and nine
peripheral filaments 
""
The shape of this spermatozoa  is very variable in the animals
""
""
The number of sperms produced 
""
For instance in the case of humans  the number of sperms
produced in one ejaculate  is of the order of two hundred to four hundred
million 
""
The  depend on a
complex interplay  of not only environmental factors but also on endocrine
secretions 
""
In principle  extrinsic as well as intrinsic factors are
involved 
""
A part of the nervous system called hypothalamus  contains
special type of nerve cells 
""
These cells 
gonadotropin 
""
These hormones  by a
vascular root or thorugh nural connections  and it stimulate cells of the
pituitry  and
L H 
""
The F S H act from the seminiferous epithilium  and brings about
""
from spermatogonia  of primary and secondary type to
spermatits  and the formation of a differentiated sperm by spermatogenesis
""
""
The F S H also acts on the certoli cells which are the nongerminal
elements  which bind with
the androgene produced in the ladic cells 
""
Such  androgene bound
proteins  the testicular
germinal epithelium  sustenance of
spermatogenesis 
""
The second hormone which is produced from the pituitry is called as
L H 
""
But in the case of male it is called as  cell
stimulating hormone 
""
This hormone acts on ladic cells 
""
""
Androgene are important for large number of functions 
""
For instance androgene  which are bound to androgene binding
protein produce certoli cells 
""
Androgene are also important for accessory male genetic gland
functions 
""
Androgenes are also involved  with the development and
differentiation of secondary sex characteristics  and they are also
concerned with libido 
""
In many animals  secretions
occur cyclically 
""
For instance there are many animals in which  these phenomena
occurs only once a year 
""
In others where this  or in
still others 
""
In the case of man  the process of spermatogenesis once it has
started continues  to the age of
seventy or even eighty years 
""
However  the limiting factors in the start of reproductive
activities in the  testicular and
ladic cells  which are complex
sexual maturational changes 
""
In the case of human male they begin  occur at the age
of 
""
The testicular spermatozoa thus produced 
the epididamus where 
described above  the vasaeference
""
""
The flow of sperms from epididamus to  the vaseeference is
partly by hydrostatic pressure as well as by peristaltic motion 
""
From vaseeference  sperms are mixed with the seminal
secretions contributed by the accessory male genetic glands 
""
They come into the urethra  the terminal part of
the urethra 
""
This penis is of 
""
In the case of humans  a vascular
type 
""
Because the erection of the penis depends on  congestion of
blood 
""
There are two main mechanisms for this erection 
""
One is reflexogenic  and the other is
""
""
The 
in the case of man 
""
The second type of penis which is found in dogs and many other
carnivores 
""
For copulation  the sperms are deposited in female genital
tract 
""
The  uh with the seminal fluid constitute the semen
""
""
This has an alcaline ph 
""
The place where the sperms are deposited also shows variation 
""
In the case of humans  the sperms are deposited in the vagina
 but in the animals like horses and others the sperms are deposited in the
uterus 
""
Irrespective of the site of deposition  the millions of sperms
""
""
The  or even more are
destroyed 
""
In the case of human female  the sperms are able to reach the
felopian tube where the egg awaits them  and nearly one thousands to three
thousands such sperms may surround the egg 
""
Of these only one will  and this
ensures
