Reproduction is essential for continuation of species in nature
""
""
For this to occur sperm  the
""
""
""
""
""
""
subsequent delivery  male gamete called sperm
""
""
 consists of
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
accessory male genetic glands 
""
""
in the case of man 
""
""
""
""

enormous variation

testes lies just behind the kidney 
""
""
testes is located against the ventral abdominal wall 
""

""
""
In the case of moults shoos and some species of birds  the
""
""
""
""

The testes 
called tunica alveginia 
""
The testes is divided into many compartments  and consists of
""
""
In between seminiferous tibules 
which are called as interstitial cells or the cells of leddes 
""
The semeniferous tibules  consists of large
number of 
""
Basically these cell types  and
""
""
The germs cells are concerned with the production of spermatozoa
""
""
""
""
""
These themselves are of several types 
""
""
intermediate type 
""
""
 their cytological
characteristics

The first generation of primary spermatocites cells  these
""
""
The myosis itself is of two types  where
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
is called as spermeogenesis 
""
""
called as gorgie  and agrosome phase and a
maturation phase

highly organised

tibules is different 
""
Sometimes  cells can be seen in
""
""
""
arrangement of cells 
despermatates and the differentiation  in the
""
""
""
different cell types have been identified 
""
The

The vasaeference lead these

""
It can rightly be said  that the epididamus is the main point
""
""
""
""
The  changes in their

time they reach the corder epididamus  they their fertilizing potential is

From the corder

glands also called as scoupers  and some other minor glands which are

These mitochondria helically arranged  and contains the

The shape of this spermatozoa  is very variable in the animals
""

complex interplay  of not only environmental factors but also on endocrine

A part of the nervous system called hypothalamus  contains

""
""
gonadotropin

elements  which bind with

Such  androgene bound

germinal epithelium  sustenance of

The second hormone which is produced from the pituitry is called as

""
""
stimulating hormone

protein produce certoli cells 
""
Androgene are also important for accessory male genetic gland
functions 
""
Androgenes are also involved  with the development and

concerned with libido

started continues  to the age of

ladic cells  which are complex
sexual maturational changes

the epididamus where 
described above  the vasaeference

The flow of sperms from epididamus to  the vaseeference is

In the case of humans  a vascular
