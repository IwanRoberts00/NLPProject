""

It is heard that uh  at Khadaklat
has been commissioned 
""
And  or the S T D facility has been
""
""
Extended to all
""
""
Extended
""
""
Uhm
""
""
That uh exchange 
""
""
In fact
""
""
In how many years 
""
""
Uh actually sir now government is  trying
very fast 
""
Now there are no manually 
""
Only a few exchanges say I can  uh say Athani and in Chikodi
they are 
""
Rest all exchanges are converted into auto 
""
Now this  I
mean 
""
But now  so that
people of Khadaklat  telephone exchange
""
""
Telephone exchange you mean
""
""
And uh Nipani telephone operators  for getting their calls
""
""
Number of times 
operators do not answer  and their calls are heavely delayed and all that
""
""
And since now it is  subscriber's
""
""
Uh they are much pleased  themselves dial
""
""
""
""
Question is about uh 
""
Previously it was the manual 
""
""
Which one
""
Khadaklat
""
""
Khadaklat Nipani 
were uh automatic exchanges
""
""
Yes sir
""
""
But the big exchanges just like Nipani Chikkodi  Sankeshwar
""
manually 
""
""
Operated 
""
""
""
""
But at this stage means I want to say that automization will not
 society
""
""
But at the same time what about the  staff
and excess staff and  that are uh needed
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Especially  S T
D facility 
""
And there are some who do not want the S T D facility 
""
So even though they are uh automization  still the staff is
needed 
""
""
""
""
""
Yes
""
""
Uhn  uh
getting 
""
Sometimes 
""
""
""
""
""
""
No sir 
for all these years  there are
about three four hundred numbers in a small exchange 
""
Manual operation is just possible 
""
But when the numbers increased  say to to one thousand two
thousand  so A to B B to C these
""
""
No no I accept I accept your difficulties 
or what I mean to say is 
""
""
""
""
""
Ahn ha ha
""
""
Now automization is nice thing I accept 
but there are certain 
 for example day before
yesterday I had been 
""
""
And there one person came and he complained  that his bill has
been uh 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Over excess bill 
""
""
Not excess
""
""
Uhm
""
""
It was too much 
""
""
Too much
""
""
It was about uh fifty thousand 
""
And he complained that even though suppose I started  the
subscriber trunk dialing continuously  the bill will not
 uh great extent
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
So it is a mechanic fault I mean
""
""
""
""
""
So 
""
""
""
of having a mechanical fault  with a telephone meter as such
""
""
Uhm exactly
""
""
 you see there are clear instructions in
our  that uh when the
subscriber establishes his call  and speaks for a minute or two minutes
""
""
So that he  comes to know that his telephone is disconnected
from S T D
""
""
S T D facility
""
 sir even though the same thing has been
 still your bills
are  that we feel that it is better to disconnect the
telephone connection
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Uh ha no doubt 
""
This is a very rare case sir
""
In that case subsriber  every
right  higher authority
department  reembursement of
all that
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
But on what ground do you 
""
""
The grounds  subscribers
meter  and if he will
""
""
At your end 
""
""
At our end
""
""
But at the same time  what I mean to say
 you
must call that particular gentleman  who has complained
""
""
""
""
""
Yes yes yes
""
""
And in  you must check it
and you must convince him  that uh the meter it was faulty
or meter is correct like that
""
Do you  have such facility
""
And do you such have these actions or
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
No we don't sir 
""
In this case  but the
department tests the  who has got a complaint
as such 
""
And we will in this case supposing now there are automization 
""
""
Supposing this had started a year before 
""
In that case  uh every two
months 
""
We will see their history of the  uh subscriber
""
""
No he says  we have
brought the bills  for the last two years
""
""
Ha two years
""
""
And it was not more  it was not more than for three hundred
""
""
And it this time it was more than fifty thousand
""
""
Ha  that is the case
subscriber I told you  to complain
""
""
No no question of right over here
""
""
And now the now the redressal office complaint is like this
""
""
We will test then  his number meter will be tested
""
""
""
See question is  whether do you test that meter in
front of the consumer or the customer
""
That is what happens because  you
may say that our uh our read  no you may say that our reading is correct
""
""
""
""
""
Uhn sir no doubt uhn
""
""
Because  take the responsibility of
your fault 
""
""
See  got to take the responsibility of
the fault
""
""
""
""
""
Do you take it
""
""
See when the metre
""
""
Does the department take it
""
I don't think that
""
""
See the department has to take sir 
""
 will take
""
""
Just see 
""
""
 one rule
 in the department sir
""
""
Uhn
""
""
There is one rule 
""
Whatever bill is  received by the subscriber he has
to pay first the bill
""
""
Exactly what I mean to I want to come to that uh
""
""
Since  this
 say of fifty thousand as
you say  which he was getting for three hundred four
hundred  rupees
""
""
When he receives the bill of five fifty thousand  definitely
""
""
He has got to uh he has definitely complained 
""
His complained will be  to
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Uhn without uh asking for the deposition  uh of that uh
amount
""
""
Uhm no in this case 
 fine
""
""
""
""
""
But uh I don't think the 
subscriber  will pay fifty thousand
""
""
""
""
 position to pay
""
""
He will be not in a position to pay 
""
Perhaps he has not paid the bill  and his
complaint will be  in due course
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Now we were talking about auto automization isn't it
""
""
Uhm
""
""
""
""
No doubt  has resulted in reduction of
staff 
""
There is a difficulty with us 
""
We were about  say thirty thirty-five operators in at Nipani
""
""
Since the automization before a year  the staff is reduced by
ten people 
""
So ten people are reduced 
""
Now this 
sma  uh auto key centre
""
""
""
""
""
Where each switch are connected 
""
They are also automized  S T D
""
""
Uhm 
""
""
And  there will be no
booking of 
which are 
""
And they will have to deal I mean oh 
 manual operators
""
""
""
""
""
And  manual operater like
""
""
Ha that difficulty is there for us 
""
No doubt people are people uh
""
""
No  just see what happens no
""
""
Yeah
""
""
They say
""
""
People 
""
Supposing if we get a telephone connection here  I mean the
connection 
or Delhi  you definitely you want all
these facilities isn't it
""
""
""
""
""
But uh you don't worry whether there is  be
 I mean reduction of staff or something of like that
""
You need not bother about it 
""
The department has to bother about it 
""
The department is now thinking  the operators to absorb in some
other departments 
 be taken as
clerks 
that is going on 
""
""
No no I am not to concern about 
 difficulties of the consumer
or the customer
""
""
""
""
""
 tell you uhm
""
""
""
""
""
Now since the  people are really
very happy 
""
They need not book the call to Nipani Exchange
""
""
And wait for the call  and uh depend upon the
operators 
""
""
 the difficulty is that
 they dial each
other  be getting engage to each other
""
 for a
certain while 
""
They will dial try twice thrice four times
""
Then they will get each other 
""
They will  they feel very happy
""
""
They are really very happy no doubt 
""
Now  that subscribers are
""
""
What I mean to say
""
""
Ha
""
""
So those who have got  uhm I
have two categories in my mind
""
""
Yeah yeah
""
""
One 
uhm  with S T D facility
""
""
""
""
""
Uhm
""
""
Those  without
subscribers  S T D
""
""
""
""
""
Without 
 uh facility
""
""
""
""
""
Ha
""
""
You have got a telephone at home
""
""
Uhm
""
""
When you are out somebody your children or wife or somebody
 dial the number
""
They go on speaking
""
Ladies if this start speaking no
""
""
""
""
""
Yeah they don't know  using the S
T D
""
""
I see I see  because it is to be used by second to second
""
""
S T D is a facility 
who can  thirty
seconds even forty seconds  and stop it
""
So that  previously they were taking the paying say twenty-five
""
""
If they finish up you say when 
it is just possible even to speak during thirty seconds forty seconds 
""
They get it 
""
""
 ha ha
 uh procedure
""
""
""
""
""
Question is  those who do not want that S T D facility
""
""
Uh they have to come and book the call
""
""
 and here again the manual
labour 
picture  in the picture uhm
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
And uh same difficulty will be faced by that subscriber
