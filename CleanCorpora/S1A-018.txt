It is heard that uh Telephone Exchange at Khadaklat
has been commissioned 
And the trunk dial facility or the S T D facility has been
Extended to all
Extended
Uhm
That uh exchange 
In fact
In how many years this programme will continue 
Uh actually sir now government is trying to trying
very fast to automize all these exchanges 
Now there are no manually operated exchanges left 
Only a few exchanges say I can uh say Athani and in Chikodi
they are having manual exchange 
Rest all exchanges are converted into auto 
Now this Khadaklat exchange is recently connected I
mean it is uh it was made auto before a few years 
But now this is connected with S T D facility so that
people of Khadaklat need not depend upon Nipani telephone exchange
Telephone exchange you mean
And uh Nipani telephone operators for getting their calls
Number of times uh what they find as Nipani do not answer 
operators do not answer and their calls are heavely delayed and all that
And since now it is linked with S T Ds subscriber's
 dialing facility 
Uh they are much pleased that uh they will themselves dial
 all the numbers of Nipani as well as uh numbers of any state 
 of of or of any city they like 
Question is about uh the system 
Previously it was the manual exchange so to say 
Which one
Khadaklat
Khadaklat Nipani are these uh the small exchanges 
were uh automatic exchanges
Yes sir
But the big exchanges just like Nipani Chikkodi Sankeshwar
 sometimes say even uh Kolhapur was also once upon a time 
manually di 
Operated exchange 
 Operated exchange 
But at this stage means I want to say that automization will not
 uhn uh uhm what I mean to say is harm the society
But at the same time what about the staff staff
and excess staff and other uh facilities that are uh needed
 Uhm 
 Staff 
Especially there are some persons who require S T
D facility uhm 
And there are some who do not want the S T D facility 
So even though they are uh automization still the staff is
needed 
 Uhm 
Yes
Uhn and here again there is possibility of uh
getting late connections 
Sometimes uh no answer no answer like that 
 one word in what in this connection what your are saying 
 No answer 
No sir see when these exchanges were manually operated 
for all these years there the supposing the exch there are
about three four hundred numbers in a small exchange 
Manual operation is just possible by one or two operators 
But when the numbers increased say to to one thousand two
thousand so A to B B to C these
No no I accept I accept your difficulties no 
or what I mean to say is 
 No 
Ahn ha ha
Now automization is nice thing I accept uhm 
but there are certain loop holes connect uhm complaints 
 uhm regarding the telephone bills for example day before
yesterday I had been in Kolhapur Telephone Bhavan 
 ah 
And there one person came and he complained that his bill has
been uh 
 Uhm 
 Loop holes 
 Uhm 
 Ah 
Over excess bill 
Not excess
Uhm
It was too much 
Too much
It was about uh fifty thousand rupees 
And he complained that even though suppose I started the
subscriber trunk dialing continuously uhm the bill will not
 uh uh uh will not be of uh such uh great extent
 Uhm 
 Come so much 
So it is a mechanic fault I mean
 Haan 
So this connection 
 Ha yes sir there is every possibility of 
of having a mechanical fault with a telephone meter as such
Uhm exactly
 Haan you see there are clear instructions in
our directory uh when the automachine is made that uh when the
subscriber establishes his call and speaks for a minute or two minutes
 he has to disconnect and see that he does get a dial tone back 
So that he comes to know that his telephone is disconnected
from S T D
S T D facility
 Accepted sir even though the same thing has been
 followed properly uhn still your bills
are so high that we feel that it is better to disconnect the
telephone connection
 Yes 
 Done done by 
 Uhn 
Uh ha no doubt uhn 
This is a very rare case sir
In that case subsriber got has got every
right to approach the higher authority higher authority
department even the court and he does get uh the reembursement of
all that
 Uhn 
 Higher authority 
But on what ground do you uh settle this case 
The grounds you see we will test that subscribers
meter and if he will
At your end 
At our end
But at the same time uhn what I mean to say
 you may test it but in this case or say in a particular case you
must call that particular gentleman who has complained
 Uhn 
Yes yes yes
And in in his presence you must check it
and you must convince him uhm that uh the meter it was faulty
or meter is correct like that
Do you have such facility
And do you such have these actions or
 His presence only 
 Uhm 
No we don't sir 
In this case we don't call the subscriber but the
department tests the meter of the subscriber who has got a complaint
as such 
And we will in this case supposing now there are automization 
 is is uh recently started 
Supposing this had started a year before 
In that case we send bills every two min uh every two
months 
We will see their history of the uh subscriber
No he says na he says that we have
brought the bills for the last two years
Ha two years
And it was not more it was not more than for three hundred
 rupees a month say uh for two for a period 
And it this time it was more than fifty thousand
Ha if if if that is the case
subscriber I told you subscriber has got every right to to complain
No no question of right over here
And now the now the redressal office complaint is like this
We will test then meter his number meter will be tested
 and uh 
See question is sir whether do you test that meter in
front of the consumer or the customer
That is what happens because we he must be you
may say that our uh our read no you may say that our reading is correct
 We 
Uhn sir no doubt uhn
Because you do not want to take the responsibility of
your fault 
See we have got to take the responsibility of
the fault
 And that is 
Do you take it
See when the metre
Does the department take it
I don't think that
See the department has to take sir 
 It it will take
Just see has to take it different and takes 
 See there is there is one rule
 in the department sir
Uhn
There is one rule 
Whatever bill is recei received by the subscriber he has
to pay first the bill
Exactly what I mean to I want to come to that uh
Since uh since this this
 is an absurd bill uhm say of fifty thousand as
you say uhm which he was getting for three hundred four
hundred rupees or say a maximum thousand rupees
 uhm 
When he receives the bill of five fifty thousand definitely
 there is wrong something wrong with the meter 
He has got to uh he has definitely complained 
His complained will be one word to
 Uh 
 Uhm 
 Uhm 
 Uhm 
 Wrong 
Uhn without uh asking for the deposition uh of that uh
amount
Uhm no in this case here as per the rules he has to 
 pay fine
 Pay 
But uh I don't think the subscriber 
subscriber will pay fifty thousand
 He has no one or two words 
 He will not be in a position to pay
He will be not in a position to pay 
Perhaps he has not paid the bill uhm and his
complaint will be dealt with uhm in in due course
 Uhm 
 Uhm 
Now we were talking about auto automization isn't it
Uhm
 Cough 
No doubt this automization has resulted in reduction of
staff 
There is a difficulty with us 
We were about say thirty thirty-five operators in at Nipani
Since the automization before a year the staff is reduced by
ten people 
So ten people are reduced we are now twenty people working 
Now this are is called uh 
sma small auto key uh auto key centre
 Auto key 
Where each switch are connected 
They are also automized and linked with S S T D
Uhm 
And now the problem with us is there will be no
booking of of calls at all by Akol Benkihal and uh Khadaklat 
which are slowing slowly being automized 
And they will have to deal I mean oh depend on the Nipani 
 exchange manual operators
 Exchange 
And it's manual operater like
Ha that difficulty is there for us 
No doubt people are people uh
No just see what happens no
Yeah
They say
People see people want their facility always 
Supposing if we get a telephone connection here I mean the
connection and if we can dial a numeric number in America England 
or Delhi Japan some any any you definitely you want all
these facilities isn't it
 Some any any 
But uh you don't worry whether there is there'll be
 autom I mean reduction of staff or something of like that
You need not bother about it 
The department has to bother about it 
The department is now thinking the operators to absorb in some
other departments and uh they'll be posted to some 
 to some booths or uhm they'll be taken as
clerks in the in the various departments 
that is going on 
No no I am not to concern about uh your difficult 
 of course not I am talking of the difficulties of the consumer
or the customer
 Of course not 
 No no I tell you uhm
 For example 
Now since the automization is made people are really
very happy 
They need not book the call to Nipani Exchange
And wait for the call and uh depend upon the
operators 
 Wait now supposing now the difficulty is that
 everybody supposing subscriber's at Khadaklat they dial each
other they'll be getting engage to each other
 They will they will keep mum for a
certain while so the only facility is they will dial once again 
They will dial try twice thrice four times
Then they will get each other 
They will you see get the connection they feel very happy
They are really very happy no doubt 
Now uh definitely as I say that subscribers are
What I mean to say
Ha
So those who have got there are two ch uhm I
have two categories in my mind
Yeah yeah
One those who are subscribers of that is one 
uhm with S T D facility
 Uhm 
Uhm
Those who have who have got the connections without
subscribers uh uh S T D S T D
 S T D 
Without S T D's there're some pople are 
 uh see S T D is a subscriber dialing uh facility
 Uh 
Ha
You have got a telephone at home
Uhm
When you are out somebody your children or wife or somebody
 yeah yeah they'll dial the number
They go on speaking
Ladies if this start speaking no
 Yeah yeah 
Yeah they don't know uhm the technique of using the S
T D
I see I see because it is to be used by second to second
 cough 
S T D is a facility generally useful for the subscribers 
who can uh minimise their conversation for a minute or so say thirty
seconds even forty seconds or a minute also and stop it
So that previously they were taking the paying say twenty-five
 rupees for a Bombay call 
If they finish up you say when twenty-five thirty seconds 
it is just possible even to speak during thirty seconds forty seconds 
They get it within two thousand 
 No I I know this I know this ha ha
 uh procedure
 Ha ha 
Question is those who do not want that S T D facility
Uh they have to come and book the call
 Isn't that isn't that and here again the manual
labour uhn comes into uhm focus 
picture in the picture uhm
 Ha uh uh 
 Uhn 
 Focus 
And uh same difficulty will be faced by that subscriber
