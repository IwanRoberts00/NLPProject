Hi Tina
Hi Jenny
How was your journey Tina from Harihar
Oh God I can't tell you it was terrible you know
What happened 
The students from the Ranebennur College you know 
they're having problem for conveyance 
So they stopped all these buses
All
Only government buses uhn K S R T C buses 
And then my God you can't they were throwing stones 
And I was sitting in the bus near the window you can't believe it I
was so terrified by this the one or two words down and then
uh some fellow he came and he said don't worry if anything
happens like that I'll take you home 
And then the whole bus went back to this kum Kumarapatnam
police station 
And then they stopped over there and then I wanted to ring up daddy
from there 
But then I thought if I ring him up then again he'll take
me back home and then I have to come back tomorrow another day I'll 
be wasting 
So what I did I just sat there for one hour and three hours
there in that village you know in middle of nowhere and there's 
nothing to eat also that was the worst part and I thought mostly they'll
 reach home in the night 
But nothing like a few words 
 What time you reached 
Uhm I reached home at eleven thirty or something
Someone came to pick you up at the but stop
No I came home in the rickshaw 
And in Hubli my God so many guys got into the bus and
you should have seen that they were almost falling on you all over the place
And then there was one fellow who was uh and there was this
one fellow who was sitting next to me and then you know he was pushing
the bag so that he could get closer to me laughter and then I pushed
the bag again and I sat like then he got the message I think so
And what are you doing two two days when I had gone home 
No nothing

slopped into the bed uhm left got up again at nine 
O'clock had my dinner went and slept laughter
