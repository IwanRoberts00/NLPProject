And then my God you can't

And I was sitting in the bus near the window you can't believe it I
was so terrified by this  down and then
uh  don't worry if anything
happens like that 
""
And then the whole bus went back to this  Kumarapatnam
police station 
""
And then they stopped over there and then I wanted to ring up daddy
from there

But then I thought if I ring him up then again  take
me back home and then I have to come back tomorrow another day 
be wasting

So what I did  I just sat there for one hour and three hours
there in that 
nothing to eat also that was the worst part and I thought mostly  they'll

""
""
And then there was one fellow who was  uh and there was this
one fellow who was sitting next to me  and then you know he was pushing
the bag so that he could get closer to me  and then I pushed
the bag again  he got the message I think so
