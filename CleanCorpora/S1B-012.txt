""
grass 
""
""
the grasshopper has an empty larder 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

never quite see those advantage to the lesson
""
My sympathies were with the grasshopper  I
never saw an ant 
""
""
fashion  I sought to express my disapproval of prudence and common sense
""
""
I could not help thinking of this fable when the other day I saw
""
""
""
""
""
He was staring into space 
""
He looked as though the burden of the whole world fell on his
shoulders 
""
I was sorry for him
