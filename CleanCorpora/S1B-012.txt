The ant and the grasshopper Somerset Maugham is the
writer of this fable 
The fable the ant and the grasshopper 
is well known 
It teaches the moral that one must work hard and save for the future
The famous British writer Somerset Maugham deals with a very
 conscientious and prudent elder brother and a happy go lucky younger
brother in this prose 
Why does he refer to the fable ?
What is his attitude to having moralising ?
You will find the answer in this prose 
When I was a very small boy I was made to learn by heart 
certain of the fable of La Fontaine 
And the moral of this was carefully explained to me 
Among those I learnt was the ant and the grasshopper which
is devised to bring home to the young the usefulnesses that
 an im imperfect world 
industry is rewarded and greedyness punished 
It is the meaning of fable 
My apology for telling something when everyone in politely
but inexactly supposed to know the ant spends a laborious summer
 gathering its winter store while the grasshopper sings on a bale of
grass singing to the sun 
Winter comes and the ant is comfortably provided for but
the grasshopper has an empty larder 
He goes to the ant and begs for a little food 
Then the ant gives him a classic answer 
What were you doing in the summer time ?
Saving your presence I sang all day all night 
You sang why then go and dance 
I don't ascribe it to perversity on my part but rather to
the habit of childhood which is deficient in moral sense that I could
never quite see those advantage to the lesson
My sympathies were with the grasshopper and for some time I
never saw an ant without putting my foot on it 
In this summary and as I have discovered since entirely human
fashion I sought to express my disapproval of prudence and common sense
I could not help thinking of this fable when the other day I saw
 George Ramsay lunching by himself in a restaurant 
I never saw anyone wore an expression of such deep gloom
He was staring into space 
He looked as though the burden of the whole world fell on his
shoulders shoulders 
I was sorry for him 
I suspected at once that his unfortunate brother has been
causing trouble again 
I went up to him and held out my hand 
Take down the difficult words 
You read out the words

The ant and the grasshopper it is a fable 
Fable means a short story which deals with the animal and it
gives us a moral 
So fable the ant and the grasshopper it is based on and is
famous and it also teaches the moral that one must work hard 
and one will should save for the future
So this moral we will get from this lesson the ant and the
grasshopper 
It is written by the famous British writer Somerset Maugham 
The famous British writer Somerset Maugham he deals with a very
 conscientious and prudent elder brother and a happy go lucky
younger brother in this story 
So we have two brothers which is one is very careful
prudent and conscientious very honest and another is very
carefree happy go lucky
They are the two brothers in this story 
Why does he refer to the fable ?
What is his attitude to having moralising ?
You will find the answers in it
So first the writer has given the fable the story 
about the ant and the grasshopper 
When I was a very small boy I was made to learn by heart 
certain of the fables of La Fontaine is a French poet and the
scholar 
And the moral of this was carefully explained to me 
Among those I learnt was ant and the grasshopper which is
devised to bring home to the young the usefulness that in an 
imperfect world industry is rewarding 
 It's always hardwork industry means hardwork it is
rewarding
If you do the hardwork you will get the prize which is a reward 
And greedyness is punished 
 Greedyness irresponsible behaviour in this parable 
If you do you will be punished in this world 
So this is the moral of this lesson 
It is a reasonable fable the ant spends the laborious
summer gathering its winter store 
So throughout the summer season the ant worked very hard
and gathered its food for the winter season 
While the grasshopper it sit sits on
a bale of grass and is singing to the sun 
So instead of doing the work grasshopper in vain waste
the whole time in singing instead of doing the work 
While the grasshopper sits on a bale of grass singing to the sun
 winter comes and the ant is comfortably provided for but the
grasshopper has an empty larder 
Larder the room where the food is kept 
So the ant it has full of larder whereas the
 grasshopper's is empty 
He goes to the ant and begs for a little food 
See what the ant says the ant says
Then the ant gives him a classic answer
There is a traditional answer 
What were you doing in the summer time ?
She is not ready to give food for to 
the grasshopper 
Then the grasshopper answers saving your presence I
sang all day all night 
So throughout the day and night the grasshopper 
waste wastes his time in singing 
You sang why then go and dance 
So like this the ant gave the answer 
She is not ready to give the food to the grasshopper 
I don't ascribe this 
So here the writer refers to the story I don't ascribe this to
perversity on my part but rather to the habit of childhood which is
deficient in moral sense 
So this story it is lack of moral sense in his childhood
 that I couldn't never first reconcile myself to the lesson 
So which is moral of the lesson the author is not agreeing
My sympathies were with the grasshopper and for sometime I
never saw an ant without putting my foot on it 
So here the writer has a big sympathy for the grasshopper 
not for the ant 
So this reference we'll get in the story of this
reference 
Why the author showed the sympathy to the grasshopper ?
My sympathies were with the grasshopper and for sometime I
never saw an ant without putting my foot on it 
In this a few words I sought to express my
disapproval of prudence and common sense 
So he is not agreeing about the prudence that he could not
It was not being careful that is a prudence 
I could not help thinking for this fable when the other day I
saw George Ramsay lunching by himself in a restaurant 
So in this story there are two brothers one is George Ramsay
and another is Tom Ramsay 
So next day the writer saw George Ramsay in restaurant 
I never saw anyone wear an expression of such deep gloom 
So he was in very sad mood 
He was staring into space or looking to the sky 
He looked as if the the burden of the whole world fell on his
 shoulders 
I was sorry for him I suspected at once that his
unfortunate brother has been causing trouble again 
So he was worried about his younger brother Tom Ramsay 
I went upto him and held out my hand
