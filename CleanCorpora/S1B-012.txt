The famous British writer Somerset Maugham  with a very
 and a happy go lucky younger
brother 
""

What is his attitude  ?
""
You will find the answer 
""
When I was a very small boy 
certain of the fable of 
""
And the moral of this was carefully 
""
Among those  which
is devised  that
""
industry is rewarded 
""
It is 
""
My apology  when everyone in politely
but inexactly  spends a laborious summer
 the grasshopper sings on a bale of
grass 
""
Winter comes and the ant is comfortably  but
the grasshopper has an empty larder 
""
He goes to the ant 
""
Then the ant gives him 
""
What were you doing in the summer time  ?
""
Saving your presence 
""
You sang 
""
I don't ascribe it  but rather to
the habit of childhood  that I could
never quite see those advantage to the lesson
""
My sympathies were with the grasshopper  I
never saw an ant 
""
In this summary  and as I have discovered since entirely human
fashion  I sought to express my disapproval of prudence and common sense
""
""
I could not help thinking of this fable when the other day I saw
""
""
I never saw anyone  deep gloom
""
""
He was staring into space 
""
He looked as though the burden of the whole world fell on his
shoulders 
""
I was sorry for him 
""
I suspected at once  has been
causing trouble again 
""
I went up to him 
""
Take down the difficult words 
""
You read out the words 
""
""
""
""
""
 happy go
lucky - carefree 
- French man  -
hardwork  conscientious
""
""
""
Prudent - careful  larder - a
room where food is kept  lack of
industry 
conscientious - honest 
""
""
The ant and the grasshopper 
""
Fable means a short story which deals with the animal  and it
gives us a moral 
""
So fable  the ant and the grasshopper it is based on and is
famous 
and  future
""
""
So this moral we will get from this lesson the ant and the
grasshopper 
""
It is written by the famous British writer Somerset Maugham 
""
The famous British writer Somerset Maugham  he deals with a very
 and a happy go lucky
younger brother in this story 
""
So we have two brothers  one is very careful
prudent  very
carefree  happy go lucky
""
They are the two brothers in this story 
""
Why does he refer to the fable  ?
""
What is his attitude  ?
""
You will find the answers in it
""
So 
about the ant and the grasshopper 
""
When I was a very small boy I was made to learn 
certain of the fables of  a French poet and the
scholar 
""
And the moral of this 
""
Among those I learnt was ant and the grasshopper  which is
devised 
imperfect world industry is rewarding 
""
 it is
rewarding
""
If you do the hardwork you will get the prize which is a reward 
""
And 
""
""
""
If you do you will be punished in this world 
""
So this is the moral of this lesson 
""
It is a reasonable fable  spends the laborious
summer 
""
So throughout the summer season  very hard
and gathered 
""
While the grasshopper  on
a bale of grass and 
""
So instead of doing the work  waste
the whole time in singing 
""
While the grasshopper sits on a bale of grass singing to the sun
 but the
grasshopper has an empty larder 
""
Larder 
""
So the ant  whereas the
""
""
He goes to the ant and begs for a little food 
""
See what the ant says  the ant says
""
Then the ant gives him  a classic answer
""
There is a traditional answer 
""
What were you doing in the summer time  ?
""
She is not ready 
the grasshopper 
""
Then the grasshopper answers  I
sang all day all night 
""
So throughout the day and night 
waste 
""
You sang 
""
So like this the ant gave the answer 
""
She is not ready to give the food 
""
I don't ascribe this 
""
So here the writer refers to the story  I don't ascribe this to
perversity on my part  which is
deficient in moral sense 
""
So this story  in his childhood
""
""
So which is moral of the lesson  is not agreeing
""
""
My sympathies were with the grasshopper  I
never saw an ant without putting my foot on it 
""
So here the 
not for the ant 
""
So this reference  of this
reference 
""
Why the author showed the sympathy to the grasshopper  ?
""
My sympathies were with the grasshopper and for sometime  I
never saw an ant without putting my foot on it 
""
In this  I sought to express my
disapproval of prudence and common sense 
""
So he is not agreeing  prudence that he could not
""
""
It was not being careful 
""
I could not help thinking for this fable when the other day  I
saw George Ramsay 
""
So in this story there are two brothers  one is George Ramsay
and another is 
""
So next day the writer 
""
I never saw anyone wear an expression of such deep 
""
So he was in very 
""
He was staring into space 
""
He looked as if the  the burden of the whole world fell on his
""
""
I was sorry for him  that his
unfortunate brother has been causing trouble again
