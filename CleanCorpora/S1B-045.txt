<I>
Good morning 
Professor Savitri Laxmanan is a Congress-I member of parliament
representing Mukundapuram of Kerala in the Lok Sabha 
This is her first term as a member of parliament 
Her entry to into politics have
 has been fairly recent 
Infact she joined politics less than three years ago 
Professor Laxmanan is basically a teacher by profession and
continues to be so 
She is professor and head of department of Malyalam 
 at the St Joseph's college at Eranjilakuda in Mukundapuram 
She is also an accomplished playwright and a dramatist 
She has written two books
One of which is a collection of One Act Plays 
Professor Laxmanan has also been associated with All
India Radio for almost sixteen years now 
Professor Laxmanan can you describe Mukundapuram to us your
constituency 
Why not Mr Hemant 
Mukundapuram is a place so nice 
It may attract so many people 
Uh I think it's outside appearance is uh extra
beautiful in all senses 
There is uhm one place called one word 
Which can be converted into a best tourist centre 
 One word includes my constituency 
And and there is another place called Malaytoor and
 Malaytoor attracts so many pilgrims 
And one Irykod near the famous Kudvillur devi
 temple 
Uh and it is supposed that St Thomas came first to this place
 in India 
He landed at Irykod says so the history 
And Irykod is very near to that devi 
temple Kudvillur
And uh Kudvillur devi is supposed to came from
that Kannagi 
 You've heard the story of Kannagi ?
Not really ?
Uh Kannagi also is related to south India 
That may be the reason you've not heard or to 
She is a powerful goddess
Uhm uhm 
And uh about my own place in Srinelkuda there is a famous
temple Kudmadikum Shree Kudmadikum temple 
In which Lord Bharda is the deity and Lord Bharda uh
 and no other places in India there is Lord Bharda 
Only at Yetinedkuda people says so 
But beyond all this Mukundapuram is very poor and in
 it's living uh people are very poor there 
Uh or probably too old or to meet the both ends meet 
Uh so many are labourers and they find it very difficult
to earn their livelihood 
But they are trying somehow or other and they expect me to
help them 
And uh though even though it is very beautiful with lakes
rivers paddy fields trees etcetra etcetra we've to uh
supply some food to them 
 That's right
You were saying before uh we to me
here that there is no such place as Mukundapuram on the map
Is it true ?
Uh there's is a small village it is it is
known as Mukundapuram but uh no notable place in this mean
Mukundapuram
Uhm uhm
But constituency is named liked that Mukundapuram 
Uh it is connected uh with an old story that Lord Mukunda 
this Vishnu had great place in some good old days
 uhm uhm and the place is named after Lord Mukunda 
Mukundapuram puram means town
Town of Mukunda
 Uhm uhm 
Uhm uhm 
In your five year term here uhm what you really
plan to do for your constituency ?
 Uhm 
I want to do a lot for my people 
But I don't know whether all my hopes will be fulfilled or
not 
And I know very well that uh all the needs of the people
can not be fulfilled by my by me alone 
But I want to do something for the ordinary people 
By helping in some way or other 
 I'll do my best to
 One or two words 
Uhm uhm 
The teaching community and also that of students they must also
be looking forward to you to help from you of many kinds 
Then I'll help and allow them 
What can you do for them as as an M P ?
 And 
To my all students I think uh I lost my students 
This is the only grief I have now 
I lost the good field of teaching
Uhm uhm 
It was so nice in my college with my students and my
colleague 
But I do I love one word 
Do you uh want to go back to teaching full time ?
 That's a que a very difficult question to
answer
I don't know exactly 
Uh people in my party ask me you you are not contesting this
election 
 That's why I came into politics
And uh truly speaking I love all the topics in between
sky and earth 
And I love politics too 
And I take it as a challenge 
And for the first time I was facing an election 
Fortunately or unfortunately I won 
And now uh I take my constituency as my institution to
which I'm so fond of 
I think uhm now Mukundapuram constituency is my St Joseph
College 
One thing uh now that you've become member of
parliament uhm has the attitude of your students or that
of your collegues changed towards you ?
 Uhm 
Uhm I think no 
Do they notice a change in you ?
I don't know 
Uh I want to be with them uh in the what I want to say 
 I'm the old Savitri Laxmanan among them
 I see 
Certainly 
And I'm sure that they'll consider me as
their old Savitri Laxmanan
Uhm uhm 
 You've written two books
One of which is the collection of short one act plays 
uhm 
Tell us a little more about these books that you've 
written 
 Uhm 
Uh act one of it uh one of them is a collection of short
stories uh sorry exclusively one act plays uhm uhm 
And other is full fledged drama
 Uhm uhm 
Uhm uhm 
Uh and uh drama is published by National Book
Store 
Uhm uhm 
 It's a reputed firm in Kerala
Uhm uhm 
It is published some fifteen or sixteen years back 
And I got some prizes for the script uhm uhm 
from Kerala Sangeet Natak Academy 
 uhm um and it is broadcasted through All India Radio
 to one word is one from Trivandrum
 Uhm uhm 
 Uhm uhm 
Uhm uhm
And I took the female part uhm in my own
drama 
 Uhm 
I think it's a rare oppurtunity for a woman
artist 
 I'm sure it must be 
How long has been your association with All India Radio
 ?
Uh I too may for the past fifteen or sixteen years
I was participating in radio plays
Uhm uhm 
 I'm approved as a staff artist there in 
All India Radio Trichur 
They used to take
I used to participate in some of the plays
Uhm uhm 
 You've also done discussions for them
 Haan some discussions some talks 
 uhm uhm some speeches etcetera 
 Uhm uhm 
 You're a teacher by profession 
One thing I would like to definitely ask you is about your 
opinion on the education policy
Do you think there should be a uniform education policy for the
whole nation ?
What I know of course Mr Hemant the education must be
uniform 
But it it's not practical I think 
Why do you think so ?
There are so many who seek higher education 
But I think ours is a poor country 
For that uh we're unable to fulfill the hopes of the
 rising students 
So private schools must be encouraged in my opinion
Uhm uhm 
I say so because in my state there are some who says
that all must be uhm government oriented education 
Private school must be abolished from the field 
But I don't think so
Because in our state private school and private colleges are
doing a lot for the students
 They're not making second rate citizens sort
But that uh when that is some round about now a days our
school rise people say these schools are creating second rate
citizens 
I feel that is what I think
Do you also think the medium of instruction ah
 should be uniform or that uh the three tier system that now exist
 is all right ?
 Ah 
Uhm we've to give due importance to the both
language English one or two word 
In my case too I bid farewell to this uh international
language from one word back because I'm a professor of
my original language Malyalam 
And I used to talk and write always in Malyalam and
now I almost forgot English
But when I became an M P English is the only force through
which I can communicate my ideas uhm 
So also with the other M P's 
 Uhm 
Some of them knew very well Hindi because Hindi is their
mother tongue 
But they are unaware of the fact that happens in in the south
The sole reason is that they are not uh uh trying to 
learn or write this English
So English could be the link language in my opinion
And then Hindi our national language 
That must be also given due importance 
And I'm trying to learn Hindi 
Now uh you are also based in Delhi uhm 
and when the ses when the parliament is in session you've 
to be hear ah 
How how difficult or how easy is it for you to communicate here
 ?
When you are here
 Uhm 
 Ah 
I always depend upon my little English 
Are you also comfortable 
 And I uh I've said I'm 
trying to learn Hindi 
Have you started 
 I've a servant who only spoke 
Hindi
Uhm uhm 
And uh I too learn uh thoda thoda 
Hindi from her
 That's very nice uhm 
 I'm sure she will be 
 Uhm 
 I know uh from this kuch nahi malum to
kya to kya that's all
 I'm sure one day 
And I uh bought my uhm little daughters book
She is doing studying in fifth standard 
And in my state fifth standard onwards Hindi starts 
And I bought her books and I read and write 
Uh yeh kalam hai yeh kitab hai laughs 
 That's very nice 
Now you've spoken of your daughter 
It must be uh a fairly uh tough task for you to manage
your school college your family and now this uh new thing of being a
member of parliament 
How do you manage it ?
 It's I can't extend very difficult for
me to part with my family 
Uhm but I've to 
During uh Lok Sabha sessions is going on 
 I'll be here at Delhi and I'll be back at my
constituency whenever I I'm needed there 
And of course if there is no meeting is going on here
at Delhi I can be at Srinelkuda back with my people and with my
family
And somehow or other they're managing 
They rise upto the moment I think uh
I am sure 
My husband will look after all such things in my
absence I think
 That's very nice 
 I'm sure you consider the entire student and teaching
community as one family 
As a family that uh is really closely knit 
 I'm very glad that you could come here and share some
experiences with us 
Thank you very much for being with us
Thank you Mr Hemant
