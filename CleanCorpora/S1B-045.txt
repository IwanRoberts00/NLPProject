And uh  though even though it is very beautiful with lakes
rivers  to uh

You were saying before  me
here  that there is no such place as Mukundapuram on the map

Mukundapuram

can not be fulfilled

The teaching community and also that of students  they must also
be looking forward to you

Then

To my all students

This is the only grief

I lost the good field of  teaching
""
""
Uhm uhm 
""
""
It was so nice in my college  and my
colleague 
""
But I do 
""
""
Do you  ?
""
""
 a very difficult question to
answer
""
I don't know exactly 
""
Uh people in my party ask me  you you are not contesting this
election 
""
 why I came into politics
""
And uh  all the topics in between
sky and earth 
""
And I love politics too 
""
And I take it 
""
And for the first time I was facing an election 
""
Fortunately or unfortunately I won 
""
And now  to
which 
""
I think  uhm now Mukundapuram constituency is my St Joseph
College 
""
""
One thing  become member of
parliament  or that
of your collegues changed towards you ?
""
""
""
""
""
Uhm I think no 
""
""
Do they notice a change in you  ?
""
""
I don't know 
""
Uh I want to be with them 
 them
""
""
""
""
""
Certainly 
""
""
And  consider me as
their old Savitri Laxmanan
""
""
Uhm uhm 
""
 written two books
""
One of which is the collection of short one act plays 
uhm 
""
Tell us a little more about these books that 
written 
""
""
""
""
""
Uh act one of it uh one of them is a collection of  short
stories 
""
And other is full fledged drama
""
""
""
""
""
Uhm uhm 
""
""
Uh and uh drama  National Book
Store 
""
""
Uhm uhm 
""
""
 a reputed firm in Kerala
""
""
Uhm uhm 
""
""
It is published some 
""
And I got some prizes for the script 
from 
 All India Radio
 is one from Trivandrum
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Uhm uhm
""
""
And I took the female part  in my own
drama 
""
""
""
""
""
I think  a woman
artist 
""
""
""
""
How long has been your association with  All India Radio
 ?
""
""
Uh I too  for the past fifteen or sixteen years
""
""
I was participating in  radio plays
""
""
Uhm uhm 
""
""
""
All India Radio Trichur 
""
They used to take
""
I used to participate in  some of the plays
""
""
Uhm uhm 
""
 also done discussions for them
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
One thing I would like to definitely ask you is 
opinion on the education policy
""
Do you think there should be a uniform education policy for the
whole nation  ?
""
""
What I know  of course Mr Hemant the education must be
uniform 
""
But it 
""
""
Why do you think so  ?
""
""
There are so many who seek 
""
But I think ours 
""
For that  unable to fulfill the hopes of the
""
""
So private schools must be encouraged in my opinion
""
""
Uhm uhm 
""
""
I say so because  there are some who says
that 
""
Private school must be abolished 
""
But I don't think so
""
Because in our state  private school and private colleges are
doing a lot for the  students
""
 not making second rate citizens sort
""
But that  round about now a days our
school  these schools are creating second rate
citizens 
""
I feel that is what  I think
""
""
Do you also think the medium of instruction  ah
 the three tier system that now exist
 ?
""
""
""
""
""
Uhm  to give due importance to the both
language English 
""
In my case too  uh international
language from  a professor of
my original language 
""
And I used to talk  and
now I almost forgot English
""
But  English is the only force through
which I can communicate my ideas 
""
So also 
""
""
""
""
""
Some of them knew very well Hindi because Hindi is their
mother tongue 
""
But  they are unaware of the fact that happens in in the south
""
""
The sole reason is that 
learn  or write this English
""
So  in my opinion
""
And then Hindi 
""
That must be also given due importance 
""
And 
""
""
Now uh 
and when the 
to 
""
How how difficult or how easy is it for you to communicate here
 ?
""
When you are here
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
I always depend upon my little English 
""
""
Are you also 
""
""
""
trying to learn Hindi 
""
""
Have you 
""
""
""
Hindi
""
""
Uhm uhm 
""
""
And uh 
Hindi from her
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
 kuch nahi malum to
kya to kya  all
""
""
""
""
""
And I uh bought my  uhm little daughters book
""
She is doing 
""
And in my state fifth standard onwards Hindi starts 
""
And I bought her books and 
""
Uh 
""
""
""
""
Now 
""
It must be  uh tough task for you to manage
your school college  new thing of being a
member of parliament 
""
How do you manage it  ?
""
""
 very difficult for
me to part 
""
Uhm 
""
During uh 
""
 be back at my
constituency whenever I 
""
And of course  going on here
at Delhi  back with my people and with my
family
""
And somehow or other 
""
They rise upto the  uh
""
""
I am sure 
""
""
My husband  all such things in my
absence I think
""
""
""
""
 sure you consider the entire student and teaching
community as one family 
""
As a family that 
""
 very glad that you could come here and share some
experiences with us 
""
