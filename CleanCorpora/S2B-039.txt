Co-operation today is an economic system as a peaceful
reaction against capitalistic economy which has resulted in the
concentration of wealth mass poverty and decay of men 
Indian co-operative movement is probably the strongest 
and the oldest movement among developing countries 
The co-operative movement has been in existance for more
than eighty-five years and would be hundred years old soon 
The movement was introduced with high hope and big
expectation providing a solution to India's rural
problem 
All the committees from the times of Mr Nicolson to this day
 have constantly emphasised that the co-operative sector is a
fundamental solution to the ills of the rural economy in general and
agricultural economy in particular 
In the first few decades the movement was not a significant
movement but after Independence due to government's 
encouragement and the Reserve Bank's participation the
movement began to spread 
Since nineteen forty-seven the number of societies have
increased from one point eight lakhs to about three
point fifteen lakhs 
And the total membership has also gone up from one point
thirty-seven crore to fifteen crore 
The co-operative sector has provided loan to the extent
of eight thousand crore during eighty-nine ninety as
against rupees six thousand crore 
provided by the commercial banks 
The development of Consumer Store and
industrial co-operatives has also been significant 
Thus the co-operative sector in India made a tremendous
progress in various directions and has reached a stage when it can be
said as an important factor in economic social and political
development of India and has now become progressive and diversified
National level statutory organizations like NABARD L T
D C N D D have been set up to promote new co-operatives in India
In nineteen eighty-seven eighty-eight the co-operatives
attended further heights 
Agricultural credit disbursed was around rupees
 three thousand five hundred crore and the value
of the credit marketed was around rupees five thousand
 crore 
The co-operatives distributed forty lakh 
tonnes of fertilizers amounting three thousand five hundred 
crore rupees and the co-operative sugar factories produced
 fifty lakh tonnes of sugar in nineteen eighty-seven
eighty-eight accounting sixty percent national production of
sugar 
Dairy development and processing co-operatives also show 
similar progress 
The experience of number of successful co-operative
organizations like Amul in Gujarat Marksade in Punjab 
Cooptex in Tamil Nadu Apco in Andhra sugar in Maharashtra 
demonstrate that co-operative sector has needful energy to forge
ahead 
There is thus vast scope for development of organized
marketing processing and export activities in the field of
vegetables flowers horticultural products forest produce and
such other things 
Consumer Store if managed honestly and efficiently can
provide services to millions 
Important achievement during the Seventh Plan was a process of
reorganization of primary society to viable unit 
This process was complete in all the States except
Maharashtra Gujarat and Jammu Kashmir 
Another milestone was the establishment of NABARD in
July nineteen eighty-two as an apex institution to handle all matters
relating to planning policy and operation in the field of
agriculture 
The Seventh Plan also laid down great emphasis on
development of professional manpower also 
All these efforts brought economic social political
 and educational benefits to the members of these societies 
The economic benefits include Providing of cheap credit
 rescuing of rural farmer from the clutches of money-lenders 
better use of credit better prices to farmer product and better
marketing facilities to industrial worker 
On social side idle men became industrial 
The spendthrift the thrifty the illiterate learnt reading
 and some drunkard person reform their ways 
In short co-operatives have become a tool of self 
aggrendisement 
Thus the co-operatives made great strides and influence
 all spheres 
However there seem to have crept in several distortions 
on account of various reasons 
Actually the movement was introduced to uplift the downtrodden
 and the small farmer 
But in this respect we find that the movement has certainly
failed in achieving these objectives 
 The rural credit survey committee has
rightly observed that the slice of the co-operative finance was
eaten by the big cultivator 
Thirteen percent of the total household got sixty percent
share of the loan while fifty-three percent household got eleven
percent only 
Mr C Subramaniam Governor of Maharashtra has rightly said 
that the co-operatives have unfortunately not catered to the needs of the
weaker classes 
On the contrary the leaders and the vested interests 
had plagued the co-operative sector thereby the committed honest
workers are ousted and driven out 
For the poor performance the number of causes are responsible
 among them lassez faire policy illiteracy 
very small sized societies undue reliance on honorary services 
inefficiency in management and partial coverage of the life of the
individual 
Extrinsic factors include Widespread indebtedness 
lack of business experience uneconomic holding price fluctuation 
dearth of regulated market old methods of cultivation 
Presently the co-operative banking sector faces the
problems like overdue Shortage of resources indifferent
management and the lack of efforts to mobilize deposits untrained
staff and weak arrangement for linking credit with marketing 
In India twenty-five percent of the societies or say 
thirty-four thousand societies are defunct and dormant today 
This shows that the co-operative movement in India is not
uniformly developed 
 There's marked regional disparity and unevenness
 in the growth 
In Maharashtra Punjab Tamil Nadu more than seventy
percent rural population has come within the fold while in Bihar
 West Bengal Assam and Orissa the coverage is below twenty
percent 
In Andhra the development is restricted to to Telangana
 or Railseema 
One of the most disquietning feature in co-operative sector is
 incidence of increasing overdues 
In Maharashtra alone overdues amount to rupees
 two thousand four hundred crore in nineteen
eighty-seven 
In the past there were selfless and zealous workers who devoted
their whole life as a mission 
But today there is lack of dedicated leadership and lack of
trained personnel also 
The development is also hampered due to lack of
inconsistant policy and rigid approach of the government 
The formation of large sized society was rejected by the
government without giving it a trial or a serious consideration 
The defective loan policy also stood in a way of severe
growth of the movement 
In most cases the members of the society do not understand
 exact aims and objectives of the co-operatives 
The members therefore have become the clients of
convenience 
This has laid to all kinds of undesirable things in the
management of the society 
Viewed in totality our co-operative sector is not that
impressive and overall image is that one of the major reasons for
this is that all initiative comes from the government agencies 
and not from the people 
It thus has lost its basic character 
Even today the movement is known as sarkari
 movement and not the sahakari 
There are several apex institutions which have no firm rule 
and have a superstructure without infrastructure 
There is also lack of inter-co-operative relationship both
vertically and horizontally 
The sector therefore cannot show its unified strength in the
economy 
There is absence of sectoral planning in co-operative sector 
Federal units like N C D C NABARD NAFED do not pay 
sufficient attention to the constituent units 
 National co-operative policy resolution of nineteen
seventy-seven relating to integreted approach has not yet been
implemented 
Absence of such a policy has major limitation which has created
 several problems in working of the co-operative sector 
There is thus an immediate need for a clear government policy
 for the co-operatives 
Now it is also quite necessary to incorporate role of
co-operatives in Indian Constitution so that a
clear prosperous future past could be defined 
For the success of co-operatives three elements are necessary
 A dedicated leadership professionally competent management
 and enlighten membership 
After all the co-operatives are owned by members and
therefore members should know what they really expect from the
co-operatives 
Awareness among the members is very poor 
There is lack of Free membership training and education
also 
Leaders also have no clarity about their role 
As the members of the co-operatives or resource poor in
India government provide finance but with some directives 
Under such circumstances how to restore member confidence 
is the highest challenge facing us 
And as a first step in this regards the government will have to
loosen its excessive control over the co-operatives 
Recently the issue of activization of democratic process 
coupled with promotion and professionalization of management was
discussed in registrar's meeting on twenty-sixth August nineteen
eighty-five 
And according to recommendations Ardhanarishvaran
committee was set up in March nineteen eighty-six 
The committee in its recent report advised to restrain the
tendency to abuse democratic rights in the co-operatives 
Exclusive of one or two recommendations all other
recommendations unless adopted expeditously the movement cannot go
further 
India is thus facing a number of challenges and in changing
situations the role of co-operatives depend on how swiftly
co-operatives adopt and reorient to these challenges 
Fortunately in Seventh Plan adequate credit was made available
to weaker section and less developed areas 
In Maharashtra from the initial role of disbursement of credit in
rural areas the co-operatives have diversified into several
subsectors 
Co-operatives now provide a full range of services to village
level farmer in all respect 
So all these are good changes yet hereafter the poor
sections could be helped in income-generating 
activities literacy programme village sanitation drinking water
programme vocational training programme and community development
activities 
Hereafter these new co-operatives are to be organized for
weaker sections 
The members should be provided training in general management
along with leadership development programmes 
In short co-operatives should do something for the community
and then only people will begin to identify as their own co-operatives
