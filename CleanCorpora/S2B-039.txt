Co-operation today  as a peaceful
reaction against  in the
concentration of wealth 
""
Indian co-operative movement 
and the oldest movement 
""
The co-operative movement  for more
than eighty-five years 
""
The movement  and big
expectation  rural
problem 
""
All the committees  to this day
 the co-operative sector is a
fundamental solution  and
agricultural economy in particular 
""
In the first few decades  not a significant
movement 
encouragement  the
movement began to spread 
""
Since nineteen forty-seven  have
increased from  to about three
point fifteen 
""
And the total membership  one point
thirty-seven 
""
""
The co-operative sector  to the extent
of eight thousand  as
against 
provided by the commercial banks 
""
The development of  and
industrial co-operatives 
""
Thus  made a tremendous
progress  has reached a stage when it can be
said as an  and political
development of India  progressive and diversified
""
""
National level  L T
D C  new co-operatives in India
""
""
In nineteen eighty-seven eighty-eight  the co-operatives
attended further heights 
""
Agricultural credit  rupees
 and the value
of the credit marketed was  five thousand
""
""
The co-operatives 
tonnes of fertilizers 
crore rupees  the co-operative sugar factories produced
 in nineteen eighty-seven
eighty-eight  of
sugar 
""
Dairy development 
similar progress 
""
The experience  of number of successful co-operative
organizations 
Cooptex in Tamil Nadu 
demonstrate that  needful energy to forge
ahead 
""
There is thus  for development of organized
marketing  in the field of
vegetables  and
such other things 
""
Consumer Store  can
provide services to millions 
""
Important achievement during the Seventh Plan was  a process of
reorganization 
""
This process was  except
Maharashtra 
""
Another milestone  in
July nineteen eighty-two  to handle all matters
relating to  in the field of
agriculture 
""
The Seventh Plan also laid down  on
development of professional manpower also 
""
All these efforts  political
""
""
The economic benefits  Providing of cheap credit
""
better use of credit  and better
marketing facilities 
""
On social side 
""
The spendthrift  the illiterate learnt reading
""
""
In short 
aggrendisement 
""
Thus  and influence
""
""
However 
on account of 
""
Actually the movement was introduced to uplift  the downtrodden
""
""
But in this respect  the movement has certainly
failed 
""
 has
rightly observed that  was
eaten by 
""
Thirteen percent of the total household  sixty percent
share of the loan  got eleven
percent only 
""
Mr C Subramaniam 
that the co-operatives have unfortunately not catered to the needs of the
weaker classes 
""
On the contrary 
had plagued the co-operative sector  the committed honest
workers 
""
For the poor performance  the number of causes are responsible
""
very small sized societies 
inefficiency in management  of the life of the
individual 
""
Extrinsic factors include 
lack of business experience 
dearth of regulated market 
""
Presently  faces the
problems like overdue  indifferent
management  untrained
staff 
""
""
In India 
thirty-four thousand societies 
""
This shows that  is not
uniformly developed 
""
 and unevenness
""
""
In Maharashtra  more than seventy
percent  while in Bihar
 below twenty
percent 
""
In Andhra  to Telangana
""
""
One of the most disquietning feature  in co-operative sector is
""
""
In Maharashtra  rupees
 in nineteen
eighty-seven 
""
In the past there were selfless and zealous workers  who devoted
their whole life 
""
But today  and lack of
trained personnel also 
""
The development is also hampered  lack of
inconsistant policy 
""
The formation of large sized society  was rejected by the
government 
""
The defective loan policy  in a way of severe
growth of the movement 
""
In most cases  do not understand
""
""
The members therefore  the clients of
convenience 
""
This has laid to all kinds of  undesirable things in the
management of the society 
""
Viewed in totality  our co-operative sector is not that
impressive  one of the major reasons for
this 
and not from the people 
""
It thus has lost its basic character 
""
Even today  sarkari
""
""
There are several apex institutions 
and have a superstructure without infrastructure 
""
There is also lack of inter-co-operative relationship  both
vertically and horizontally 
""
The sector therefore  cannot show its unified strength in the
economy 
""
There is absence of sectoral planning in co-operative sector 
""
Federal units 
sufficient attention to the constituent units 
""
 National co-operative policy resolution of nineteen
seventy-seven  relating to integreted approach has not yet been
implemented 
""
Absence of such a policy has major limitation  which has created
""
""
There is thus  an immediate need for a clear government policy
""
""
Now  role of
co-operatives in  a
clear prosperous future past 
""
For the success of co-operatives  three elements are necessary
 professionally competent management
""
""
After all  and
therefore  members should know what they really expect from the
co-operatives 
""
Awareness among the members 
""
There is lack of  Free membership training and education
also 
""
Leaders also have no clarity 
""
As the members of the co-operatives  in
India 
""
Under such circumstances 
is the highest challenge facing us 
""
And as a first step in this regards the government will have to
loosen 
""
Recently the issue of activization of democratic process 
coupled with promotion  was
discussed in  meeting on twenty-sixth August nineteen
eighty-five 
""
And according to recommendations  Ardhanarishvaran
committee 
""
The committee in its recent report advised  the
tendency to abuse democratic rights in the co-operatives 
""
Exclusive of  all other
recommendations unless adopted expeditously  the movement cannot go
further 
""
India is thus facing  and in changing
situations  how swiftly
co-operatives adopt 
""
Fortunately in Seventh Plan  adequate credit was made available
to weaker section and less developed areas 
""
In Maharashtra from the initial role of disbursement of credit in
rural areas  into several
subsectors 
""
Co-operatives now provide a full range of services  to village
level farmer 
""
So all these are good changes  hereafter the poor
sections 
activities  drinking water
programme  and community development
activities 
""
Hereafter these new co-operatives are to be organized  for
weaker sections 
""
The members should be provided  training in general management
along with 
""
In short co-operatives should do  something for the community
and then only  people will begin to identify as their own co-operatives
