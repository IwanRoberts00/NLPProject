Bidhan Nagar in attack 
""
To Sanjoy Mitra  looking at
""
""
Bidhan Nagar playing the three mid field players  three forwards
""
""
""
""
Now 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
So Raja Chatterjee will come in 
""
Bidhan Nagar 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Sports College Lucknow which they will take just near the centre line 
""
Long high free kick  but not much danger comfortably collected
by 
""
""
skipper  clear for a
corner 
""
Corner kick will be taken from the far right 
""
Some clearance 
""
""
the ball but losing out again 
""
""
for the off side 
""
""
they maintained this lead  they will have achieved their ambition of
""
nineteen ninety semi-finalist in nineteen ninety  semi-finalist again
in ninety-nine  and runners up in nineteen
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
they won one nil and in the semi- final they beat  the school from Ranchi
three nil 
""
Sports College Lucknow from the near right  but well cleared by
""
""
Long clearance this could be dangerous
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
touch 
""
Still Bidhan Nagar one  and Kamal
""
""
Now Raja Chatterjee with the ball  attempted
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
by the sports authorities of India  our leading Sports College Lucknow by
""
""
""
""
""
""
But this time Bidhan Nagar 
""
able to translate their dominance 
""
Approach plays good 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Lalit Rathod and Veer Bahadur Thapa were the main striker for
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
left to Imad Hussein 
""
""
 he
""
from a reasonably dangerous position  if they have a hard hitting striker
""
""
Sports College Lucknow could utilise this free kick quite well 
""
""
""
""
""
 goal keeper Vimal Das has seen it well and so there was no
""
""
And referee waves 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
playing study football just long clearances 
just trying to wind time away 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Referee Joji looking 
""
Bidhan Nagar coming close to fulfilling their ambition  good
""
""
From the far side it is Imad Hussein building up an attack  for
""
""
The typical  by
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Habib and Mondal now it could give 
Niyogi 
""
He steals a diagonal but  displayed by Shailendra Kumar the poor
""
""
""
""
""
Good ball controlled by Veer Bahadur Thapa 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Lucknow could equalise 
""
It would be very demoralising for Bidhan Nagar 
""
In the beginning they stop playing  constructive football the
type of football they are capable of playing 
""
""
""
""
""
""
substitution they can of course still change their goal keeper if they want
""
""
""
""
""
And a down step Sports College Lucknow but number twelve  Salim
""
""
So Sudeep Majumdar on the field the substitute  to Komal Das
""
""
""
""
Komal Ghosh  for
""
by their  which prevents danger
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
and 
""
""
""
""
formation
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
the ball is too long to wangled for Veer Bahadur  near to
""
""
""
""
which he can do justice 
""
""
""
""
""
""
fitter but 
""
""
""
But it accidently handles the ball and  a free
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
So one more aimless crappy football into aimless crappy football
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Free kick  which is being taken by Lalit Singh of Sports
""
""
""
create danger
""
""
well cleared by Shankar Das 
""
""
the ball 
""
""
""
""
""
by being such a defensive 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
it on 
""
Deepak Mandol controls  a chance
now by Sujeet Niyogi  but the ball goes to the goal
""
""
Bidhan Nagar players resorting to long drives in this closing
minutes 
""
Probably content on their one goal lead and trying to waste a
""
""
""
""
""
Komal Ghosh is a very nippy forward as he is darting through here
""
clear the ball into touch 
""
So these seems to be the tactic for Bidhan Nagar long passes 
""
""
Bidhan Nagar players Amit Singh Rawat and throw foul  which will be taken
""
""
""
""
""
""
Niyogi a fine through pass from far right  and on the far right it is
""
crudely tackled  and rightly gets a foul though one sense may be umpire
""
managed to dribble 
""
Again Chander Joshi  Bidhan
""
""
A free kick  building up an
""
the ball 
""
""
""
""
pace  against the form but he gets a free kick just
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
with certainly a well directed free kick  could lead to a goal
""
""
Rajan Kumar is there 
""
""
""
""
""
""
Rajan Kumar kicks in the rebound  as goal keeper Vimal Das
""
""
A crowning free kick  he couldn't
""
darted in that goal with the low left footer 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
now there will be greater sense of urgency in Bidhan  play
""
