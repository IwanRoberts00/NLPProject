Bidhan Nagar in attack 
""
To Sanjoy Mitra  looking at
the box but referee waves play on 
""
Bidhan Nagar playing the three mid field players  three forwards
""
""
Sports College Lucknow 
""
Now 
""
Comfortably collected  the Bidhan Nagar goal
keeper 
""
Sports College Lucknow trailing zero one  in this Subrato
Mukherjee Cup final 
""
And the substitution  Vimal
""
""
Raja Chatterjee  come on
""
""
And coming out is the number twelve 
""
So Raja Chatterjee will come in 
""
Bidhan Nagar 
""
Once again 
""
This is in the second half Bidhan Nagar leading their opponent
Sports College Lucknow one nil in the 
""
""
Bidhan Nagar has lost three nil 
""
So if Bidhan Nagar win today it will be their first ever win in the
Subrato Cup 
""
And as their coach  Surjit Kumar Ghosh said it will be sweet
revenge  when they lost zero
three to Sports College Lucknow 
""
Referee Joji 
""
Bidhan Nagar player pulled up for stamping  and a free kick to
Sports College Lucknow which they will take just near the centre line 
""
Long high free kick  but not much danger comfortably collected
by 
""
Bidhan Nagar  their
skipper  clear for a
corner 
""
Corner kick will be taken from the far right 
""
Some clearance 
""
Now  throwing
the ball but losing out again 
""
Bidhan Nagar skipper Sanjoy Das trying to build up an attack 
for the off side 
""
So Bidhan Nagar still  clinging on to that one nil lead and if
they maintained this lead  they will have achieved their ambition of
bringing the Subrato Cup they have been pass getting the Subrato Cup since
nineteen ninety semi-finalist in nineteen ninety  semi-finalist again
in ninety-nine  and runners up in nineteen
ninety-one 
""
But they have yet to win the tournament 
""
Aimless football even this early 
""
Bidhan Nagar  reach the
final without having conceded a goal 
""
In their league matches they won ten nil thirteen nil  and then
were held cold  in the quarter final
they won one nil and in the semi- final they beat  the school from Ranchi
three nil 
""
Sports College Lucknow from the near right  but well cleared by
Bidhan Nagar 
""
Long clearance this could be dangerous
""
A chance by Sports College Lucknow  mid fielder Lalit Singh
takes a very weak try 
""
Mid field action  and
referee Joji giving 
one of Sports College Lucknow player  Bidhan Nagar
defender 
""
So  clearance Bidhan Nagar in attack
 through Raja Chatterjee the overlapping left back
""
""
Manoj Singh  but the ball goes into
touch 
""
Still Bidhan Nagar one  and Kamal
Ghosh the prolofic scorer 
""
Now Raja Chatterjee with the ball  attempted
to pass but 
""
Suddenly Bidhan Nagar seem to have become a bit hasty
""
As time is running out  they are getting anxious to hold on to
this lead  which could be long tactics because the break away move Sports
College Lucknow 
""
The ball is not of a very high quality 
""
Both teams 
""
Now this Arbind Mhatra  the ball out
of danger for Bidhan Nagar 
""
See Bidhan Nagar players lying on the ground as a results of these
""
""
And referee Joji calls up  for medical assistance
""
And there will be a slight hold up 
""
Bidhan Nagar  high school from fourth lane in Calcutta adopted
by the sports authorities of India  our leading Sports College Lucknow by
one nil
""
Both these teams met in the finals in nineteen ninety-one 
""
The Sports College Lucknow won rather emphatic win three nil 
""
But this time Bidhan Nagar 
they have been the more dominating team  but they are not really being
able to translate their dominance 
""
Approach plays good 
leads to impossession 
""
So it is 
medical attendant  near the goal and play will
resume
""
Referee Joji insist  goal keeper goes to see him
""
And there will be long  goal kick
""
""
Shankor Das also 
""
Now Bidhan Nagar  but
Komal Ghosh 
""
And on the break  there
""
""
And a long aimless kick which sails over the bar 
""
Lalit Rathod and Veer Bahadur Thapa were the main striker for
Sports College Lucknow 
""
But they have made very little impact  against the tight
marking Bidhan Nagar defence 
""
Now Imad Hussein the left winger attacking  Sports
College Lucknow  but
""
""
Sports College Lucknow trying to build up attack through from the
left to Imad Hussein 
""
And Lalit Rathod with the ball  it's
 he
accidently handle the ball while tackling 
from a reasonably dangerous position  if they have a hard hitting striker
""
""
Sports College Lucknow could utilise this free kick quite well 
""
Standing there is Vishal Prasad and Lalit Singh and let us see who
takes it 
""
Lalit Singh  goes over the bar
 goal keeper Vimal Das has seen it well and so there was no
danger 
""
And referee waves 
""
Bidhan Nagar leading Sports College Lucknow by one goal to nil 
""
Sports College Lucknow  losing out to Komal
Ghosh Komal Ghosh pulled up forward  and so Salim
Javed will take this free kick 
""
A wasted free kick  Bidhan Nagar also now
playing study football just long clearances 
just trying to wind time away 
""
Bidhan Nagar leading Sports College Lucknow by one goal to nil
""
Komal Ghosh being the scorer 
""
Raja Chatterjee taking this throwing trying to get  Komal Ghosh
in action but it is the right back Amit Singh Rawat  who intercepts and
place the ball into touch 
""
Yet another throwing 
""
Referee Joji looking 
""
Bidhan Nagar coming close to fulfilling their ambition  good
build up this 
""
From the far side it is Imad Hussein building up an attack  for
Sports College Lucknow 
""
The typical  by
Bidhan Nagar Parmanand Karmakar 
""
The long ball tactics of Sports College Lucknow not 
penetrating enough  Bidhan
Nagar defence which intercepts very well both in the air  on the
ground 
""
Habib and Mondal now it could give 
Niyogi 
""
He steals a diagonal but  displayed by Shailendra Kumar the poor
Shailendra Kumar 
""
And it is Lalit Rathod  give the ball to Veer Bahadur Thapa
""
""
Good ball controlled by Veer Bahadur Thapa 
""
""
 but again
misdirected by  Shankar Das to
make a long aimless clearance 
""
This tactics could misfire because on a break away Sports College
Lucknow could equalise 
""
It would be very demoralising for Bidhan Nagar 
""
In the beginning they stop playing  constructive football the
type of football they are capable of playing 
""
And  strike and you will
see yet another substitution
""
 who is coming on
for Bidhan Nagar so they have  on team
substitution they can of course still change their goal keeper if they want
according to latest 
""
And coming out is the number eight  is
""
""
And a down step Sports College Lucknow but number twelve  Salim
Javed shoot wide 
""
So Sudeep Majumdar on the field the substitute  to Komal Das
Komal Ghosh 
""
Komal Ghosh dribbles well and good ball control
""
Komal Ghosh  for
Sports College Lucknow defender 
by their  which prevents danger
""
""
Bidhan Nagar  infringement
and so Sports College  Lucknow will get this free kick if they take from
the near right long clearance from Amit Singh Rawat 
""
The ball with Salim Javed  with
Manoj Singh  attempted long pass but
which is misdirected 
""
So Bidhan Nagar playing with four defenders three mid field players
and 
""
And leading Sports College Lucknow  by one goal to nil
""
Sports College Lucknow playing in the traditional four to four
formation
""
Four defenders two mid field players 
""
Though one of their wingers just  to
help the forward line 
""
Bidhan Nagar so far quite untroubled  by Sports College Lucknow
 they can hold out unnecessary
defence in 
""
Long pass trying to get Veer Bahadur Thapa  but
the ball is too long to wangled for Veer Bahadur  near to
it 
""
Veer Bahadur Thapa of course  is the prolofic dangerous
striker for Sports College Lucknow but he has not received the service  to
which he can do justice 
""
Shankar Das getting ready with a long free kick  goal kick
""
""
But doesn't find an opponent Komal Ghosh going up for the ball
losing out to stretched out Komal Ghosh  Sports College Lucknow taller
fitter but 
""
Now 
""
But it accidently handles the ball and  a free
kick 
""
Misdirected free kick Raja Chatterjee edge  heller
 Lalit Rathod to Veer Bahadur Thapa
""
""
So one of the rare break away move  Sports College Lucknow
couldn't really spell any danger 
""
One more wrong high goal kick to the left side to find Komal Ghosh
""
""
So one more aimless crappy football into aimless crappy football
 the
right back 
""
Amit Singh Rawat  trying to find Lalit Singh
""
""
Amit Singh Rawat 
""
Now it is Raja Chatterjee pulled up for pushing  Salim Javed
from behind and so 
""
Free kick  which is being taken by Lalit Singh of Sports
College Lucknow 
""
Free kick from the near right  if taken accurately could
create danger
""
Three Sports College Lucknow  but
well cleared by Shankar Das 
""
A chance here for Sports College Lucknow Veer Bahadur Thapa has
the ball 
""
And now  a good shot by Imad Imdad
Hussein 
""
So this was the danger because what could happen  Bidhan Nagar
by being such a defensive 
on a break away move Sports College Lucknow nearly collide 
""
Now it is 
""
But an aimless clearance by Manoj 
""
Arbind Mhatra  who kicks
it on 
""
Deepak Mandol controls  a chance
now by Sujeet Niyogi  but the ball goes to the goal
keeper 
""
Bidhan Nagar players resorting to long drives in this closing
minutes 
""
Probably content on their one goal lead and trying to waste a
little time  by taking these long rangers
""
They also hope to unsettle  and try
for a rebound
""
Komal Ghosh is a very nippy forward as he is darting through here
 but it is Amit Singh Rawat who gets there first and
clear the ball into touch 
""
So these seems to be the tactic for Bidhan Nagar long passes 
""
And now it is again Komal Ghosh but  uh obstruction by the two
Bidhan Nagar players Amit Singh Rawat and throw foul  which will be taken
by Amit Singh Rawat at right flank 
""
Goaler  in yellow shirts Sports College Lucknow
""
""
Now Bidhan Nagar developing an attack to Sujeet Niyogi  Sujeet
Niyogi a fine through pass from far right  and on the far right it is
Deepak Mandol getting control yes  very
crudely tackled  and rightly gets a foul though one sense may be umpire
Joji could have given  advantage because he had managed Deepak Mandol had
managed to dribble 
""
Again Chander Joshi  Bidhan
Nagar from the far right 
""
A free kick  building up an
attack  Rajan Kumar loses out
the ball 
building up an attack with Lalit Singh back to Lalit Rathod  a diagonal
pass to the near right to Veer Bahadur Thapa 
""
This could be dangerous Veer Bahadur Thapa moving up picking up
pace  against the form but he gets a free kick just
outside the box if there had been a yard inside it could have been a penalty
and could have spell danger 
""
Again the break away move causing danger to Bidhan Nagar 
""
Veer Bahadur Thapa certainly shows  good subtle pulse and quick
control 
""
The most dangerous movement  Sports College Lucknow
""
""
Veer Bahadur Thapa  picked himself up his credit being thinking
of himself  this is an area
with certainly a well directed free kick  could lead to a goal
""
""
Rajan Kumar is there 
""
 see how Sports College Lucknow take this free kick
""
""
Veer Bahadur Thapa props up 
""
Rajan Kumar kicks in the rebound  as goal keeper Vimal Das
didn't collected very properly 
""
A crowning free kick  he couldn't
control it  it was the nippy Rajan Kumar who
darted in that goal with the low left footer 
""
Bidhan Nagar defenders should be blamed with this because they
didn't rush back  was in danger they should
have rushed back to help him
""
One hour now 
""
Bidhan Nagar  School Calcutta one Sports College Lucknow one
now there will be greater sense of urgency in Bidhan  play
now
