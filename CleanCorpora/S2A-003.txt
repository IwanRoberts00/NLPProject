 In Hindi 
Bidhan Nagar in attack 
To Sanjoy Mitra Sanjoy Das the captain is looking at
the box but referee waves play on 
Bidhan Nagar playing the three mid field players three forwards
 and five defenders 
Sports College Lucknow attacking to Veer Bahadur Thapa 
Now it's Rajan Kumar Kuldeep left footer 
Comfortably collected by Vimal Das the Bidhan Nagar goal
keeper 
Sports College Lucknow trailing zero one in this Subrato
Mukherjee Cup final 
And the substitution being made by Bidhan Nagar Vimal
 no it is Raja Chatterjee who's coming on 
Raja Chatterjee the number thirteen who'll come on
And coming out is the number twelve that is Santosh Gupta 
So Raja Chatterjee will come in in the next back position 
Bidhan Nagar in attack 
Once again to Sanjoy Das the skipper 
This is in the second half Bidhan Nagar leading their opponent
Sports College Lucknow one nil in the nineteen nineteen 
 ninety- one final 
Bidhan Nagar has lost three nil to Sports College Lucknow 
So if Bidhan Nagar win today it will be their first ever win in the
Subrato Cup 
And as their coach Surjit Kumar Ghosh said it will be sweet
revenge for the defeat in nineteen ninety-one when they lost zero
three to Sports College Lucknow 
Referee Joji awards foul 
Bidhan Nagar player pulled up for stamping and a free kick to
Sports College Lucknow which they will take just near the centre line 
Long high free kick but not much danger comfortably collected
by Vimal Das the goalkeeper as he collect it 
Bidhan Nagar in attack through Sanjoy Das their
skipper a good through pass but it's clear for a
corner 
Corner kick will be taken from the far right 
Some clearance and the ball goes into touch 
Now Sports College Lucknow Hemchandra Joshi throwing
the ball but losing out again 
Bidhan Nagar skipper Sanjoy Das trying to build up an attack 
for the off side 
So Bidhan Nagar still clinging on to that one nil lead and if
they maintained this lead they will have achieved their ambition of
bringing the Subrato Cup they have been pass getting the Subrato Cup since
nineteen ninety semi-finalist in nineteen ninety semi-finalist again
in ninety-nine in ninteen ninety-two and runners up in nineteen
ninety-one 
But they have yet to win the tournament 
Aimless football even this early part of the second half 
Bidhan Nagar have the distinction of having reach the
final without having conceded a goal 
In their league matches they won ten nil thirteen nil and then
were held cold by one word Shillong in the quarter final
they won one nil and in the semi- final they beat the school from Ranchi
three nil 
Sports College Lucknow from the near right but well cleared by
Bidhan Nagar Raja Chatterjee 
Long clearance this could be dangerous
A chance by Sports College Lucknow mid fielder Lalit Singh
takes a very weak try 
Mid field action not much constructed football and
referee Joji giving awarding a foul to Bidhan Nagar because 
one of Sports College Lucknow player obstructed Bidhan Nagar
defender 
So it's a long clearance Bidhan Nagar in attack
 from the near left through Raja Chatterjee the overlapping left back
 a long left footer but the ball goes obviously wide 
Manoj Singh long high goal kick but the ball goes into
touch on the near right 
Still Bidhan Nagar one Sports College Lucknow nil and Kamal
Ghosh the prolofic scorer for Bidhan Nagar scored this goal 
Now Raja Chatterjee with the ball dribbles well attempted
to pass but mis direction 
Suddenly Bidhan Nagar seem to have become a bit hasty
As time is running out they are getting anxious to hold on to
this lead which could be long tactics because the break away move Sports
College Lucknow could equalise 
The ball is not of a very high quality 
Both teams tense and anxious 
Now this Arbind Mhatra who's cleared the ball out
of danger for Bidhan Nagar 
See Bidhan Nagar players lying on the ground as a results of these
 tussles of the ball 
And referee Joji calls up for medical assistance
And there will be a slight hold up 
Bidhan Nagar high school from fourth lane in Calcutta adopted
by the sports authorities of India our leading Sports College Lucknow by
one nil
Both these teams met in the finals in nineteen ninety-one 
The Sports College Lucknow won rather emphatic win three nil 
But this time Bidhan Nagar has have the initiative 
they have been the more dominating team but they are not really being
able to translate their dominance into goal 
Approach plays good but near the goal hasty passes 
leads to impossession in attack and break up of the attack 
So it is Bidhan Nagar Shonkar Das receiving assistance 
medical attendant near the goal line near the goal and play will
resume
Referee Joji insist goal keeper goes to see him
And there will be long goal keep goal kick
 by Parmanand Karmakar 
Shankor Das also leaps back onto the field 
Now Bidhan Nagar in attack this could be dangerous but
Komal Ghosh looked as he trys to touch the ball 
And on the break for Sports College Lucknow is there
 number twelve Salim Javed Salim Javed to Veer Bahudar Thapa 
And a long aimless kick which sails over the bar 
Lalit Rathod and Veer Bahadur Thapa were the main striker for
Sports College Lucknow on their way to the final 
But they have made very little impact against the tight
marking Bidhan Nagar defence 
Now Imad Hussein the left winger attacking for Sports
College Lucknow takes a good returned pass attempts across but
 is unsuccessful 
Sports College Lucknow trying to build up attack through from the
left to Imad Hussein 
And Lalit Rathod with the ball solo pass but it's
 the referee pulls up this tackle by Sanjoy Das he
accidently handle the ball while tackling and throw a free kick 
from a reasonably dangerous position if they have a hard hitting striker
Sports College Lucknow could utilise this free kick quite well 
Standing there is Vishal Prasad and Lalit Singh and let us see who
takes it 
Lalit Singh serving the free kick just goes over the bar
 of course goal keeper Vimal Das has seen it well and so there was no
danger 
And referee waves ask for play to resume 
Bidhan Nagar leading Sports College Lucknow by one goal to nil 
Sports College Lucknow Salim Javed losing out to Komal
Ghosh Komal Ghosh pulled up forward for the obstruction and so Salim
Javed will take this free kick for Sports College Lucknow 
A wasted free kick mis directed Bidhan Nagar also now
playing study football just long clearances in inter space 
just trying to wind time away 
Bidhan Nagar leading Sports College Lucknow by one goal to nil
Komal Ghosh being the scorer 
Raja Chatterjee taking this throwing trying to get Komal Ghosh
in action but it is the right back Amit Singh Rawat who intercepts and
place the ball into touch 
Yet another throwing for Bidhan Nagar 
Referee Joji looking at his watch 
Bidhan Nagar coming close to fulfilling their ambition good
build up this but well foiled by Surendar Kumar 
From the far side it is Imad Hussein building up an attack for
Sports College Lucknow 
The typical long pass but very well headed away by
Bidhan Nagar Parmanand Karmakar 
The long ball tactics of Sports College Lucknow not really 
penetrating enough to upset the tight marking and Bidhan
Nagar defence which intercepts very well both in the air and on the
ground 
Habib and Mondal now it could give Neg 
Niyogi in the striker position 
He steals a diagonal but displayed by Shailendra Kumar the poor
Shailendra Kumar 
And it is Lalit Rathod give the ball to Veer Bahadur Thapa
 dangerous striker 
Good ball controlled by Veer Bahadur Thapa one word 
 takes the return pass 
 It's the Rajan Kumar moving up but again
misdirected by one word Bidhan Nagar defender Shankar Das to
make a long aimless clearance 
This tactics could misfire because on a break away Sports College
Lucknow could equalise 
It would be very demoralising for Bidhan Nagar 
In the beginning they stop playing constructive football the
type of football they are capable of playing 
And that is formed by Sujeet Niyogi strike and you will
see yet another substitution
 It's number seventeen Sudeep Majumdar who is coming on
for Bidhan Nagar so they have used first one word on team
substitution they can of course still change their goal keeper if they want
according to latest SEFA rule 
And coming out is the number eight for Bidhan Nagar is
 that is 
And a down step Sports College Lucknow but number twelve Salim
Javed shoot wide 
So Sudeep Majumdar on the field the substitute to Komal Das
Komal Ghosh from the left side 
Komal Ghosh dribbles well and good ball control
Komal Ghosh gives the fine smooth pass but it deflects for
Sports College Lucknow defender and good recovery tackle 
by their one word back Surendra Kumar which prevents danger
Bidhan Nagar in attack but it's infringement
and so Sports College Lucknow will get this free kick if they take from
the near right long clearance from Amit Singh Rawat 
The ball with Salim Javed now with Shailendra Kumar with
Manoj Singh long clearance to Imdad Hussein attempted long pass but
which is misdirected 
So Bidhan Nagar playing with four defenders three mid field players
and three forwards 
And leading Sports College Lucknow by one goal to nil
Sports College Lucknow playing in the traditional four to four
formation
Four defenders two mid field players and four forward 
Though one of their wingers just frequently fall back to
help the forward line 
Bidhan Nagar so far quite untroubled by Sports College Lucknow
 it's long passing game and they can hold out unnecessary
defence in one word 
Long pass trying to get Veer Bahadur Thapa in action but
the ball is too long to wangled for Veer Bahadur to even get near to
it 
Veer Bahadur Thapa of course is the prolofic dangerous
striker for Sports College Lucknow but he has not received the service to
which he can do justice 
Shankar Das getting ready with a long free kick goal kick
But doesn't find an opponent Komal Ghosh going up for the ball
losing out to stretched out Komal Ghosh Sports College Lucknow taller
fitter but making a tight control with the Bidhan Nagar players there 
Now it's a good throw pass to Komal Ghosh 
But it accidently handles the ball and there's a free
kick to Sports College Lucknow 
Misdirected free kick Raja Chatterjee edge but it heller
 goes straight to Lalit Rathod Lalit Rathod to Veer Bahadur Thapa
 who attempts the cross from the right but he doesn't reach 
So one of the rare break away move Sports College Lucknow
couldn't really spell any danger couldn't create any major danger 
One more wrong high goal kick to the left side to find Komal Ghosh
 but he is unable to attack 
So one more aimless crappy football into aimless crappy football
 and there will be a throwing being taken by Amit Singh Rawat the
right back 
Amit Singh Rawat right back trying to find Lalit Singh
 who turns and shoot but promptly cleared by Parmanand Karmakar 
Amit Singh Rawat 
Now it is Raja Chatterjee pulled up for pushing Salim Javed
from behind and so it's a foul 
Free kick which is being taken by Lalit Singh of Sports
College Lucknow 
Free kick from the near right if taken accurately could
create danger
Three Sports College Lucknow player up in the box but
well cleared by Shankar Das 
A chance here for Sports College Lucknow Veer Bahadur Thapa has
the ball 
And now good shot by Imdad a good shot by Imad Imdad
Hussein but which went wide gives the side one word 
So this was the danger because what could happen Bidhan Nagar
by being such a defensive and trying to lose out the ball and 
on a break away move Sports College Lucknow nearly collide 
Now it is Manoj Singh on the far side 
But an aimless clearance by Manoj 
Arbind Mhatra sending it to skipper Sanjoy Das who kicks
it on to Deepak Mandol 
Deepak Mandol controls it's a long clearance a chance
now by Sujeet Niyogi top of the box but the ball goes to the goal
keeper 
Bidhan Nagar players resorting to long drives in this closing
minutes 
Probably content on their one goal lead and trying to waste a
little time by taking these long rangers
They also hope to unsettle goal keeper Abdus Salam and try
for a rebound
Komal Ghosh is a very nippy forward as he is darting through here
 on the left but it is Amit Singh Rawat who gets there first and
clear the ball into touch for a throwing to Bidhan Nagar 
So these seems to be the tactic for Bidhan Nagar long passes 
And now it is again Komal Ghosh but uh obstruction by the two
Bidhan Nagar players Amit Singh Rawat and throw foul which will be taken
by Amit Singh Rawat at right flank for Sports College Lucknow 
Goaler goaler in yellow shirts Sports College Lucknow
 not being able to create any cohesive attack 
Now Bidhan Nagar developing an attack to Sujeet Niyogi Sujeet
Niyogi a fine through pass from far right and on the far right it is
Deepak Mandol getting control yes he dribbles but he is very
crudely tackled and rightly gets a foul though one sense may be umpire
Joji could have given advantage because he had managed Deepak Mandol had
managed to dribble 
Again Chander Joshi and the free kick now to Bidhan
Nagar from the far right 
A free kick uh Sports College Lucknow building up an
attack from the near side it is to Rajan Kumar Rajan Kumar loses out
the ball to Lalit Rathod Lalit Rathod in centre of the field 
building up an attack with Lalit Singh back to Lalit Rathod a diagonal
pass to the near right to Veer Bahadur Thapa 
This could be dangerous Veer Bahadur Thapa moving up picking up
pace dribble pass one against the form but he gets a free kick just
outside the box if there had been a yard inside it could have been a penalty
and could have spell danger 
Again the break away move causing danger to Bidhan Nagar 
Veer Bahadur Thapa certainly shows good subtle pulse and quick
control 
The most dangerous movement for Sports College Lucknow
Veer Bahadur Thapa picked himself up his credit being thinking
of himself uh a wall being formed ten yards away this is an area
with certainly a well directed free kick could lead to a goal
 It's a direct free kick Veer Bahadur Thapa is there 
Rajan Kumar is there 
 Let's see how Sports College Lucknow take this free kick
Veer Bahadur Thapa props up and this could be a goal 
Rajan Kumar kicks in the rebound as goal keeper Vimal Das
didn't collected very properly 
A crowning free kick put Vimal Das in trouble he couldn't
control it and off the rebound it was the nippy Rajan Kumar who
darted in that goal with the low left footer 
Bidhan Nagar defenders should be blamed with this because they
didn't rush back sensing their goal keeper was in danger they should
have rushed back to help him
One hour now and the game could go to extra time 
Bidhan Nagar School Calcutta one Sports College Lucknow one
now there will be greater sense of urgency in Bidhan Nagar's play
now
