 is
""
""
Too many of the tensions that are surfacing in Indian society today
""
""
""
""
The issue has ceased to be upfront 
""
And in fact  uh much
""
""
Uh 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
And gave the world the major of those  development
""
""
Although now I believe he is on record saying  that
""
""
But  that from
""
""
""
""
issues 
""
""
seat 
""
""
participation of  for the
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
twenty-six 
""
Why is this happening  ?
""
""
""
""
""
To give his comment on  ?
""
""
""
""
""
to discuss 
""
""
""
And the response is 
""
Because uh what has happened in the last forty 
""
""
The population of India from the nineteen fifty-one  to the
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
nineteen forty-seven 
""
""
absolute term more people 
""
""
growth 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
We must have a very hot anvil you know because  in nineteen
""
""
""
Now that is sixteen years ago 
""
""
representatives of the government of India  enlighten us that what exactly
has 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
you getting the support  ?
""
""
""
""
""
But  well whether we can save the disaster or
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
And in the last one year 
""
""
""
very close interaction  we
have been  uh increasing the awareness
""
""
""
also to 
""
Then we have 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
co-ordinated implementation action 
""
""
 N N D C on population which is going into the whole question on
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Dr Karan Singh has  about
""
""
""
""
""
""
services which is your 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
And training will play a key role 
""
""
government  four mega
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
programme  filling up of portio
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
district strategy that is focussing on the ninety worst state  of which
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
your local people  chief medical officer
""
""
And they from the local condition  which
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
We are 
""
""
""
""
""
mortality 
""
And 
""
not have launched up 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
National Population Policy 
""
""
 again formulating a national population policy
""
 just done a preliminary analysis of the nineteen
ninety-one census data 
""
And  is a great diversity
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
We should have done it 
""
Now Dr Karan Singh the only snag uh  you would forgive me for
""
him 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
And as you know the very next year the Janata Government withdrew
""
""
""
""
in nineteen seventy-one  upto two thousand one
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
So  not get back into history
""
The thing is  as we are now if we are still waiting even after
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Now which brings me 
""
Now there if I mentioned so my differenc to the  ministry's
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
My point is  if you put more money on familiy palanning in
""
rates are high precisely because infra-structure is not there 
""
The roads are not there 
""
""
not fuctioning  staff is not there
""
""
""
""
""
""
backward  whether it is child labour
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
High maternal mortality
""
""
That you should not spread the butterfield 
""
You should not waste your resources  planning's
 in those districts where the
infra-structure has to be laid first 
""
So in my scheme of things in 
""
the 
""
""
""
For Example the urban birth rate must be drastically cut down 
""
 a shame that
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
about the urban slums definitely need the full pace 
""
But  still in the
""
needing the services now are identified to be those that are religious with
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Yes yes that makes 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
mutually extreme
""
""
Yeah 
""
""
We are focussing on urban slums 
""
""
""
And when you  if you strengthen the infrastructure you put a
""
""
So  how to
""
""
We have taken four cities including Delhi 
""
""
Other uh municipal 
""
""
""
""
""
And then we get a totally inattitude uh idea of what is to be done
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
otherwise those districts will be far behind
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Firstly  uh if you are going to wait for micro-plans to be
""
""
""
ne mana ke tagaful na karoge lekin  khak ho jayenge hum tum ko khabar hone
""
""
By the time you uh  one
or two words  you know the country is
""
 people
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
It became a dirty word they even change the name of the ministry
 I don't
""
""
""
""
""
entire population policy which included  uh contraceptive technology is
included female literacy  it included a lot of worthwhile
""
""
