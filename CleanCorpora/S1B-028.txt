 is
like a subterranian 
""
Too many of the tensions that are surfacing in Indian society today
""
""
But not a chronic ailment 
""
The issue has ceased to be upfront 
""
And in fact  uh much
else that we do 
""
Uh 
Focus 
""
That brings together  of the population game
""
""
Uh we have here today  lead the
Indian delegation at the first World Population Conference  in nineteen
seventy-four 
""
And gave the world the major of those  development
is the best contraceptive 
""
Although now I believe he is on record saying  that
contraception is a best form of develpoment
""
But  that from
him 
""
Then there is Dr Bose  an
evergreen  in many other
issues 
""
And finally  in the hot
seat 
""
But first before we 
participation of  for the
last one year now 
""
The eighth plan  has given
""
""
But at the same time 
down-scaled  even though one positive scene in all
this dismal 
""
But  the eighth plan has scaled down to birth rate of only
twenty-six 
""
Why is this happening  ?
""
Or perhaps  and ask Dr Karan
Singh  with very critical
""
""
To give his comment on  ?
""
And where do you think we are going where you see we can go  ?
""
""
Well the 
to discuss 
""
And I have uh 
""
And the response is 
""
Because uh what has happened in the last forty 
""
""
The population of India from the nineteen fifty-one  to the
nineteen ninety-one census  is something which is absolutely staggering
""
""
It has diluted to a very large extent  uh
economic development that took place 
""
As a result of which we are going into the twenty-first century
 then when we became free in
nineteen forty-seven 
""
More people  not a larger proportion of the population but in
absolute term more people 
""
Our cities are exploding  into slums they are like cancer
growth 
""
Uh the whole social structure and fabric is beginning to collapse
""
""
There is urbanization  there is uh
""
""
And I would say 
""
Now  what can be done about it ?
""
I was very surprise to hear you say that uh 
the 
""
We must have a very hot anvil you know because  in nineteen
hundred and seventy-six  I presented a national population policy to
parliament  which was accepted
""
Now that is sixteen years ago 
""
If the anvil is still growing  I think we should let the
representatives of the government of India  enlighten us that what exactly
has 
""
""
Mr Mathur right
""
Would you tell us  why is it that it is necessary to tell the
working on the population policy ?
""
But also I would like you to comment on what  would
you think feasible to be done in the near future  ?
""
And what are  and are
you getting the support  ?
""
""
Well while I entirely agree with Dr Karan Singh that  it's
""
""
But  well whether we can save the disaster or
not 
""
And therefore we have  uh manfully taken the challenge
 our department
 we can do about it
""
""
And in the last one year 
uh concerted efforts 
""
Now again  focus attention on the population problem through
very close interaction  we
have been  uh increasing the awareness
about the whole problem
""
We are  in ordinary people
also to 
""
Then we have 
family welfare programme with the population control programme 
""
When population control is a much larger concept 
""
Family welfare of course 
""
For population control is dependent on female literacy 
education 
""
So for that you must have a micro-level coordinated policy 
""
Now  very glad that there was a policy as Dr Karan
Singh has had mentioned earlier a National Population Policy 
""
But that all had to be  uh made into implementation plan and
there had to be a  mechanism also to have a
co-ordinated implementation action 
""
Now  because of that now the N D C has appointed a committee of
 N N D C on population which is going into the whole question on
micro-level co-ordination 
""
And as far as the  we
have  plan
""
family welfare services the health services 
attention of the urban slums
""
Dr Karan Singh has  about
 introducing new contraceptive
""
na  N G O
""
""
What specific measure  of
services which is your 
""
""
""
""
""
Uh well  a lot of it is going to be
the advent state of input 
""
And training will play a key role 
""
Now we have through  very close interaction with the state
government  four mega
states of North  and to an
extent Orissa and 
""
We have  brought home the need for improving the delivering
system
""
So 
infrastructure  uh training
programme  filling up of portio
""
These are the nitty gritty details of good administration which
makes all the difference 
""
And then of course  having very close monitoring what
they do  ?
""
""
Yes greater enthusiasm 
""
""
And then we have got this  what you called uh ninety
district strategy that is focussing on the ninety worst state  of which
eighty-three are in the four state 
""
""
So I have a
""
""
""
""
""
Well  the beginning have been made
""
We are awaiting  uh the micro-plan from the individual district
""
""
So we have told the State Government  please involve
your local people  chief medical officer
""
""
And they from the local condition  which
would indicate 
""
So that uh 
""
And then of course I  a very great emphasis
""
""
We are 
child survival and safe motherhood project  uh through an
integrated  and for promotion
of 
""
It reduce infant mortality  and maternal
mortality 
""
And 
 they need
not have launched up 
""
""
Ashish  wondering what you have to say on all
this
""
I can  see you it
looks  right now
""
""
""
""
""
I will make two brief comments at the outset 
""
First what Dr Karan  to the
National Population Policy 
""
I think it is too late in the day now as nineteen ninety-two  to
 again formulating a national population policy
""
 just done a preliminary analysis of the nineteen
ninety-one census data 
""
And  is a great diversity
of India 
""
And you can't put all these states and districts  in one
package 
""
And therefore the national population policy tends to be  a set
of platitudes 
""
And it has very little operational value 
""
In any case  miss the bus
""
We should have done it 
""
Now Dr Karan Singh the only snag uh  you would forgive me for
saying that only snag about the  national population policy formulated by
him 
""
Well this was emergency 
because there was one permissive clause 
""
I don't remember the particular section 
which saying that some state government wants to introduce compulsory
sterilization then we do so 
""
If they have  resolve and that landed
""
""
And as you know the very next year the Janata Government withdrew
that policy 
""
The only thing common  policy was
 the parliamentary assembly seat
in nineteen seventy-one  upto two thousand one
""
That is a very good step  I suppose that
""
""
In fact there was very serious  severe setbacks to
the 
""
""
""
""
So  not get back into history
""
The thing is  as we are now if we are still waiting even after
formulating the eighth five year plan  for a national population policy
""
""
And 
""
And it is time that we forget this sort of 
and comes out to grasp that another plan of action 
""
Now which brings me 
""
Now there if I mentioned so my differenc to the  ministry's
 those ninety districts which you have identified
""
""
In fact in my analysis on nineteen ninety-one census  I get one
hundred and fifteen districts 
""
Any other noble mind you told me that you can also change  uh
 the act to that resolve
""
 not my point
""
My point is  if you put more money on familiy palanning in
those districts  there the birth
rates are high precisely because infra-structure is not there 
""
The roads are not there 
""
These hospitals are not functioning  are
not fuctioning  staff is not there
""
""
""
""
""
And there are number of other social indicators are in here
backward  whether it is child labour
whether it is
""
""
""
""
""
Yeah  therefore I would say
""
""
High maternal mortality
""
""
That you should not spread the butterfield 
""
You should not waste your resources  planning's
 in those districts where the
infra-structure has to be laid first 
""
So in my scheme of things in 
strategy which  I would support
the 
""
We should give the lead to the country 
""
For Example the urban birth rate must be drastically cut down 
""
 a shame that
""
""
One of the reason of course is the large slum population to which
Dr Karan Singh referred 
""
So  the strategy of putting your money in a
backward districts for family planning back-up  I really have reserves
""
""
""
""
""
But why you have a valid point about  doing something
about the urban slums definitely need the full pace 
""
But  still in the
rural areas  seventy-five percent of those really
needing the services now are identified to be those that are religious with
relation to two thousand population
""
""
Yes more settlement
""
""
There is uh settlement
""
""
Yes yes that makes 
""
""
""
""
""
So therefore the ninety district strategy either  a few
words  little discussion on this
""
""
Actually what you feel is that  the two things are not
mutually extreme
""
""
Yeah 
""
""
We are focussing on urban slums 
""
We realize that these are also neglected area
""
And when you  if you strengthen the infrastructure you put a
little bit push 
""
So  how to
strengthen the infrastructure
""
We have taken four cities including Delhi 
Hyderabad and Bangalore in the first phase 
""
Other uh municipal 
government's  asked to have their own plans
""
Because you see unless the  local authorities are involve in
the planning process 
""
And then we get a totally inattitude uh idea of what is to be done
""
""
So we are awaiting that and 
definitely  cities in the first phase
""
""
But ninety district uh strategies  we have to go along
otherwise those districts will be far behind
""
""
 come back on the ninety districts
""
""
 can I say something one or two
things I would like to say of this
""
Firstly  uh if you are going to wait for micro-plans to be
need 
""
That reminds me of the famous verse by Galib  hum
ne mana ke tagaful na karoge lekin  khak ho jayenge hum tum ko khabar hone
tak 
""
By the time you uh  one
or two words  you know the country is
already uh uh 
 people
""
So  that there must be a sense of
urgency about it 
""
And I do agree  that having been in exile for fourteen years
like  Ram from nineteen seventy-seven till nineteen
ninety-one 
""
""
It became a dirty word they even change the name of the ministry
 I don't
want to get into controversy 
""
But just because in one of the eighteen paragraph  there was a
mention 
laws which were never pass  for having dished the
entire population policy which included  uh contraceptive technology is
included female literacy  it included a lot of worthwhile
""
""
Including you increase the age of marriage
