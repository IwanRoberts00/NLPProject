 India's too graphic population growth is
like a subterranian under current 
Too many of the tensions that are surfacing in Indian society today
But not a chronic ailment that one learns to live with 
The issue has ceased to be upfront in the national debate 
And in fact because unless this is addressed uh much
else that we do for our developmental efforts does not justify 
Uh welcome break therefore in today's 
Focus in the wake of the World Population Day 
That brings together three veterans of the population game
 into the studio for a discussion with us 
Uh we have here today Dr Karan Singh who lead the
Indian delegation at the first World Population Conference in nineteen
seventy-four 
And gave the world the major of those one word development
is the best contraceptive 
Although now I believe he is on record saying that
contraception is a best form of develpoment
But I'm sure you will hear more about that from
him later 
Then there is Dr Bose a Jawaharlal Nehru fellow and an
evergreen of commentator of the population in many other
issues 
And finally Dr Mathur who is the bureaucrat in the hot
seat as a secretary with the Department of Family Welfare 
But first before we turn the floor over for a free 
participation of everybody for a discussion on this issue for the
last one year now a population policy has been on the anvil 
The eighth plan which has been approved in May has given
 priority to the population issue 
But at the same time while giving priority it has 
down-scaled birth rate target even though one positive scene in all
this dismal scenario has been that of late birth rates are dropping 
But the eighth plan has scaled down to birth rate of only
twenty-six for the year nineteen ninety seven 
Why is this happening ?
Or perhaps I should stop at this point and ask Dr Karan
Singh who has spearheaded this programme with very critical
 point in the programme 
To give his comment on uh where we are ?
And where do you think we are going where you see we can go ?
Well the uh theme we are about discussion 
to discuss is uh Population: Whithered India 
And I have uh two word response to that two word question 
And the response is towards disaster 
Because uh what has happened in the last forty year 
 years uh the increase of five hundred million people 
The population of India from the nineteen fifty-one to the
nineteen ninety-one census is something which is absolutely staggering
It has diluted to a very large extent the considerable uh
economic development that took place 
As a result of which we are going into the twenty-first century
 with more people below the poverty line then when we became free in
nineteen forty-seven 
More people not a larger proportion of the population but in
absolute term more people 
Our cities are exploding into slums they are like cancer
growth eating into the countryside 
Uh the whole social structure and fabric is beginning to collapse
 under the sheer pressure of number 
There is urbanization there is deforestation there is uh
 defoliation the environment is being destroyed 
And I would say that we are in a disastrous situation 
Now what can be done about it ?
I was very surprise to hear you say that uh a 
the population policy is on the anvil 
We must have a very hot anvil you know because in nineteen
hundred and seventy-six I presented a national population policy to
parliament which was accepted
Now that is sixteen years ago 
If the anvil is still growing I think we should let the
representatives of the government of India enlighten us that what exactly
has happen happened 
Mr Mathur right
Would you tell us why is it that it is necessary to tell the
working on the population policy ?
But also I would like you to comment on what is would
you think feasible to be done in the near future within this decade ?
And what are the strategies that you are forging and are
you getting the support if you think you need ?
Well while I entirely agree with Dr Karan Singh that it's
 a disastrous uh situation 
But whither India well whether we can save the disaster or
not would depend what we do in the next ten years 
And therefore we have very uh manfully taken the challenge
 uh should say atleast in the de our department
 to see how what we can do about it
And in the last one year first of all we've made 
uh concerted efforts 
Now again focus attention on the population problem through
very close interaction between India's one word we
have been I think uh instrumental in uh increasing the awareness
about the whole problem
We are finding a lot of interest now in ordinary people
also to participate in the whole thing 
Then we have projected at least don't create 
family welfare programme with the population control programme 
When population control is a much larger concept 
Family welfare of course is a key aspect of it 
For population control is dependent on female literacy 
education rural devepolment uh age of marriage of girls 
So for that you must have a micro-level coordinated policy 
Now I'm very glad that there was a policy as Dr Karan
Singh has had mentioned earlier a National Population Policy 
But that all had to be uh made into implementation plan and
there had to be a uh micro-level mechanism also to have a
co-ordinated implementation action 
Now because of that now the N D C has appointed a committee of
 N N D C on population which is going into the whole question on
micro-level co-ordination 
And as far as the a family welfare factor is concerned we
have prepared a very result oriented and purpose one word plan
 giving emphasis or improving of the quality or the self 
family welfare services the health services constant one word 
attention of the urban slums
Dr Karan Singh has spoke spoken about
 improving the quality of contraceptive introducing new contraceptive
 social marketing better information communication education 
na uh ta strategies ivolvement of people N G O
What specific measure that improve endeavoury of
services which is your one or two words 
 That maternal 
Uh well you see on that a lot of it is going to be
the advent state of input 
And training will play a key role 
Now we have through very close interaction with the state
government particularly the state government from these four mega
states of North U P Bihar Madhya Pradesh Rajasthan and to an
extent Orissa and uh Assam where the problem is uh aggrieving 
We have brought home the need for improving the delivering
system
So we are having certain special projects one word 
infrastructure great emphasis being made lead on the uh training
programme filling up of portio
These are the nitty gritty details of good administration which
makes all the difference 
And then of course we're having very close monitoring what
they do ?
Yes greater enthusiasm 
And then we have got this what you called uh ninety
district strategy that is focussing on the ninety worst state of which
eighty-three are in the four state 
So I have a
 One word taken up already 
Well the beginning have been made
We are awaiting uh the micro-plan from the individual district
 because we do not want to impose anything from above 
So we have told the State Government please involve
your local people your collector your uh chief medical officer
 
And they from the local condition send us micro-plan which
would indicate their special support is required from the Center 
So that uh the democracy profile improves in those states 
And then of course I I was mentioning a very great emphasis
 on maternal and child health area you see 
We are just about to launch a very important 
child survival and safe motherhood project which uh through an
integrated have been to mention for child survival and for promotion
of safe motherhood practices 
It reduce infant mortality child mortality and maternal
mortality 
And people will then appreciate that uh if you 
 your their children are going to survive they need
not have launched up 
Ashish I'm wondering what you have to say on all
this
I can al al almost see you it
looks coining a new acronym no no right now
 No no 
I will make two brief comments at the outset 
First what Dr Karan Singh's relation to the
National Population Policy 
I think it is too late in the day now as nineteen ninety-two to
 think of again formulating a national population policy
 I've just done a preliminary analysis of the nineteen
ninety-one census data 
And one thing which emerges gre is a great diversity
of India 
And you can't put all these states and districts in one
package 
And therefore the national population policy tends to be a set
of platitudes 
And it has very little operational value 
In any case we've miss the bus
We should have done it right in the First Five Year Plan 
Now Dr Karan Singh the only snag uh you would forgive me for
saying that only snag about the national population policy formulated by
him 
Well this was emergency and it became highly unpopular 
because there was one permissive clause 
I don't remember the particular section or the dialogue 
which saying that some state government wants to introduce compulsory
sterilization then we do so 
If they have the way they've resolve and that landed
 the government in very serious trouble 
And as you know the very next year the Janata Government withdrew
that policy 
The only thing common in their next year's policy was
 this fielding of the electorate the parliamentary assembly seat
in nineteen seventy-one upto two thousand one
That is a very good step I suppose that
In fact there was very serious severe setbacks to
the a few words 
 A few words 
So let's not get back into history
The thing is as we are now if we are still waiting even after
formulating the eighth five year plan for a national population policy
 then I think we are lost 
And we're heading towards disaster as he say 
And it is time that we forget this sort of a generalizing 
and comes out to grasp that another plan of action 
Now which brings me my second point 
Now there if I mentioned so my differenc to the ministry's
 plan of action is those ninety districts which you have identified
 they are truely backward 
In fact in my analysis on nineteen ninety-one census I get one
hundred and fifteen districts 
Any other noble mind you told me that you can also change uh
 dedicated the act to that resolve
 That's not my point
My point is if you put more money on familiy palanning in
those districts you will not succeed because there the birth
rates are high precisely because infra-structure is not there 
The roads are not there 
These hospitals are not functioning sub-centre's are
not fuctioning staff is not there
 Yeah 
And there are number of other social indicators are in here
backward whether it being marriage whether it is child labour
whether it is
 All the other one or two words 
Yeah therefore I would say
High maternal mortality
That you should not spread the butterfield 
You should not waste your resources family planning's
 limited resources on giving a backup in those districts where the
infra-structure has to be laid first 
So in my scheme of things in my my 
strategy which I'm going to formulate shortly I would support
the thickly populated densely populated advanced districts 
We should give the lead to the country 
For Example the urban birth rate must be drastically cut down 
 I I it's a shame that
 in the urban areas the birth rate is so very high 
One of the reason of course is the large slum population to which
Dr Karan Singh referred 
So but uh the strategy of putting your money in a
backward districts for family planning back-up I really have reserves
 But uh 
But why you have a valid point about doing something
about the urban slums definitely need the full pace 
But seventy-five percent of India is in still in the
rural areas and within that seventy-five percent of those really
needing the services now are identified to be those that are religious with
relation to two thousand population
Yes more settlement
There is uh settlement
Yes yes that makes the task more difficult 
 So 
So therefore the ninety district strategy either a few
words we can have little discussion on this
Actually what you feel is that the two things are not
mutually extreme
Yeah 
We are focussing on urban slums 
We realize that these are also neglected area
And when you if you strengthen the infrastructure you put a
little bit push you can have the results 
So city by city we are making a plan to how to
strengthen the infrastructure
We have taken four cities including Delhi Calcutta 
Hyderabad and Bangalore in the first phase 
Other uh municipal commissioners and the state 
government's have been asked to have their own plans
Because you see unless the local authorities are involve in
the planning process then they don't own the fact 
And then we get a totally inattitude uh idea of what is to be done
So we are awaiting that and I and yes will 
definitely we will cover all the ninety cities in the first phase
But ninety district uh strategies we have to go along
otherwise those districts will be far behind
 I'll come back on the ninety districts
 One or two words can I say something one or two
things I would like to say of this
Firstly uh if you are going to wait for micro-plans to be
need and come up to you before you formulate your new policy 
That reminds me of the famous verse by Galib hum
ne mana ke tagaful na karoge lekin khak ho jayenge hum tum ko khabar hone
tak 
By the time you uh you develop your laughter one
or two words you will see these micro- plan you know the country is
already uh uh virtually drowning in an ocean of of 
 of people
So my submission would be that there must be a sense of
urgency about it 
And I do agree that having been in exile for fourteen years
like Shri Ram from nineteen seventy-seven till nineteen
ninety-one fourteen years family planning was in exile laughter 
It became a dirty word they even change the name of the ministry
 and mind you the alibis I've been two words I don't
want to get into controversy 
But just because in one of the eighteen paragraph there was a
mention an enabling mention of the possibility of some state passing 
laws which were never pass that is not an alibi for having dished the
entire population policy which included uh contraceptive technology is
included female literacy it included a lot of worthwhile
Including you increase the age of marriage
