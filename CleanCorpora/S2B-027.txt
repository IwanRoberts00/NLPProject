Photogrammetry means making measurements on
photographs 
When direct measurements are not possible as in the case of
 very intricate objects or moving objects we make 
photograph and from that photograph we make measurements 
Usually we take photograph from the air to make map of the
topography 
In this case the branch is known as aerial photogrammetry
If the photographs are taken from the ground then the objects
are surfaces are at a distance less than three hundred metres we
call the branch as close range photogrammetry
Where do we make use of close range photogrammetry in ?
There are a number of applications 
We can broadly divide these applications into two parts 
The first part the objects will be static 
For example historic monuments temple one word 
 a train accident 
In all these cases the objects on the surfaces are not
moving they are all static 
In the other case the object will be moving or the surface
will be dynamic 
To cite some specific example we can take the case of a
wave form 
When the waves are moving if you want to make measurement
about the characterstics of the wave it is not possible to record the
measurement directly 
We take the photograph of this wave which are dynamic and
later on we analyse the photograph to derive that information we desire
To cite another example we can consider a running
athlete 
If you want to analyse the movement of the athlete it is
difficult to make the measurement directly 
We make use of close range photograph to record the movement of
the athlete at various instance of time and later on from the photograph
 we can analyse the movement of the particular sportsmen to find
out their deficiencies 
There are a number of applications of close range
photogrammetry in the medical field 
One such application is plastic surgery 
For example if we want to make some alteration in any part
of the human body we should know the present position of the particular
part 
We take photograph of that particular part by making use of
 a special camera 
The doctor can then simulate by making use of computer 
how the particular part would look like after the surgery is made 
The surgeon may decide how much of tissue should be taken 
from another part of the body where the tissue should be placed and
how it should be placed all these required measurement can be
analysed by means of the photographs taken of the particular
patient 
Another interesting application is in recording crime
scene and traffic accidents 
Imagine the nature of the traffic in a very busy highway
 when a traffic accident takes place 
Immediately the vehicles pile up one after another for
kilometres together if it is a very busy highway 
We will normally wait till the police people come to make
the necessary measurement and the signal from the police people 
to clear the traffic it takes about half an hour or so to
record all the measurements the police people need to present the
case before the magistrate 
Consider the delay in the movement of the traffic in this
case to all the people who are waiting in their vehicles to clear the
traffic 
If you have here close range photogrammetry camera we can rush
the camera to the traffic accident site record the scene by means of a
few photographs taken from two or three vantage position 
What all measurements we need about the traffic accident we
can later on derive the same by analysing the photograph taken from
the close range photogrammetry camera 
Another area where close range photogrammetry would be
more useful is in the recording of structural movement of
massive structures 
To cite a specific example we can consider a massive dam
If we would like to know how much the dam is one word 
 over a period of time or how much the dam is getting deflected over a
period of time we can make use of this technique 
We will make special target on the surface of the dam
 at various points 
We can record the dam site alongwith the target mark making use
of the photogrammetry camera over a period of time 
Normally we may take pictures at intervals of about a month
If we analyse the photograph of the dam taken periodically
 making use of special plotting machines we will come to know 
how much that targets are getting moved either in the vertical direction
 or in the lateral direction or in any direction of deformation 
Because we will be taking measurement to a very high order of
accuracy to about one by thousand of a milimetre we will be knowing
how much the structure is getting deflected over a period of time 
very very accurately 
Same is the case when we want to record structural failure 
For example if a beam is loaded by external load 
gradually the beam will be deforming until the beam fails 
If a structural engineer would like to record the behaviour of
the structure due to various types of loading he can make use of the
close range photogrammetry camera to record how the structure is
getting deformed instant after instant 
After the recording is done he can analyse the photograph 
in the special photogrammetry plotting machine to find out their nature
of deformation and the extent of deformation very very accurately
Another field of application is the field of anthropology 
The anthropologists are interested in classifying the skull
 to find out to which race a particular skull belongs 
The anthropologist will be recording the important dimensions
of various skulls belonging to different races 
There will be some characteristic measurements for a particular
skull 
If a skull is to be analysed we can take photograph of the skull
 find out the characteristic of the important measurements and from
the measurements we can find out whether the skull belongs to a
Chinese or a Nepali or an Asian race 
We need a number of equipment to produce map making use of
the close range photogrammetry technique 
The first equipment needed is an electronic distance measuring
equipment 
An electronic distance measuring equipment is known as E D M
This is a sophisticated equipment to measure the distances 
and angles 
An infra range beam is generated in the E D M and
it travels to the point to which you want to make measurement and it
gets reflected back to the equipment 
By analysing the face shift we can find out the distance between
any two points to a high order of accuracy usually fractions of a
milimetre 
In the case of close range photogrammetry we establish a
few control points as target in the field of view of the photograph 
The E D M is made use of in the field to record the
rectangular coordinate of the various control points 
By analysing their distances and angles we will come to know
 that X Y and either coordinate of the control point situated in
the field of view 
When we analyse this photograph in the plotting machine the
control points are very essential 
The coordinate of the control points which were obtained from
the E D M are fit into the plotting machine 
The second equipment needed for the close range photogrammetry
 is a special stereometric camera 
This camera essentially consists of two independent 
highly accurate camera separated by a known distance of hundred and
twenty centimetres 
The lenses are having a focal length of sixty milimetres 
A speciality of these two cameras is that the lenses have been
so refined that practically no lense distortion occurs in the
pictures taken from this camera 
Since we will be making measurement on the photograph to a very
high order of accuracy we have to have the images of the objects 
positioned in the geometrically correct location 
If there is need of specially refined lenses required for
this stereometric camera we we should have two cameras instead of one in
the case of close range photogrammetry 
If we take twin pictures simultaneously we will be able to see
their actual field in three dimensions in the plotting machine which we
will be using later 
Because the two photographs are taken simultaneously we are
freezing the movement of the objects as well as we are able to get a
three dimensional true to scale model in the photogrammetric plotting
machine 
This machine is so constructed to have simultaneous pictures
If we operate a single button both the pictures are taken
simultaneously 
Because we will be taking measurement very very accurately this
camera takes only glass plates 
The glass plates are sensitized with the photogrammetric emulsion
The emulsion are sensitive to the light and the processing
which takes place after the exposure is made 
During the development stage during the drive stage no
distortion of the pictures occurs 
Thats why we are making use of glass plates to arrest all
distortions of the negative 
Another special feature of this camera is the various
possibility of orientation of the camera 
If we need the shaft of the camera containing both the
cameras can be rotated in the longitudinal axis or the camera
can be brought one over the other 
The camera can also be swivelled about the vertical axis 
Why should we need all these types of movement ?
We may need to take photograph from the high point such as the
top of a mountain but the object may be far below 
Once the photographic processing is over the original glass
plates containing the emulsion are converted into the dipositives 
In the plotting machine we keep the dipositives 
one on the left side and one on the right side 
We measure the coordinate of a particular point in the machine
 through the binocular kept in front of the observer 
The observer finds a fourteen mark in the field of
view 
He keeps the fourteen mark over a point of interest
As he measures the coordinate of the point making use of the
photogrammetric machine the computer controlled part takes the X and
Y coordinate from the left image and the right image and they are
processed through the computer to give the X Y and either coordinates
 with respect to a given origin 
The ground control points which are measured earlier they are
also made use of to calculate the actual position of the point
measured 
The computer after recording all the photographic coordinates
 converts them into graphic details 
The graphic details are then passed on to a special plotting
table 
In the plotting table the plotting pencil according to the
command of the observer converts the details of the scene into a
picture 
That picture may contain all the details appearing in the field
of view in the form of live feature 
The operator may choose special symbols and special colours
 to codify the different types of features appearing in the field
of view 
A user by studying the map coming out from the plotting table
 will be able to get all the measurements he needs without any
difficulty 
If the observer needs only the coordinate and not the map he
can take all the required coordinate from the screen of the computer
itself or if the operator would like to keep all the
measurements in a magnetic tape or a floppy he can store all the
information of the field and keep them in a special plate 
If you would like to record the changes in a particular field over
a period of time the same type of measurement can be repeated and
from the repeated measurement it is possible to find out the changes
which have occured in a particular field or a particular object 
Concluding I would like to remark that whenever you have a
situation where the direct measurements are not at all possible 
the stereophotogrammetric technique will be coming handy to you
