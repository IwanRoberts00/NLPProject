Photogrammetry  making measurements on
""
""
When direct measurements are not possible  as in the case of
""
photograph and from that photograph 
""
""
topography 
""
In this case  branch is known as aerial photogrammetry
""
""
If the photographs are taken from the ground  then the objects
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
The first part 
""
""
""
""
""
moving 
""
In the other case  or the surface
""
""
To cite some specific example  a
""
""
When the waves are moving  if you want to make measurement
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
difficult to make the measurement directly 
""
We make use of close range photograph  to record the movement of
""
 to find
out their deficiencies 
""
""
photogrammetry in the medical field 
""
One such application is plastic surgery 
""
""
of the human body  we should know the present position of the particular
""
""
We take  by making use of
""
""
The doctor can then simulate 
how the particular part would look like 
""
The surgeon may decide 
""
how it should be placed  can be
analysed  of the particular
""
""
""
""
""
Imagine  in a very busy highway
""
""
Immediately  for
""
""
We will normally wait  to make
the necessary measurement 
""
record all the measurements  to present the
""
""
Consider the  in this
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Another area  would be
""
""
""
To cite a specific example  a massive dam
""
""
If we would like to know 
 or how much the dam is getting deflected over a
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
If we analyse the photograph of the dam  taken periodically
""
""
""
""
""
accuracy  we will be knowing
""
""
""
""
""
For example 
""
""
""
the structure  he can make use of the
""
getting deformed 
""
""
in the special photogrammetry plotting machine  to find out their nature
""
""
""
Another field of application is 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
skull 
""
If a skull is to be analysed we can take photograph of the skull
""
""
""
""
""
the close range photogrammetry technique 
""
""
equipment 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
it travels to the point  and it
""
""
""
""
milimetre 
""
In the case of  we establish a
""
""
The E D M is made use of in the field  the
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
twenty centimetres 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
positioned in the geometrically correct location 
""
""
this stereometric camera  we we should have two cameras instead of one in
""
""
""
""
will be using later 
""
""
freezing the movement of the objects  we are able to get a
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
simultaneously 
""
Because we will be taking measurement very very accurately  this
camera takes only glass plates 
""
""
""
""
""
which takes place after the exposure is made 
""
During the development stage  no
""
""
""
""
""
Another special feature of this camera  is the various
""
""
""
cameras can be rotated  the camera
can be brought one over the other 
""
""
""
""
""
""
top of a mountain 
""
""
""
""
""
one on the left side and one on the right side 
""
We measure the coordinate of a particular point  in the machine
""
""
The observer  mark in the field of
""
""
He keeps the  over a point of interest
""
""
""
photogrammetric machine  part takes the X and
""

""
""
""
table 
""
In the plotting table  according to the
command of the observer  into a
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
 without any
""
""
""
""
itself  all the
measurements in a magnetic tape  he can store all the

If you would like to record the changes in a particular field over

which have occured in a particular
