Photogrammetry  making measurements on
photographs 
""
When direct measurements are not possible  as in the case of
""
photograph and from that photograph 
""
Usually  to make map of the
topography 
""
In this case  branch is known as aerial photogrammetry
""
""
If the photographs are taken from the ground  then the objects
are surfaces  we
call  the branch as close range photogrammetry
""
Where do we make use of  ?
""
There are 
""
We can broadly divide these applications 
""
The first part 
""
For example 
""
""
In all these cases  on the surfaces are not
moving 
""
In the other case  or the surface
will be dynamic 
""
To cite some specific example  a
wave form 
""
When the waves are moving  if you want to make measurement
about the characterstics of the wave  it is not possible to record the
measurement 
""
We take the photograph of this wave  and
later on we analyse the photograph  to derive that information we desire
""
""
To cite another example  running
athlete 
""
If you want to analyse the movement of the athlete  it is
difficult to make the measurement directly 
""
We make use of close range photograph  to record the movement of
the athlete at various instance of time  and later on from the photograph
 to find
out their deficiencies 
""
There are a number of applications of  close range
photogrammetry in the medical field 
""
One such application is plastic surgery 
""
For example  some alteration in any part
of the human body  we should know the present position of the particular
part 
""
We take  by making use of
""
""
The doctor can then simulate 
how the particular part would look like 
""
The surgeon may decide 
from another part of the body  and
how it should be placed  can be
analysed  of the particular
patient 
""
Another interesting application  crime
scene 
""
Imagine  in a very busy highway
""
""
Immediately  for
kilometres together 
""
We will normally wait  to make
the necessary measurement 
to  to
record all the measurements  to present the
case before the magistrate 
""
Consider the  in this
case  to clear the
traffic 
""
If you have here close range photogrammetry camera  we can rush
the camera to the traffic accident site  record the scene by means of a
few photographs 
""
What all measurements we need  we
can later on derive the same  taken from
the close range photogrammetry camera 
""
Another area  would be
more useful  of
massive structures 
""
To cite a specific example  a massive dam
""
""
If we would like to know 
 or how much the dam is getting deflected over a
period of time 
""
We will make  on the surface of the dam
""
""
We can record the dam site alongwith the target mark  making use
of the photogrammetry camera 
""
Normally  at intervals of about a month
""
""
If we analyse the photograph of the dam  taken periodically
""
how much that targets are getting moved  either in the vertical direction
""
""
Because we will be taking measurement to a very high order of
accuracy  we will be knowing
how much the structure is getting deflected 
very very accurately 
""
Same is the case when we want to record 
""
For example 
gradually the beam will be deforming 
""
If a structural engineer would like to  record the behaviour of
the structure  he can make use of the
close range photogrammetry camera  how the structure is
getting deformed 
""
After the recording is done 
in the special photogrammetry plotting machine  to find out their nature
of deformation  very very accurately
""
""
Another field of application is 
""
The anthropologists  skull
""
""
The anthropologist will be  recording the important dimensions
of various skulls 
""
There will be some characteristic measurements  for a particular
skull 
""
If a skull is to be analysed we can take photograph of the skull
 and from
the measurements we can find out  to a
Chinese 
""
We need a number of  making use of
the close range photogrammetry technique 
""
The first equipment needed  is an electronic distance measuring
equipment 
""
An electronic distance measuring equipment  is known as E D M
""
""
This is a sophisticated equipment 
and angles 
""
An  and
it travels to the point  and it
gets reflected 
""
By analysing the face shift we can find out the distance between
any two points  usually fractions of a
milimetre 
""
In the case of  we establish a
few control points 
""
The E D M is made use of in the field  the
rectangular coordinate of the various control points 
""
By analysing their distances and angles  we will come to know
 of the control point situated in
the field of view 
""
When we analyse this photograph in the plotting machine  the
control points are very essential 
""
The coordinate of the control points  which were obtained from
the E D M 
""
The second equipment needed for  the close range photogrammetry
""
""
This camera 
highly accurate camera  hundred and
twenty centimetres 
""
The lenses are having a focal length of sixty milimetres 
""
A speciality of these two cameras is  that the lenses have been
so refined  in the
pictures taken from this camera 
""
Since we will be making measurement on the photograph  to a very
high order of accuracy 
positioned in the geometrically correct location 
""
If there is need of  required for
this stereometric camera  we we should have two cameras instead of one in
the case of close range photogrammetry 
""
If we take twin pictures simultaneously  we will be able to see
their actual field in three dimensions  in the plotting machine which we
will be using later 
""
Because the two photographs are taken simultaneously  we are
freezing the movement of the objects  we are able to get a
three dimensional  true to scale model in the photogrammetric plotting
machine 
""
This machine is so constructed  to have simultaneous pictures
""
""
If we operate a single button  both the pictures are taken
simultaneously 
""
Because we will be taking measurement very very accurately  this
camera takes only glass plates 
""
The glass plates are sensitized with the photogrammetric emulsion
""
""
The emulsion are sensitive to the light  the processing
which takes place after the exposure is made 
""
During the development stage  no
distortion of the pictures occurs 
""
Thats why we are making use of glass plates  to arrest all
distortions of the negative 
""
Another special feature of this camera  is the various
possibility of 
""
If we need  both the
cameras can be rotated  the camera
can be brought one over the other 
""
The camera can also be swivelled about the vertical axis 
""
Why should we need all these types of movement  ?
""
We may need to take photograph from the high point such as  the
top of a mountain 
""
Once the photographic processing  the original glass
plates containing the emulsion 
""
In the plotting machine 
one on the left side and one on the right side 
""
We measure the coordinate of a particular point  in the machine
""
""
The observer  mark in the field of
view 
""
He keeps the  over a point of interest
""
""
As he  measures the coordinate of the point making use of the
photogrammetric machine  part takes the X and
Y coordinate  and they are
processed through the computer  Y and either coordinates
""
""
The ground control points which are measured earlier  they are
also made use of  the point
measured 
""
The computer  after recording all the photographic coordinates
""
""
The graphic details are then passed on  to a special plotting
table 
""
In the plotting table  according to the
command of the observer  into a
picture 
""
That picture may contain all the details  appearing in the field
of view 
""
The operator may choose  and special colours
 appearing in the field
of view 
""
A user by studying the map coming out from the  plotting table
 without any
difficulty 
""
If the observer needs only the coordinate and not the map  he
can take all the required coordinate  from the screen of the computer
itself  all the
measurements in a magnetic tape  he can store all the
information of the field 
""
If you would like to record the changes in a particular field over
a period of time  and
from the repeated measurement it is possible to find out  the changes
which have occured in a particular 
""
Concluding I would like to  that whenever you have a
situation 
the stereophotogrammetric technique
