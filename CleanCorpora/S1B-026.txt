We are here to discuss the priorities  of the eighth Five
""
""
The other day the national development council met and approved of
""
""
""
""
""
""
 about the
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
We are going to discuss I think  of the
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
are going to come 
""
""
shortage of resources  and also the
""
""
May I first ask  uh uh Dr Nitish Singh Sen Gupta who is with us
""
""
in the Planning Commission  uh who is
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
of the eighth plan as a  a matter relevent to todays time and change
""
""
""
Well at a time when  there is a
general uh 
""
""
Although it is another thing that  any planning has to build on
 earlier by the previous plans and also draw on the
development experience of 
""
""
In our opinion planning is very relevent although it has to 
""
""
It has to acquire  and new experience
empirical knowledge  so as to acquire a new
""
""
It is relevent 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
includes  by and
""
""
Uh taking care of the education 
""
""
needs  essential needs of the people in
general 
""
Now this is  public sector will have to take care of
""
""
In the need for the  these items public goods and
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
uh uh the eighth plan particularly welcomes the involvement of private sector
""
""
For example in energy  private sector has been invited to take
part
""
""
Ah ha 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
In some sense  uh
""
their micro-economy 
""
And that is the area which will remain in a sense even after all
these other three 
""
""
""
ask Dr Sen Gupta  is the eighth five year plan
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
gained earlier 
""
We are starting against the backdrop of  very significant growth
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
time because of our inprovidence in the recent past 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
 the maximum gain out of the
""
""
""
""
It is time we give up the  necessarily
""
""
""
""
schemes when  uh only about
""
""
""
""
""
So as to avoid 
""
""
misplace priority on a number of things you know like for instance we give a
""
""
Now government has given up  uh vacated a large number of areas
""
""
""
""
""
Now sixth and seventh plan we practically gave up population
control
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Now  all
""
""
achieved by let us say China 
""
I think how much that  how much difference that alone
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Uhm uhm 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Uhm
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
It will not give  uh attention
""
extent necessary for 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
which planning will address uh 
""
""
the economy 
""
The private sector also would have something to do with it 
""
""
that there are innovations in this plan other than what Dr Sen Gupta has
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
things
""
""
Ah ha 
""
""
""
 by financial expenditure
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
return  in terms of its effectiveness in achieving target
""
""
""
""
""
""
to the development of  the proper
institutions  used in the second five year plan
""
""
""
""
""
This plan  this plan for the first time talks of indicative
planning
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
of agriculture 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
And to which we were able to achieve 
""
Now we will be paying a little more attention  to the
""
widen the area of indicative planning 
""
""
""
""
""
this country 
""
""
""
Uh there has been a shortage of resources from taxation and
""
""
""
from the  has been the order of
""
economy 
""
And the story of Indian planning generally is a story of inflation
""
""
""
the same reason  and
exports were not released from the domestic economy 
""
Uh Dr Veermani  new
things that there is some new thinking 
in the area of budget deficit management  and in the area of balance of
""
""
""
Yeah let me uh  uh just give couple of examples where I
""
""
""
As the popular expression is to  to fit
""
""
""
planning 
""
""
on realistic and achievable targets rather than spreading the money  uh
""
""
""
""
put it a little strongly uh 
""
to be done by the government  and if the gap could not be closed it was
""
""
""
uh have the private sector do it
""
So that the goals are achieved 
""
Uh so this is basically  for this attempt
""
""
Uh I would like to add one kind of word of caution in a sense 
""
""
which have marked  would
""
improved 
""
""
on we can discuss 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
What are the sectors which are being regarded as the priority
""
""
What are the areas of achievements which are being uh  regarded
""
""
If you were to order priorities what would be the list of these
your priorities  ?
""
""
I will give this priorities but they would not necessarily be
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
 where
it has been very much uh manifest  to those areas parts of the country
""
""
""
""
""
The plan assumes that Indian agriculture has tremendous capacity
""
be used to meet the requirement of other parts of the world
""
""
""
Then population  already elaborated on the
""
""
But the idea is that the  should be
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
We still have to go to achieve the rate which China has achieved
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
jobs a year 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
By concentrative attention 
""
""
""
""
""
But irrigation again  there is a kind of idea to switch on from
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
the  practically all
""
""
But there the problem of resources come in
""
""
Dr Sen Gupta  I I did feel that bringing the the ambition
""
rate 
""
""
""
within a five year period is a
