We are here to discuss the priorities of the eighth Five
Year Plan 
The other day the national development council met and approved of
the directional paper 
Uh which is preceeding the actual meeting of the eighth plan
Uh there used to be approach papers before every plan and as
 an economist who also had a sense of humour once quipped about the
fifth plan it's not the it's not the approach to the
fifth plan but the fifth approach to the same plan 
Emphasisng the similarity that exists in all our plans 
Now one wonders whether it'll be different this time
And to discuss such issues we're going to talk
about whether the planning concept is still relevent into these world 
and if so in what way is the eighth plan going to be different from
the past plans 
We are going to discuss I think the main thrusts of the
eighth five year plan whatever they are and whatever the priority there
may be 
We are going to reflect on the size and the shape and the
structure of the eighth plan 
And finally I suppose the financing aspect where the resources
are going to come uh to meet the needs of the plan 
And while doing this major issues like budget deficits uh
shortage of resources uh shortage of infrastructure and also the
balance of payments questions all these will come up 
May I first ask uh uh Dr Nitish Singh Sen Gupta who is with us
 other then and he is the Secretary of the Planning Commission uh
other then Dr Syed Hashim Raza who is Advisor in Perspective Planning
in the Planning Commission and Dr uh Arvind Veermani uh who is
Advisor in the Ministry of Finance 
Uh it so happens that all of us uh are doctors here you know
and as Alexander Pope once quipped who shall decide when
doctors disagree 
However let me ask uh Dr Nitish Sen Gupta whether he
feel that the planning concept is still relevent today and could we think
of the eighth plan as a a matter relevent to todays time and change
circumstances 
Well at a time when all over the world there is a
general uh debunking of the concept of planning we feel that 
planning is very relevent 
Although it is another thing that any planning has to build on
 the gains reached earlier by the previous plans and also draw on the
development experience of declinations following different 
 it's way slightly different routes 
In our opinion planning is very relevent although it has to 
shed off a lot of the past traditions 
It has to acquire new traditions and new experience
empirical knowledge so as to make it uh so as to acquire a new
meaning 
It is relevent 
What do you think uh Dr Hashim Raza ?
Uh the relevence of planning in our country is to be
seen in the context of two very important and major areas uh
where we need to keep on the developmental phase 
One is the area of human development human resources which
includes the development of taking care of the health by and
large 
Uh taking care of the education building up training 
Uh along with the provision of certain uh items of minimum
needs fulfilling the basic essential needs of the people in
general 
Now this is what public sector will have to take care of
 particularly in a situation where large gaps still exist 
In the need for the services these items public goods and
 uh the provision which already exist 
Another important area where I think planning will be
 remain relevent in our country for quite a long time is the
building up of infrastructure 
This include energy it includes transport infrastructure
communication uh and it also includes infrastructure like
you know certain essential one word variations 
Uh therefore in both of these two though in the later part 
uh uh the eighth plan particularly welcomes the involvement of private sector
wherever possible
For example in energy private sector has been invited to take
part
Ah ha 
But it's par 
participation in the coming next few years will only be at
the margin for private sector has to learn how to come in we've
 to learn 
But hasn't it learnt considerably in the last forty years 
Uh I would like to ask Dr Veermani an in-view of this new
trends towards privatization 
Uh an in-view of the fact that uh the new policies of the
government in this country too uh are talking of deregulations and
decontrol and handing things over considerbly to the private sector
Is there still some need for economic planning ?
Uh yes certainly 
Uh and I would like to add one more area uh which has been
 uh not mention by Dr Hashim and that is the area of micro-management
In some sense uh even countries which don't have uh
planning in the sense that we have used this word uh still have to plan
their micro-economy 
And that is the area which will remain in a sense even after all
these other three uh have passed the way 
Then now let us come to the aspect on this and I would like to
ask Dr Sen Gupta uh in what way is the eighth five year plan
different from uh the past plan ?
Are there any innovations that are peculiar to this plan and
can we talk of it as a different entity compare to the past ?
Eighth plan uh Prof Khushroo is different from the
previous plans in quite a number of ways 
As I said in the beginning it tries to build on the experience
gained earlier 
We are starting against the backdrop of very significant growth
rate of five point five percent throughout the decade of the nineteen
eightees and five point six percent during the seventh plan period
Uhm uhm 
Now so this on the at the same
time because of our inprovidence in the recent past 
 We've been subject to the need for this kind of rather 
uh dramatic process of adjustment in our economy 
 Which is which makes our task somewhat
difficult
Now this plan will seek to ma make
 ta take the maximum gain out of the
investment already made 
It will be a plan for consolidation 
It is time we give up the uh earlier race about necessarily
making a plan bigger than the pa pre previous 
 one in terms of allocation 
It is time we give up accepting let us say five hundreds
schemes when you've got resources to complete uh only about
hundred schemes 
It is time to uh give all attention to completing project some
time
So as to avoid time over run and cost over run 
Again it is also time to give up this earlier uh uhm you know
misplace priority on a number of things you know like for instance we give a
lot of attention to running industry 
Now government has given up uh vacated a large number of areas
in industry hoping that private initiative will take over uhm 
Then secondly uh let us say things like literacy and
population control 
Now sixth and seventh plan we practically gave up population
control
 Uhm 
Uhm uhm 
Now it is now understood that if only if the all
the growth that has taken place in the industry services agriculture if
only we have been able to control our population growth to the rate
achieved by let us say China 
I think how much that el how much difference that alone
would have made in part of the terms 
Uhm
Then secondly so today government will concentrate on
infra-structure as Prof Hashim mentioned mainly transport 
communication agriculture irrigation 
Not so much on industry now except certain basic and heavy
industry whose area also has been drastically reduced 
Uhm uhm 
Then we neglected social development very much 
We give up a any attempt to achieve literacy 
Uhm
Now eighth plan will concentrate on achievement of literacy
and universalization of primary education by the time the plan ends 
And then vocationalizing scondary education 
It will not give enough of direct governmental uh attention
 uhm to higher education etcetera etcetera except to the
extent necessary for upgrading the requirement 
 Uhm 
And there a lot will depend on uh utilizing private
initiative to supplement government efforts 
So many respectable governments role will be the role of
 a facilitator for desirable activities 
And doing tha taking direct
action only in the infra-structure and only in social human
development 
So it appears that uh though there are important areas
which planning will address uh even now 
Uh there are other things which have to be done by other sectors of
the economy 
The private sector also would have something to do with it 
Uh Dr Hashim do you fe feel 
that there are innovations in this plan other than what Dr Sen Gupta has
mention
Uh Prof Khushroo I will suppliment what Dr Nitish Sen
Gupta has said 
By emphasising one aspect of approach to this plan 
in contrast with the earlier plan is that this plan very
prominently relies on the involvement of people for achieving a number of
things
Ah ha 
Which earlier was thought to be achieved just by an outlet
 by financial expenditure
Ah ha 
It is very explicitly recognized in this document that
it is not the financial expenditure that can achieve everything
In fact in course of time expenditure has diminishing
return in terms of its effectiveness in achieving target
Ah
And therefore involvement of people which brings you
to the development of rural institutions ah the proper
institutions uh a phrase which was used in the second five year plan
 I think is becoming much more relevent now developing
institutions adequate to the needs of the people 
And that will be one of the very important I feel 
This plan this plan for the first time talks of indicative
planning
 Ah 
Ah ha 
Infact in India we had a mix 
mixture of indicative planning as well as direct planing of
investment and targets in certain areas of public sector 
Uh our achivements of indicative planing can be seen in the sector
of agriculture 
Uhm
Where the production is done by millions of farmers 
and yet when the sixth food grain target when we decided that we have
to become self-sufficient in food-grain production 
We took a number of steps indirect steps by way of creating
infra-structure by way way of way of a
package of policies including controlling prices and of stocking 
And to which we were able to achieve agricultural target 
Now we will be paying a little more attention to the
instrument and the methods of indicative planning and in large area
widen the area of indicative planning 
So this will be another 
Now uh I notice that we have had a series of plan in
this country 
Every plan has had a huge budget deficit 
Uh there has been a shortage of resources from taxation and
borrowing 
And therefore borrowing from abroad and particularly borrowing
from the Reserve Bank of India has been the order of
the day that has let to all kinds of uh inflationary pressures in the
economy 
And the story of Indian planning generally is a story of inflation
It also is a story of balance of payment deficit partly for
the same reason that the domestic economy has been inflated and
exports were not released from the domestic economy considerably 
Uh Dr Veermani uh would you say that there are some new
things that there is some new thinking or some innovations in the 
in the area of budget deficit management and in the area of balance of
payments management in this plan 
Yeah let me uh uh just give couple of examples where I
think of genuine effort has been made uh to take account of the
resource constraint 
As the popular expression is to cut your coat to to fit
the cloth 
Uh one uh both things have been mentioned by secretary of
planning 
Uh one is the area of social expenditure where uh the focus is
on realistic and achievable targets rather than spreading the money uh
too far and wide and not achieving uh specially ta 
 targets like literacy population control and so on 
And second is in the area of infra-structure where if one may
put it a little strongly uh earlier government may have had a kind of 
uh dog and the manger attitude that uh they said that everything had
to be done by the government and if the gap could not be closed it was
postponed indefinately sometimes for decades 
Uh the attitude now is that if we can not do it uh let us
uh have the private sector do it
So that the goals are achieved 
Uh so this is basically is a reflection for this attempt
 uh to take account of this resource constraints 
Uh I would like to add one kind of word of caution in a sense 
uh because there are still assumptions uh in the plan that public
savings uh the adverse tre trends 
which have marked the the short decade would
in a sense be reversed and the public saving performance would be
improved 
I think that is critical uh to the plan and perhaps later
on we can discuss in what ways that may be achieved 
Thank you very much
Now I would like to come to the area of the main
thrust of the eighth five year plan 
What are the sectors which are being regarded as the priority
sectors ?
What are the areas of achievements which are being uh regarded
as uh thrust areas ?
If you were to order priorities what would be the list of these
your priorities Dr Sen Gupta ?
I will give this priorities but they would not necessarily be
 in terms of one two three and four
Yeah
Now agriculture for instance the idea is to carry the
 Green Revolution from the North of India where
it has been very much uh manifest to those areas parts of the country
where it has not reach reached before 
And secondly to use agriculture to build up exportable surplus
The plan assumes that Indian agriculture has tremendous capacity
and elasticity about uh to create providing a surplus which can
be used to meet the requirement of other parts of the world
And also to keep us a valuable balance of payments support 
Then population I've already elaborated on the
importance
But the idea is that the crude birth rate should be
brought down from thirty point four per thousand till to about twenty
point uh six by the end of the uh seventh five year plan
And the growth rate of population will automatically come down
from uh two point one percent which it is at present to about one point
eight percent 
We still have to go to achieve the rate which China has achieved
And you can see what how China has progressed in terms of economic
development 
Then poverty alleviation in general especially by
concentrating on the rural areas and on the urban property 
 poverty 
And then employment the plan promises to create ten million
jobs a year 
And hoping that uh by that by the end of the century with all
the problems of all the problems of education all that we'll be
able to largely solve the unemployment problem 
Then literacy 
Literacy because that is very important and we propose to uh
achieve full literacy by the end of this century 
By concentrative attention 
Then coming to infra-structure well roads have to be given
importance communication has to be given importance and irrigation
has to be given importance and energy 
But irrigation again there is a kind of idea to switch on from
 the earlier exessive concentration on big project 
Recovering a lo involving a long gestation uh
period and a lot of resources on to medium and smaller size 
irrigation projects which can be applied very sort of operative 
implimentated march more quickly 
So uh and then uh of course irri uh energy of course
is very important because if we cannot uh have proper electricity of
the one word proper mix of hydel and thermal practically all
development will come to a stop 
But there the problem of resources come in
Dr Sen Gupta I I did feel that bringing the the ambition
and the aim of bringing the growth rate of popula no not the growth
rate 
 The the the the fertility rate or the
birth rate of population from thirty per thousand to twenty per thousand
within a five year period is a is a I think a pipe dream really
