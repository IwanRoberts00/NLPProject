We are here to discuss the priorities  of the eighth Five
Year Plan 
""
The other day the national development council met and approved of
the directional paper 
""
Uh which is  eighth plan
""
""
Uh there used to be approach papers  and as
 about the
fifth plan  not the approach to the
fifth plan but the fifth approach to the same plan 
""
Emphasisng the similarity 
""
Now one wonders whether  be different this time
""
And to discuss such issues  talk
about whether the 
and if so  is the eighth plan going to be different from
the past plans 
""
We are going to discuss I think  of the
eighth five year plan  whatever they are and whatever the priority there
may be 
""
We are going to  reflect on the size and the shape and the
structure 
""
And finally I suppose the financing  aspect where the resources
are going to come 
""
And while doing this  uh
shortage of resources  and also the
balance of payments questions 
""
May I first ask  uh uh Dr Nitish Singh Sen Gupta who is with us
 uh
other then Dr  who is Advisor in Perspective Planning
in the Planning Commission  uh who is
Advisor in the Ministry of Finance 
""
Uh it so happens that all of us  uh are doctors here you know
and  who shall decide when
doctors disagree 
""
However  whether he
feel that the planning concept is still relevent today  and could we think
of the eighth plan as a  a matter relevent to todays time and change
circumstances 
""
""
Well at a time when  there is a
general uh 
planning is very relevent 
""
Although it is another thing that  any planning has to build on
 earlier by the previous plans and also draw on the
development experience of 
""
""
In our opinion planning is very relevent although it has to 
shed off 
""
It has to acquire  and new experience
empirical knowledge  so as to acquire a new
meaning 
""
It is relevent 
""
""
What do you think uh  ?
""
""
Uh the relevence of planning in our country  to be
seen  uh
where we need 
""
One is the area of human development  which
includes  by and
large 
""
Uh taking care of the education 
""
Uh along with the provision of certain  minimum
needs  essential needs of the people in
general 
""
Now this is  public sector will have to take care of
""
""
In the need for the  these items public goods and
""
""
Another important area  be
 the
building up of infrastructure 
""
This include  it includes transport infrastructure
communication  infrastructure like
you know certain essential 
""
Uh therefore in both of these two 
uh uh the eighth plan particularly welcomes the involvement of private sector
wherever possible
""
For example in energy  private sector has been invited to take
part
""
""
Ah ha 
""
""
But 
participation  will only be at
the margin  we've
""
""
""
But hasn't it learnt considerably in the last forty years 
""
Uh I would like to ask Dr Veermani  an in-view of this new
trends towards privatization 
""
Uh an in-view of the fact that  uh the new policies of the
government in this country too  uh are talking of deregulations and
decontrol and handing things over  considerbly to the private sector
""
Is there still some need for economic planning  ?
""
""
Uh yes certainly 
""
Uh and I would like to  uh which has been
 and that is the area of micro-management
""
""
In some sense  uh
planning in the sense that we have used this word  uh still have to plan
their micro-economy 
""
And that is the area which will remain in a sense even after all
these other three 
""
""
Then now let us come to the aspect on this and I would like to
ask Dr Sen Gupta  is the eighth five year plan
different from  uh the past plan ?
""
Are there any innovations that are peculiar to this plan  and
can we talk of it as a different entity compare to the past ?
""
""
Eighth plan  is different from the
previous plans in quite a number of ways 
""
As I said in the beginning it tries to build on the experience
gained earlier 
""
We are starting against the backdrop of  very significant growth
rate of five point five percent  throughout the decade of the nineteen
eightees  and five point six percent during the seventh plan period
""
""
Uhm uhm 
""
""
Now so this  same
time because of our inprovidence in the recent past 
""
""
uh dramatic process of adjustment in our economy 
""
 our task somewhat
difficult
""
Now this plan will seek to  make
 the maximum gain out of the
investment already made 
""
It will be a plan for consolidation 
""
It is time we give up the  necessarily
making a plan bigger than the 
""
""
It is time we give up accepting  let us say five hundreds
schemes when  uh only about
hundred schemes 
""
It is time to  uh give all attention to completing project some
time
""
So as to avoid 
""
Again it is also time to give up this earlier  uh uhm you know
misplace priority on a number of things you know like for instance we give a
lot of attention to running industry 
""
Now government has given up  uh vacated a large number of areas
in industry hoping that private initiative will take over 
""
Then secondly uh  and
population control 
""
Now sixth and seventh plan we practically gave up population
control
""
""
""
""
""
Uhm uhm 
""
""
Now  all
the growth that has taken place in the industry services agriculture  if
only we have been able to control our population  rate
achieved by let us say China 
""
I think how much that  how much difference that alone
would have made in part of the terms 
""
""
Uhm
""
""
Then secondly so today government will concentrate on
infra-structure as Prof Hashim mentioned mainly 
communication 
""
Not so much on industry now except certain  basic and heavy
industry whose area also has been drastically reduced 
""
""
Uhm uhm 
""
""
Then we neglected social development very much 
""
We give up a 
""
""
Uhm
""
""
Now eighth plan will concentrate on achievement of literacy
and universalization of primary education by the time the plan ends 
""
And then vocationalizing scondary education 
""
It will not give  uh attention
 except to the
extent necessary for 
""
""
""
""
""
And there  uh utilizing private
initiative to supplement government efforts 
""
So many  governments role will be the role of
""
""
And doing  direct
action  and only in social human
development 
""
""
So it appears that uh  though there are important areas
which planning will address uh 
""
Uh there are other things which have to be done by other sectors of
the economy 
""
The private sector also would have something to do with it 
""
Uh Dr Hashim do you 
that there are innovations in this plan other than what Dr Sen Gupta has
mention
""
""
Uh Prof Khushroo I will  Dr Nitish Sen
Gupta has said 
""
By emphasising one aspect 
in contrast with the  very
prominently relies on the involvement of people for achieving a number of
things
""
""
Ah ha 
""
""
Which earlier was thought to be achieved just by  an outlet
 by financial expenditure
""
""
Ah ha 
""
""
It is very explicitly recognized in this  that
it is not  everything
""
In fact in course of time  diminishing
return  in terms of its effectiveness in achieving target
""
""
Ah
""
""
And therefore  which brings you
to the development of  the proper
institutions  used in the second five year plan
 developing
institutions adequate to the needs of the people 
""
And that will be one of the very important 
""
This plan  this plan for the first time talks of indicative
planning
""
""
""
""
""
Ah ha 
""
""
Infact in India we had 
mixture  of
investment and targets in 
""
Uh our achivements of indicative planing can be seen in the sector
of agriculture 
""
""
Uhm
""
""
Where the production 
and yet  when we decided that we have
to become 
""
We took a number of steps  indirect steps by way of creating
infra-structure  a
package of policies including controlling prices and of stocking 
""
And to which we were able to achieve 
""
Now we will be paying a little more attention  to the
instrument and the methods of  in large area
widen the area of indicative planning 
""
So this will be another 
""
""
Now uh  we have had a series of plan in
this country 
""
Every plan 
""
Uh there has been a shortage of resources from taxation and
borrowing 
""
And therefore borrowing from abroad  and particularly borrowing
from the  has been the order of
the day  that has let to all kinds of uh inflationary pressures in the
economy 
""
And the story of Indian planning generally is a story of inflation
""
""
It also is a story of balance of payment deficit  partly for
the same reason  and
exports were not released from the domestic economy 
""
Uh Dr Veermani  new
things that there is some new thinking 
in the area of budget deficit management  and in the area of balance of
payments management in this plan 
""
""
Yeah let me uh  uh just give couple of examples where I
think of genuine effort  uh to take account of the
resource constraint 
""
As the popular expression is to  to fit
the cloth 
""
Uh  both things have been mentioned by secretary of
planning 
""
Uh one is the area of social expenditure where  uh the focus is
on realistic and achievable targets rather than spreading the money  uh
too far and wide and not achieving 
""
""
And second is in the area of infra-structure  where if one may
put it a little strongly uh 
uh dog and the manger attitude  they said that everything had
to be done by the government  and if the gap could not be closed it was
postponed indefinately 
""
Uh the attitude now is  uh let us
uh have the private sector do it
""
So that the goals are achieved 
""
Uh so this is basically  for this attempt
""
""
Uh I would like to add one kind of word of caution in a sense 
uh because there are still assumptions  that public
savings 
which have marked  would
in a sense be reversed  and the public saving performance would be
improved 
""
I think that is critical  later
on we can discuss 
""
""
Thank you very much
""
Now  the area of the main
thrust of the 
""
What are the sectors which are being regarded as the priority
sectors  ?
""
What are the areas of achievements which are being uh  regarded
as uh thrust areas  ?
""
If you were to order priorities what would be the list of these
your priorities  ?
""
""
I will give this priorities but they would not necessarily be
 in terms of one two three and four
""
""
Yeah
""
""
Now  the
 where
it has been very much uh manifest  to those areas parts of the country
where it has not 
""
And secondly to use agriculture  to build up exportable surplus
""
""
The plan assumes that Indian agriculture has tremendous capacity
and  to create providing a surplus which can
be used to meet the requirement of other parts of the world
""
And also to keep us a valuable balance of payments support 
""
Then population  already elaborated on the
importance
""
But the idea is that the  should be
brought down from  till to about twenty
point uh  uh seventh five year plan
""
And the growth rate of population will automatically come down
from  uh two point one percent which it is at present to about one point
eight percent 
""
We still have to go to achieve the rate which China has achieved
""
And you can see what how China has progressed in terms of economic
development 
""
Then poverty alleviation in general  especially by
concentrating on 
""
""
And then employment  the plan promises to create ten million
jobs a year 
""
And hoping that uh  by that by the end of the century with all
the problems of  be
able to 
""
Then literacy 
""
Literacy because that is very important and we propose to  uh
achieve full literacy by the end of this century 
""
By concentrative attention 
""
Then coming to infra-structure well  roads have to be given
importance  and irrigation
has to be given importance 
""
But irrigation again  there is a kind of idea to switch on from
""
""
Recovering a  uh
period 
irrigation projects which can be applied very 
implimentated 
""
So uh  uh energy of course
is very important because if we cannot uh  proper electricity of
the  practically all
development will come to a stop 
""
But there the problem of resources come in
""
""
Dr Sen Gupta  I I did feel that bringing the the ambition
and the aim of bringing the growth rate of  no not the growth
rate 
""
 fertility rate or the
birth rate of population from thirty per thousand to  twenty per thousand
within a five year period is a
