Hello good evening David 
""
""
Thank you  good evening Ramchandran
""
""
Thank you Prakash  same to you
""
""
Thank you
""
""
So you had been to your place 
""
So 
""
So if any nice experience you had been with there in Tumkur 
""
""
Yes to start with 
O'clock  in Nipani bus
stand for 
""
And it was uh different experience for me  I
reached Belgaum safely 
""
And uh the tragedy started there 
""
And I took a Belgaum and Dharwad bus that is beautiful  new bus
infact 
""
And it took two  thirty minutes to reach Dharwad
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
My God
""
""
And I was the first man to go to driver and to scold him 
because see whether you are a driver or not 
laughter 
""
He was doing in  driving like a lorry no
""
""
Ah ha
""
""
In fact I was the first man to go and ask  see what you are
doing like that
""
""
I think some fat people are there in the bus  he thought
 so instead of
thinking that  a
lorry
""
""
Yes yes
""
""
Now you said that
""
""
No 
""
""
""
I was first person to go and ask  why you are driving
like a lorry 
""
No sir I am new just an unexperienced man  to come
uh try on this 
""
Then just I asked him 
in the night 
""
But he replied sir safety is required 
""
Safety is required  that is for us and not for you
""
""
""
""
 is first than everything
else comes next 
""
You must be facing it but whether it is your place or not
""
""
""
""
""
Yeah yeah
""
""
Did you meet Basavaraj  that in uh Nandita building I mean
 we had one fun
""
""
It was a nice thing about Basavaraj 
""
""
He was there 
""
So he was very lean personality  as if you
dissecting 
flesh 
""
""
""
""
""
He was telling one day to my friends  he had uh applied
for this 
""
""
""
""
""
Two 
""
""
Two 
""
""
How can it be man 
""
He is not even thirty-eight thirty-five kilo
""
""
Only five kilo of flesh is there 
given two 
""
""
 two
hundred 
""
""
 how happened
""
""
And if Dinesh was for two  he was
telling  we had experienced
""
""
And when you were in degree  did you
read any of 
""
""
Of course not 
""
""
Not of course not  fine
""
""
I have read I have read
""
""
You have read
""
""
I have read 
""
""
Actually I have read almost all of his verses
""
I liked it very much you know 
""
So even some of your bright point of your first person as the
techniques second person every point of your techniques he has brought 
""
And uh 
on the doom innocent electrical  your
Harshad Mehta also there
""
He has brought in there 
""
""
Really
""
""
He has expressed very nicely here 
""
""
And in fact when you take up this uh Endamuri 
Veerendranath's  very thoroughly when you are
entering to degree or  some PG courses
""
 PG
courses
""
""
Actually I wanted them to be translated to English 
""
""
Definitely definitely good better and read them  laughter
""
""
""
Actually I don't read Kannada novels
""
""
Is it
""
""
It is
""
""
Then  do you read
""
""
""
""
""
English
""
""
English
""
""
Uh 
""
""
Hardy 
""
""
Hardy you read it as a 
""
""
 read it hardly
""
""
Hardly of 
""
So 
""
""
 the fine thing
""
In fact uh 
because that should have 
""
""
""
""
""
Yes initially
""
""
We can read our own
""
""
It can suggest  to read other
novels English novels particularly
""
That the best point of  if we take up
Endamuri as 
""
That was my point of view  about Endamuri
""
Of course I read others uh Endamuri this one K T Gatti and Satarnas
also but 
""
""
Uh but even in English writers you know I read Jacquelins 
of course though 
""
I read Jacquelins Susan  and some such
other
""
Supposing your 
I've 
""
But not that much general matter is included in their novels 
""
There is some plot the  hero comes and he does something
""
If heroine he goes somewhere and thus they run  the villains
come and it ends there 
""
But uh one of her novels as Jacquelins Susan an American novelist
 Valley of Dogs
""
""
""
""
Uhm uhm
""
""
Ah quite natural idea present my Madam before you  anyway
away 
""
And  that's
""
""
So these three will not come at a time
""
""
Yeah 
""
""
 why my David is different from the David I
reference before Prakash 
""
""
Uh that one should not  come to know what the other said
of 
""
Then the friendship breaks
""
""
Yeah 
""
""
Oh 
""
""
What do you say Mr David
""
""
David has uh many fine experiences in some or other way
""
""
Definitely definitely definitely  from the fair point of
sex 
""
""
You tell something about uh David 
""
""
Yeah
""
""
Yes somewhat you are saying 
""
""
 that one you
know means that I I should be comfortable with his Endamuri Narayana
""
""
No problem 
""
""
No problem any Narayan will do 
""
""
Any Narayan will do for that matter  our Narayan will also
do
""
""
Uhm
""
""
He will give somewhat
""
""
Or Narayan is there is no  he gives different sort of that
altogether
""
""
Yeah
""
""
And some here in never
""
""
No in fact I was adjusting with that since these but I loved
it 
""
""
To survive
""
""
To survive
""
""
To survive
""
""
Survival of the fittest he is testing 
""
""
So this is philosophical touch
""
""
Yes it does we have  and uh Mr David
""
""
""
Tell something about his uh native place 
""
""
Should I
""
""
Ah yes in fact
""
""
Please please
""
""
Good it is a nice place Malnad it is called no
""
""
Yeah 
""
""
We have nice weather 
""
""
I see
""
""
 especially in Shimoga we have
""
""
Ah
""
""
Uh sand mud and all no
""
""
Yeah yeah 
""
""
You know 
have a nice 
""
""
Ah
""
""
Nice  this lands and the
 you can speak well said
""
""
""
""
""
And uh  when we have come to
this PG you no 
""
""
Why that 
some different kinds of things of PG no  when they came she has got so
nice campus and that day first time when I came here to Nipani 
""
Again I  lost first
period 
""
So actually I was even when I
""
""
""
""
""
 the teacher
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
I I heard a lot of things about him 
""
Actually first time we went to Sangli 
""
There one Professor Pardy is there 
""
He called us he 
he told that
""
Now you go to 
""
 Kulkarni
""
""
So 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
They were of course classmate  of course friends uh
colleagues 
""
So we came to tell his name here 
""
But uh we did not meet him
""
He was there was uh  on the he was on leave for some three days
""
""
So and we met Professor S T Naik  and some other uh Naiks
we met 
""
So 
""
""
Some other Naiks
""
""
Yeah Naiks mean uh they have different meaning  laughter
""
""
""
""
""
""
Teachers Professors 
""
""
So we met the  participant first class we
met 
""
Uh he lost that uh first half  he was dealing with the
statement first half 
""
So on the very day we can recognised 
this will be first lecture
""
""
""
""
""
Because in after all the degree in our degree we had only one
good teacher
""
Filomina Philip from Bangalore 
""
Oh yes she was a wonderful lecturer  and was giving you know
""
""
She was so wonderful  I mean
""
""
""
""
""
Uh so wonderful means you cannot explain it  her
knowledge 
""
""
 yeah
""
""
 nice lady with uh
affectionate feelings towards the students  uh she did all
""
""
And moreover  uhm
 as we all get
""
""
""
""
""
Her pronunciation you know  how fast she was pronuncing
""
""
Just like your
""
""
BBC news  she was also uh telling everything in the class
""
""
""
And in fact when I had been to Bangalore  the other day
 I couldn't meet her
""
""
Uhm uhm
""
""
Moreover she was not there and uh  I didn't have any time
to meet her  and I came back to my pavilion
""
""
You know  natural if people go to Bangalore and
they don't meet 
""
""
She was in Bangalore
""
""
Except except those few  those
""
""
The only thing you can't get in Banglore is time  time
""
""
""
Of course you may not get University buses also 
laughter 
""
""
Yes yes
""
""
We have plenty of University buses but you won't get 
""
""
It is there 
""
""
You don't go to city bus only for uh  reaching your place
you know 
""
You will have to go and search for some seats 
""
""
Yes coming back to Arjuna Nagar this thing  what what
""
""
""
Yesterday no 
""
""
About the college 
""
""
About the college right  city college you heard of it
""
""
Oh you  telling uh
yesterday you told that he met uh you
""
""
Ah ah I I met him on the way
""
""
Ah yes  did you meet
him
""
""
I see
""
While going to Belgaum  he was in the bus
""
surprise visit
""
""
 quite surprising
""
""
Yeah there was lot of discussion about this uh  waiting
for Godoth and  even Macbeth
""
""
I see  that is the thing whenever you meet at whatever the
time may be  listen to his
""
""
And this is  this is the relevance of this
""
""
Yes
""
""
Suppose uh this should be there you know 
""
""
Yeah
""
""
If you are dealing with history you should always be kinds of
""
""
""
""
""
""
You should have given them situation with your day to day
life and you should refer to the students 
""
""
Day by day
""
""
So that the relevance will be there 
""
""
There lies the greatness 
""
In fact when he is uh  dealing with the English literature he
covers Sanskrit literature Kannada literature
""
""
Greek literature
""
""
Greek literature everything  British history everything he
covers 
""
It has nothing  why
""
""
As though
""
""
So it was I was unfortunate  because I couldn't hear any
lecture from him
""
""
Ah ah
""
""
Yeah definitely correct
""
""
""
""
Of course he said that he would come  here
""
When he comes here he will inform us  and have a
""
""
Yes yes
""
""
""
""
""
 Tumkur did you read
any  private library
""
""
This time infact I had programme to go
""
In fact I  programme to go Tumkur as such
""
""
Uhm
""
""
It was to go only Hubli  and to Madras
""
""
Ha you wanted to visit many places 
""
""
Yes in fact it naturally once uh
""
""
Oh once uh 
""
""
Yeah yeah
""
""
It has become such that the visiting places is the only
business
""
""
Definitely definitely
