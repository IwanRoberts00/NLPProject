Hello good evening David 
Thank you good evening Ramchandran
Thank you Prakash same to you
Thank you
So you had been to your place 
So you've the nice experience 
So if any nice experience you had been with there in Tumkur 
Yes to start with I left Nipani hostel at three 
O'clock uh and I was waiting for bus in Nipani bus
stand for for an hour 
And it was uh different experience for me and afterwards I
reached Belgaum safely 
And uh the tragedy started there uhn 
And I took a Belgaum and Dharwad bus that is beautiful new bus
infact 
And it took two two hours thirty minutes to reach Dharwad
 Uh 
 Uhn 
My God
And I was the first man to go to driver and to scold him 
because see whether you are a driver or not first of all I asked him 
laughter 
He was doing in driving like a lorry no
Ah ha
In fact I was the first man to go and ask see what you are
doing like that
I think some fat people are there in the bus he thought
 it's a big luggage is there in the bus so so instead of
thinking that it's a bus he must have thought that it's a
lorry
Yes yes
Now you said that
No it was non-stop bus moreover 
 Just just I went and asked him 
I was first person to go and ask why you are driving
like a lorry 
No sir I am new just an unexperienced man I'd to come
uh try on this 
Then just I asked him hey why did you come to uh this one 
in the night and other things I asked 
But he replied sir safety is required 
Safety is required that is for us and not for you
 Laughter 
 Safety safety is first than everything
else comes next yeah 
You must be facing it but whether it is your place or not
 Yeah 
Yeah yeah
Did you meet Basavaraj that in uh Nandita building I mean
 you're when we were in degree na we had one fun
It was a nice thing about Basavaraj 
He was there 
So he was very lean personality laughter as if you
dissecting you'll get only some five to six kilo of 
flesh 
 Flesh 
He was telling one day to my friends he had uh applied
for this LIC LIC for two lakhs 
 LIC 
Two lakhs 
Two lakhs 
How can it be man laughter 
He is not even thirty-eight thirty-five kilo
Only five kilo of flesh is there he's 
given two lakhs 
 Even if we sell it it will around two
hundred rupees laughter 
 That's how happened
And if Dinesh was for two lakhs he was
telling and that was a beautiful joke we had experienced
And when you were in degree na did you
read any of Endumari's novels 
Of course not 
Not of course not fine
I have read I have read
You have read
I have read 
Actually I have read almost all of his verses
I liked it very much you know 
So even some of your bright point of your first person as the
techniques second person every point of your techniques he has brought 
And uh I think recently in one magazines it's uh 
on the doom innocent electrical he brought even that uh who your
Harshad Mehta also there
He has brought in there 
Really
He has expressed very nicely here 
And in fact when you take up this uh Endamuri 
Veerendranath's novels it's very thoroughly when you are
entering to degree or some PG courses
 It's the real thing that we can enjoy in degree or PG
courses
Actually I wanted them to be translated to English 
Definitely definitely good better and read them laughter
Actually I don't read Kannada novels
Is it
It is
Then what what novels do you read
 Then you better read 
English
English
Uh whose novel have you read so far 
Hardy 
Hardy you read it as a laughter 
 You've read hardly you've read it hardly
Hardly of Hardy's novels 
So and uh 
 And uh and that's the fine thing
In fact uh we have to read those things initially 
because that should have 
 First we should read enough uh 
Yes initially
We can read our own
It can suggest it can suggest many ways to read other
novels English novels particularly
That the best point of if you'll if we take up
Endamuri as our model definitely we can grasp enough 
That was my point of view about Endamuri
Of course I read others uh Endamuri this one K T Gatti and Satarnas
also but it's it lacked something 
Uh but even in English writers you know I read Jacquelins 
of course though though they are the best sellers 
I read Jacquelins Susan and Herald Robins and some such
other
Supposing your Laurence Sanxaz such novels 
I've read 
But not that much general matter is included in their novels 
There is some plot the hero comes and he does something
If heroine he goes somewhere and thus they run the villains
come and it ends there 
But uh one of her novels as Jacquelins Susan an American novelist
 I like the novel uh which one that is uh Valley of Dogs
 in which he said one line beautiful line comes 
 we all have different sides that we show to different people 
Uhm uhm
Ah quite natural idea present my Madam before you anyway
away and I show some regards to her in different way 
And uh I've uh my teachers image in me that's
 it uh they all play the different one 
So these three will not come at a time
Yeah 
 That's why my David is different from the David I
reference before Prakash 
Uh that one should not come to know what the other said
of is my said is enough 
Then the friendship breaks
Yeah 
Oh that's what I think what do you say 
What do you say Mr David
David has uh many fine experiences in some or other way
Definitely definitely definitely from the fair point of
sex 
You tell something about uh David 
Yeah
Yes somewhat you are saying 
 You need you need that one you
know means that I I should be comfortable with his Endamuri Narayana
No problem laughter 
No problem any Narayan will do 
Any Narayan will do for that matter our Narayan will also
do
Uhm
He will give somewhat
Or Narayan is there is no he gives different sort of that
altogether
Yeah
And some here in never
No in fact I was adjusting with that since these but I loved
it 
To survive
To survive
To survive
Survival of the fittest he is testing 
So this is philosophical touch
Yes it does we have we have told and uh Mr David
 is going to 
Tell something about his uh native place 
Should I
Ah yes in fact
Please please
Good it is a nice place Malnad it is called no
Yeah 
We have nice weather 
I see
 Es especially in Shimoga we have
Ah
Uh sand mud and all no
Yeah yeah 
You know you you go out uh for walk you'll 
have a nice uh what 
Ah
Nice it's got uh fragrance of this lands and the
 yeah yeah you can speak well said
 Yeah yeah 
And uh so in fact when we have when we have come to
this PG you no we had altogether different type of experiences here 
Why that I'll be expecting so I think some said 
some different kinds of things of PG no when they came she has got so
nice campus and that day first time when I came here to Nipani 
Again I lost first period we together lost first
period of our uh first teacher 
So actually I was even when I
 Yeah yeah 
 What's the teacher
 A few words 
 A few words 
I I heard a lot of things about him 
Actually first time we went to Sangli 
There one Professor Pardy is there 
He called us he of course he would give seat afterwards uh 
he told that
Now you go to uh Sangli 
 Arjunnagar there C T Patil Kulkarni
 Professor is there you tell him my name to him 
So influence 
 Arjunnagar 
 Kulkarni 
 Influence 
 It's not influence because he just he guided 
They were of course classmate of course friends uh
colleagues 
So we came to tell his name here 
But uh we did not meet him
He was there was uh on the he was on leave for some three days
So and we met Professor S T Naik and some other uh Naiks
we met 
So laughter 
Some other Naiks
Yeah Naiks mean uh they have different meaning laughter
 Theek hai 
Teachers Professors 
So we met the one word participant first class we
met first period he met 
Uh he lost that uh first half he was dealing with the
statement first half seond half we met 
So on the very day we can recognised definitely 
this will be first lecture
 Definitely 
Because in after all the degree in our degree we had only one
good teacher
Filomina Philip from Bangalore 
Oh yes she was a wonderful lecturer and was giving you know
She was so wonderful uhm I mean
 Uhm 
Uh so wonderful means you cannot explain it her
knowledge 
 Ah ha yeah yeah yeah
 Such a such a nice lady with uh
affectionate feelings towards the students uh she did all
And moreover she's being a Christian uhm
 as we all get
 Uhm 
Her pronunciation you know how fast she was pronuncing
Just like your
BBC news she was also uh telling everything in the class
And in fact when I had been to Bangalore the other day
 I couldn't meet her
Uhm uhm
Moreover she was not there and uh I didn't have any time
to meet her and I came back to my pavilion
You know it's natural if people go to Bangalore and
they don't meet laughter 
She was in Bangalore
Except except those few those
The only thing you can't get in Banglore is time time
 and and of course you can have money also 
Of course you may not get University buses also 
laughter 
Yes yes
We have plenty of University buses but you won't get 
It is there it is there 
You don't go to city bus only for uh reaching your place
you know laughter 
You will have to go and search for some seats to sit on it 
Yes coming back to Arjuna Nagar this thing what what
 what we were discussing 
Yesterday no 
About the college 
About the college right city college you heard of it
Oh you was were telling uh
yesterday you told that he met uh you
Ah ah I I met him on the way
Ah yes where where did you meet
him
I see
While going to Belgaum he was in the bus
surprise visit
 That's quite surprising
Yeah there was lot of discussion about this uh waiting
for Godoth and even Macbeth
I see that is the thing whenever you meet at whatever the
time may be you'll listen to his
And this is this is the relevance of this
Yes
Suppose uh this should be there you know 
Yeah
If you are dealing with history you should always be kinds of
 the stretch 
 Know about history 
You should have given them situation with your day to day
life and you should refer to the students 
Day by day
So that the relevance will be there 
There lies the greatness 
In fact when he is uh dealing with the English literature he
covers Sanskrit literature Kannada literature
Greek literature
Greek literature everything British history everything he
covers 
It has nothing in fact and that's why
As though
So it was I was unfortunate because I couldn't hear any
lecture from him
Ah ah
Yeah definitely correct
 That's why we decided uhm to him 
Of course he said that he would come here
When he comes here he will inform us and have a
Yes yes
 Live discussion on 
 And then you went to Tumkur did you read
any this uh did you go to our uh library private library
This time infact I had programme to go
In fact I it was not in my programme to go Tumkur as such
Uhm
It was to go only Hubli and to Madras
Ha you wanted to visit many places 
Yes in fact it naturally once uh
Oh once uh laughter a few words 
Yeah yeah
It has become such that the visiting places is the only
business
Definitely definitely
