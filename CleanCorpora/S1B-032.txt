Good evening and welcome back to the Election Analysis
Programme
""
This will be the last programme this evening
""
And our last programme to  wind up will be tommorrow
night at the same time nine fifty
""
Senior members of the congress parliamentary party have had just
emerged actually from an informal meeting
""
And  be going to the congress party head quarters to
try and find out what exactly happened in those  rooms
""
But first the  at
ten  tonight
""
Congress-I and allies are hurrying towards two hundred and
thirty-five
""
Still twenty-five to thirty short of a majority 
""
The BJP plus its allies are set forward for one-twenty 
""
In Andhra Pradesh the Congress-I is literally swamping  the June
vote 
""
In the May vote we saw the Telugu Desam  Desam doing well
""
But in June 
""
H K L Bhagat is defeated 
""
""
 Is karyakram ke mukhya samachar is prakar hain
Congress-I wa uske sahyogi dal  do sau paintees seetein jeetne ki oor
""
Bhartiya Janata  ek sau
bees seetein pane ki ummeed 
""
Andhra Pradesh mei  ke matdan mei Congress
bahut aage  chunau
jeete  Prannoy
""
""
Well Vinod  go straight into the latest results
position
""
This is final 
and we have results now on three hundred and fifty-five or five hundred and
eleven seats 
""
The Congress-I one seventy-nine out of three fifty-five 
""
The BJP coming second on its own with eighty-one 
""
The Janata Dal twenty-nine still 
""
CPM nineteen 
""
The AIADMK eleven 
""
But Telugu Desam still part of the National Front with ten 
""
The  CPI five
""
""
The BSP is fighting on its own with one seat now 
""
RSP part of the National Front  thirty-six
""
""
 look at the leading position
""
These are the trends
""
This includes results
""
This is both leading and those results  just seen
because we get the overall picture here 
""
So we got information now on four hundred and eighty-six out of
five hundred and eleven seats 
""
And the Congress is leading now in two hundred and twenty 
""
 picked up uh three or four seats in U P at the
movement 
""
But doesn't seems to be going much further 
""
BJP is coming second with hundred and seven 
""
The Janata Dal fifty-five on its own 
""
The CPM twenty-nine 
""
The Telugu Desam thirteen
""
These are all part of the  National Front
""
Janata 
""
Others sifty-two 
""
CPI eleven 
""
AIADMK eleven 
""
The JMM six 
""
RSP three 
""
Bahujan Samaj Party one 
""
Making a total of others 
""
Now this projects into the tenth 
something like this 
""
Congress plus all its allies put together somewhere around two
thirty-five
""
Take 
""
The Left Front looks as though  heading towards fifty
""
""
And the National Front eighty-five
""
So together  they form a nice little chunk of a hundred and
thirty-five seats
""
Likely to form this is prediction 
""
 ahead actually of the BJP and its allies which is
basically the Shivsena  which is now heading towards about a hundred and
twenty 
""
And other minor parties are about twenty-one 
""
So  that we expect to see
inside the next tenth  Vinod
""
""
 Dr Muralimanohar Joshi of
Bharatiya Janta Party  Shri
Harkishan Singh Surjeet of Communist Party Marxist  and Shri N K P Salve
of Congress-I Prannoy 
""
""
Mr Salve let me start with you 
""
What do you expect the President to do next  ?
""
""
Uh well what I expect President to do next  is what he did
the last time 
""
Perhaps  party which is the highest number of
members in 
""
""
""
""
Call for the leader of the party
""
""
Good  call for the leader of the party
""
""
And who is that going to be ?
""
""
Uh well 
""
There is no dearth of talents in our party
""
And the Congress parliamentary party is going to decide upon a
leader  how delicate is the task
ahead of us 
""
He will be a strong
""
""
Not dearth of talent  are you talk heavy with leaders in
fact
""
""
No in fact  balanced on all ends
""
Which is not top  top at the bottom
""
""
But the question is we realize the responsiblity
""
We have very delicate responsibility 
""
We own this responsibility 
""
And  minority government
""
""
And a durable government  can not be run only on experience and
gimmicks
""
""
Yes 
""
Where are you going to get the critical thirty seats from  in
order to form a government  ?
""
""
No as I said  I'm
 expecting at this juncture
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Where am I going to get thirty seats  is precisely from
where Mr Joshijee might be expecting some other seats to come 
""
I don't have any other source 
""
Other are the source which all four parties of all the four had
""
But 
leader of a party with the largest number of uh  I do take it
that even if your projections are correct  perhaps the Congress Party will
be the first one to be called 
""
""
Uh Mr Surjeet from your experience in 
these  matters how long I mean the country is waiting now for things
to settle down ?
""
 been a long campaign
""
""
""
They want a bit of uh uh  certainty on the political front
""
How long do you think this whole thing will take to settle down to
some kind of  ?
""
""
It should not take much time  because now situation is
pretty bad in the country 
""
It requires a government 
""
There is no government at the moment 
""
And Salveji has rightly stated  President has no other option
but to call the 
party in the Parliament 
""
And then  see that uh they take the responsibility
""
""
So 
""
""
""
""
""
Week is too much  it too
long
""
""
""
""
""
Because the situation is critical in the country
""
Now  mentioned about Punjab
problem
""
What is happening inspite of the efforts of all the political
parties they are going 
cough 
""
So many other problems are there
""
Situations is very complicated 
""
""
Please carry on
""
""
I want to ask Mr Bommai  you can actually
authoritatively state as being the President of the Janata Dal  the
official position of the Janata Dal towards a coalition  with the
congress-I ?
""
Because they are looking for those thirty seats  and you are
going to have them 
""
""
Now firstly 
""
And  sit in the opposition
""
""
And we will be  playing a role of the constructive opposition
""
""
So far 
it is for the Congress
""
Whether they want to have coalition whether they want to remain
minority government 
""
All those things have to 
""
And if there is any indication  the National Front and the Left
""
""
""
Are you open to the idea of a coalition government of
Congress  ?
""
""
No  open to that
""
But  we will give it a go to the
situation
""
 too early to answer it
unless 
""
""
""
""
""
 not ruling it out
""
""
No no it comes when 
""
Because the country is passing 
""
Not financial 
""
And 
""
And that government 
""
The  very
difficult to answer because  we oppose
""
""
And if  is agreeable to those
solutions 
""
""
Other than the common issues Joshijee on which your party can
extend critical suport  ?
""
""
Uh I don't think so 
""
Uh we would be sitting in opposition 
""
Uh there is no reason 
""
So
""
""
I think Vinod said issues  particular issues
""
""
Well you see that whenever there are issues uh 
infringing  or there is a
calamity of an unprecedented magnitude
""
Then certainly we extend co-operation  and support to the
government 
""
But as of uh  normal implementation of
programmes and policy  well certainly I don't find that there is any
reason or occassion 
""
But for all measures of uh  I mean
certainly agreed to political parties
""
""
I think 
yeah  Murlidhar is waiting
""
""
""
""
""
Murlidhar is waiting over there 
""
""
The former Chief Minister of Maharashtra  who has been
declared winner from Colaba constituency 
""
Mr Antulay 
attempting to overthrow Mr Pawar 
""
What made you 
""
""
Well I believe  that this assumption unfortunately is not
very correct 
""
See there could be internal differences  in any democratic
set-up 
""
Which of course our party claims to 
""
But when it comes to a national  all
the local differences  gets
under 
""
""
What positive sense of insecurity that made you  uh mend
fences with Mr Pawar  ?
""
""
What 
""
""
Because you had the patron of Mr Rajeev Gandhi 
""
Now the scenario is different 
""
""
You mean to say that Mr Pawar didn't have the patronage of Mr
Rajeev Gandhi 
""
I believe everybody has patronage 
""
He was our leader 
""
We all accepted him as our leader 
""
The question of patronage  if you
choose to use it  is not is rather inappropriate
""
But if you want to choose it 
""
But then everybody has his patronage including Mr Pawar 
""
So there is no question of Antulay having patronage  and not
Pawar 
""
""
Did Mr  uh really help
you  ?
""
""
Well  campaigning did help dispell
 suspicions created by the BJP candidate who was my main rival
""
""
And Mr  and campaign and
canvassing was necessary 
""
I mean to that effect
""
And I think  uh
endevour 
""
""
Would  Pawar's
 ?
""
""
No I don't think I would have lost 
""
That nobody even Mr Pawar also doesn't think that  I would have
lost 
""
Even Mr
""
Pawar won't say 
""
In fact uh  dispell the doubts
created  uh against our own Chief
Minister 
""
Because Mr Pawar is a Congress-I Chief Minister  it's
""
""
""
Thank you very much Mr uh  running
short of time
""
""
Thank you very much
""
""
On that note this is H V Muralidhara returning you to Bombay
""
""
""
Thank you very much Murali 
""
At the moment uh  this is the first time actually Vinod thanks
to  net-work that we using which is
the planning commissioned uh 
""
That we have been able to actually 
garner  some information of votes all across the country
""
Normaly this takes uh  the election commission and other
sources 
""
So we we were very luky unto night we can actually review  the
situation today the about the votes of the different parties  uh across
the country
""
 look at the all India vote share of all the
different parties 
""
Now this is based so far on four hundred and fifty one lead 
and the vote position is as follows 
""
Thirty-six percent for the Congress-I
""
""
""
The BJP 
""
""
The Janata Dal twelve on its own 
""
The CPM six  and others which is the conglamuration of parties
 twenty-three
""
Now if we compare this with nineteen eighty-nine and look at the
vote change of swing in vote the Congress as I said was down two percent 
""
The BJP the biggest gainer almost doubling its vote to ten percent
""
""
The Janata Dal suffering quite a set back now really in three
states 
""
CPM about up point five to one percent  and others down four
percent
