Good evening and welcome back to the Election Analysis
""
""
This will be the last programme this evening
""
And our last programme to  wind up will be tommorrow
""
""
Senior members of the congress parliamentary party have had just
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
But in June 
""
H K L Bhagat is defeated 
""
""
 Is karyakram ke mukhya samachar is prakar hain
""
""
Bhartiya Janata  ek sau
""
""
Andhra Pradesh mei  ke matdan mei Congress
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
and we have results now on three hundred and fifty-five or five hundred and
""
""
""
""
The BJP coming second on its own with eighty-one 
""
""
""
CPM nineteen 
""
The AIADMK eleven 
""
But Telugu Desam still part of the National Front with ten 
""
""
""
""
""
""
RSP part of the National Front  thirty-six
""
""
""
""
These are the trends
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
 picked up uh three or four seats in U P at the
movement 
""
But doesn't seems to be going much further 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
AIADMK eleven 
""
The JMM six 
""
RSP three 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
So together  they form a nice little chunk of a hundred and
""
""
""
""
""
basically the Shivsena  which is now heading towards about a hundred and
""
""
""
""
""
inside the next tenth  Vinod
""
""
 Dr Muralimanohar Joshi of
""
Harkishan Singh Surjeet of Communist Party Marxist  and Shri N K P Salve
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
members in 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
And the Congress parliamentary party is going to decide upon a
""
ahead of us 
""
""
""
""
Not dearth of talent  are you talk heavy with leaders in
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
But the question is we realize the responsiblity
""
""
""
""
""
And  minority government
""
""
""
""
""
""
Yes 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Other are the source which all four parties of all the four had
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Uh Mr Surjeet from your experience in 
these  matters how long I mean the country is waiting now for things
to settle down ?
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
some kind of  ?
""
""
""
""
""
It requires a government 
""
There is no government at the moment 
""
And Salveji has rightly stated  President has no other option
but to call the 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
long
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Now  mentioned about Punjab
""
""
""
parties they are going 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Please carry on
""
""
I want to ask Mr Bommai  you can actually
""
official position of the Janata Dal towards a coalition  with the
""
""
Because they are looking for those thirty seats  and you are
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
And we will be  playing a role of the constructive opposition
""
""
""
it is for the Congress
""
""
minority government 
""
""
""
And if there is any indication  the National Front and the Left
""
""
""
Are you open to the idea of a coalition government of
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
 not ruling it out
""
""
No no it comes when 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
difficult to answer because  we oppose
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
extend critical suport  ?
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
I think Vinod said issues  particular issues
""
""
""
infringing  or there is a
calamity of an unprecedented magnitude
""
Then certainly we extend co-operation  and support to the
government 
""
""
programmes and policy  well certainly I don't find that there is any
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
yeah  Murlidhar is waiting
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
declared winner from Colaba constituency 
""
Mr Antulay 
""
""
""
""
""
Well I believe  that this assumption unfortunately is not
""
""
See there could be internal differences  in any democratic
""
""
""
""
But when it comes to a national  all
""
under 
""
""
What positive sense of insecurity that made you  uh mend
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
I believe everybody has patronage 
""
""
""
""
""
The question of patronage  if you
""
""
But if you want to choose it 
""
But then everybody has his patronage including Mr Pawar 
""
""
""
""
""
""
you  ?
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
canvassing was necessary 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
 ?
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Even Mr
""
Pawar won't say 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Thank you very much Mr uh  running
short of time
""
""
""
""
""
On that note this is H V Muralidhara returning you to Bombay
""
""
""
""
""
""

""
""
That we have been able to actually 
""
""
Normaly this takes uh  the election commission and other
""
""
So we we were very luky unto night we can actually review  the
""
the country
""
""
""
""
