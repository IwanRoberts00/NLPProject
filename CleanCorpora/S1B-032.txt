Good evening and welcome back to the Election Analysis
Programme
This will be the last programme this evening
And our last programme to re wind up will be tommorrow
night at the same time nine fifty
Senior members of the congress parliamentary party have had just
emerged actually from an informal meeting
And we'll be going to the congress party head quarters to
try and find out what exactly happened in those folk filled rooms
But first the head lights head lines at
ten O'clock tonight
Congress-I and allies are hurrying towards two hundred and
thirty-five
Still twenty-five to thirty short of a majority 
The BJP plus its allies are set forward for one-twenty 
In Andhra Pradesh the Congress-I is literally swamping the June
vote 
In the May vote we saw the Telugu Desam Desam doing well
But in June the Congress-I is literally sweeping 
H K L Bhagat is defeated and George Farnandis win 
 Is karyakram ke mukhya samachar is prakar hain
Congress-I wa uske sahyogi dal do sau paintees seetein jeetne ki oor
Bhartiya Janata Party aur Shivsena ko ek sau
bees seetein pane ki ummeed 
Andhra Pradesh mei June ke matdan mei Congress
bahut aage H K L Bhagat chunau hare aur George Fernandis chunau
jeete Prannoy
Well Vinod let's go straight into the latest results
position
This is final MP's in the next Lok Sabha 
and we have results now on three hundred and fifty-five or five hundred and
eleven seats 
The Congress-I one seventy-nine out of three fifty-five 
The BJP coming second on its own with eighty-one 
The Janata Dal twenty-nine still 
CPM nineteen 
The AIADMK eleven and others thirty-six 
But Telugu Desam still part of the National Front with ten 
The Ja JMM five CPI five
 all part of the National Front 
The BSP is fighting on its own with one seat now 
RSP part of the National Front and uh totalling thirty-six
 Let's look at the leading position
These are the trends
This includes results
This is both leading and those results we've just seen
because we get the overall picture here 
So we got information now on four hundred and eighty-six out of
five hundred and eleven seats 
And the Congress is leading now in two hundred and twenty 
 It's picked up uh three or four seats in U P at the
movement 
But doesn't seems to be going much further 
BJP is coming second with hundred and seven 
The Janata Dal fifty-five on its own 
The CPM twenty-nine 
The Telugu Desam thirteen
These are all part of the Nat National Front
Janata uh National and Left Front combined 
Others sifty-two 
CPI eleven 
AIADMK eleven 
The JMM six 
RSP three 
Bahujan Samaj Party one 
Making a total of others sixty-two 
Now this projects into the tenth Lok Sabha 
something like this 
Congress plus all its allies put together somewhere around two
thirty-five
Take uhm uh plus or minus two three seats 
The Left Front looks as though it's heading towards fifty
And the National Front eighty-five
So together they form a nice little chunk of a hundred and
thirty-five seats
Likely to form this is prediction 
 That's ahead actually of the BJP and its allies which is
basically the Shivsena which is now heading towards about a hundred and
twenty 
And other minor parties are about twenty-one 
So that's the kind of look that we expect to see
inside the next tenth Lok Sabha Vinod
 We've in our studios Dr Muralimanohar Joshi of
Bharatiya Janta Party Shri S R Bommai of Janata Dal Shri
Harkishan Singh Surjeet of Communist Party Marxist and Shri N K P Salve
of Congress-I Prannoy 
Mr Salve let me start with you 
What do you expect the President to do next ?
Uh well what I expect President to do next is what he did
the last time 
Perhaps call for the party which is the highest number of
members in Lok Sabha 
 That's the only alternative for him 
Call for the leader of the party
Good call for the leader of the party
And who is that going to be ?
Uh well 
There is no dearth of talents in our party
And the Congress parliamentary party is going to decide upon a
leader who knows how honour ourselve how delicate is the task
ahead of us 
He will be a strong
Not dearth of talent are you talk heavy with leaders in
fact
No in fact we are reasonably balanced on all ends
Which is not top uh heavy nor is it uh top at the bottom
But the question is we realize the responsiblity
We have very delicate responsibility 
We own this responsibility 
And we'll if we do have to form minority government
 then we do know that we have to form a durable government 
And a durable government can not be run only on experience and
gimmicks
Yes 
Where are you going to get the critical thirty seats from in
order to form a government ?
No as I said it's the minority government I'm
 expecting at this juncture
 If your prediction are correct 
 A few words 
Where am I going to get thirty seats is precisely from
where Mr Joshijee might be expecting some other seats to come 
I don't have any other source 
Other are the source which all four parties of all the four had
But when I say the President would be sending for the 
leader of a party with the largest number of uh members I do take it
that even if your projections are correct perhaps the Congress Party will
be the first one to be called 
Uh Mr Surjeet from your experience in this 
these matters how long I mean the country is waiting now for things
to settle down ?
 It's been a long campaign
 It's been uh people are pretty tired 
They want a bit of uh uh certainty on the political front
How long do you think this whole thing will take to settle down to
some kind of uh stability ?
It should not take much time because now situation is
pretty bad in the country 
It requires a government 
There is no government at the moment 
And Salveji has rightly stated President has no other option
but to call the leader of the biggest largest 
party in the Parliament 
And then see that uh they take the responsibility
So you're talking about a week or three days or 
 one or two word 
 No no not a week 
Week is too much too long that's it too
long
 Too long 
Because the situation is critical in the country
Now you've we've mentioned about Punjab
problem
What is happening inspite of the efforts of all the political
parties they are going cough ahead of the one word 
cough and all that 
So many other problems are there
Situations is very complicated 
Please carry on
I want to ask Mr Bommai what is uh you can actually
authoritatively state as being the President of the Janata Dal the
official position of the Janata Dal towards a coalition with the
congress-I ?
Because they are looking for those thirty seats and you are
going to have them 
Now firstly we respect the verdict of the people 
And they've asked us to sit in the opposition
And we will be playing a role of the constructive opposition
So far talk of coalition is prematured in mind unless 
it is for the Congress-I to decide what they've 
Whether they want to have coalition whether they want to remain
minority government 
All those things have to be indicated by Congress 
And if there is any indication the National Front and the Left
 combined we'll sit together and take a view on that 
Are you open to the idea of a coalition government of
Congress ?
No I'm not uh open to that
But if the situation demands we will give it a go to the
situation
 It'll in my view uh too early to answer it
unless that they move 
 You're not ruling it out 
 You're not ruling it out
No no it comes when you know the whole thing 
Because the country is passing to a very serious crisis 
Not financial law and order all things are there 
And there should be a government 
And that government should be able to give solutions 
The when you talk of coalition it's very
difficult to answer because there are issues on which we oppose
And if the party which proposes is agreeable to those
solutions 
Other than the common issues Joshijee on which your party can
extend critical suport or constructive support to Congress-I ?
Uh I don't think so 
Uh we would be sitting in opposition 
Uh there is no reason and no occasion 
So
I think Vinod said issues particular issues
Well you see that whenever there are issues uh 
infringing upon national security say there is a war or there is a
calamity of an unprecedented magnitude
Then certainly we extend co-operation and support to the
government 
But as of uh in day-to-day normal implementation of
programmes and policy well certainly I don't find that there is any
reason or occassion to extend any support 
But for all measures of uh national welfare I mean
certainly agreed to political parties
I think we'll quickly go first to Bombay 
yeah Murlidhar is waiting
 Yeah 
Murlidhar is waiting over there 
The former Chief Minister of Maharashtra who has been
declared winner from Colaba constituency 
Mr Antulay you were one of the leading president 
attempting to overthrow Mr Pawar 
What made you suddenly uh one word 
Well I believe that this assumption unfortunately is not
very correct 
See there could be internal differences in any democratic
set-up 
Which of course our party claims to have have 
But when it comes to a national disaster or calamity all
the local differences even national differences within the party gets
under 
What positive sense of insecurity that made you uh mend
fences with Mr Pawar ?
What what exactly do you mean by sense of insecurity 
Because you had the patron of Mr Rajeev Gandhi 
Now the scenario is different 
You mean to say that Mr Pawar didn't have the patronage of Mr
Rajeev Gandhi 
I believe everybody has patronage 
He was our leader 
We all accepted him as our leader 
The question of patronage if you use that word if you
choose to use it is not is rather inappropriate
But if you want to choose it you are welcome to do so 
But then everybody has his patronage including Mr Pawar 
So there is no question of Antulay having patronage and not
Pawar 
Did Mr Pawar's campaigning uh really help
you ?
Well Mr Pawar's campaigning did help dispell
 the suspicions created by the BJP candidate who was my main rival
 that he has the support of the Chief Minister which was not true 
And Mr Pawar's presence there and campaign and
canvassing was necessary 
I mean to that effect
And I think uh we succeeded I mean in that uh
endevour 
Would you've lost had it not been for Mr Pawar's
 campaigning ?
No I don't think I would have lost 
That nobody even Mr Pawar also doesn't think that I would have
lost 
Even Mr
Pawar won't say 
In fact uh it was as I said only to dispell the doubts
created in the minds of the people by uh against our own Chief
Minister 
Because Mr Pawar is a Congress-I Chief Minister and it's
 my duty as congress man to see that he one or two words 
Thank you very much Mr uh Antulay we're running
short of time
Thank you very much
On that note this is H V Muralidhara returning you to Bombay
 Delhi 
Thank you very much Murali 
At the moment uh this is the first time actually Vinod thanks
to one word net this computer uh net-work that we using which is
the planning commissioned uh infra-structure 
That we have been able to actually ga 
garner some information of votes all across the country
Normaly this takes uh the election commission and other
sources at least week or ten days to sort out 
So we we were very luky unto night we can actually review the
situation today the about the votes of the different parties uh across
the country
 Let's look at the all India vote share of all the
different parties 
Now this is based so far on four hundred and fifty one lead 
and the vote position is as follows 
Thirty-six percent for the Congress-I
 That's down to about two percent since last time 
The BJP thirty-three percent coming seco 
 second doing extremely well 
The Janata Dal twelve on its own 
The CPM six and others which is the conglamuration of parties
 twenty-three
Now if we compare this with nineteen eighty-nine and look at the
vote change of swing in vote the Congress as I said was down two percent 
The BJP the biggest gainer almost doubling its vote to ten percent
The Janata Dal suffering quite a set back now really in three
states down by five percent 
CPM about up point five to one percent and others down four
percent
