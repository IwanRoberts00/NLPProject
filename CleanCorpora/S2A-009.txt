Hello and welcome to the highlights of the fourth One Day
International between India and the West Indies 
India were leading two one before the match at the
Barabati stadium Cuttuck 
The West Indies desperately needing to win here to level
off the series at two all and to make it a real live affair for
the fifth One Day International at Jaipur which follows
on Friday 
The West Indies made one change beside that it lost at Vizag 
they dropped Barrington Browne and preferred to strengthen their batting 
bringing in Shivnarine Chanderpaul 
India had to drop Navjot Siddhu who was injured and brought in
Atul Bedade but surprisingly they brought back Chetan Sharma in
place of Venkatesh Prasad 
It was a cloudy morning when Courtney Walsh the West Indian
captain won the toss and elected to bat 
We pick up the play of the very first ball of the morning 
 It's Manoj Prabhakar bowling to Phil Simmons 
 In Hindi 
West it's fascinating structure there 
People standing on the balconies 
Looking end of the side screen like the centre piece of
pavilion 
 That's gone away for four runs 
Simmons aiming it well 
Striking it at off the space just behind square 
That was favourite cut of Simmons 
A cut short centre wide there is two ways of cutting one
with the horizontal bat and one with perpendicular that was the 
perpendicular way of playing the square cut 
 It's straight away to Azharuddin there in the gully
That was an exotic catch Phil went into the trap and it went
straight away to Azhar
Quite difficult to tell really 
Simmons got back really and hit it very hard 
Here I had seen that was a catch
Indeed Azharuddin a very agile normally was
amongst 
That end up very very powerful over
Azharuddin had had to go to his right 
This is a good start by the West Indies because uh there
was a quite a bit of moment early on uh in this wicket and uh 
the two of them have counted that very well 
Great shot there by Simmons like he go for runs 
four runs square cut 
That really is a trademark shot of uh Simmons uh shot
 a little bit of width being a tall man standing up here 
That balls are by Chetan giving Williams all those to play his
shot back foot cover drive
Four runs 
Williams particularly is very good at shot 
Well he gave that a fair old whack uh that Steuart
Williams a ball to be head short and on a wicket of this nature
now with the uh ball not coming on to the bat that's a free
hand for the batsman specially the West Indian batsman with such good
backfoot there 
There he's given it a fair old thump 
Could be out 
Yes he is 
Good catch by Manoj 
 That's a generous really happy and very good well
judged that catch by Manoj there
Running back a little bit 
And there William's gone 
First wicket for India and to Chetan Sharma 
Williams not getting on top of that short ball I think he was
beaten a little bit by pace here and uh hurried on to him and uh 
ball coming a lot quicker then he expected and getting the top edge and Manoj
Prabhakar here running around taking a good catch 
That will do Chetan Sharma as a morale world of good 
Caught Prabhakar bowled Sharma for fifteen 
 That's more of a desperate shot stepping out 
Uh but well played outside a square drive stepping out
 That's a very good shot to play 
Four runs there 
 In Hindi 
In the air but it's safe 
Lara not trying to bow but he've still soon then
But he's gone off fast on it for that to go away 
for four runs 
Sharma now to Hooper 
Jadeja was giving his side he is out 
What a brilliant throw and uh a very well field 
Hooper does is out
What a marvellous piece of cricket from Jadeja but careless by
Hooper who was very one word to walk about like that 
Certainly very very careless and another wicket of West Indies
could not afford to lose particular Hooper being run out
Hooper has been playing so well 
And that is uh uh uh for a big support for the West Indies
team uhm Hooper there playing the ball uh to a shot mid-wicket
 just taken off and Jadeja coming in and pick the ball up and a
lovely throw hit the wicket on time 
Seventy-seven for three 
 It's straight 
 It's another good short there by Lara 
Shrinath is the fielder
Coming back for the second and it was fast throw but
 not out says the umpire 
But this Indian team so certainly hit in the stumps from all
over the field 
Uh again that could have been pretty close if Lara played it to
mid-wicket and and Shrinath run run they have taken up and a
lovely throw in 
See there Lara is in there just in time 
Once again he has to chase the run he won't get that 
It was played very fine by Lara 
Late and fine and nicely controlled 
In the air and a big appeal 
No says the umpire Mr Jose Kurushinkal that came off the pad 
so 
Have a look at that one again 
Another particularly good shot and up and uh very
good decision 
Well that's the edge it's four runs 
All is fair in love and war as they say 
The end of the over 
Twenty-four overs and it's ninety-nine for three 
 applaud and whistles 
So Lara well he is beginning to make a significant score even
though he work on the score is many of his runs made one word 
like that 
And another fielder at the other end 
 It's one word to time again the counter term
with the mis field by Anil Kumble 
Well he did that well for four
It was a lovely shot moving freely into the half volly 
Kumble now to Lara 
Well that was delicately played 
And that is gone away for four runs 
Just about as fine as you could get it 
Kumble now to Arthurton 
And that runs for Arthurton to fine leg it could well go for four
there 
It does 
So a productive over for the West Indies
Twenty-five overs have gone it's a hundred and
thirteen for three 
And that's beautifully played by Lara wide across at
short fine leg 
Four more 
Runs certainly coming in 
Very good running between the wicket 
Excellent 
 In Hindi 
 That's a lovely shot there 
And over the top 
six runs 
Brian have been trying to play the shot for quite sometime 
from the last over he has been successful now 
 It's Arthurton facing Raju 
Uh that should be a close one 
Uh I thought he played right across the line Ravi 
Here the ball is spinning so it's it's not easy
for Raju to get a leg before decision unless it's it's
 a straight throw as you can see its pitched outside the line and uh 
the batsman also has its foot outside the off stump 
Umpire has given him out 
It was a magnificient catch 
 Arthur Arthurton stepping out stepping down 
from the one word end was a big one word and bat back
 caught brilliantly by Mongia at just silly mid on 
Straight drive beautiful shot all the way almost going to
the boundary
Yes it is long on boundary wide off long on fielder had
no chance 
Very good shot there by Brian Lara 
Square cut there 
Lara Lara has been playing the shot very well all the way for
four runs 
There again brilliant paceman that's a bad
ball from Raju giving Lara room and in this kind of form he is not going to
waste uh deliveries of that kind there 
Playing it late and beating the fielder at deep point giving
him absolutely no chance 
Like I said this is a much better Brian Lara you are seeing 
Stepping down before the ball is delivered straight down
and well fielded
No 
Yes it is 
Just inside the boundary line well done by Raju once again
just two runs 
Raju in the end doing well 
To stop the ball just inside the fence 
Oh there and he is out 
Umpire has given him out 
Wicket keeper umpire that's a good skill good piece
of keeping by Mongia who picked up all the loss done by and uh and
this Lara being stumped 
Stumped Mongia bowled Kumble 
Ah there is excellent piece of glove work here by Nain Mongia
because Brian Lara slipped a bit when he played that shot and just
dragged his leg outside as uh you would be able to see here
There you see just dragging and Mongia in a flash and his
leg is just an inch outside the crease maybe even on the line but 
that's out 
 A good decision by the umpire there 
 But that is 
End of the thirty ninth over
West Indies are one ninety one for five 
And the new batsman coming in 
Should be Chanderpaul 
Batsman one word Chanderpaul hasn't played a match
after the Bombay one day 
And he should be replacing Lara 
Left hander replacing another left hander 
Very important wicket for India that because Lara was
looking extremely dangerous 
He is a type of player who likes to play long innings and he had
uh still another fourteen overs to go 
 That's way he was out 
High play and he is given out
Yes going right across the line of delivery 
And again umpire Jayprakash giving Chanderpaul out 
L B W bowled Jadeja 
Funny all this game can change uh you lose the wicket
 when side is cruising
And now here again Chanderpaul playing across the line to
delivery from Jadeja that was coming in and paying the penalty 
Wide of the crease Jadeja angling at it and as you can see
 Chanderpaul one word is not playing across 
Score one ninety-two for six now West Indies 
 That's well played there 
And Manoj shot that by just like stepping for the going near
the ball and four runs all the way 
With two fielders they are pretty close to each other the
man at short third and backward point there is a very little gap there
 but uh Holder placing the ball to perfection 
He was waiting on it 
And at the very last minute tabbing it down and placing it
beautifully past Manoj Prabhakar 
Once it beaten the other fielders had absolutely no chance
 That's wide over there and Manoj Prabhakar
alternate
Yes he has gone in there 
A simple catch Manoj Prabhakar at long on and Junior Murray
is out 
Caught Prabhakar bowled Jadeja 
Trying to hit the ball out of the ground he has just come in
to bat uh and it's gather shot by uh Murray because he
needed to give his senior partner Holder as much of the strike as
possible
There was no need for a short of this kind 
There is still over fifty balls to play and West Indies should be
trying and picking up uh the single ones and twos and allowing uh 
Holder to do face on the the bowling because uh losing wickets at
this stage regularly can put tremendous pressure on the new man who comes in
The score is two hundred and two for seven West Indies
Jadeja to Holder 
 That's in the air it's going over the top
for six 
Uh Kambli also has gone over the top uh he was unable as
well 
He has some of the gut shot uh before he picks it up
early 
Gone into position 
So it's going to be Kumble now to bowl to Andy
Cummins 
Cummins is gone he is given out he was sweeping 
there and uh the umpire uh Mr Kurushinkal has turned out there so
Cummins is on his way 
Uh that fell well whether we take that probably just at
the outside of the off stump 
No one is certain as to what happen 
Uh except obviously the wicket keeper Mongia 
The bail is off and Walsh is gone 
He has asked the Indian perhaps they said well one word 
and very unspendidly he has taken that word for it and he is out 
Well it was very difficult to say because he seem to be right
cover in the wicket and just pushing at the ball as you can see
there 
And it seems that it his pad in the way
But it's probably just took the outside
edge of the stumps 
Yes yes there you can see the wicket keeper gloves is away
back and you see the man in there and two twenty-eight for nine
 One word uhm Shrinath again to Holder 
Oh is it that may be a mild but he didn't picked this
well
 It's well fielded by Kumble 
Shrinath now to one word Cuffy 
Another full toss he played it before 
Well that was perfectly played and it takes Cuffy to nine 
He couldn't have played that very safe
Well I think that Cuffy can raise and walk in and Hooper
 because Hooper played that similiar kind of shot when he played
in the last game
When he went inside to the full toss
And that was a lovely shot 
As you can see Cuffy gets an inside there 
He played that didn't he ?
Uhm skidding it wide of the leg stump 
Cuffy there was coming down looking for the big hit 
Umpire examining two words I think so 
Cuffy but it's a get down on target out 
I got some uh upon the hot shot like uh I got some
sensational news his highest score in this cricket is one 
He never scored more than singles so he reaching his top
score as fifteen runs 
Last ball being bowled now 
Oh he is obviously over there going for single oh laughs
And I tell you what Prabhakar he hadn't put his hand to the
when that ball hit the wicket
