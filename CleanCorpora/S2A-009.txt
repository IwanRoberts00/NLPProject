Hello and welcome to the highlights of the fourth One Day
International between India 
""
India  at the
Barabati stadium Cuttuck 
""
The West Indies desperately needing to  to level
off the series at two all  for
the fifth  at Jaipur which follows
on Friday 
""
The West Indies made one change 
they dropped Barrington Browne and preferred to strengthen their batting 
bringing in 
""
India  had to drop Navjot Siddhu who was injured and brought in
Atul Bedade  in
place of 
""
It was a cloudy morning  when Courtney Walsh the West Indian
captain won the toss and elected to bat 
""
We pick up the play 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
West 
""
People standing on the balconies 
""
Looking end of the side screen  like the centre piece of
pavilion 
""
""
""
Simmons aiming it well 
""
Striking it at off the space just behind square 
""
That was 
""
A cut short  there is two ways of cutting one
with the 
perpendicular 
""
 straight away to Azharuddin there in the gully
""
That was an exotic catch  Phil went into the trap and it went
straight away  to Azhar
""
""
Quite difficult to tell really 
""
Simmons got back really and 
""
Here  I had seen that was a catch
""
Indeed  normally was
amongst 
""
""
That end up  very very powerful over
""
Azharuddin had 
""
""
This is a good start by the West Indies because uh  there
was a quite a bit of moment 
the two of them have counted that very well 
""
""
Great shot there by Simmons 
four runs 
""
""
That really is a trademark shot of uh  shot
""
""
""
That balls are by Chetan giving Williams all those to play his
shot back foot  cover drive
""
Four runs 
""
Williams particularly is very good at shot 
""
""
Well he gave that a fair old whack uh  that Steuart
Williams  of this nature
now with the  a free
hand for the batsman specially the West Indian batsman with such good
backfoot there 
""
There 
""
""
Could be out 
""
Yes he is 
""
Good catch by Manoj 
""
 really happy and very good well
judged that  catch by Manoj there
""
Running back a little bit 
""
And there 
""
First wicket for India 
""
""
Williams not getting on top of that short ball I think he was
beaten a little bit by pace here and 
ball coming a lot quicker then he expected and getting the top edge and Manoj
Prabhakar here running around taking a good catch 
""
That will do Chetan Sharma as a morale world of good 
""
Caught Prabhakar 
""
""
""
Uh but well played  outside a square drive stepping out
""
""
""
Four runs there 
""
""
""
""
""
In the air but 
""
Lara not trying to bow  still soon then
""
But 
for four runs 
""
""
Sharma now to Hooper 
""
Jadeja was giving his side he is out 
""
What a brilliant throw and uh 
""
Hooper does is out
""
What a marvellous piece of cricket from Jadeja  but careless by
Hooper who was very 
""
""
Certainly very very careless and another wicket of West Indies
could not afford to lose  particular Hooper being run out
""
Hooper has been playing so well 
""
And that is uh  for a big support for the West Indies
team  uh to a shot mid-wicket
 Jadeja coming in and pick the ball up and a
lovely throw hit the wicket on time 
""
Seventy-seven for three 
""
""
""
""
""
""
Shrinath is the fielder
""
Coming back  but
""
""
But this Indian team so certainly  hit in the stumps from all
over the field 
""
Uh again that could have been pretty close  if Lara played it to
mid-wicket  run they have taken up and a
lovely throw in 
""
See there Lara 
""
Once again he has to chase the run he won't get that 
""
It was played very fine by Lara 
""
Late and fine 
""
In the air and a big appeal 
""
No says the umpire Mr Jose Kurushinkal that came off the pad 
so 
""
Have a look at that one again 
""
Another particularly good shot  very
good decision 
""
Well 
""
All is fair in love and war as they say 
""
The end of the over 
""
Twenty-four overs and 
""
""
So Lara well he is beginning to  make a significant score even
though he work on the score is 
like that 
""
""
""
And another fielder at the other end 
""
 again the counter term
with the mis field by Anil Kumble 
""
""
Well he did that well for four
""
It was a lovely shot 
""
Kumble now to Lara 
""
Well that was delicately played 
""
And that is gone away 
""
Just about as fine as you could get it 
""
Kumble now to Arthurton 
""
And that runs for Arthurton to fine leg it could well go for four
there 
""
It does 
""
So a productive over for  the West Indies
""
Twenty-five overs have gone  a hundred and
thirteen 
""
And  wide across at
short fine leg 
""
""
Four more 
""
""
Runs certainly coming in 
""
""
Very good running between the wicket 
""
Excellent 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
And over the top 
""
six runs 
""
Brian have been trying to play the shot for quite sometime 
from the last over 
""
""
""
""
""
Uh that should be a close one 
""
Uh I thought he played right across the line Ravi 
""
""
Here the ball is spinning so  not easy
for Raju to  it's
""
the batsman also has its foot outside the off stump 
""
""
Umpire has given him out 
""
It was a magnificient catch 
""
""
from the  and bat back
""
""
""
Straight drive beautiful shot all the way  almost going to
the boundary
""
Yes it is  fielder had
no chance 
""
""
Very good shot there by Brian 
""
""
Square cut there 
""
Lara  Lara has been playing the shot very well all the way for
four runs 
""
""
There again brilliant paceman  bad
ball from Raju giving Lara room and in this kind of form he is not going to
waste uh 
""
Playing it late and beating the fielder at  deep point giving
him absolutely no chance 
""
Like I said this is a much better Brian Lara you are seeing 
""
""
Stepping down before the ball is delivered  straight down
and well fielded
""
No 
""
Yes it is 
""
Just inside the boundary line well done by Raju  once again
just two runs 
""
""
Raju in the end doing well 
""
To stop the ball just inside the fence 
""
""
Oh 
""
Umpire has given him out 
""
Wicket keeper umpire  good piece
of keeping by Mongia  and
this Lara being stumped 
""
Stumped Mongia 
""
""
Ah there is excellent piece of glove work here by Nain Mongia
because Brian Lara  slipped a bit when he played that shot and just
dragged his leg  you would be able to see here
""
There you see  and his
leg is 
that's 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
End of the thirty ninth over
""
West Indies are one ninety one for five 
""
And 
""
Should be Chanderpaul 
""
""
Batsman  Chanderpaul hasn't played a match
after the Bombay 
""
And he should be replacing Lara 
""
Left hander replacing another left hander 
""
""
Very important wicket for India that because  Lara was
looking extremely dangerous 
""
He is a type of player who likes to play long innings and he had
uh 
""
""
""
""
""
High play and he is given out
""
Yes 
""
And again umpire Jayprakash 
""
L B W bowled Jadeja 
""
""
Funny all this game can change uh  you lose the wicket
 when side is cruising
""
And now here again Chanderpaul playing across the line  to
delivery from Jadeja that was coming in and 
""
Wide of the crease Jadeja angling at it  and as you can see
""
""
""
Score one ninety-two for six now West Indies 
""
""
""
And Manoj  shot that by just like stepping for the going near
the ball and four runs all the way 
""
""
With two fielders they are pretty close to each other  the
man at short third and backward point  there is a very little gap there
""
""
He was waiting on it 
""
And at the very last minute tabbing it down  and placing it
beautifully past Manoj Prabhakar 
""
Once it beaten  the other fielders had absolutely no chance
""
""
""
 Manoj Prabhakar
alternate
""
Yes he has gone in there 
""
A simple catch Manoj Prabhakar at long on  and Junior Murray
is out 
""
Caught Prabhakar 
""
""
Trying to hit the ball out of the ground he has just come in
to bat uh  because he
needed to give his senior partner  Holder as much of the strike as
possible
""
There was no need for a short of this kind 
""
There is still over fifty balls to play and West Indies should be
trying and picking up uh 
Holder to do  losing wickets at
this stage regularly can put tremendous pressure on the new man who comes in
""
""
""
The score is two hundred and two for seven  West Indies
""
""
""
Jadeja to Holder 
""
 going over the top
for six 
""
Uh  uh he was unable as
well 
""
""
He has some of the gut shot uh  before he picks it up
early 
""
""
Gone into position 
""
So  Kumble now to bowl to Andy
Cummins 
""
Cummins is gone 
there and uh  Mr Kurushinkal has turned out there so
Cummins is on his way 
""
""
Uh that fell well  whether we take that probably just at
the outside of the off stump 
""
No one is certain as to what happen 
""
Uh except obviously the wicket keeper Mongia 
""
The bail is off 
""
He has asked the Indian perhaps they said well 
and very 
""
Well it was very difficult to say because he seem to be right
cover in the wicket  as you can see
there 
""
And it seems that it his pad in the way
""
But  outside
edge of the stumps 
""
Yes yes there you can see the wicket keeper gloves is  away
back and you see the man in there  two twenty-eight for nine
""
""
""
""
""
Oh is it that may be a mild  but he didn't picked this
well
""
""
""
Shrinath now to 
""
""
Another full toss he played it before 
""
Well that was perfectly played and it takes Cuffy to nine 
""
""
He couldn't have played that very safe
""
""
Well I think that Cuffy can raise and walk in  and Hooper
 played
in the last game
""
When he went inside to the full toss
""
And that was a lovely shot 
""
As you can see Cuffy gets an inside there 
""
""
He played that didn't he  ?
""
Uhm skidding it wide of the leg stump 
""
""
Cuffy there was coming down looking for the big hit 
""
Umpire examining 
""
""
Cuffy 
""
I got some uh  I got some
sensational news his highest score in this cricket is one 
""
He never scored more than singles so he  top
score as fifteen runs 
""
Last ball being bowled now 
""
Oh he is obviously over there going for single oh  laughs
""
""
""
And I tell you what Prabhakar he hadn't put his hand to the
when that ball hit the wicket
