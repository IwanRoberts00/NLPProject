Hello and welcome to the highlights of the fourth One Day
""
""
India  at the
""
""
""
""
the fifth  at Jaipur which follows
""
""
""
""
bringing in 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Looking end of the side screen  like the centre piece of
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
 straight away to Azharuddin there in the gully
""
That was an exotic catch  Phil went into the trap and it went
""
""
""
""
""
Simmons got back really and 
""
Here  I had seen that was a catch
""
""
amongst 
""
""
That end up  very very powerful over
""
""
""
""
""
was a quite a bit of moment 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
That balls are by Chetan giving Williams all those to play his
""
""
Four runs 
""
""
""
""
""
Williams  of this nature
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Good catch by Manoj 
""
""
judged that  catch by Manoj there
""
Running back a little bit 
""
And there 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
for four runs 
""
""
Sharma now to Hooper 
""
Jadeja was giving his side he is out 
""
What a brilliant throw and uh 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
could not afford to lose  particular Hooper being run out
""
Hooper has been playing so well 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
over the field 
""
""
mid-wicket  run they have taken up and a
""
""
""
""
Once again he has to chase the run he won't get that 
""
""
""
""
""
In the air and a big appeal 
""
""
so 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
All is fair in love and war as they say 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
And another fielder at the other end 
""
 again the counter term
""
""
""
""
""
It was a lovely shot 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Just about as fine as you could get it 
""
Kumble now to Arthurton 
""
""
""
""
""
""
So a productive over for  the West Indies
""
Twenty-five overs have gone  a hundred and
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Runs certainly coming in 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Brian have been trying to play the shot for quite sometime 
""
""
""
""
""
""
Uh that should be a close one 
""
Uh I thought he played right across the line Ravi 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
It was a magnificient catch 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Very good shot there by Brian 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
waste uh 
""
""
him absolutely no chance 
""
""
""
""
""
and well fielded
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Stumped Mongia 
""
""
""
because Brian Lara  slipped a bit when he played that shot and just
""
""
There you see  and his
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Batsman  Chanderpaul hasn't played a match
after the Bombay 
""
And he should be replacing Lara 
""
Left hander replacing another left hander 
""
""
""
looking extremely dangerous 
""
""
uh 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Yes 
""
""
""
""
""
""
Funny all this game can change uh  you lose the wicket
""
""
""
delivery from Jadeja that was coming in and 
""
Wide of the crease Jadeja angling at it  and as you can see
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
And Manoj  shot that by just like stepping for the going near
""
""
""
""
man at short third and backward point  there is a very little gap there
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Once it beaten  the other fielders had absolutely no chance
""
""
""
""
""
""
Yes he has gone in there 
""
""
is out 
""
""
""
""
""
to bat uh  because he
""
possible
""
""
""
""
""
""
this stage regularly can put tremendous pressure on the new man who comes in
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Jadeja to Holder 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
He has some of the gut shot uh  before he picks it up
""
""
""
Gone into position 
""
""
Cummins 
""
""
there and uh  Mr Kurushinkal has turned out there so
Cummins is on his way 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
The bail is off 
""
""
""
""
""
cover in the wicket  as you can see
there 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Oh is it that may be a mild  but he didn't picked this
well
""
""
""
""
""
""
Another full toss he played it before 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
in the last game
""
""
""
""
""
As you can see Cuffy gets an inside there 
""
""
He played that didn't he  ?
""
""
""
""
""
""
Umpire examining 
""
""
Cuffy 
""
I got some uh  I got some
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
And I tell you what Prabhakar he hadn't put his hand to the
when that ball hit the wicket
