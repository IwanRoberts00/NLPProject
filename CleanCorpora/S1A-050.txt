<I>
""
""
So 
""
""
""
Actually Umesh  there are a lot of
people 
""
""
Ahn 
""
""
So  uh according to scientists they are expecting one more
""
""
But this is very very  last month
""
""
""
Uhm  what has happened is for
good or bad 
""
""
No no it is extremely bad 
""
In the last  uh
disaster happened 
""
""
In India or on earth 
""
""
Uhm
""
""
In India or in the world 
""
""
Uh  I can't tell in the world because I don't know more
about  but in India this is the very very
serious 
""
""
Uhm 
""
""
As  Mr P V
Narasimha Rao should have 
serious step on this
""
""
Oh yeah 
""
""
And that affected a lot of people  and also many houses
every thing has been 
""
""
Do you think 
India 
""
""
Yeah Umesh  just for the day
""
""
Have changed in India  my friend
""
""
""
""
""
Yes Umesh 
""
Actually what happened is 
there will be a 
""
In uh most probably in December 
""
Because uh  more
precautions 
earthquake till now 
""
So we have to think about it 
""
""
What do you  whose lives have
gone 
""
""
Yeah  relief funds
coming from outside the country and  on this
""
""
There are a lot of uh relief funds coming from other countries 
like uh 
one word  from
""
""
But don't you think that it will be better that if uh  the
people 
""
""
Yeah we like to have it so  what is
called  just asking for
relief  this one uh for earthquake relief fund for earthquake do you think
it is better 
""
""
Yeah 
""
Uhm 
a lot of participants are coming  fund
""
""
So  people are donating as much as
possible for the relief fund as  their own pople are
dying from 
""
So 
""
As far as my
""
""
But Mr Mahesh  uh that people being
suffered 
it'll  would
 because see all the things what has
happened  slum
areas you can say always  you get
""
""
Yeah 
""
""
So  uh
not only in India but also as  uh and most of the countries are concerned
 the unwanted scenes happen only in
slums  they all this multi-
millionaires trying to become 
yeah  by destroying all the slums
""
""
""
""
""
Yeah 
""
""
So what I think is  be better if all those
people  uh the earthquake
""
""
Yeah  which is more beneficial
""
""
""
Because as far as participation is concerned uh  it would
be better  uh half the way
""
""
Uhm
""
""
In their life that is uh 
living and the other half side they are 
be better  donate generously
""
""
Uhm 
""
""
""
""
And  if people would have lost
their lives the population also would have gone down
""
""
Uhm 
""
""
So 
would have been uh benefitted 
the problem of uh
""
""
Uhm 
""
""
Eatables
""
""
Uhm 
""
""
Then uh any other  miscellening uh purpose
""
""
Uhm 
""
""
That wouldn't be much of problems 
""
""
And what do you think of the  participation
in this 
""
""
As far as  is concerned the prime minister uhm
""
""
Of course  uh I think even he is generating I mean he is
donating generously 
""
But to some extent 
""
We can't say that he isn't uh 
""
 he is the prime
minister of the country no 
""
""
So now what do you think about the  earthquake in
Maharashtra 
""
There a around thirty thousand  people have died and what do you
 better
""
""
No as I told you before that 
 would have lost their lives in
that  as I told you before
""
""
Uhm uhm
""
""
Because  now this medical expenses
 the medical
expenses have been given free the all items
""
""
Uhm 
""
""
But as far as uh other thing is concerned
""
""
Uhm
""
""
They 
uhm  the life
is miserable
""
""
""
""
""
Uhm
""
""
 if they would have lost their lives
""
""
""
Now what do you think about  maximum many of
the people have died in Maharashtra
""
""
Oh yeah
""
""
So what do think about them 
""
""
About them 
""
""
What would be better if  what would be the better steps to
be taken 
""
""
I think it was good what have what happened was good 
""
""
And what about  uh
earthquake happened 
""
""
Yeah in Karnataka that same opinion
""
""
No many people they  uh very few died and also
""
""
No the same thing  that has been applicable to Maharashtra
""
""
""
Uhm 
""
So okay  shift on to some other this
one 
""
Okay Umesh 
festival that is  has
declared holiday 
""
So what do you think about it 
""
""
Enjoyable 
""
""
Okay Umesh uh  actually what I am thinking is I am thinking
to  seeing
the  uh in front of Mysore
Palace 
""
There will be a 
Maharaja  seated
on an elephant  uh all uh
""
""
I 
""
""
No actually his grandsons are there
""
So  uh get him seated uh on an elephant
in the place of their fore-fathers 
""
So there will be all ministers  and also the Prime Minister will
be attending the 
""
So I think there is a grand festival and  people from all over
the country will be 
""
Okay Umesh what do you think about the  competitive
exams conducted by 
""
""
 to come up in life
""
""
Uhm 
""
""
So  competitive exams
""
""
Uhm 
""
""
So it helps uh  students come up in life
""
""
Uhm 
""
""
In  they have
got plenty of  other way
""
""
""
""
""
Uhm 
""
""
So it really helps 
""
 something you say
""
""
Yeah like  intelligent persons
will be filterd 
""
And uh  want to be in a
good position 
""
And so what do you think about their  uh
like will it be good or  politics or what do
you think about it 
""
""
No as far as  power and their mind is
concerned 
""
""
Uhm 
""
""
""
""
""
No 
political  any influence
comes and  the correct person
will be placed on position
""
""
""
""
""
Hey 
""
As far as the will power and the mind is strong  uhm
 they need not have to
keep themselves down 
""
""
""
""
""
Yeah okay 
""
Now what do you think about the State Competitive Exams 
""
""
State competitive exams 
taking much of interest in Union State competitive exams
""
""
Uhm 
""
Know what I think is  many of them
who have done well will not be qualified
""
""
Fine 
""
""
Sometimes in the state level they may be qualified 
""
Their intelligence may be understood  intelligence
can be  higher persons who are going
to conduct the exams 
""
So I think uh  good
competitive exams all India and state level it is quite good 
""
It helps people in many ways and also  influences many of the
""
""
Well  university exams
conducted 
""
""
So university exams are conducted uh  see at present
India is considerable you know plenty of universities  union level
""
""
Uhm uhm 
""
""
And some of the  some of the universities
""
""
Uhm 
""
""
Their  wisdom
""
""
Uhm 
""
""
So what I think is doing in that particular university
""
""
Uhm 
""
""
The persons career  to some extent might be spoilt
""
""
Uhm 
""
""
Because 
for job opportunities
""
""
Uhm 
""
""
What they ask is 
""
""
Uhm
""
""
Preferably from a good  recognised university
""
""
Uhm 
""
""
And if the university has got a black spot
""
""
Uhm 
""
""
Naturally all the persons who has 
particular university
""
""
Uhm 
""
""
Also  the same thing
""
""
Will be a waste
""
""
Yeah 
""
""
To the student who has studied over there
""
""
Exactly 
""
""
And what do you think about the 
""
If the college is not good how can a university be  uh means
""
""
""
The college is not good in the sense what do you mean 
""
""
Like uh  students may not
be good 
""
""
As far as lecturers are concerned
""
""
Uhm 
""
""
The teaching 
uhm  standard
""
""
""
""
""
Uhm,
""
""
As far as students are concerned 
""
""
Uhm 
""
""
The main thing all depends on students
""
""
Uhm 
""
""
They  they have got a good friendship
""
""
Uhm
""
""
Alright 
""
""
Uhm 
""
""
They can uh  that's
 with studies
""
""
Uhm 
""
""
With lecturers  also
""
""
But suppose if the students  to
build up their  good friendship
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Uhm
""
""
Good friend circle 
""
""
Uhm 
""
""
Naturally the  college also gets a bad name
""
""
Uhm 
""
""
So in which  will also be included
""
""
Uhm 
""
Okay then 
""
Okay 
""
""
We had a good conversation
""
""
Yeah  might
take a good turn 
it may 
""
And  finishing this
discussion by  this topic itself
""
So

""
""
""
""
Good bye
