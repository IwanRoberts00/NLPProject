<I>
So what do you think about the disaster happened 
 Dakshin Maharashtra about earthquake 
Actually Umesh as we have seen there are a lot of
people died 
Ahn 
So uh according to scientists they are expecting one more
But this is very very serious disaster happened last month
Uhm but do you think that what has happened is for
good or bad 
No no it is extremely bad 
In the last around ten fifteen years this is the worst uh
disaster happened 
In India or on earth 
Uhm
In India or in the world 
Uh I can't tell in the world because I don't know more
about other sides happened but in India this is the very very
serious hit to the people and also to the country 
Uhm 
As as this is a very serious happened Mr P V
Narasimha Rao should have take taken a very 
serious step on this
Oh yeah 
And that affected a lot of people and also many houses
every thing has been crushed 
Do you think anything that will be going to happen in 
India 
Yeah Umesh just for the day
Have changed in India earthquake my friend
 Yeah 
Yes Umesh 
Actually what happened is scientists have predicted that 
there will be a serious earthquake in one uh again 
In uh most probably in December as they have predicted 
Because uh before that time they have to take more
precautions as there is a lot of life lost in the 
earthquake till now a serious step has to be taken 
So we have to think about it a lot 
What do you think about those people whose lives have
gone whose lives have gone in earthquake 
Yeah there are uhm there are lot of relief funds
coming from outside the country and people are also donating on this
 break in recording 
There are a lot of uh relief funds coming from other countries 
like uh donations of amount and aid and also the food 
one word like uh food uh from other countries and also from
 the people are also donating break in recording 
But don't you think that it will be better that if uh the
people take up general opinion of say uhm helping us 
Yeah we like to have it so taking to uh what is
called uh box or something and uh going on just asking for
relief this one uh for earthquake relief fund for earthquake do you think
it is better Mr Mahesh 
Yeah 
Uhm yeah I think people are donating and also the 
a lot of participants are coming to take part in the relief fund
So as far as my thinking people are donating as much as
possible for the relief fund as they think that their own pople are
dying from whole everything 
So we also should have to take part in that 
As far as my
But Mr Mahesh see what I think is uh that people being
suffered by this uh being wounded in all this cases 
it'll be better if those people uh would would
 have lost their lives because see all the things what has
happened it all most more uh it's been happened slum
areas you can say always you get
Yeah 
So and you can have and one more thing is uh
not only in India but also as uh and most of the countries are concerned
 all this uh what is called uh the unwanted scenes happen only in
slums like uh you know this uh raped and uh they all this multi-
millionaires trying to become more and more millionaire 
yeah by destroying all the slums
 Yeah 
Yeah 
So what I think is it'll be better if all those
people would have lost their lives in uh the earthquake
Yeah so what do you think which is more beneficial
 to participate in the earthquake 
Because as far as participation is concerned uh it would
be better first uh those people who are uh half the way
Uhm
In their life that is uh half the thing they are 
living and the other half side they are dying in that case it'll 
be better people gener donate generously
Uhm 
 That's what I think 
And more one more thing is if people would have lost
their lives the population also would have gone down
Uhm 
So from that point of view the other people also 
would have been uh benefitted because the earthquake doesn't bring 
the problem of uh
Uhm 
Eatables
Uhm 
Then uh any other miscellening uh purpose
Uhm 
That wouldn't be much of problems 
And what do you think of the PM's participation
in this relief fund uh relief Umesh 
As far as PM's is concerned the prime minister uhm
 he's working quite hard 
Of course uh I think even he is generating I mean he is
donating generously 
But to some extent 
We can't say that he isn't uh uh helping them 
 It's his duty to those because he is the prime
minister of the country no 
So now what do you think about the earthquake in
Maharashtra 
There a around thirty thousand people have died and what do you
 feel which is better
No as I told you before that uh it'll be 
 the thing was better if all the people would have lost their lives in
that as I told you before
Uhm uhm
Because one more thing is now this medical expenses
 and going for that thing as far as living uh even the medical
expenses have been given free the all items
Uhm 
But as far as uh other thing is concerned
Uhm
They being lost their property and other thing 
uhm they naturally feel uh bad about they feel that the life
is miserable
 Uhm 
Uhm
 It's better if they would have lost their lives
Now what do you think about the people maximum many of
the people have died in Maharashtra
Oh yeah
So what do think about them 
About them sa sad 
What would be better if what would be the better steps to
be taken 
I think it was good what have what happened was good 
And what about what do you think about the uh
earthquake happened in Gulbarga that is in Karnataka 
Yeah in Karnataka that same opinion
No many people they uh very few died and also
No the same thing that has been applicable to Maharashtra
Uhm 
So okay uh now we'll shift on to some other this
one uh recording broken 
Okay Umesh what do you think about the Dussera 
festival that is uh from next week they uh the college has
declared holiday 
So what do you think about it 
Enjoyable one word 
Okay Umesh uh actually what I am thinking is I am thinking
to of going to Mysore and uh spending there a week seeing
the Dussera festival that is uh in front of Mysore
Palace 
There will be a big crowd and also the Mysore 
Maharaja the uh Maharaja will be seated
on an elephant and uh all uh
I a few words some Maharaja at present 
No actually his grandsons are there
So they are going to uh get him seated uh on an elephant
in the place of their fore-fathers 
So there will be all ministers and also the Prime Minister will
be attending the uh function 
So I think there is a grand festival and people from all over
the country will be coming 
Okay Umesh what do you think about the compt competitive
exams conducted by the All India level 
 It's good for students to come up in life
Uhm 
So they got plenty of comp competitive exams
Uhm 
So it helps uh students come up in life
Uhm 
In just not in monopolying uhm they have
got plenty of other way
 Uhm 
Uhm 
So it really helps 
 It's something like an entrance something you say
Yeah like uh many most of the intelligent persons
will be filterd and will be placed in a top most position 
And uh so it helps a lot of students who want to be in a
good position 
And so what do you think about their this one future or uh
like will it be good or uh will there be any politics or what do
you think about it 
No as far as their will power and their mind is
concerned if they are well strong enough 
Uhm 
 They'll be well placed 
No what I am thinking if there is some 
political background like uh from some minister any influence
comes and uh will they change their mind or will the correct person
will be placed on position
 They'll have good or uh 
Hey that's what I'm telling no 
As far as the will power and the mind is strong uhm
 they need not have to uh keep uh say they need not have to
keep themselves down 
 Uhm 
Yeah okay 
Now what do you think about the State Competitive Exams 
State competitive exams right people are uh 
taking much of interest in Union State competitive exams
Uhm 
Know what I think is in the national level many of them
who have done well will not be qualified
Fine 
Sometimes in the state level they may be qualified 
Their intelligence may be understood or their intelligence
can be seen by the examiners or some higher persons who are going
to conduct the exams 
So I think uh this this is more uh it's good
competitive exams all India and state level it is quite good 
It helps people in many ways and also influences many of the
 people to come up and also be placed in a good position 
Well what do you think about the university exams
conducted 
So university exams are conducted uh see at present
India is considerable you know plenty of universities union level
Uhm uhm 
And some of the some of the universities
Uhm 
Their great wisdom
Uhm 
So what I think is doing in that particular university
Uhm 
The persons career to some extent might be spoilt
Uhm 
Because moreover now-a-days when we go away 
for job opportunities
Uhm 
What they ask is 
Uhm
Preferably from a good recognised university
Uhm 
And if the university has got a black spot
Uhm 
Naturally all the persons who has studied in that 
particular university
Uhm 
Also the same thing
Will be a waste
Yeah 
To the student who has studied over there
Exactly 
And what do you think about the college itself 
If the college is not good how can a university be uh means
 uh be pointed out 
The college is not good in the sense what do you mean 
Like uh lecturers are not good or students may not
be good or sometimes the placement may not be good 
As far as lecturers are concerned
Uhm 
The teaching you know might be quite low 
uhm quite high the level standard
 Uhm 
Uhm,
As far as students are concerned 
Uhm 
The main thing all depends on students
Uhm 
They they have got a good friendship
Uhm
Alright 
Uhm 
They can uh deal with any other thing also that's
 with studies
Uhm 
With lecturers they can have good relation also
 
But suppose if the students uhm don't have to
build up their good friendship
 Uhm 
 Uhm 
Uhm
Good friend circle 
Uhm 
Naturally the college also gets a bad name
Uhm 
So in which the achievers also will also be included
Uhm 
Okay then 
Okay Mah okay Umesh uh we have talked a good 
We had a good conversation
Yeah and uh I think the flood relief might
take a good turn and in the earthquake may take a good turn and 
it may be of some help to the people 
And so I'm thinking of finishing this
discussion by this topic itself
So okay Umesh say you good bye 
 Good bye Mahesh 
Good bye
