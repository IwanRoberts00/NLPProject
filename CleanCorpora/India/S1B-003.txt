 bb-work 
""
so the last time we had studied  the external structure of heart
""
""
mammalian heart 
""
today we are going to study about    internal  internal
structure   bb-work 
""
""
 internal  
""
""
as you know that  the mammalian heart  it is  four
chambered   bb-work 
""
can any one tell me  which  which are these  chambers 
are  ?
""
""
auricles and ventricles 
""
""
yes very correct 
""
""
two auricles
""
""
two auricles   bb-work  two auricles  and two
ventricles 
""
which chambers are called as auricles  ?
""
say clearly 
""
""
the upper portion 
""
""
which are the auricles ?
""
""
upper portions are auricles
""
""
yes  very correct 
""
the upper portion  the upper chambers are  auricles 
 bb-work  and the lower ones are  ventricles
""
""
ventricles 
""
""
in the same way these auricles  auricles are usually 
are   very thin wall structures   bb-work  whereas the
ventricles are very muscular 
""
each side of the  auricles and ventricles they are
interconnected  the left side and the  right side 
""
now they are interconnected by  an aperture common aperture 
which are known as  auricular-ventricular aperture   bb-work 
""
""
it is internal  effecting through auricles
""
""
no    auricles    auricles and ventricles
   noise 
""
""
 auricles  
""
""
 auricles and ventricles  
""
""
now these  auricles are guarded by  valves  which
  prevent   prevents   the  blood  flowing again
 on the same  side or going back  into the ventricles or auricles
""
""
or you can say   that   that    it prevents
the  back flow  of the blood 
""
the left side  auricular-ventricular aperture here in this
diagram you can see 
""
it is  guarded by  a valve which is known as bicuspid valve
""
""
bicuspid   bb-work  bicuspid valve or  you can 
call it as a mitral valve also   bb-work 
""
""
what is it function  what
""
""
to prevent the back flow of the blood  from auricles to
ventricles 
""
similarly the right auricle  and the ventricle  is again
guarded by  a valve which is known as tricuspid valve  tricuspid
valve   bb-work 
""
these valves are very strong and made up of  muscular tissues
 which  open into the  of  course  of  ventricular side
 and to  keep it there  keep the flap  as it is  it is
 held up by some  tissue chords  which are known as 
collisentinel    collisentinel   bb-work  
""
so this is the internal structure
""
now how does  working of the heart takes place  ?
""
""
by left and right ventricle aperture they may be 
""
""
left side takes the bicuspid  and right side the tricuspid
""
""
""
auriculars 
""
""
auricular-ventricular aperture 
""
""
left side  this side entering
""
""
that means that  left side auricular-ventricular 
aperture is guarded by bicuspid valve  and the  right side of the
auricular-ventricular aperture is guarded by tricuspid valve   bb-work
""
""
the two auricles act as a  reservoir of the blood  which
 collected  from    the side of the    all sides
of the   body 
""
it comes and get  stored in the auricles 
""
from auricles then  it goes to the ventricles  and then
ventricle when it contracts it  gets closed into the vessels 
""
this is the  general  working of the  heart  
bb-work 
""
auricles  when the auricles  contract  the blood flows
into the  ventricles  and when the ventricles contract the blood flows
into the  vessels 
""
which are these vessels can any one tell me  ?
""
 bb-work 
""
from the  le   left side  from the left  it goes
to the  pulmonary  pulmonary vessels   bb-work 
""
what do you mean by pulmonary  ?
""
going towards  lungs   bb-work 
""
then what about systematic  arteries  ?
""
 bb-work 
""
systematic artery are the main  vessels which  supply blood
to the  body organs different body organs 
""
now these vessels also  as it opens into the ventricles  of
their own side  in the vessel itself it also contains or it also based on
that  which are known as  cellulilar  glands   bb-work 
""
in this diagram  here  see this is the  in 
systematic  this is pulmanory and this is  described here 
""
now the blood  which  comes to the  right auricle  it
comes from  different parts of the body
""
that means it should be  definitely  veinal blood 
""
what do you mean by vienal blood  ?  bb-work 
""
""
into the 
""
""
de-   oxygenated   de-oxygenated  
bb-work 
""
""
 oxygenated  
""
""
this is a degenated 
""
""
pardon me 
""
""
degenated 
""
""
de 
""
""
genate 
""
""
de-oxygenated blood  because it will go for purification to
the  lungs 
""
except one  vein  which brings  purified blood
""
which is that  ?
""
that day i have told you about it 
""
""
pulmonary 
""
""
pulmonary vein 
""
though it is called as vein but it brings  oxygenated blood
 because the direction of flow is towards the  heart 
""
but it carries  oxygenated blood 
""
in the same way the pulmonary artery  which is going away from
the  heart  that other  aor  this  aorta 
""
but these carry  veinal blood  why  ?
""
or these carry  de-oxygenated blood 
""
why  ?
""
can you tell me  ?
""
then why the name has been given as  aor  aorta  ?
""
only because the direction of flow is towards the  body organs
""
""
away from the heart 
""
now which are these two  veinal blood systems  are  ?
""
which is here  this blue one  superior and inferior venacava
  bb-work begins  superior  inferior  venacava  bb-work
end 
""
the superior venacava  brings de-oxygenated blood  from the
 upper portion or head region of the body   bb-work 
""
head   ante  anterior against these 
""
""
de-oxygenated 
""
""
and inferior means  from the  lower portion of the body
  bb-work 
""
these two aortas open into the right auricle 
""
then when the auricle contracts  it goes to the  right 
ventricle 
""
then from ventricle when it ventricle contract  the blood goes
 into the vessel 
""
from right auricle  which vessel it will go  ?  bb-work
""
""
""
pulmonary vein  pulmonary artery
""
""
pulmonary 
""
""
artery
""
""
artery yes 
""
which  will take the blood to the  lungs for purification
""
""
in the same way  left auricle receives blood  purified
blood from the lungs 
""
as it contracts  the left  auricle  oxygenated blood
then goes to the left  ventricle 
""
and the ventricle  after contraction it  takes blood
through the vessels  to  to the different parts of the  body 
or  main systematic arteries   bb-work 
""
but aorta and uh  sorry  uh auricles and the ventricles 
they contract  together  or the auricles they will contract  at at
the time 
""
so the working of left and the right auricle will be going  as
i have just explained you 
""
ventricles also contract  at the same time 
""
both the ventricles 
""
  and the working  
""
""
 and they are undertaking  
""
""
no no two  two together 
""
auricles first  then ventricles 
""
how many times this contraction takes place  ?
""
""
seventy two uh 
""
""
  seventy-two  uh  good 
""
""
 seventy-two times  
""
""
seventy-two times 
""
can you measure it  ?
""
know there is some instrument 
""
""
electrocard  iogram  
""
""
stethescope   bb-work  which helps in 
""
""
miss what is the meaning of electrocardio   gram 
""
""
 counting   the sounds  of this contraction
""
""
miss what is the main function of electrocardiam 
""
""
that  spinal 
""
""
that function of e t p radiocardiam 
""
""
that is electron 
""
how to count these in the  first medical  you have to first
count these lub and dub sound   bb-work 
""
lub and dub sound 
""
""
lub 
""
""
and if you want to  count it by your finger tips  you
can 
""
""
there is pulse rate 
""
""
pulse yes  pulse  rate you can just near the thumb 
""
""
i   mean the pulse is 
""
no no i mean
""
""
 left hand  
""
""
here it is  this count near the thumb  thumb side
portion  this is   bb-work 
""
now there are two types of these  veins  also
""
now the  ephatic  portal vein  and the  one more is
there portal vein  renal portal   ephatic  portal  
bb-work 
""
what do you mean by the portal  vein ?
""
why not it is simple vein  ?
""
portal vein  ?
""
because this vein  is not directly going to the heart  but
it goes through  some  one of the organs 
""
there it gets filtered on the  nitrogenous  amonic
material  and from there then the simple way to go to the  heart 
from heart then it goes to the lungs for purification 
""
so there are two portal veins   hepatic  portal vein and
the  renal-portal vein 
""
 hepatic  portal vein  goes to the  liver  
bb-work  liver for  filtration  that is nitrogeneous material
""
""
and renal- portal  the filtration takes place in  kidney
 for amonic material 
""
again that would be the procedure only 
""
so in this way  there are two portal veins  and different
types of veins in the body which help in collecting the  different 
veinal blood  and then getting  stored in the  auricle 
""
which auricle  ?
""
it will come to which auricle  ?
""
""
main vein 
""
right auricle
""
""
right auricle correct  
""

the scientist is doing    experiment  experiment
correct 
""
""
 experiment  
""
""
then just  i will read the lesson loudly   teacher
starts reading

 p c ray 
""
the neighbours did not know what to make of the young man 
""
that he was a college lecturer and scientist  they knew 
""
and he did experiments in small laboratory he had set up at his
house 
""
but what scientific purpose could he hope to serve by dumping on
terrace  sackfuls of cattle bones he had got from the local butcher 
""
they had put up with the odours that had often been wafted to them
by breeze from his laboratory 
""
but the stench from rotting bone and flesh was unbearable 
""
crows had also been littering houses all around with bones picked
up from  te  terrace 
""
after several days of this  they could stand it no longer 
""
they told the young man  to take away the bones 
""
if he did not they would call the muncipal authorities 
""
at this juncture a friend came to the rescue of the young man 
""
he had a vacant plot of land a little away from any house  
end of reading 
""
""
 yeah 
""
""
 starts reading 
""
at this juncture a friend came to the rescue of the young man 
""
he had a vacant plot of land a little away from any house and the
 bones could be dumped there 
""
that was done and one evening  when he found that the bones had
been well dried by the sun  the young man made a bonfire of them 
""
there was trouble again 
""
policemen attracted by the fire  arrived and he had a hard time
convincing them that he was no  murderer  destroying evidence  and
that it was not human bones that were being burnt 
""
the next morning he took the ashes of the bones to his laboratory
and treated with them  sulphuric acid 
""
when the superphosphate of lime thus produced was mixed with soda
 a solution of phosphate of soda was formed 
""
the solution was then put into large basin and boiled 
""
this produced lumps of phosphate of soda crystals 
""
the young man took a lump and chewed it 
""
he smiled happily 
""
he had converted the waste cattle bones into a medicinal compound
from which nerve tonic could be made 
""
the young man began to produce the tonic on a large scale 
""
it was cheaper than the imported product available in the market
and was  as effective 
""
in the beginning druggist were not ready to keep this  desi
 medicine  but doctors who knew the  young man and the
effectiveness of the tonic canvassed it and it became  popular 
""
this was the modest beginning of the bengal chemical and
pharmaceutical works  now one of the biggest chemical firms in the country
 and the young man was prafulla chandra ray
""
today ray is recognised as the father of  india's  chemical
industry 
""
and he not only developed centres of research in chemistry and
trained brilliant young chemists  but also by original research  placed
india in high position in the world of chemistry   end of reading 
""
now read the lesson  silently  for three to four minutes
