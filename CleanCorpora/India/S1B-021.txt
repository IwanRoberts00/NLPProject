we have in this studio  today three prominent persons 
related to carbohydrates  technology  and industry 
""
let us introduce ourselves 
""
former  senior district director  ahmadabad textile industry
research association 
""
he is head of  carbohydrate  research division 
""
he is currently working there  as emeritus csir    scien
  uh  professor   
""
dr k r bhattacharya  is a former scientist  central food
technological research institute 
""
and he is an expert in food-carbohydrates 
""
and we have dr  p m shah 
""
he is a technologist in a industry  related to carbohydrates 
typically making starch and its products 
""
now  dr shrivastav i request you to tell us  what are
diverse materials which we call as carbohydrates  and what are their
common  and less common uses  ?
""
then  i'll  also like you to elaborate  how india
acquired  technology  on carbohydrates which we are  uh looking
today 
""
and how do we compare in utilization of our carbohydrate research
 uh carbohydrate resources  compared to international level  ?
""
""
carbohydrates  are one of the most uh  widely  and
 commonly occurring  products in nature 
""
we  use them  almost everyday  carbohydrates  are
either sugars  which are normally sweet 
""
or they are made up of  sugars 
""
carbohydrates either  are of one unit  or two units 
several units  or hundreds of units 
""
those which are  one unit are called sugars  those which are
two units are called  disaccharides 
""
saccharide is standing for sugar 
""
those which have three units  are trisaccharides  and so on
""
""
tetra  penta  and then  polysaccharides  which are 
which have a large number  of sugar units  in their molecular 
structure 
""
to illustrate  the diversity  of carbohydrate materials 
we have here  on this table  a number of  carbohydrate substances
""
""
the first  is a single unit  sugar  called glucose 
""
it is also known as  dextrose  which is commonly used 
during recuperating process  of patients 
""
then  we have a disaccharide  with which  most of you are
familiar 
""
and this is cane-sugar  or sucrose  the sample  is also
here 
""
then we have a large variety  of polysaccharide 
""
the most common of which  is cellulose 
""
by  the  name itself  you can understand  that 
this is  the sugar of cells 
""
or the polysaaccharide of cell  and that is why  the word 
is cellulose 
""
all  plant cells are made up  of cellulose 
""
among one of the most common  substances  made up of
cellulose  or cotton  a sample of which  is here 
""
similarly paper  on which we write  is also  made up 
of essentially  cellulose 
""
then  we have  another material  which actually  is a
seed carbohydrate  and it is starch 
""
it is a polymer  of glucose unit 
""
this is also  widely present  in seeds  and in stems 
and in tubers 
""
some examples of these  are also  here 
""
we have  rice  which has  a large quantity of  starch
 in it 
""
then  we have corn  from which  starch industrially 
is isolated 
""
now some of these products  are converted  into  food
materials 
""
snack food  or fast food 
""
for example  the corn  when puffed  gives popcorn 
""
and potato  which also contains lot of starch  gives potato
chips 
""
these samples are also  displayed here 
""
besides  the example shown here  there are large number of
other carbohydrates
""
for example  the  skeletal material  of insects  and
 sea animals like shrimps  and crabs and lobsters  is made  of
 made up of a polymer   of  which is a sugar  modified sugar
 glucose i mean 
""
and this polymer  is called chitin 
""
at present there is lot of interest  in this  polymer  
these  because it occurs  to a very large extent  among the sea
 animals 
""
 we're  all familiar  with the  cane sugar industry
""
""
cane sugar  is one of the cheapest  and  purest 
organic material  which is available 
""
it is more than ninety-nine percent pure
""
and its cost is  anywhere from  rupees  seven 
to ten 
""
then we have  the cotton  which is the basis  for 
all  textiles 
""
whether hundred percent cotton  or blended cotton 
""
similarly paper  as i mentioned earlier is essentially 
cellulose 
""
and  the paper is made  from  the wood  which is
chipped  and then converted into pulp  and then  later on 
converted into  the paper  which we use for writing 
""
recently  we have  a  one word  industry  which
is  uh based in india  and in pakistan 
""
and  cultivation of it is mostly  in rajasthan  haryana
 gujarat  and punjab 
""
although  in india we have  modified  many of these 
corbohydrate polymers  like cellulose  starch  and gums 
""
when we  compare  the level of  technology  available
in our country  vis-a-vis  the advanced countries  we have still 
far to go 
""
even though  india has made considerable progress  in 
utilizing  its own sources  of carbohydrate materials  and 
based on this  several industries  old and new  have been set up
""
""
""
dr shrivastav has very much  elaborated the industrial uses
of carbohydrates 
""
now dr k r bhattacharya who is present with us  and he is an
expert in food  uh carbohydrates 
""
he can additionally tell us about the  technology we have  in
carbohydrate utilization as food 
""
""
you know  one of the primary  requisites of the food
 as we like it  is its texture 
""
by texture i mean  the qualities  of how we  perceive
the material in our mouth 
""
whether it is hard  or soft  whether it sticks to the mouth
 to the teeth  or whether it doesn't stick 
""
whether the food crumbles when you bite  or it slowly melts 
""
so  the   it is  liquidic  or it is soft 
""
now  this is   the totality of these  is called
texture 
""
now take the taste of  uh the potato chips  dr shrivastav has
mentioned  or the  the popcorn 
""
now that has crumbled uh  if you take  uh potato as such 
then  it is soft  it doesn't crumble like that 
""
or  take for instance  the case of   idli 
 which is a very popular food in south india and now has become very
popular throughout india 
""
now it has a definite texture
""
 it's  extremely soft  and pliable  and yet  it
doesn't     i i     it's    not pliable
in the sense that it  it deforms slowly     i i i  
 it   brakes 
""
  it is   it is   soft  and yet 
breakable 
""
now the point i am trying to say is  that  this particular
characteristic food  this called your food  its texture  is
contributed most importantly by its carbohydrate contents 
""
a rice contains starch  about ninety percent starch 
""
maize contains about eighty percent starch  potato contains 
but for its water content  virtually     mo   
more   than ninety-five percent of starch
""
so if  if if cornflake and  and potato chips 
""
and there are other materials which contain other kinds of uh 
monosaccharide polysaccharide or different kinds of carbohydrates 
""
now it is these carbohydrate content which  contribute to the
largest extent  to the texture 
""
to our perceptions of food  as we like it
""
the food have not only nutritional content  not only  its 
taste perse but also the texture perception  by which  we like  or
dislike a kind of food 
""
""
dr bhattacharya  you've  given a very interesting
example 
""
and i suppose the texture of  the same carbohydrate food can be
modified  like a  cooked vegetable made from potatoes that has one
texture 
""
and the chips have quite a different texture
""
so i think this is a part of your technology  that we can change
the texture  of the same material 
""
""
yes uh  prof mathur what you say is very right 
""
uh  as you mentioned  potato has one texture 
""
potato fried in a particular way has one texture
""
potato fried in a different way  and in different form has a
slightly different texture 
""
but uh  what i would like to  stress is  it is not only
the way you prepare  it is not only the way  you process  but also
the inherent  inherent uh  composition uh  inherent  trite
  content  quantity  quality  of the carbohydrate  could
play a very important role 
""
""
dr bhattacharya as in one aspect  on which you might stress
upon  is the energy  which is uh  given by the carbohydrate 
material that are ingested by people 
""
because this is the family source of energy 
""
""
beside texture energy is a very important  factor 
which is contributed by  carbohydrates 
""
""
yeah  i think  it's  a very good point  dr
srivastav and dr mathur has reminded me 
""
we eat food for  for primarily two reasons 
""
one is for  energy  and the other is  for  various 
constituents that our body needs 
""
uh energy means  various energy doesn't necessarily mean only
the work that we do 
""
we need energy not only for the work we do  but our body itself
is doing millions of functions continously 
""
even if we lie perfectly still  and that  even then we need
 approximately twelve hundred to    fifty    
fifteen   hundred calories per day  just to maintain our body
functions 
""
now  as dr srivastav  very rightly mentioned  it is the
food  which enables us  to obtain  that is this energy and  carry
out our functions 
""
now it has been shown that carbohydrate particularly starch 
sugar  they contain  approximately four  calories  it is a kind
of unit  a measure  like uh  inch  or metre  or gram 
""
it is a kind of measure of energy 
""
each gram of  sugar or starch  or carbohydrate material 
contains approximately four  calory of energy  per gram 
""
so  if we need uh   let's  say on an average  some
two thousand  calories per day  an average man 
""
then you can  say  we would have needed if we  ate
carbohydrate alone we would have needed approximately  five hundred grams
of carbohydrates 
""
of course we don't eat this much because we eat other things as
well
""
you know we not only eat carbohydrates but we eat  proteins and
fat
""
and fat supplies  much more energy for the  unit weight 
as compared to carbohydrates 
""
so as uh dr shrivastav has very rightly said  supplier of
energy 
""
but uh  i'll  again come back  uh human  being's 
 needs  now satiation is a factor 
""
so liking  is a  major  one word  provide that we
enjoy our food and  that's  why you eat 
""
we just  when we eat we just  don't  think  that we
must maintain our body and we must have nutrition 
""
we enjoy food so we eat 
""
and the texture  is a very very important part of the content
""
""
dr p m shah  the technologist  in a carbohydrate based
industry will elaborate  about the prospects of this industry 
""
 it's  relevence to national development  and  our
technology compared to international standard 
""
""
now the relevence of this carbohydrate  or carbohydrate
chemistry  is very much in usage  to human life 
""
right from morning when you get up  you use either a
carbohydrate  or its product 
""
take for example in the morning   you're  doing like 
using a tooth paste 
""
it contains a product  of carbohydrate 
""
secondly  you go for a breakfast  you have got something 
on starch 
""
you wear clothes  it is made up of either cellulose  which
is a carbohydrate 
""
or  it is processed with a carbohydrate called starch  for
sizing or finishing 
""
then you come  to the uh children  for as a confectionery
 there it is a product of carbohydrate 
""
then you come  to the medicine  which is required  either
by young boy  or a woman or an old man  it is also  containing some
products of carbohydrate chemistry 
""
then  the industry  is  such a marvellous industry 
that none of its product  is used  is wasted  or it is completly
utilized 
""
take for example the manufacturing of starch 
""
there  you take either rice starch  or maize starch  or a
 one word  starch 
""
all its constituents  are either converted into starch  or
 its uh  ingredients  are used somewhere in the cattle feeds  or
 in some other indusrty 
""
so the beauty of this industry  is that nothing is wasted 
""
even the waste water  is used for one of the based industry
called pharmaceutical industry 
""
so you can understand the    rele    relevence
  of this industry  in the human life 
""
now coming  to the other aspect of  man uh this   
natio     national   important things  other things
""
""
now our industry  say as for example starch industry  or 
its other products  which is called   refinery   refined 
 products 
""
that is the total productions of the country  is to the tune of
around two hundred  crores  of  rupees  
""
and  we are utilizing  nearly about  two hundred
thousand tonnes of grains 
""
say in terms  when i say grain i  usually   mentioned
  mention    maize 
""
then  to the exchequer  it is giving  nearly about thirty
to thirty-five  crores  of  rupees  
""
not only that  but it gives a direct employment  to more
than eight thousand people 
""
and indirect  employment to the other  eight to ten thousand
of people 
""
now this is just  i give you a small  uh some idea 
about the industry 
""
now what are we manufacturing  in carbohydrate industry  ?
""
we take right from the grain 
""
we process the grain  and separate its ingredients  of which
it is composed of 
""
it is composed of  if you take a maize  it is composed of
four parts 
""
one is called  oil  bearing substance called germ  then
protein which is a protein like substance  then starch which is a
carbohydrate  and fiber  which is called a celluline birch 
""
now similarly also in  one word   or in rice  you
have got  not only same proportion  but a different proportion of
starch  and fiber or celluline  substances 
""
now  technically speaking  when we are  doing this
carbohydrate industry  starch or a refinery product  our 
machinaries  are practically comparable  to what  we have got  in
the most advanced countries 
""
not only that  but our products are meeting  the standards
and specifications  of international  requirements 
""
you take our products  it meets i p standard  but  it
also meets u s standard  or british standard 
""
that is all our products  are meeting the standards 
""
therefore  you can very well understand  that the processes
that we are using  it   the technology that we are adopting  is
same  as what  all other advanced countries are using 
""
and technologically i don't think  we will be in any way 
away or slightly different 
""
only thing we may have  some difficulty  that  the
advancement  of the computerization  which  is  available in the
western countries may not be here  because  we have to use either a
human  or we have to use a human as well as a mechanical man  not that
much of computerization
