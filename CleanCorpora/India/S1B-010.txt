""
""
see children  i will be uh  talking about weathering
once again  okay 
""
 we'll  be talking about  weathering 
""
now just behave as if  you've  not learnt this chapter okay
""
 i'll  start with from the beginning 
""
now  the atmospheric   conditions   condition 
  is never constant 
""
it keeps on changing  okay
""
there is always   throughout you have   rise and fall
of the temperature  okay
""
now  as this rise and fall of the temperature  affects 
human being our skin for example  you find that in the cold season 
your skin get shrivelled 
""
it get shrivelled it get  cracked
""
your lips get cracked 
""
so they are subject to  that  the changes in the 
atmosphere  okay
""
the rise and fall in the temperature 
""
now similarly this atmospheric condition this rise and fall of the
temperature also affect other components  for example the rocks 
""
now like  how  the wear and tear of a skin  similarly the
rocks are also subjected to such wear and    tear   okay
""
due to the rise and fall of the temperature  the rocks are also
affected 
""
now how they are affected ?
""
 we'll  be doing   we will  i will be discussing
that also shortly 
""
now this wear and    te    tear   
 it's  this uh atmospheric  ke  changes in the
atmosphere     a    affect   the rock and this
rock  get soften  breaks up into pieces 
""
so this is known as  weathering 
""
the softening  and the breaking up of rocks  is termed as
""
""
 tear  
""
""
weathering
""
""
okay
""
the wear and tear
""
like how our skin  for example get shrivelled gets cracked 
or even in the hot summer season you find it very dry  okay
""
you find your skin getting very dry
""
similarly the rocks are also subjected to such wear and tear 
""
and this  that  exist  so the rocks  been uh they 
are exposed to the atmosphere always 
""
they are always exposed to the atmosphere 
""
this wear and tear of the rock  the softening  and the
breaking up of rock is termed as
""
""
weathering
""
""
okay
""
so could you repeat the definition weathering
""
yes ranjeet  ?
""
""
there are  uh there are  the wear and tear   of
  of   rocks by the  atmosphere upon the rock is called
weathering 
""
""
yes of  cou  upon uh
""
so the softening and the breaking up of rock  in geographical
term  is defined as    weathering  weathering
""
""
 weathering  
""
""
sit down take your seat  okay
""
now this weathering  can be classified into  two types 
okay
""
chemical weathering and    mechanical weathering 
""
""
 mechanical weathering  
""
""
okay
""
we classify this weathering into  chemical  and mechanical
""
""
okay now what is this mechanical weathering  ?
""
that is mechanical weathering is caused  because of  the
rise that difference in temperature  the variations in temperatures 
cause mechanical  weathering 
""
so how does it take place ?
""
what happens to the rock because of the variations in temperature
 ?
""
what happens  ?
""
the rock gets  expa  any  ma  now rock material 
when heated gets    expanded  expanded
""
""
 expanded  
""
""
expanded when cooled get    contracted  contracted
""
""
 contracted  
""
""
okay
""
so variations in temperature  how does it afffect this rock  ?
""
the rocks in the hot summer season  gets expanded  and when
the temperature falls in the winter season gets    contracted 
contracted
""
""
 contracted  
""
""
so this expansion and contraction  in the  for  co
 for a  long  in a  course of time  what happens ?
""
the rock   become   becomes   loose 
""
it gets weathered 
""
it gets weathered  it gets weathered and it starts crumbling 
breaking up into  pie  breaking up into    pie   
small pieces   and from the small pieces into gravel  from gravel
into very fine particle  noise  and it becomes ultimately   
sand  
""
so the sandy nature of the desert is the result of  ?
<$ch
""
 sand  
""
""
mechanical weathering
""
""
 cough 
""
mechanical  weathering
""
so this mechanical weathering is caused  because of uh  the
variations in   temperature 
""
""
 temperature  
""
""
and the variations in temperatures are change in atmosphereic
conditions  okay
""
the changes in atmospheric condition
""
this  uhm   we'll  just recall what is mechanical
weathering complete with this  pavle  
""
how would you describe mechanical weathering  ?
""
""
the disintegration of rock
""
""
yes the disintegration of rock right 
""
due to what  ?
""
disintegrate means what ?
""
breaking up 
""
so why  how  does it break up  ?
""
""
the change in temperature
""
""
the change in temperature
""
the rise and fall in temperature
""
yes   in most   in detail   
""
manasi  ?
""
""
teacher  dis 
""
""
just elaborate on the topic
""
""
disintegration of the uh  rock into the chemical process is
called mechanical weathering
""
""
yes
""
""
due to chemical changes uh 
""
""
i am talking of only mechanical weathering
""
""
the changes in the physical temperature  so that rock
changes weathers it then uh it gets uh
""
""
how does it get weathered ?
""
""
the small pieces travels and fallen into the tanks  when
large pieces
""
""
but you haven't explained how does it get weathered  ?
""
how does it get weathered ?
""
if mechanical weathering  is uh result of  the variations in
   temperature 
""
""
 temperature  
""
""
so how does the variations in temperature affect rock ?
""
okay let her answer
""
""
changes in temperature affect rock  when the temperature
gets more hot the rock uh expand
""
""
the temerature gets more hot or temperature rises
""
""
the rock is expanded and when it cools down the rock the rock
also get contracted
""
""
yes
""
""
due to uh  this process   of rock finally get  uh
uh   rock finally breaks    cough  up into pieces 
cough  because of more weathering it breaks   it   to 
 form sand
""
""
yes 
""
so the sandy nature of uh desert is the result of  
mechanical weathering 
""
""
 mechanical weathering  
""
""
anything more to say  ?
""
okay  okay
""
so this  was what  is mechanical   weathering 
""
now what is chemical weathering  ?
""
now this rock material  contains various minerals present in it
""
""
okay see
""
""
 weathering  
""
""
now   this uh    in this   atmosphere
the various components of atmosphere
""
what are the various components of atmosphere ?
""
if you recall your  earlier portion done in the  lower
classes
""
what are the various components of atmosphere  ?
""
""
water vapour oxygen gases
""
""
this  water vapour  gases  nitrogen oxygen
carbondioxide  various gases   presented   present  
in the  organ 
""
then uh dust particles  these are all components of the
atmosphere
""
now  now these chemical these components like water uh
carbondioxide  water vapour  they change  the chemical composition
of the   rock 
""
""
 rock  
""
""
and when the chemical composition of the rock is changed 
it is termed as   chemical weathering 
""
""
 chemical weathering  
""
""
okay 
""
so the various other components of the atmosphere  like water
vapour  uh then carbondioxide  nitrogen  and the way other  uh
these  organ   dust particles they act upon the rocks 
""
the chemical composition present in the rocks is changed 
""
and this is the   results do   result   
""
and  then  this is then subjected to various  changes
 even the chemical composition of the rock changes
""
again it gets weathered 
""
and this can be termed as   chemical weathering 
""
so we learnt what is weathering  the definition of weathering
""
""
that the weathering can be classified into  mechanical we have
learnt mechanical and    chemical 
""
""
 chemical weathering  
""
""
 chemical  
""
""
mechanical is the result of  the   variations in
temperature 
""
""
 variations in temperature  
""
""
while  chemical weathering is  the
""
""
the chemical composition of the rock is changed
""
""
the chemical composition of the rock is changed 
""
gets changed  because of the action of  these components
""
components like    water-vapour  carbondioxide 
etcetera
""
""
 water-vapour carbondioxide  
""
""
 is  they act upon the minerals in the rock 
""
they act upon the components and the minerals of the rock and 
 the   the   composition of this rock  is changed 
""
so this can be termed as    chemical weathering 
""
""
 chemical weathering  
""
""
okay 
""
now  now we move to uh   at now besides  the
variations in temperature  besides these  uh uhm chemical composition
getting changed because of the other components in the atmosphere
""
there are  others also  other methods other ways also by
which  the rock is weathered  okay 
""
i hope you are familiar with the term weathered now
""
what do you mean by weathering and what is weathering of the rock
 ?
""
okay now various other factors are also there
""
now  there are  various external agents of uh  the nature
""
""
okay which act upon the different components in the atmosphere 
okay
""
now this external agent  can you tell me what are the external
agents of uh nature ?
""
yes raja  ?
""
""
 one word  
""
""
external agents of nature  which acts upon the rocks
""
""
   wa wa wa wa    water  
""
""
water yes 
""
rain water ground water  then  glacier  spring 
""
""
seawave  wind 
""
""
yes 
""
""
wind 
""
""
wind  seawave yes
""
they all erode and   weathered   weather  
the rock particles in the  atmosphere  okay
""
now  this rain water  the rain water which falls on the
earth surface  okay
""
they go down in the    fo  they can they are  in
  form   they join the seas    they   they
  form    rivu    rivulet   
""
they   go into the they   get  percolated into the
  ground and they form ground water 
""
other then that the rain water also  is  the 
responsible  for the weathering of    rocks  
""
""
 rocks  
""
""
how  ?
""
how is the rain water responsible for weathering of rocks ?
""
we saw  how the variations in temperature  affect the rock
and how the rocks get weathered  okay
""
we saw  how the chemical components of    atmos 
how the components of   atmosphere    are  act upon the
minerals in the rock and    chem    chemical  
composition gets changed  and we saw how weathering takes place 
""
now we shall see how this rain water acts upon  the rock and
how the rock is weathered because of rain water 
""
okay the rain water which falls on the earth   cough 
surface  gets into  uh it falls and it gets into it also enters the
rock
""
how  ?
""
""
the cracks
""
""
from the cracks of the rock  they enter the   cracks
  cracks   of the rock  okay
""
so this rain water gets collected  in the crack of   a
  the     rock 
""
""
 rock  
""
""
now  when the temperature falls  when the temperature
falls  this water  doesn't remain as water as well  what happens ?
""
""
  it freezes 
""
""
 it freezes    in  the  extreme cool
temperature the water freezes and forms   ice 
""
""
 ice  
""
""
now ice requires    more place 
""
""
 more place  
""
""
it requires  more place than water 
""
so what will happen ?
""
when they form ice it requires more places  and so therefore
the rock   is  has to get   gets   expanded 
""
the rock has to get expanded  okay
""
the rock expands  the rock expands  and the crack  
 widen  
""
""
 widen  
""
""
the crack   widen  
""
""
 widen  
""
""
so this is also  again in course of time  this doesn't
happen in  a  day or two  or in a year or two
""
in course of time  in course of time  ultimately what
happens to those particular rock  ?
""
""
the rock
""
""
it gets   it  disintegrated it gets  broken up
and  they   the weathering of rock  takes place 
""
so rain water is another factor  which causes   
weathering  which causes weathering
""
""
 weathering  
""
""
okay 
""
now  uh other creature   other  the other  
other than   all this  even human beings  even living beings
 are responsible for the weathering of rock   cough  for
example  the rat  which   burrows itself   which makes
burrows    or digs underground soil to live inside that 
""
earthworms  there are so many other  these  creatures
which live under the    soil  soil okay 
""
so they in course of time by burrowing the soil and eating up the
 they uh  weather the rock  they weather the rock material and these
are also  one of the uh causes why the rock gets   weathered 
""
""
""
 soil  
""
""
 weathered
