uhm mr yadav you told something about your native place na  yeah which is your native place  native place is uh u p azamgarh  oh i see  so when did you finish your m a degree  in fact i finished my m a some uh from the university of jabalpur madhya pradesh  uhm i see  that means uh you finished it in the university itself  which year could you tell me the year  yeah  right in nineteen eighty-seven  after that what have you been doing since then  infact after uh in uh nineteen eighty-seven almost uh  in july i got my degree m a degree and uh after that i taught in a college almost for four year uh four months and uh of course and uh after that  since it was a private college and uh i didn't hope much from this college  and meanwhile fortunately i got a job in state government school and uh i took up this job now i'm  going on with this job   oh is that  uh uh are you happy with this present job   it's all it laughs to a certain extent  uh i'm happy  but since it's a very interior part of uh jabalpur city  so sometimes i don't find uhm me at ease  eh in the in the sense it was uh high i'm  appointed there as a english teacher uh but things are quite different there i don't find people who can uh speak with me in english ah or even whenever i teach in in the classes uh i quiet often i used by mother tongue hindi so from uh my part i like something that uh   ah   it means uh since you do not get the opportunity to use english outside the classroom or even inside the classroom you are not fully satisfied with the present job   oh yeah well i'm not uh fully satisfied  because in fact uh english is a second language for me and  uh unless uh we uh take up or continue with the uhm unless we follow the uhm four available skills of learning second language  then i don't think it will be better for a learner to develop or uh okay i understand that now since you are doing the p g c t now after going back  is it possible for you to use simple english in the classroom itself yeah i would like to uhm use simple english as much as uh possible  since uh student there where i teach they're  not able to understand uh even simple sentences  but even then i would like to do uhm my best particularly i would like to use english sentences simple sentences so that uh they can uh make an effort to understand the sentences  yeah that's what i also feel better because  to to begin with you can use simple english simple sentences and uh after one month or so on after one month or so  you can increase the standard step by step  and i think you'll be successful in using english inside the classroom also  and when you meet some friends when you go here and there to different places you can use uh english and so i think uh you can improve a lot  then what's your future plan  that is uh to continue the school or to search for another job  well uhm infact uh i need a lot of improvement  particularly in my spoken english and uh particularly pronunciation stress intonation and uh there're uh other fields of english there i find myself uh uhm but i realise that uh i lack something  so my next plan would be eh to take up diploma course from c i e f l hyderabad and i wish i would be able to do my best  yeah now i've understood uh much from you i've  understood your carrer and so on  but so far i've not informed to you anything about me  uhm well you as you know my name is chandrashekhar  and actually i belong to the south india tamil nadu  kanyakumari district  and presently i'm teaching in st joseph's college  chakama kohima nagaland  teaching in a college where there is p u degree pre degree  then b a also is there  b a two year plus one year  b a pass course and b a honours   i'm teaching there for all the three year students and i'm happy with my job  uhm salary is okay  then the people the students are also well co-operative then my wife is also working in the college so everything is quite okay with me  uh if you want to know something more about me you are free to ask  uh when did you get this job  i got this job in nineteen eighty-six nineteen nineteen eighty-six  and uh when did you finish your post graduate my post graduation degree i finished it in uh mid june nineteen eighty-six june nineteen eighty-six   yes  and immediately after that in july nineteen eighty-six i joined the post yeah all right uh in fact since you're also doing your uh post graduation certificate in teaching english uh after i hope as you are doing well and laughs and uh you are supposed to get good grade as well in the what would be your next step  are you going to take up your diploma course or uh if you get suppose if you get uh uh a grade or a plus  then uh would you like to take up your m litt certainly master of litt yeah certainly  i my ambition is this one to do my diploma and complete my m litt then if possible m phil also so that i can cover the literature side also english literature then at last do my ph d it's my aim  but i think things will go on well  shall i take your opinion about your  academic career  uh you talk talk about your m phil and diploma as well but i don't think it's my own opinion uh once you have degree of uh diploma in the teaching of english from c i e f l hyderabad and most of the universities of our country uh have uh accepted this diploma equivalent to m phil degree  then i don't think it would better for you to do again  your m phil  and it would be better to do your m litt after your diploma yeah what you've said is correct but uh after doing m phil uh diploma i directly wanted to  do my m litt course  and then if possible i'll cover up in order to cover up the literature area also i feel like doing m phil if possible suppose if uh you finish your m litt i think it's  your ambition and is a desire as well  and then uh would you like to think something uh about your ph d  quite often we find people interested uh in doing ph d  uhm somewhere even some from the from some universities but uh doing ph d from c i e f l hyderabad is not an easy task  because uh we are supposed to perform well there only then ph d degree is awarded there so uh what is your next plan what about your next plan in future to do your ph d from c i e f l hyderabad or some uh other universities of our country  it is yet uhm uhm very interesting question that you have asked me  actually it is not an easy task to do our ph d from c i e  especially in e l t  but before that i want to give extra reading to improve myself  so that i can when i finish my diploma m litt and m phil  with wider reading i think i'll be able to uh complete my ph d very well in a satisfactory way  okay you have told me all about yourself now could you tell me something about your family background  your parents and how many children are there in the family and so on  right i infact my family is cons consist of  uh six seven members seven members  uh my parents and uh my two brothers and uh two sisters and i've a wife and i've a son as well right infact my father is uh at calcutta he is in port trust as a cargo officer there and uh next year sometime uh in june he is going to  retire  and uh as far as uh my question is concerned i'm  the man uhm yeah  are you the eldest in the family  yeah no my one of my sister is the youngest  i'm sorry eldest and uh i'm the next to her  i see  what about you would you like to uhm give some details about yourself why not sure see in our family we're five children to our parents  three sisters and two brothers including me  my both the parents are farmers only  my eldest sister is married to a police officer  he is in tamil nadu  the second sister is married to a n j c o serving in the army and myself you know a lot about me since we've  been staying for a long time  not long time about two weeks back  then my youngest younger brother he is doing his b e now then youngest one is doing her b a class b a economics   so   what about your wife ah i forgot to tell me laughs tell you about my wife  i'm sorry  uhm she is also a post graduate in english  and she is working in the same college  along with you along with me  and i've got a son also yeah that's the thing yeah laughs he is one year old and one year and two months old  a very naughty boy  naughty boy  yeah very clever he has got after you say like this quiet naughty boy cough  yeah children are supposed to be naughty at the beginning hope it is  but he is very clever so everything is well  and uh i like the family i'm a happy man so to so to say  that is the matter uh for you its good that you have uh a wife and a son  you must be very happy man having a wife who is working with you in the same college  and uh don't you think uh whenever you work in the same college you find some sort of uh uhm problem  problem i mean uh working in a same college in same in the same de department  don't you find uh some sort of trouble or some sort of  cont or controversy as such  you see uh  there is no trouble or problem as such  but the only problem with us is getting leave from  the principal   that's the only problem  when she wants to do any course or anything she can't get leave and when i want to do anything i also i'm not free to get leave  this is the only problem we face when we work together in the same college and nothing else  the other things are okay because we're working in the same place  and we have the opportunity of being together always and it is something interesting  a few days infact i would like to take you to uhm i would like to take you in this politics  and uh i think uh you you must be familiar uh with the conditions going on that our country is facing  uhm political disasters and uh disorders and election has taken place a few weeks earlier  and uh what shall would be your opinion and that no party again has come into power and i think uh uh in your opinion as far as my opinion is concerned i would like to uh uh i want uh if india needs uh  british rule or uh next alternative  what would be the next alternative would you like to suggest  but uh clearing the throat what has happened this year is really a political disaster  but even then i still have faith in democracy  but all the political systems ha have their own defects  even then i believe in democracy and uh india needs a better leader  one who can do and one who can do well for the people now we have been talking about everything since you belong to  since you belong to m p could you tell me something about your state  it's alright infact i went to jabalpur  a well known city of uh m p state  i went there in nineteen eighty-five  i uh before uh i had uh no sort of any idea about uh m p and uh but there i found people particularly in the field of pol politics  there politics is based on some sort of principles  and uh leaders are supposed to do some work concrete work  uh for the public  and infact uh same people sometime they favour uh  congress-i and sometime they favour   bharatiya janata party but they're but infact there uh politics is based there uh on uh some sort of principles  they are not going to show the same beaten track like uh  other states u p bihar where politics is totally based on uhm casteism
