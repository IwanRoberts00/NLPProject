""
""
uh you know the university
""
""
 a few words  as it is
""
""
of course we speak on  one or two words 
""
""
uh
""
""
so specially  when i heard about this indian english today
morning  i felt  uh that uh  he did not specifically  point
out uh  what exactly is indian english 
""
because uh  in our room  there is a maharashtrian  and uh
there is a punjabi    kannadian   kannadiga   and 
 we've  some of telugu speaking people 
""
but when all of us were speaking conversing in the conversation 
i didn't find much difference  one from the other 
""
but uh in the class room situation sometimes  uh we find 
students  they're  trying to speak in english  uh they  bring
in that  uh telugu accent  but uh they don't have much to refer 
""
uh when i teach also  whenever i teach use the correct accent
 sometimes  i've  to come down to their level and uh speak
otherwise  they may not be able to learn from this
""
""
yes yes 
""
""
they make take up for example word like uh work    uh
 you know unless they spell it  sometimes they may not be able to read
it up  even when i read
""
""
 uh  
""
""
so  at that level  uh sometimes uh  a butler 
speaking uh somebody who are influenced by  people who are speaking
english  picked up words 
""
such people when they are speaking  there may be some difference
in accent or  uh their use in the words 
""
but generally the educated uh  people i don't find much
variation  but in uh  accent there may be a variation 
""
so what do you think about that variation ?
""
""
of course i agree with you to so many time 
""
but still i think  the influence of the vernacular  language
 is there on indian english 
""
for example  the latters are not in the habits of 
pronouncing the  for example there is   a a   a  
jocular statement also 
""
if anyone is going there  in the  veranda  
if   a   a   bengali happens to see him  he just says
like this    he's  wandering in the  verandah
  
""
he won't pronounce the v such a differences may be there
""
""
of   all   all   the accents
""
""
accent
""
""
that accent may be different
""
""
accent may be different  but as far as the language and
other parts are concerned  there may not be  much difference 
""
only accent and intonation  may be different  because 
every individual is habituated to a particular accent and intonation 
depending upon the vernacular language  which he is say have just
habituated to use  from the time of birth  till the end 
""
these vocal chords should be adjusted  in such a way  that
uh they always  uh  they're   in favour of  a such a kind
of particular intonation and accent 
""
""
 that's  why  the difference  if at all is the
difference is there  in indian english  depending on the various
states  in this country 
""
it is mainly as you said  it is mainly which is not an
intonation and accent  as far as the language part is concerned 
vocabulary is concerned  one need not find uh
""
""
naturally you won't find much difference 
""
""
so what i  wanted to impress upon you is uh  the
influence of english on vernacular languages  definitely is there  
 yeah 
""
in even in telugu sometimes when we use the word like  uh
master    yes  english word
""
""
 yeah  
""
""
 yes  
""
""
but it has come down to the level of uh  becoming
completely vernacular word  master
""
""
i know
""
""
so  that difference is there  and i can understand that
""
""
and the same way these languages uh  might be influencing
english 
""
and the indian writers writing in english  especially persons
like r k narayan and uh  raja rao then come down to  one word 
""
""
raja rao made an experiment
""
""
he made an experiment 
""
even uh  r k narayan was writing  he tried specifically to
bring in indian humour  flavour indian kind of words in indian english
""
""
uh so that way deliberately or  unintentionally  these people
might have brought some words of indianism  or indian words into the 
literature part 
""
but indian english as it is  because whole india is filled by
speaking   english   english   in india 
""
so indian english as it is  gramatically  or uh 
vocabulary wise  or lexican uh what you call it 
""
then i don't mind such difference 
""
see because uh  we were taught only what is the standardise
english 
""
and you know the newspapers magazines  so magazines is just uh
mostly trying to imitate uh american english 
""
specially these uh  film magazines or uh the  one word 
""
""
then american english because they are more uh stylish 
""
""
stylish 
""
""
so  british english is easier than
""
""
easier because they have brought such a changes  which you
which uh which adopt and make you easy
""
""
but then uh another kind of uh people we come across these
days  uh the children special who are taken in uh  uh christian schools
or uh
""
""
missionary
""
""
uh urbanised schools  say public schools  that we all
know means special group their accent pronunciation is something very
artificial
""
""
yes
""
""
you see most note particular  group and particular group
they alone can understands what they speak 
""
but in general if they rightly try to speak to other people  uh
those sentences mean their sometimes artifical pronunciation 
""
 they're  trying to drag a new word in the conversation
unnecessary accent and something attracting something 
""
means that is another kind of trend which going on
""
""
going on  in all catholics
""
""
so  another thing is uh they  isolate themeselves 
feeling that they are uh quiet superior  because they are able to speak so
fluently that language and   american   american  
language 
""
so that trend is  formed 
""
but what i  what really to grasp from  uh    from
his lecture  from this lecture 
""
what exactly is the meaning of english  ?
""
mean how really it differs from this standardized british english
or uh  whatever you may call it 
""
""
 from his lecture  
""
""
 nei  the language as people say there is
nothing like real standard  because uh people  use it as uh  i mean
if you come to telugu telugu is spoken in different styles and  
different ways  and though we  mannerise literature in telugu  and
cinemas in telugu  is using a particular kind of standerdised english
telugu 
""
""
 yes  there's  different styles  
""
""
that way some people are influenced 
""
but if you come to a place like uh  hyderabad  and  it's
 mostly more  uh your accent is completely urdu  kind 
""
when you go to orissa  in uh berrakpur  uh
""
""
in orissa oriya
""
""
oriya is there completely 
""
when you go to chittoor definitely  you'll  find the 
southern influence is there 
""
see the word  completely  one word  uh  one or two
words in telugu  in   in telugu we use it 
""
""
 kannada influence  
""
""
yes  so that dialectical differences you find in every
language  and otherwise the language cannot survive 
""
""
yeah 
""
you heard some time ago as you made it into request
""
""
but what exactly is indian english  ?
""
 i'm  unable to ring with that 
""
""
yes of course  this is how from his speech we would gain
 uh i think  one word  but to uh  we can try and analyse 
""
indian english  i think  it is more  identifiable based
on literature other than languages    uh i know  correct
""
""
 uh i know  
""
""
yeah  that's  my point
""
""
as far as language is concerned    uhm  we cannot
find much difference  except this latest information that are going on
there in  in england or in american  whose mother tongue is english
""
""
basically the vocabulary  grammar part and all those things 
 they   they   remain  constant 
""
yet even in those things  there may be some slight changes
because  their mother tongue is uh    english  and they are
authorised to bring changes  depending upon the daily usage 
""
""
 uhm  
""
""
 english  
""
""
whereas it is our cultivated language  foreign language 
we are not authorised to bring  changes in grammar and all those things
""
 that's  why  we remain as we were 
""
where did you get those  uh wood laws entry  the grammar
vocabulary and all those things  were uh  almost all standardised in a
particular way 
""
still we carry on those things  without bringing any  uh
latest changes 
""
as far as the language is concerned  that's  true 
""
but  in my opinion  indian english differs completely  in
a way in all literature  indo-anglican literature 
""
that makes all the difference  uh about this  ind 
indian english 
""
because  it cannnot survive without uh literature of course 
""
""
what i think is  spoken english
""
""
if someone has uh gradual  tone  in his speech
""
""
that spoken english
""
""
as far as spoken english
""
""
spoken english accent will be different  some new words
might have come  some of the indianism might have come in there 
""
but basically  english language as it is  i don't think we
can go for transform very much to, branding of indian english  as much as
we brand american english
""
""
american english 
""
there is much difference in american
""
""
because uh they specifically they took a lot of efforts 
they changed it
""
""
intentionally they did it 
""
""
uhm  i mean they created their own dictionary 
""
means they don't like to call it an american english they want to
call it american language
""
""
american language 
""
""
but uh   i  in america also they have various kinds
of influence spanish language you know mean the negroes going they have their
own kind of accent 
""
so  even there the difference is there but uh they are
identified themselves with american language 
""
that way if compared to that  i don't find anything  uh
very much significant in indian  english 
""
uh i think indians pronounce or  the accent of indians  are
much better than the french men speaking english  or   right yet
 speaking english 
""
""
 yes  
""
""
but in the african continent  there is a specific  uh
influence of their own language and their own accent kind of english 
""
if you read uh  article in english novels  you find that
""
""
but in india  i don't think it has gone to that extent to
brand the indian english 
""
may be i don't know anything
""
""
eh no no  you are correct totally correct 
""
what  i'm  asking is   there's  no much  uh
difference as far as the language part is concerned grammar vocabulary and
all those things are concerned 
""
we can't find any difference  between english english and the
indian english 
""
but indian   english   english   can claim to
be different  can claim to be unique  basically  literature that is
these brought out from here  because the whole indo-anglican literature is
based  mainly    of course  mainly i have stressed  on the
indian tradition indian things indian culture  over whatever  a piece
of creative creative literature  that uh so called indo- anglican
literature if you refer to it prose poetry novel whatever it may be 
basically
""
""
 of course  
""
""
but there also you have to differentiate uh  see if a
person like naipaul
""
""
uhm
""
""
nobody call him like  language might have  very much
lived in the west
""
""
yes
""
""
then take another manohar mazumdar  very much lived in the
  western   west   and his writing developing means you
don't find much of the indianism 
""
though he treats indian  uh characters in    indian
english  but his language and the flow of language  i mean you don't
find  uh anything convertible like r k narayan    ah  means
means they like you let a autobiography of nehru  and autobiography of
gandhi 
""
there is a vast difference 
""
 nehru's  style is something very  naturally flowing 
""
