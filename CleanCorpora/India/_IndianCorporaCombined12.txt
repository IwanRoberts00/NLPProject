so when did you come ? i came today morning at seven o'clock  and i reached here i came by dakshin express from delhi first from amritsar i took a train and i came by ac fare  and from there i have to take another train which is this dakshin  express and uh i took second ac there  and i don't know how they're going to pay me now  laughs  there is more than the first class laughs   it's a pleasant experience  it was a pleasant experience but also very tiring this train is uh it takes thirty-six hours  and there is a faster train andhra express which takes just twenty-four hours  but the timing doesn't suit uhm how things are moving in punjab now-a-days ? punjab is much better now  and as you must have read in the papers as they say  eighty percent of the problem is solved  it is really solved because one can lead a normal life now  but twenty percent problem is there  twenty percent means that you don't feel it you see i mean crime is always there  so you can say some extortionist some terrorist whatever may be there  but for uh for practical purposes i mean when the life was disturbed that thing was not there what do you think about this ayodhya problem now ? i think it's a bad thing whatever has happened and uh i think the educated hindu people   they they also think the silent majority thinks that it's a wrong thing  i mean this is exactly what happened in punjab you know when  the akalis   do punjabi's think is it's  uh something wrong yeah will they be in favour of bjp ? no they think it's wrong  because a similar thing happened with the akalis  uh they started listening to people who were not within the party  like that bindrawala or uh modern things that worsened the terrorists or whatever so now bgp bjp has taken orders from uh  sadhus and sanyasis uhm yes so they don't face the same problem what i feel that it could turn out to be that way   sadhus and sanyasis  oh so it may turn out like a boomrang yes it i think it will be like that because you see  uh people majority as i said majority of the people they are aware of all this now  even the uneducated people many of them they want to live in peace  and all this disturbs peace  some people feel that there is a kind of new awareness  and because of that bjp is likely to be benefitted  there's no awareness  these are all political stunts i think  oh well are you happy here satyam ?  it's too early to say that but so far it's  fine  and uh i've to be careful of the mosquitoes here  laughter  and uh i think it should be fine and i had long desired to come here because uh it is the what you say mecca for uh english  english  you you don't have mosquitoes there in your home ? no we have mosquitoes there but mosquitoes of ciefl are famous laughter  i mean that what you told  uh you see the mosquitoes are there mosquito curtains are not there and uh  no you see we in amritsar there's it's  an extreme weather ah ha i mean it's very cold there now and it will be hotter than what is here now  so when it's severe cold mosquitoes will die out and  severe wint uh summers they'll again die  ah ha   mosquitoes are there  uhm so they are only some laughter  so you are free from mosquitoes  not throughout the year but of course and here you see the mosquitoes are well bred laughs uhm yes so there they die and then again they have to come up and then they attack  but i don't know why they can't control it  i mean in uh when i'm uh during the mosquito season in like amritsar and many cities especially in uh let's say some good colonies the municipalities they spray  so if the muncipality of hyderabad so what would be the reason then ? i think uh there should be a spray in the campus the mosquitoes we won't have them in the campus simple reason is if you want to control you can control if you don't laughter and so if ciefl is doing such good work in languages   ah it should do this little work of killing mosquitoes also  laughs   ah  so after uh hearing so much about uh ciefl  uhm and coming over here uhm uh what exactly you want to do ?  uhm   uhm  see actually i came here of course for refresher course that's all right to get refreshed laughter  and uh a friend of mine says uh the hyderabad is famous for pearls  he has given me some money to buy some  so i've up to look out for somebody who knows what pearls are because i don't know what they are haan  and there are a lot of uh artificial uh sellers uhm  so i will have to buy some pearls for a friend of mine and uh  i will visit uh there's a museum they say  haan   uhm  uh salarjung and uh a fort   that's why i wanted five days a week  and i also told dr prakasham to arrange something for atleast people from outside yes i mean you're you are an outsider yes yes  though of course you must have seen everything because you have been staying here  but still there are many could be many people who haven't  or a few of them so they have made the programme very tight   it's very correct  and they treat us as uh school children laughter   because they don't allow or they dont give any time to  they they can have the same number of sessions same number of speakers and uh with uh one lecture say if it's one and half hours make it one hour and with teacher there also he just keeps would you would you like to come out with uh your idea  when we find something is impo imposed from above uhm uhm then people accept it as it is  and  uh yes they don't want they say the ugc says so many working hours uhm sometimes the ugc says and we find uh what goes in political circle so i think what ever you think in academic also  i think what they should do is they should make it from  let's say five-thirty to six-thirty everyday  one hour is added there  cut off saturday and adding one hour means missing one hour  because laughter ) when the programme is too long you will naturally cut it short no in maharashtra what they say that there is  adeshraj uhm and as when something comes from above it could not be challenged whether it is rational or irrational  accept it and act upon it   uhm  uhm see that's on paper you see  no that laughter so   so little i requested them why not to turn some of the sessions into library sessions yeah and then all of us could have got benefitted what is this project that they are talking about ? you can have any project ah of your choice  ah  uhm if project means we can you have to say have particular topic you have to work on that topic and this is the way the thing could be done dealt  this is what you have to   achha so you just uh  you know synopsis of the project what is it ? no they don't give  haan  they don't give you have to have a data uhm for uh yes if you have a problem uhm uhm and then you work on that then you work on that either in the library or field or whatever it maybe so it's just like writing of the paper  that's all  that's all  suppose i want to work on two novels will it do ? oh yes  why two ? one one one yes that is nei but thay are also saying that you have to present a paper at the end that is the same work  when you work on a particular say a  nei nei they were talking about two different things that everybody has to speak for about ten minutes on something and then several others  nei once you have a project  uhn definitely you've to present a paper   nei but that's compulsory for all ? no that ten minutes business is compulsory  it's that is compulsory  so that again a paper and project is again a paper  no both in all you have faster than one or two words that will be for every body that is for everybody right  and the project the problem that you work on you have to present that also you have half an hour choice half an hour and then discussion discussion is also going to be about cross question and all what we have so i think the four speaker is going to be just this that is a just  uh first ten minutes talk and then half an hour talks  by the participants  see for pretty long time that practice teaching sessions are there  and still we find they are not ready to come out of that  so here also it's a kind of practice teaching  yeah  and as we find these things are not there we are there laughter  it is uh it is going to be you you are going to have b ed teaching no, not i but see paper reading comes to that  actually see in uh one months time is it possible for you to present a really something that can be called the research paper ? yeah on that project that's that's way research take here that's right  see when you get some grant from ugc or something like that then you have to present something  uhm uhm in one form or the other  no but i don't think uh this must be the case in other refresher courses might not be this is a kind of thing in other refresher courses what atmosphere you find  atleast you find here after noon sessions are there there are no afternoon sessions  i did my first at pune and what atmosphere no refresher  so no afternoon sessions nothing like that  achha you've done one only from nine to one and then completely free  now they were i think about five uh different refresher courses now this yes one is uh one is at jaipur uh pune uh at yes vishakapatnam no no trivandrum shimla  my catchment area was simla  uh but i didn't want to go there and from cold amritsar to colder simla say laughter  the freezing point  so i wanted to come to number number one of course hyderabad  uh and i wanted to come and also that it'll be nice here in my case what happened we were at the ulakh vidyanagar  shriraman and myself uhm uhm  and shriraman is the co-ordinator co-ordinator here  so why not uh why don't you come to hyderabad  uhm uhm   co-ordinator  okay it's alright  that's how i'm in hyderabad  laughter  and we've only six from out of hundred and five applicants yes that's what you were of course very fortunate very fortunate laughter but what what must be the criterion for this ? one criterion he has mentioned laughter  that is the one  that's right that is the one that's right so one he has mentioned no but what i must be find even for that the other things are there i brought my english from one word now i'm  on there correspondence department oh you think you are only not because uh he knows me and i know him  that's not the thing  that way i was lucky to know dr prakashan also laughter  you know how it is particularly what i like uh what you said  a few words in sanskrit   he's a very laughter  he is a very practical man  he's uh i did my m phil from patiala ah he was there in the department called anthropological linguistic  oh  that department was started by this professor called professor ranjit gill  he is in jnu in what is that department of uh uh department of english  ah   oh  technologist i think school of language school of language he is a professor there uhm  he had started all that department  and dr kasiwal was also there  and he taught us phoenetics that time and i know him since then  and very  uhn  but uh so what what is appli no what is applicable to me  the same thing is applicable to him also laughter  hey you prakash laughter
