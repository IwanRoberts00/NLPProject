""
""
 laughs 
""
both of you how do you find this  your course  ?
""
""
well   clears her throat   it's  quite
interesting  i mean uh  like uh  when it really comes to 
practical point of view  it's  quite interesting 
""
now at the moment we are just uh blindly studying  regarding all
the  uh how the  uhm dental materials  used and how are the 
things that are mixed together 
""
and like  what are the materials that are used for dentures and
what are the  materials that are used for fillings and everything 
mixing dying and then  setting them everything we are dealing in 
dental material 
""
whereas this is a such a bore 
""
 i'm  in final year but  like they have  started from
first year itself 
""
so that we get a  whole round uh  must have point  point
of view regarding the subject 
""
then uhm  then regarding anatomy and then physiology and all
that we come to know  whether uh  structures that are present
anatomically and then  physiology means like  whether the system are
 working and how  how does it 
""
suppose for example  in digestive system like how does it get
disturbed  or how does the liver works  and all those things  we
study in physiology 
""
and then  though they are like  we find it quite  dry at
the moment  but when it comes to the clinical  when we see the
patients and when we deal with the patients then   it's  quite
interesting i mean 
""
""
so you have started dealing with your patients and all  ?
""
""
no no we are uh  just starting to face like
""
we are in first year 
""
so clinicals we start from third year onwards 
""
so we are looking forward for training 
""
""
so like your practical is still with  like how is your 
what is the process of your practicals  ?
""
""
i mean uh  in  third year or  you mean in  
every year every year  we have got different  practicals 
""
""
 no right now  so far  
""
""
suppose for physiology also we have uh two practicals like 
amphibian  and human physiology 
""
in human physiology we take the samples of the blood and then we
test the blood and then we count  r b c count  then w b c count then
 like uhm  after that we see  the hemoglobin   one word
 and then  differential count in w b c 
""
all these things we count 
""
that is to we take on the   coughs  our  human blood
itself 
""
then in  amphibian practical we  dissect the frog 
""
then we  try to see the models which  then the oscillation
and then  one word  of uh  nerves and everything 
""
so that comes under physiology
""
and bio-chem we  have separately done like  how are this uh
 proteins and  nutrition differential  bet  between the unknown
solutions 
""
they will give us some unknown solutions and we have to do the 
experiments until we found out whether  it's  protein or  whether
it is carbohydrates  or sometimes  urea uh uric acid all those things
""
""
 it's  uh  chemistry lab  ?
""
""
yeah   it's  done in separately in  chemistry
lab 
""
""
so how many  practicals you have  ?
""
""
how many practicals uh  like  for physiology we have 
two practicals and  bio-chem we have one practical and  we have
dissection in anatomy  that's  also a practical like 
""
and then uh  we have for physics  practicals  where we
 like finding the cast  and out of cast we have to form uh  make
display  and although the display we equip with uh  wax  ring 
 like
""
so those are some models like we have to  know from now onwards
""
""
so that is  in practical  practically in uhm  for
physics 
""
""
so you are in second year now  ?
""
you are in second year  ?
""
""
yeah 
""
""
then  like uh  after your  after you finish your
degree what is your  further  plans  ?
""
""
well if i get through perfectly you know  i mean  good
colours then  i would like to go for my p g  and  that's  post
graduation in we have got seven different uh  like uh  departments
""
so  in each department we can chose whichever you want to do
""
""
specialise 
""
""
yeah  that's   specialise 
""
so i want to do in ortho 
""
""
what is ortho  ?
""
""
ortho orthodentia  that is uh they put braces and  all
those things 
""
""
and what about chandini  ?
""
so far  how is your  ragging  ?  laughter 
""
""
ragging   laughs  fine
""
""
 cough 
""
no you just tell like how your seniors used to rag you your
classmates and 
""
""
no they used to ask us about our biodata no  ?
""
and they uh make us sing  and then dance 
""
they are also enjoying uh  we are also enjoying 
""
""
so you also you enjoyed ragging
""
""
  ah ha 
""
""
 what  so    what sort of ragging  they
used to  ?
""
""
mentally  not physically and not physically  
recording broken or a long pause 
""
""
so uh  what  i mean what do you think about the people
in india  ?
""
""
i mean here in hyderabad the people are   it's 
okay  they are nice 
""
i mean uh  my friends they are  friendly and uh  used to
help me a lot in my work 
""
and  this just a one  uh one month back time i am here in
hyderabad 
""
so i have made friends with uh  some of my  classmates 
""
and uh  so  so to say friendly and   laughs 
""
""
helpful yeah
""
""
yeah helpful 
""
usually the people here in  i mean down in  south  they
are very helpful
""
""
yeah south
""
""
but  what i find the difference in 
""
""
according to  any
""
""
i mean only in south eastern they are  like in bangalore
where the people are quite different like  they are helpful as well as
they are quite broadminded and  they are quite friendly with the people
and  i mean  i mean the  environment is so different from
hyderabad
""
""
yeah
""
""
whereas hyderabad the people are more  conservative and
like  they don't like to go out even  or  at the first move they
don't like to talk with people also 
""
but whereas when they really come to know the people they like to
help the people 
""
then uh  for example like whereas in bangalore you go out in
shorts or  even the females  go out in shorts or  anything like that
they don't mind 
""
i mean  they are more advanced in all those things and then
 whereas in hyderabad if you even wear a  skirt even like  then
they  give a good i mean  back stare at you and you feel out of place
like when you wear all those stuff 
""
then you feel that  okay somebody is observing me so much and
you feel  uncomfortable in all those things 
""
whereas in  bangalore you are free like 
""
i don't think people will be  least bothered like even if you go
 almost like a naked female and   laughs 
""
so  those are the difference according to the places also
""
and whereas in madras when you can see  the people are  i
mean  what to say uh  they are still yet to build up  in all
those things 
""
atleast in hyderabad  it's   i mean they have become more
modernised  like in  comparatively in twin cities like  in
secunderabad also  the people are quite different and  the girls and
the  boys  all they are  more modernised  than in hyderabad
""
""
whereas in hyderabad they still have the old cultures and  so
many things that even  the parents they don't even let the girls  talk
with the guys 
""
it is hidden talking like  they get a good punch at home or
something like that   laughs 
""
but whereas in secunderabad they are so fast they even go for 
pubs and discos and here and there clubs and then  so many other  i
mean extra  curricular  activities are going on 
""
but whereas in hyderabad they are only  stuck with their books
and  home and work  that's  all like 
""
there is a lot of   different   difference  
between these two twin cities itself 
""
so then  comparitively to north  south is quite  to see
in study  point of view south is quite good 
""
whereas in north  there is lot of activities  may be  it's
 due to the influence of the tourist people from different countries and
 all those things 
""
so in  north i should say they are more advanced than  in
study point of view they are not that  uh good as good as  in south
""
""
so  i mean that is the difference i find between this  uh
north and south 
""
""
and what about ragging difference between north and south  ?
""
""
well the ragging in  south is quite  i mean  quite
cool i should say  because you don't have any physical  torturement or
anything like that 
""
they just ask some  simple questions  regarding your biodata
 then your hobbies  then  they may ask you to sing a song  or
dance  or ask for a treat 
""
 that's  the maximum they do here 
""
but whereas in north  they  literally kill the person like
""
""
you know most of the  people who  who go to  north for
medical studies they are really scared 
""
i don't want to go there because they are  physically tortured
like uh  sometimes they even ask them to go the morgery and  at
midnight twelve  o'clock  whereas everyone is so scared like  
laughs 
""
""
yeah
""
""
and thinking about  dissection hall itself they really
get scared and that also in the midnight uh 
""
""
 haan 
""
""
so they asked them to go to the  morgery  whereas 
in the morgery even the  fresh bodies are  i mean kept 
""
so  sometimes they  i mean they ask the students to go to
the  dissection hall and identify  so many things 
""
at the same time  some of their  same collegues  they
must be hiding  i mean lying down in the stretcher and they just wake up
suddenly so 
""
there   was   were    two cases  in
north that  two persons had died because of this type of ragging
""
""
yeah yeah 
""
""
and then
""
""
it has been
""
""
so far yeah 
""
so far what i have heard is that in north  they have asked uh
 a guy  they gave him uh  a huge  i mean  piece of  uh
soap and they asked him to  they gave him some  specific time and
asked him to take  bath and finish that soap 
""
well that  guy  he was finding very difficult to do that
and  he tried his best to finish that soap 
""
so by the time he finished the soap he was  admitted in the
hospital 
""
""
 accha 
""
""
that  that serious he became 
""
then uh  there are so many serious  ragging  done by the
seniors in north 
""
but whereas in south like i feel the lecturers and the professors
 whoever in-charge then the principal they are  controlling the
students in that point of view 
""
but in  north  they are not bothered  like  they
just leave upto the students 
""
so the  seniors really  torture the  juniors  and
 i mean they find it difficult  to stay there
""
so many  students have left their course  just because of
ragging 
""
""
  so 
""
""
 and   so far like  what i have heard about uh
 one college is that one  guy was asked to go to the ladies hostel 
""
""
 haan  
""
""
uhn the  warden was  a  spinster so  like 
he has asked the  guy to  i mean the senior has asked the guy to go it
is  panties along  alone like  to go early in the morning and ask
her what did  she do with her husband the previous night 
""
so  at the same time  like he refused to do 
""
so  they asked him to  stand at the college gate  with
the  panties alone
""
""
uhn 
""
""
so that  that was when he  became mad 
""
and he is really a  mental  off the person now at the moment
""
""
so  those are the differnces you can find like how  badly
they are ragging in north and  south 
""
south how lenient they are 
""
""
so what you like  ?
""
do you think that there should be ragging or not  ?
""
""
well  in my point of view okay ragging means what they are
doing in the south  i really appreciate 
""
unless you  rag your junior by asking so many  i mean
whatever you want to ask  that junior never bothers to say  hi
 even  like in their later life  like  when the college
goes on smoothly like 
""
so  in that point of view  ragging is  good 
""
what i feel is  so that you get to know the  junior and the
junior comes to know who you are  and what a person you are 
""
then you can have a  healthy friendship i should say like 
""
i mean the ragging should be  quite healthy  not  i
mean not unhealthy one 
""
""
so champani you are new to this place  ?
 
""
yeah  
""
""
how do you find the college and the ragging towards you  ?
 
""
the college is uh   it's  nice uh  but  living
in so far is  not so  one word  no   ?
""
""
yeah 
 
""
the place is   it's  quite nice  
""
""
so first day of your dissection when you saw the dead bodies
how did you feel and  when they showed you the  i guess they must have
have shown you the morgery  where they have preserved the dead bodies 
""
how they are preserved  ?
 
""
yeah 
""
""
so how did you find all those things  ?
 
""
on the first day i was very scared  even to touch the body
 na   
""
""
so how do you feel now  ?
 
""
ah  i don't feel anything now  
""
""
i am sure you must have uh  washed your hands at least
  ten  times  before eating after touching the bodies 
laughs 
 
""
 yeah   
 
""
yeah  it's  so smelly no  
""
""
ah then how about now  you wash atleast once  ? 
laughs 
""
because now  we have    one word  
""
""
 you   don't wash you don't wash now 
""
""
yeah there are students who doesn't wash at all and eat food
because they are so used to it 
""
""
ah ha
""
""
i mean just  an ordinary wash okay you rinse your hand in
the water end up  but  you know it become so casual like
""
""
yeah 
""
""
but the first day when you go for a dissection or  when
you just touch the dead bodies  you feel something and then  when you
go back home you  specially  wash your hands in the dettol atleast for
ten times and you just  keep on rubbing your nails and clean everything
and  you know  that's  how it happens but  slowly  you
became like used to  all those things
