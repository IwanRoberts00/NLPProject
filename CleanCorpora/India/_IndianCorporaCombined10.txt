 st's college from madras university and yet  still deciding on what topic we would like to talk on  i am padma doing my ph d here in literature teaching i am srilata doing my ph d here  i am subalakshmi doing pgm here  i am swarnalatha doing by ma in english literature  i am ramkumar doing my m phil in english literature  i am louis doing my ma here  well we have decided to talk uh on women's  liberation to begin with and we may move on to other topics later  what do you think of women's liberation louis   women's liberation is basically uh a noble concept but but the whole question is the ball is actually in the  women's court i would say  if i think woman should be a lot more assertive then what they are now  and i think they are allowing themselves to be more conditioned than it is more that they condition themselves then men conditioning them  i object to what louis said  no doubt question of the woman being conditioned the society which plays a major role in fact the society doesn't give a woman a chance to prove her abilities  she sort of repress and any attempt of a woman to liberate herself is met is met with strong disapproval  so i think the ball is in the men's court because  no but somehow i think you are contradicting yourself in some ways  uh as you said it's not actually men or women  that's not the question at all you yourself said that it is the society that controls society made both men and women  so uhn i think we when we talk of women's liberation we immediately the association is that it is anti-men  uh i would like to question that definition first  no but india is mostly a patriarchal society so it's men who play a more important role right in all your decision making and what about this however modern we may get to but still the same  we haven't broken up from our ancient roots   that's what we call  i would like to object to the first statement that she made  that society conditions a woman  i don't belive in society as such i think the individual is superior to society  i don't understand why uh individual should allow society to dominate over his his or her individuality  so the question of women's liberation is not that  society suppresses a woman  it is just that the woman refuses to do anything that could alleviate her suffering  i think the speaker is talking about about an utopian society which can never exists  because the individual is very much a part of the society he can't alleviate himself from the society  what i feel is only the education and the economical status makes a woman to feel very liberated  so every woman must be educated and must be employed  then only they can be free taking decisions economically they will feel so  what do you feel about it  well i feel uh now uh we have been given equal chances with men and uh almost in all uh position even women are have been working  i mean only thing we have to utilise the chances properly and  get into proper positions and make woman come up somewhere educate them basically and then make them also come up and  be one with men  i totally disagree that the women they are not taking up any initiatives  see for the last two or three decades as or so we find that women they've reached a real good status to over the men  in each and every field that they have participated  say now we find that that women they are given a voice  they are given a platform rather to voice their own opinions  in each and every field be in press be in writing fiction  writing poetry they have come up in a great way but don't you think that that is more an exception than a rule how many women assert themselves  if you take an average indian woman you take an average indian woman i think the indian woman does not think more than marriage and settling down in life  an indian women's ultimate objective in life is to marry and settle down  you take you take an educated indian woman in a indian society she might have done her ma or ph d but what is ultimate objective she wants to get married  this marriage is the ultimate ideal of society or an individual it cannot be this no but marriage is just a part of uh life you know but when we're getting ourselves educated there is no point sitting at home as such doing ph d's and all that hey you can just sit with your ba or   no that is not the opinion of   that's what i'm saying it's  more an exception than a rule  it is more an exception than a rule  perhaps a few of you who are doing a ph d think that way  how many come to the ma classes by the way  no no this is the situation i mean it's bad  but the situation seems to have taken a change over the past  i challege that   they've but far to far to gradual to have any any impact on society but i still feel that there is a percent of change  as she said our's is a patriarchal society and to move away from the patriarchal society it takes some time  it's not so easy  exuse me you are talking about marriage it's necessary you do because there is no sec security for a single woman  she is not respected that's a fact no but i think his point was   i i'm not i'm not advocating  uh i'm not advocating a woman being a spinster okay   you've got me wrong  i am not trying to say that  but what i'm i am only taking the exception to a  woman's ultimate objective being marriage  that is wicked of the society that's what  i've been trying to tell you no but i have one question to ask what is you   why should it be why should it be  you you have been educated you should learn to be independent now one second  but who gives that kind of notion that that's going to be your objective   it's a mother it's a father it's a brother at home yeah or you know you you are taught even when a child is born  look at all that the advertising that we listen to  the bank says you save save money for your son's  education and save for your daughter's marriage   marriage  you are talking  so its there you you are talking you're talking of conditioning of a person okay  a person an ess essential an individual an individual should assert himself no that as you say is a very utopian concept no no i i strongly disagree   because an individual can not exist  please do not dismiss it as a utopian i strongly disgree with that view  it is not utopian  it's very much practical only we refuse to be practical that is all what you say a woman should does not talk about it don't look at her objective point of her i am not i'm not being objective  good going i think we'll have a change in the topic now uh we will talk of the examination system uh to which all of us are agreed to  yes why don't you begin  exam system what do you feel that uh you are getting your rights the exam present kind of exams no ma'am i feel examination should be abolished i mean at specially at your graduate under graduate level  post graduate level  i mean they don't help the students in any way  infact they sort of hamper the pleasure one receives from learning  you don't learn for pleasure you learn for marks  so it should be done away does everyone subscribe to this view what would you like to say ramkumar no what i still feel is there should be some way in which the lecturer should be in a position to gauge the performance of the students and one good way is examination  but what i still feel is the continuous assessment system  will work out in a better way rather than having a three hour examination yeah  say at the fag end of the session to evaluate the students no don't you think uh that the question of a teacher  gauging a students performance is utilatarian  that is a high utilitarian concept you are prostituting knowledge no not at all  how do you claim why why do you want to gauge a students performence  students knowledge you learn a few words   a few words   you've to place a student where  where he stands   that's equally important because at the higher studies   as i feel  as i feel that is what i am saying it is a highly utilatarian concept you want to test the students so that you know whether you sit for this whether you sit for this whether you sit for this   that's it  whether he is qualified for any promotion or not will have to be determined by the lecturer  listen examinations don't don't examinations really do not uh speak of their real ability as such  your abilities are quite different from what you something that you take for harassment   well i am   that's about the evaluation system  yes one shade of the ability is that the lecturers  they test when they evaluate the students   what you know is from the nature   whether from a guide simply use it he may not really get the spirit of   that's not i mean to say  the continuous assessment system is far better of than having an examination at the end of the year or at the end of couple of years no no there so many problems in continuous assessment that have come out now  even if the  i don't think students really feel confident   it's again putting them into a kind of uh modern slavery to the department concerned  and that has also been uh pointed out by many and not every teacher can be really made objective   no what i really wanted is to make the  objective elements of the teacher comes into play then  but what i still feel is you've different means and methods by which you can evaluate the students to continue the assessment  you can say introduce a seminar pattern the panel discussion group discussion ask the students speak out in class  regularly and then assess the student instead of asking him to sit for a three hours examination  and then assess him on that basis   yeah in comparision yes in comparision yes  no but uh when you are taking a seminar or something like that no one or two students from the class only uh read the others you cannot say all of them are listening in the class no he should have been given a topic to the before the class   i mean but when you are asked i mean when you are asked to write an exam all of us have to write no each one of the student is asked to present a paper   should be given then yeah obviously  but then we have other uh difficulties as well  say the class strength is massive you can't uh expect each and every student to present in a seminar  or ask each and every student to participate in a group discussion especially in general english classes where the strength is over seventy  so the case is whether examination should be conducted at all  or they shouldn't be conducted at all  now i suppose we've boiled down to that level no that's a basic question but ultimately in practice i think it is used more as a screening  for employer to select you know they give prescribe qualifications and that provide the kind of uh screening for them  know some kind of uh proof that they have selected somebody with certain certain qualification yeah its very whether that qualification really uh matters and whether it really gives them the skills that are necessary for the job is not all yeah only for government coughs employment  but when you go to the pr private sector it so happens that they have their own means and methods of testing the students  see normally they take for example if it's going to be a salesman's job what they do is they have a group discussion they have an interview no even then there is a basic qualification basic qualification is always there  some where somehow somewhere you'll have to  scren screen test   screen  but do we always feel that uh you know uh we are a mixed ability group normally in the classroom  uh with different backgrounds and all all that  i've always felt that uh the differentiation between a mediocre student and a good student never really emerges from the system that we have at present  you now the ma it is very marginal  the difference is very marginal  i don't know how uh you react to it   it's a maybe we're more interested in having a national syllabus and merging each and every type of institution into one  like the cd cis tamil nadu state no that is structuralising knowledge you can't we can't accept that  that is that is something very  rigid  yeah  you can't structuralise something and say you compartmentalise  you can't compartmenatalise knowledge it's unethical because you don't give license no you don't give  give a student access to other branches of knowledge when you compartmentalise knowledge  give license  this is not compartmentalising knowledge what you mean to say is that see we've different systems as the central board of secondary education icse then we've the state board each and every state having its own uh curricular like you know or syllabi  now once you merge have one syllabus for each and  for every student who studies in india then may be we were in better position to evaluate students performence  no but ramkumar what what you find in the syllabus is not a guarantee to what is done in the classroom
