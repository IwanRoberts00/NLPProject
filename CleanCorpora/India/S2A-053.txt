""
""
  it's  moving 
""
""
  it's  moving okay 
""
""
okay now  cough   this is the d s p sonograph 
and this has a lot of hardware inside and also  in  it's  rom there
is software 
""
so the several commands we feed in it takes in and processes or do
 done  through this software which is built-in in it 
""
and  it's  a special  special purpose  you can say 
it's  a special purpose computer 
""
then this is the monitor   it's  of two fifty-six colour
shade monitor 
""
you can see the  i have to get the  uh mike on
""
""
mike
""
""
microphone is on uh   what's  his name ?
""
""
last man
""
""
now who is the last man  ?
""
""
uh anupam 
""
""
 anupam's  table is there   in a in a   in
a   package  you can pick it up 
""
uh uh  hello 
""
uhm this is a very sensitive  uhm uh  monitor  it can give
you two hundred and fifty-six grades of colour 
""
compared with a v g e monitor which you see usually a good monitor
which gives you four shades 
""
we get uh nice uh this thing and  it's  a flat screen too
""
""
 it's  not protruding this way  it's  a flat screen
 monitor 
""
and this also could also be connected to a computer
""
right now  laughs  these guys are trying and not able to
succeed  that's  another problem they have 
""
you can operate certain things from the computer 
""
""
yeah 
""
""
uhm  there are  we should look at this  all the
controls are at the front panel 
""
there are some controls at the back panel but they have to be 
used  very rarely  for a initial setting sense on 
""
output  there are certain outputs that could be taken from the
back panel 
""
here  you have this this is the input  section  and this
is the output  section 
""
you input speech  or any sound  you can also get the output
of the sound 
""
usually  it is  if you don't mute it  the output comes
through the speakers which are connected at the back 
""
you can also listen through a headphone here 
""
the inputting is done  you have two channels  you can choose
two channels  channel one and channel two 
""
""
yeah 
""
""
and then  first do the recording 
""
when you are recording through a microphone  you have to insert
this into the microphone here 
""
this this is channel one  this is channel two 
""
this is for microphone and this is for auxilary that is tape
recorder and such purpose 
""
""
it will be higher voltage input 
""
""
and similarly the other two   cough 
""
you also select your input level  it is at thirty degree which
is a comfortable  input level 
""
you can also increase it  to seventy seventy is the maximum 
and it becomes  you can see that it is getting over loaded 
""
see  even  it's  picking up from here  
hello  hello  hello 
""
 that's  too much actually 
""
so we go down to thirty 
""
now  it's  not  so  sensitive 
""
let me get out of that  actually that  takes time to display
""
""
yeah   hello  
""
this is the convention spectrogram  that has bottom of the layer
 and the top one is a   it's  in a wave form 
""
so  you can input it here  from here  either through
microphone or through the auxiliary input 
""
and then  okay for inputting  you have to do record  you
have to be in record mode 
""
once you press this one this is a very sacred button 
""
if you press anything here whatever is recored gets erased  as
there is this   it's  a circular buffer is there  continously
records and erases 
""
as it proceeds it goes in a circle 
""
so  once i press this   it's  now recording 
recording is going on  recording is going on right now  whatever 
i'm  saying is going inside  and it is being kept inside 
""
now to stop it  and to preserve that signal i have to press this
knob 
""
and then always that enhance is necessary comes you just press this
button e  it will do the enhancement on its own 
""
now the settings have been changed let me   come back 
 go back   to my settings   cough  
""
 hello  yeah
""
i have increased the input level here  to forty degree  you
can see the difference in the  the way  the amplitude is getting
displayed there 
""
now when i decrease it to thirty you will see that it becomes less
 and twenty still less 
""
okay  forty forty is quite comfortable in fact  uh sometimes
it becomes a bit loud 
""
what we can get here  is a continous spect 
""
right now what we have chosen a spectrogram at the bottom 
screen and the  wave form at the top screen 
""
so  let's  say  something like   akka
  
""
in fact there is a clipping here  this kind of straight line
means  there is too much space means too loud  that clipping is going
on 
""
that clipping is going on  which should be avoided 
""
clipping means  it's it's  it's  called overloading 
overloading 
""
you can see that  it's it's  clipping here too 
""
so we should not be too close there 
""
so   akka akka    this is
quite  comfortable   cough 
""
uh  just if you take this signal    akka
  here  you can  you can get a few points in this
""
i mean the interesting points you can see there 
""
one thing is you can see  it is something like i produce
something like a sentence  a declarative sentence  with a pitch falling
 you see the pulses are going down  becoming separated here  and
here too  the distance between pulse to pulse is becoming more and more
 that means  your pulses in in a  in a given period of time so the
pitch is less 
""
and we can do many many things with this signal here 
""
 let's  put some cursors now this this brings cursors in and
out  okay 
""
so the cursors give you the facility to measure
""
let me shift them  now they are on the lower screen  the red
cursor   i'll  shift them to a  shift it to the upper screen
""
""
now there  you see a red cursor but  that's  not one
cursor there is a green cursor behind it 
""
just we are moving this moves the cursors 
""
by moving it  okay  you get  the  both the cursors
separated  the reading at the red cursor  is three point six five
something  reading of the green one is three point five    the
 dif    the difference   is  point one three 
""
yeah  okay  point one three
""
so this  duration  between these two cursors  has come out
as point one three four one three  four four seconds 
""
we can use this  kind of  information 
""
let me expand this very form but as  it's  in two contract
form
""
so i can go back to time access  okay  and select the time
access  and the upper screen  this is my upper screen  i activate
that  small knob there  and make it expanded  and  it's 
enhanced now 
""
yeah it will rewrite 
""
redraw that  i unselect  i unselect  still this we have
to enhance 
""
so i say enhanced  it has enhanced  it has redrawn in an
expanded way  okay 
""
what i can do is i can precisely measure  the length  of the
closure  the length of the closure of k  in   akka
  
""
okay now this store business is that it makes the cursors 
where it converts the red and green to green and red 
""
it has the only the red cursor moves the green cursor does not move
""
""
so if i want  to  move this cursor i have to have it in red
colour 
""
if i want to move this first i have to  make it red  then i
can move it 
""
or if i want to move back  convert into red and then move it
""
""
okay now  roughly that is the time taken for the k to  that
is the maintaining  that's  it due  that's  the closure period
of the k in   akka   
""
that is point one nine second  roughly point two  seconds
 okay 
""
point two seconds   cough 
""
so  immediately you can get the measurement of the durations
""
""
i want to measure the duration of this  aa  
as opposed this  aa  
""
 that's  very easy  point one  point one seconds
""
""
and then  somewhere roughly there  and somewhere roughly
there   it's  point point one four seconds  that was hundred
milli-seconds  and  this is hundred and forty-seven milli-seconds 
okay 
""
 let's  take a word  two words in marathi 
""
see what is the difference between the  so called 
shwa  vowel there    kara  kar  karto
 kar  karto   
""
this is a   kar  tu kar  
means you do the work  imperative form of   kar 
 
""
and it is phonetically  shwa  
""
 it's  not a long  shwaa   it's 
a  shwa  
""
uhn  let's  look at  it's   length  point
one eight  point one eight four six 
""
this is   aa   of 
 kar   
""
this is   a    this is k is
here  you can't see k  this   a  
simply   a   okay 
""
in fact you can hear that  you can choose a particular portion
here how it sounds  or indeed the head phones otherwise it will disturb
everybody and you know if you go on playing that 
""
and then this is   karto  me kaam karto
   let's  say 
""
now this is the  now this is the k closure  
 a a ki   closure  o  fading away
""
""
fading out 
""
now here  remember that was point one eight four seconds 
okay   kar a    this guy  is point
zero seven  okay  almost half 
""
so this way immediate measurement you can get  and if you have
let us say hundred or  hundred two hundred samples  just transfer them
one by one 
""
there is a  you can have a large uh  buffer also
""
and you can choose the buffer size  and measure them 
""
now sometimes you have a doubt  about  where a particular
segment started and where a    seg    segment  
stopped   let's  say ended 
""
we have both systems 
""
let me realign them 
""
okay  this is the   kar  
 you can see this this is spectogram of the same thing i gave the same
signal in both the screens  this is the wave form  and this is the
sound spectogram   cough 
""
sound spectogram   is a   is a   two
dimensional  thing 
""
and here  you can see the formants  that means change in
colour 
""
you see the f one  f two f three f four  and each vertical
slash let me explain this  you will see this 
""
okay now  it's  clear  you can see the slash  one
after another corresponding to this pulses  each slashes is one lot of
pulse 
""
you can make it even even uh  more a 
""
now  let's  watch how the  how the pulses look like
""
""
look at each pulse  each pulse 
""
""
yeah 
""
""
each pulse 
""
so it is like that 
""
then  uh we   come back   go back   to 
 the original earlier one 
""
you can see the formant transition  this is the 
 aa    and going higher  going into 
 ra   
""
this is falling down to   ra  
 as   ra   has that s two rise s two
fall  kind of thing 
""
uhn so those make you about what is a formant  i'll  just
immediately show you what it is
""
let me  invoke another module 
""
 it's  a rerecorded  the signal is a bit loud here 
""
now  cough  because of this 
""
yeah 
""
 i'll  rerecord this signal 
""
take the  let's  take the vowel  e  
""
vowel  e   has the first spectral peak 
at around  two hundred fifty hertz 
""
second spectral peek  should be around two thousands hertz 
""
so this is the usual configuration 
""
 let's  see how it looks like 
""
 ee  ee   okay 
""
oh  that's  just a minute 
""
 ee  ee  
""
 that's  good 
""
this is an expanded we can see each  uh  each pitch pulse
 each has a pulse here 
""
and then the information  uh of that  you can pick up one
glottal pulse 
""
okay   it's  a bit loud here  and see   it's
  you can actually get the measurements  of the  what we call
f one  conventionally call f one  that is the first spectral peak 
and the second spectral peak you know here it may be difficult for you to
follow let me change the colour 
""
okay  okay this the spectral peak  first spectral peak 
and you can see the central point there  and it is two forty hertz  
that's  the standard text book you saw  two fifty hertz is the first
spectral peak of the  e  
""
first form of the f one is at two fifty hertz 
""
this is spectrum  spectrum  after you know you do this
enhance for your analyses you get the spectrum 
""
then the second spectral peak  is  is here you can see it
visually 
""
this guy that is the second formant  which will correspond this
peak you know both of them are moving in the similar  they are moving
together  both the cursors  this two three six zero 
""
this is again  a text book case  okay 
""
if you look at ledger if you remember ledger of this chart of f
one f two f three 
""
and this third one has got a split there actually third and fourth
are  bit 
""
oh 
""
third and fourth is a  are  bit merged 
""
i don't know i i think it shift aside  yeah 
""
ah this is a better one yeah 
""
let me clear this  uh let me clear  this guy yeah 
""
now here  see that  the fourth spectral peak is here 
""
now there is the fourth formant 
""
so first form and second third fourth  first second third
fourth  okay 
""
now  let's  go back to the second spectral peak here 
""
remember  it's  two three two zero 
""
let me produce a  an  aa   and see what
happens to that   aa  aa  aa  
""
yeah  the f f three f two has come so low  compared to 
the  this one  it has come down to eight forty 
""
so that f one f two f three f four  the movement of these 
you can see the each formant  you can precisely measure  not only by
looking at this if you want much precise measurement you can do it by this
spectrum 
""
this is the spectrum of the signal at that red cursor 
""
if you want spectrum  of this signal  over a period of time
 you have another choice  power between cursors 
""
 it's  a power actually  okay 
""
now you need two cursors now  power suppose i want to have an
averaged  spectrum of this  i put the cursors there  i simply press
d   it'll  come there 
""
so  it's  over a larger period 
""
but you can even analyse pitch pulse by pulse here  pulse by
pulse you can analyse here 
""
so  ao   characteristics of different vowels
 could be analysed  by looking at their formant characteristics 
""
