""
""
uh  right 
""
i am rana nayar 
""
""
and i am sudeep minhas 
""
""
so  sudeep what do you think we should talk about this
morning  ?
""
""
 that's  what i am thinking   laughs 
""
""
why don't you set the ball rolling 
""
""
 that's  what i am thinking
""
 let's  talk about feminism
""
 let's  just continue  the  yesterday's  
discussion 
""
i think  it's  very interesting    i i   i
  wasn't participating yesterday 
""
""
right
""
""
so i   would like 
""
""
 but that   was  uh more personal in nature
because 
""
""
yes we won't talk
""
""
i was just  uh drawing upon my personal  
experience  and talking about it 
""
uh and how of course i  started   off as the feminist
 and uh became more of a male chauvinist later 
""
""
 experience  
""
""
  a few words   
""
""
yes 
""
""
so  why don't you share  a bit of  your experience
 so   that we will be on 
""
""
 about feminism  
""
about how  man   feel 
""
""
 even   ground 
""
""
how man feel
""
""
how strongly you feel about  this whole idea of  
feminism  ?
""
""
 feminism   right 
""
uh now  i'll  we can't say how strongly i feel about it
""
but i think it  most of the personal experience is that you
slowly  begin to realise that  being a working woman makes you more of
a  you know  a target of male chauvinism 
""
had i been a  housewife i think i would have certainly 
enjoyed more privileges  than i do now   laughs 
""
""
do you regret being a career woman  ?
""
  is that what you are trying 
""
""
 no i think the satisfaction    the satisfaction
for my subject gives me  uh i mean  it's  a kind of  balances
the whole thing 
""
but sometimes i think  uh i certainly wish i just could relax at
home and you know  the chores that i do  now i mean  if were to do
just those chores and i would feel certainly much more happier 
""
""
but that will   not  really make you  uh
feminist  ?
""
then then   what  you are asking for    no
 is some kind of a   typical  role that is   assigned
 to women
""
""
 well i  
""
""
 no  
""
""
 no  
""
""
 exactly  
""
""
 no the  
""
""
 i'm  saying i am saying  this is what i had
encountered 
""
not that i want to be like that
""
this is what i have encountered from   me 
""
""
 given   a choice  you won't like
""
""
exactly    uhm  exactly 
""
i mean  uh we have certain dreams i feel all  young girls
have certain dreams and uh  then uh  when i was about twenty-five
twenty-six  just before my marriage
""
""
 uhm  
""
""
uhm uhm 
""
""
i i had this kind of a dream that  okay  i'm  going
to set certain rules  if  i'm  working  and he is working we are
going to divide  uh what we are going to do 
""
but i think  and i ended up with a lot of problems 
""
""
uhm uhm
""
""
got lot of problems
""
""
uhm uhm 
""
""
so i think uhm   that's  what when you were talking
about yesterday  one word  better you know that  yes one  sets
out thinking that yes one is  feminist but  when actually slowly you
 when you when you actually  uh face the realities  when you come
down to the ground realities  i think one is so much more happier in the
conventional truth 
""
 same's  happened with me
""
""
uhm uhm 
""
""
when i think it would have been  i think my mother is in a
much better position and a situation than i am 
""
she is much more respected 
""
""
ah ha 
""
""
i am the one who is supposed to be you know  going out and
having fun but still i am working the most of the  one word  you know
  laughter 
""
and my mother just because she is a mother you know she is lady of
the house
""
she has so much more respect 
""
""
uhm uhm 
""
""
and uh  i think i  lose out on that
""
and i sometimes wish and i crave for that kind of  an adoration
and looking upto   laughter  looking upto 
""
""
are you trying to say that as we get on in years we become
more of  uh man or more of woman  uh   is that the  idea ?
""
""
 now about the  one word   
""
""
yes  i mean have we  i mean  i think had i been given
enough uh   wh  what should i say  had the situation been
different  and the convention been different then i would have certainly
loved to be a liberated  woman or the  or as we say  the working
woman or a professional kind
""
i would have certainly loved to be that
""
""
would you like to say that all  working women are liberated
in that sense   in your words  ?
""
""
 no they are not   no no 
""
""
then ?
""
""
i mean i would have loved
""
""
opting for a career only way of seeking liberation 
""
""
yes it is of course to   uh to  ce   to a
great extent  yes   i i   i   agree   with
that to a great extent of course as sometimes doing  one word  
""
""
 is it not  
""
""
 uh would you like to think of liberation purely in
ecnomic   terms
""
""
 it's >/w> not just that rana   it's  not just
that
""
 it's  so much more you can  i mean sometimes i think you
just tend to  uh build a  build up so much when you are at home and
this is some kind of an outset
""
i think  it's   not just economical  it's 
psychological also 
""
and the  the very fact of moving out of the house  i think
 man enjoys that don't they ?
""
i mean you make them sit at home for  uh say about  uh uh
not even a week  say two days i mean    right  if they have a
prolonged weekend they just begin to tend to get  irritated   they
   they   won't move  one word   they feel
confined 
""
i think  the very fact  you know this  this  breaking
of the psychological barrier yes that  even i am moving out 
""
""
 right  
""
""
right
""
""
this is physical moving out  is sometime equated  uh
with the  with the psychological uh  opening up 
""
""
right 
""
""
right    uhm  i mean you can carry on  
 uhm  i mean i don't know what to think about that   laughter
""
""
i hope
""
""
 uhm  
""
""
 uhm  
""
""
of course we can always  agree to differ    as
far  this   is concerned because 
""
""
 oh yes  
""
""
 why not why   not why not 
""
of course he has got an absolutely different  uh say
""
""
no because i am a staunch believer in uh  what i call 
biological determinant    you see 
""
""
 now what   is biological determinant ?
""
  please explain that you were saying yesterday also 
""
""
 uh i know uh uh i know   i know  laughter 
i know i am going to raise lot of hackles when i say that 
""
but this is exactly what  uh what my life experience is that
 things are what they are because of   bio  biology and biology
is what conditions are 
""
and we cannot really be any different  or we cannot really go
very far  from    where we start 
""
""
 i think don't   we give meanings to  biology
""
""
i think let to itself it would have been much more simpler
""
i mean  it would have been much more  uh on the equal
ground had  i mean we give a lot of meaning to what biology means as such
""
""
""
i am not really trying to
""
""
and this is  i don't know anything about  
biological determinism exactly    laughter 
""
i have no  scholarly   laughs  background about this
""
""
 so do impose and stuck upon  
""
""
nor do i for that matter
""
""
and  two words  justify thing
""
""
and if  not really meant be scholarly discussion but 
""
""
i know  no  but still i don't what it is  but i
 somehow feel personally that we give a lot of meaning  because 
that's  the way we want it to be 
""
 that's  the way our  society wants it to be 
""
""
yeah  that would be another way of looking at it but uh
""
""
""
you mean biologically men are stronger than women ?
""
""
i am not  talk  talking in terms of relative strength
 that men are  stronger and women are weaker 
""
but  what i am trying to suggest is that  whether it is
psychology or  sociology  or cultural pattern  or behaviourial
pattern  all stem from  a certain kind of biological makeup 
""
everything else follows  you see 
""
everything else comes later 
""
it begins there 
""
""
no i think   it  begins   no no no 
""
""
 and  
""
""
 and and   perhaps   you see  
 when when   when   women talk in terms of  liberation
uh   ar  are they talking in terms of being  more of men than
 women
""
is that what they want  ?
""
equality with men  does it mean that  they want to be like
men  ?
""
i i would not really be very happy with that kind of situation 
if women were to be  like men  or   where try  to become
men  because
""
""
 i feel  
""
""
 this is i can i  
""
""
 that's  true  i mean they
""
""
as far as that goes  reversal of roles can never take
place 
""
""
i i uh   i  am  agree 
""
""
  for instance  one of the extreme is  one of
the extreme  position that i think of is that  man can never give birth
""
""
i was thinking of it  i was thinking   of it 
 so
""
""
 so to say  
""
""
you see that is something which    women  alone
can do
""
""
  one word   
""
""
but that does not
""
""
call it a previlege or  whatever    yes  but
 it's  granted only to uh  i think men are  poorer for this
reason  that they are  they cannot give birth
""
""
 yes  
""
""
no but  that's    i think  that is a 
 very fine  way of saying we   are poor so we  should
be allowed to do this   we should  be allowed to do this
""
""
 because  
""
""
 because  
""
""
 this is this is  
""
""
 this is  
""
""
one way in which they can somehow satisfy  a creative
impulse 
""
a man is always trying to   laughs  give expression to
it in so many different ways
""
and i think half the time he doesn't succeed 
""
""
i don't know about that problem but i think you know  uh
 laughter   what's  more important is as i was saying  the
husband is  one word   i mean as you were saying about this
reversal of role  i believe in it  yes and i think  that should not
be  just by giving birth i think she should not be denied  of other
things
""
i mean i think she feels proud of it yes  that she is a mother
""
""
and it so much more natural for a mother to have that kind of
relationship with the child which of course the father can never have it of
   right  but it develops slowly 
""
but  again  is that an excuse for her  not  being 
i mean  so that she should not be taking  such and such role  she
should not be doing this and this thing  is that some kind of a constraint
""
just because she happens to be a mother
""
""
 right  
""
""
certainly not  and i want  i don't even want to 
suggest that  it should be  a kind of a constraint 
""
the idea is  you first identify yourself with what you are
""
you accept yourself for what you are
""
""
yes right 
""
""
you accept your limitations  you accept your strength 
and from there you proceed 
""
""
very fine
""
""
you see  a woman  may be or a man for that matter let
me not talk  only of women 
""
if a man also wants to  liberate himself then i think every
man needs to liberate himself or  all human beings need to liberate
themselves because  all of us have this basic impulse  to move towards
some kind of an autonomy  growth    may be  this is something
that we all  think about
""
and this is  exactly what i mean by liberation 
""
""
 exactly  
""
""
exactly
""
""
moving towards some kind of a higher state    yes
 of growth 
""
growth which you may measure in  whatever terms you  chose
to 
""
first  one word  maybe  social  psychological 
spiritual  material  any term you chose to
""
terms you can define for yourself
""
but  i am talking about the basic idea of growth  and that
alone  means liberation to me
""
""
 yes  
""
""
exactly
""
""
so  for that kind of growth i think  it's  very
important  i mean  that's  the way i look at it 
""
for a man and  for that matter even a woman  to accept 
himself herself 
""
and this kind of self- acceptance is exactly what doesn't really
count most  one word 
""
""
exactly as it is
""
""
which becomes a hindrance  in a way    and 
this in itself is a kind of bondage 
""
""
 i  
""
""
right 
""
 i'll  give you   i'll  give you  uh a
personal example for that matter 
""
when you were saying that  when woman want to be  uh woman
want to be liberated  are they trying to be like man 
""
i will give you an example 
""
my husband  likes  a very clean house
""
he  likes to remain at home 
""
he likes to do all the things 
""
and believe it he loves to do needle work also
""
""
uhm uhm 
""
""
i don't 
""
i am the one who would rather sit and have a  one word 
newspaper 
""
yes i love to  that is one thing i like to 
""
but he   do   does   all the other things 
""
whenever we are together  on the weekend
""
you know  thinking  is generally thought to be a  man's
 priority  right  i i
""
""
not necessarily 
""
""
no yes 
""
""
not necessarily
""
""
yes 
""
i i i  you know i will give you   so many examples from
""
""
""
 men are warriors not   thinkers 
""
""
no   laughter
