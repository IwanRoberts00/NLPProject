good evening and welcome back to the election analysis programme this will be the last programme this evening and our last programme to re wind up will be tommorrow night at the same time nine fifty senior members of the congress parliamentary party have had just emerged actually from an informal meeting and we'll be going to the congress party head quarters to try and find out what exactly happened in those folk filled rooms but first the head lights head lines at ten o'clock tonight congress-i and allies are hurrying towards two hundred and thirty-five still twenty-five to thirty short of a majority  the bjp plus its allies are set forward for one-twenty  in andhra pradesh the congress-i is literally swamping the june vote  in the may vote we saw the telugu desam desam doing well but in june the congress-i is literally sweeping  h k l bhagat is defeated and george farnandis win   is karyakram ke mukhya samachar is prakar hain congress-i wa uske sahyogi dal do sau paintees seetein jeetne ki oor bhartiya janata party aur shivsena ko ek sau bees seetein pane ki ummeed  andhra pradesh mei june ke matdan mei congress bahut aage h k l bhagat chunau hare aur george fernandis chunau jeete prannoy well vinod let's go straight into the latest results position this is final mp's in the next lok sabha  and we have results now on three hundred and fifty-five or five hundred and eleven seats  the congress-i one seventy-nine out of three fifty-five  the bjp coming second on its own with eighty-one  the janata dal twenty-nine still  cpm nineteen  the aiadmk eleven and others thirty-six  but telugu desam still part of the national front with ten  the ja jmm five cpi five  all part of the national front  the bsp is fighting on its own with one seat now  rsp part of the national front and uh totalling thirty-six  let's look at the leading position these are the trends this includes results this is both leading and those results we've just seen because we get the overall picture here  so we got information now on four hundred and eighty-six out of five hundred and eleven seats  and the congress is leading now in two hundred and twenty   it's picked up uh three or four seats in u p at the movement  but doesn't seems to be going much further  bjp is coming second with hundred and seven  the janata dal fifty-five on its own  the cpm twenty-nine  the telugu desam thirteen these are all part of the nat national front janata uh national and left front combined  others sifty-two  cpi eleven  aiadmk eleven  the jmm six  rsp three  bahujan samaj party one  making a total of others sixty-two  now this projects into the tenth lok sabha  something like this  congress plus all its allies put together somewhere around two thirty-five take uhm uh plus or minus two three seats  the left front looks as though it's heading towards fifty and the national front eighty-five so together they form a nice little chunk of a hundred and thirty-five seats likely to form this is prediction   that's ahead actually of the bjp and its allies which is basically the shivsena which is now heading towards about a hundred and twenty  and other minor parties are about twenty-one  so that's the kind of look that we expect to see inside the next tenth lok sabha vinod  we've in our studios dr muralimanohar joshi of bharatiya janta party shri s r bommai of janata dal shri harkishan singh surjeet of communist party marxist and shri n k p salve of congress-i prannoy  mr salve let me start with you  what do you expect the president to do next ? uh well what i expect president to do next is what he did the last time  perhaps call for the party which is the highest number of members in lok sabha   that's the only alternative for him  call for the leader of the party good call for the leader of the party and who is that going to be ? uh well  there is no dearth of talents in our party and the congress parliamentary party is going to decide upon a leader who knows how honour ourselve how delicate is the task ahead of us  he will be a strong not dearth of talent are you talk heavy with leaders in fact no in fact we are reasonably balanced on all ends which is not top uh heavy nor is it uh top at the bottom but the question is we realize the responsiblity we have very delicate responsibility  we own this responsibility  and we'll if we do have to form minority government  then we do know that we have to form a durable government  and a durable government can not be run only on experience and gimmicks yes  where are you going to get the critical thirty seats from in order to form a government ? no as i said it's the minority government i'm  expecting at this juncture  if your prediction are correct   a few words  where am i going to get thirty seats is precisely from where mr joshijee might be expecting some other seats to come  i don't have any other source  other are the source which all four parties of all the four had but when i say the president would be sending for the  leader of a party with the largest number of uh members i do take it that even if your projections are correct perhaps the congress party will be the first one to be called  uh mr surjeet from your experience in this  these matters how long i mean the country is waiting now for things to settle down ?  it's been a long campaign  it's been uh people are pretty tired  they want a bit of uh uh certainty on the political front how long do you think this whole thing will take to settle down to some kind of uh stability ? it should not take much time because now situation is pretty bad in the country  it requires a government  there is no government at the moment  and salveji has rightly stated president has no other option but to call the leader of the biggest largest  party in the parliament  and then see that uh they take the responsibility so you're talking about a week or three days or   one or two word   no no not a week  week is too much too long that's it too long  too long  because the situation is critical in the country now you've we've mentioned about punjab problem what is happening inspite of the efforts of all the political parties they are going cough ahead of the one word  cough and all that  so many other problems are there situations is very complicated  please carry on i want to ask mr bommai what is uh you can actually authoritatively state as being the president of the janata dal the official position of the janata dal towards a coalition with the congress-i ? because they are looking for those thirty seats and you are going to have them  now firstly we respect the verdict of the people  and they've asked us to sit in the opposition and we will be playing a role of the constructive opposition so far talk of coalition is prematured in mind unless  it is for the congress-i to decide what they've  whether they want to have coalition whether they want to remain minority government  all those things have to be indicated by congress  and if there is any indication the national front and the left  combined we'll sit together and take a view on that  are you open to the idea of a coalition government of congress ? no i'm not uh open to that but if the situation demands we will give it a go to the situation  it'll in my view uh too early to answer it unless that they move   you're not ruling it out   you're not ruling it out no no it comes when you know the whole thing  because the country is passing to a very serious crisis  not financial law and order all things are there  and there should be a government  and that government should be able to give solutions  the when you talk of coalition it's very difficult to answer because there are issues on which we oppose and if the party which proposes is agreeable to those solutions  other than the common issues joshijee on which your party can extend critical suport or constructive support to congress-i ? uh i don't think so  uh we would be sitting in opposition  uh there is no reason and no occasion  so i think vinod said issues particular issues well you see that whenever there are issues uh  infringing upon national security say there is a war or there is a calamity of an unprecedented magnitude then certainly we extend co-operation and support to the government  but as of uh in day-to-day normal implementation of programmes and policy well certainly i don't find that there is any reason or occassion to extend any support  but for all measures of uh national welfare i mean certainly agreed to political parties i think we'll quickly go first to bombay  yeah murlidhar is waiting  yeah  murlidhar is waiting over there  the former chief minister of maharashtra who has been declared winner from colaba constituency  mr antulay you were one of the leading president  attempting to overthrow mr pawar  what made you suddenly uh one word  well i believe that this assumption unfortunately is not very correct  see there could be internal differences in any democratic set-up  which of course our party claims to have have  but when it comes to a national disaster or calamity all the local differences even national differences within the party gets under  what positive sense of insecurity that made you uh mend fences with mr pawar ? what what exactly do you mean by sense of insecurity  because you had the patron of mr rajeev gandhi  now the scenario is different  you mean to say that mr pawar didn't have the patronage of mr rajeev gandhi  i believe everybody has patronage  he was our leader  we all accepted him as our leader  the question of patronage if you use that word if you choose to use it is not is rather inappropriate but if you want to choose it you are welcome to do so  but then everybody has his patronage including mr pawar  so there is no question of antulay having patronage and not pawar  did mr pawar's campaigning uh really help you ? well mr pawar's campaigning did help dispell  the suspicions created by the bjp candidate who was my main rival  that he has the support of the chief minister which was not true  and mr pawar's presence there and campaign and canvassing was necessary  i mean to that effect and i think uh we succeeded i mean in that uh endevour  would you've lost had it not been for mr pawar's  campaigning ? no i don't think i would have lost  that nobody even mr pawar also doesn't think that i would have lost  even mr pawar won't say  in fact uh it was as i said only to dispell the doubts created in the minds of the people by uh against our own chief minister  because mr pawar is a congress-i chief minister and it's  my duty as congress man to see that he one or two words  thank you very much mr uh antulay we're running short of time thank you very much on that note this is h v muralidhara returning you to bombay  delhi  thank you very much murali  at the moment uh this is the first time actually vinod thanks to one word net this computer uh net-work that we using which is the planning commissioned uh infra-structure  that we have been able to actually ga  garner some information of votes all across the country normaly this takes uh the election commission and other sources at least week or ten days to sort out  so we we were very luky unto night we can actually review the situation today the about the votes of the different parties uh across the country  let's look at the all india vote share of all the different parties  now this is based so far on four hundred and fifty one lead  and the vote position is as follows  thirty-six percent for the congress-i  that's down to about two percent since last time  the bjp thirty-three percent coming seco   second doing extremely well  the janata dal twelve on its own  the cpm six and others which is the conglamuration of parties  twenty-three now if we compare this with nineteen eighty-nine and look at the vote change of swing in vote the congress as i said was down two percent  the bjp the biggest gainer almost doubling its vote to ten percent the janata dal suffering quite a set back now really in three states down by five percent  cpm about up point five to one percent and others down four percent
