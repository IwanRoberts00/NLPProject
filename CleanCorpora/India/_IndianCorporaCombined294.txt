hello i'm meenakshi v today i'm going to speak on the topic science and happiness  there have been many wonderful discoveries by scientists to make our lives more comfortable more safe and more interesting  but if we ask the question have these discoveries made men happier ? it is difficult to give a true answer  the chief difficulty in giving a true answer is because   happiness is not a material thing which can be given to us like food or motor or a radio set it is in our mind just think carefully and you will see that this is so  if you get something which pleases you the happiness is not in the thing but in your mind which finds the thing pleasurable  there is another point about happiness  which is also worth thinking about  happiness does not depend upon the amount of things you have  it does not come to you when you try to get it and keep it  on the contrary it depends on the fewer fewness of your wants just think about it this also carefully  a man who has many wants always wants more  he wants one thing and tries to get it  he gets it but he is not satisfied  he wants something else  the more he gets the more he wants  is not that true of most people who want wealth or power or high position ? most people are like that even if their wants are for  smaller things  a boy wants a bicycle  his father gives him one  he sees someone with a be better   bicycle so he wants one like that  when he is a little older he wants a motor cycle  then he wants a motor car  if he has enough money to buy one he wants another and a bigger one and so on  but a man who has few wants whether he is poor or rich has a much better chance of being happy  the wisest men in the world have taught us that the only complete happiness is when one wants nothing  it is difficult for us to be like that  but nevertheless it is true that merely having more does not make us happier  that is why most people are not happier today even with many wonderful and useful new things that science has discovered and given us  some of the things which science has given us have certainly helped  to make our lives happier  science has helped us to get rid of many sickness of the body  that is a great thing  it is difficult to be happy in your body if your body is full of pain  we have learnt of the many discoveries made by scientists to make us painless and to get rid of the cause of pain and sickness  by making it possible to cure terrible diseases such as malaria  small-pox plague pneumonia and tuberculosis science has lenghtened the life of the average man  in nineteen hundred every baby born in the u s a could be expected to live less than fifty years  fifty years later the health conditions have so much improved that the average length of life was nearly seventy years  a few hundred years ago the average length of life was less than thirty years   but it certain but it is certain sorry   but is it certain that people were less happy in those times  ? what is the use what what is the use of living longer unless you are also happy ? science is helping man to produce much more food from the earth by this it is helping to prevent famine and sickness due to undernourishment  it has also made it possible to send quick relief to places where there is shortage of food and medicines with the help of motor uh motor lorries railway trains ships and aeroplanes  this is also very good and many lives are saved in such ways  but in india and some other countries such as indonesia and south america the number of people is increasing faster than than the food supply  science has not yet found out how to solve that problem  it is a very serious because there will be worse and worse famine unless it is solved  and people certainly cannot be happy if they are starving  can they ? there are also many discoveries of science which have definitely brought unhappiness into the world  that is not because the discoveries are bad but because men are using them badly  for example consider the discovery of the gun powder and of other explosives each more powerful than the previous one discovered  in ancient times men could wound and kill each other only if they were near enough to strike each other with stones arrows spears or swords  even in the battles of the olden times which history calls great battles the armies on both the sides usually consisted only of a few thousand men and the number of wounded and killed in the wars  of those times was not very great  in most wars except a few such as the wars which destroyed the roman empire the peasant went on cultivating their fields peacefully  even when the armies were fighting a few miles away  but the invention of fire arms and high explosives caused a great change  a modern machine gun or quick firing gun worked by a single man can wound and kill hundreds of people in a few minutes one modern bomb can kill thousands  it is said that the latest type of atomic bomb could kill  hundreds of thousands of people immediately if it was dropped on a big city  the scientists who invented these terrible weapons are not wicked men who enjoy killing  they are people with kind hearts like yours and mine but they are more clever and they can earn their living by discovering new things  it is the leaders of the various nations who employ them to make discoveries which can be used to kill the people of  o other nations that are to blame  the same country discoveries could be used only for useful purposes if the leaders did not allow them to be used for killing  explosives are not harmful if they are used for such purposes as helping to get coal metals and other minerals out of the earth  the same motors and aeroplanes which are used to carry guns and drop bombs can be very useful for good purposes  so you see that it is not the discoveries and inventions that are bad but the ways in which men use them  now let us try to find out why men use them for harmful purposes  it is not easy to find this out but it is very important  unless you can find it out there will be more and more terrible wars in your your own time and if we go on like that our grand-children will not be able to live in this world at all  the earth will become a desert and mankind will come to an end  with these few words i end my speech  thank you for giving me an oppotunity to speak  thank you once again  hello i'm shantala speaking in uh speaking  for the total literacy in if inevitable  for the political social and economic development of a country on the world scene on one hand india can stand proudly shoulder to shoulder with frontline countries in matters of space research  advanced technology etcetera  but in literacy queue we are far behind other countries   it's well known world over that the areas of poverty and illiteracy more or less overlap each other in a map and continued illiteracy can be a major handicap for the growth and development of democratic institution in a country  in this context functional literacy becomes all the more significant and important  mere advertisement and learning three hours is of no consequence  rather than an end in itself literacy should be regarded as a way of preparing man for social and civil and economic role  literacy teaching is resolutely oriented towards development  and should be an integral part of not only of any national educational plans  but also of plans and projects for development of all sectors of national life  considering the experience of many other countries the targets fixed by india's educational planners are by no means beyond realisation but still are lagging behind   let's analyse the need for our relevance of literacy in a few more specific situations  there are very prejudices facts and taboos which frown upon literacy go indeed to demonstrate its strength let us start with the example of industrial workers  an industrial worker in a an organised sector however intelligent and enterprising is also in need of access to information about the source of raw material and its conversation to  finished goods price standardisation and quality control marketing  rate fixation process provision relating to safety and the work at the work place etcetera  a belief that thus an illiterate worker can also successfully operate machines can repar repair and maintain them is nothing but a an affirmation  of a blind prejudice could be the outcome of vested interests  a worker in the unorganised or the semi- organised sector is in need of sem similar access to information about various process of modernisation improved farming  suitability of a particular soil to a particular crop quality of seeds fertilisers and other modern methods  the malfunctional middlemen who rob the legitimate share of the farm and the forest produce may be tactfully dropped  the plight of the share croppers of the landless agricultural labourers fact factors which lead to their indebtness and bondage will be improved to a very great extent  yet another important segment of the society is the rural artisans they should also wake up from their traditional slumber and look around them and the world  they must look beyond the crude and antiquited ways of making goods example of back blacksmith  should leave his old slumber and switch on to new electric arc furnace etcetera the potter to electric wheels and others  in the social background improving the sta   status of women uh depends mostly on literating the woman  it helps in warding off the superstition and other social evils too woman it helps a woman in tracing her identity and strength and weakness herself  no more she is what we say in sanskrit koop manduke  that's the frog in the well  and even in the political situation the voting right of a person is denied that is because a person is illiterate  and if a person is literate he ca he cannot be deceived by the politi  political parties or the politicians  they can fight for the rights to a greater extent  thus literacy in a sense is not a dose which can produce instant and dramatic results  it can it's an absract weapon through though powerful which gradually trains and equips some human mind and prepares it increasingly for eventual change  these few words of mine add up to the inevitability of total literacy for a countries all round development  thank you
