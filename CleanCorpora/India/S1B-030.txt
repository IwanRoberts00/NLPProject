""
""
so   the the   the   movement  in the
new situation  has to concentrate or adjust itself  to many of this 
uh issues or problem
""
""
quite right 
""
rasgotraji  one uh issue i would like to raise which is  that
as a concept  non-alignment is perhaps  uh forty years old 
""
if you   takes   take   its birth  with the
famous speech of jawaharlal nehru in parliament
""
""
nineteen forty-six
""
""
nineteen forty-six 
""
but as a movement it is  uh  thirty  thirty-one years old
""
""
now  despite the fact that uh  it has had criticism from all
quarters that you are mentioning 
""
there were critics even during the  two words  
""
would you say that in the present situation the concept is still
valid ?
""
that uh  that is number one 
""
number two has the non-align movement  if it opens a 
balance of say  performance or achievement and i think  do you think
the ledger uh  shows more credit  or discredits 
""
has it you got anything to be satisfied about  in terms of the
fact that it define for itself a certain agenda  ?
""
has it fulfilled at least any element of post agenda or some
elements of those agenda  ?
""
""
 let's  take the concept first 
""
""
yes 
""
""
i think the foreign policy uh  the whole idea of 
country having foreign policies  have been evolving  four thousand
years let us say for a long time 
""
originally the concept that controlled or conditioned the  uh
framing of foreign policy and its  one word   was the doctrine of
the supremacy of power 
""
take up your neighbour  and the next  and the next 
""
so you are a dominant power
""
""
might is right 
""
""
then  came a more uh  rational concept in a world 
which had many more state impending on one another 
""
and this concept grew in the italian city-states  of the
medieval age 
""
uh the back concept is balance of power
""
but basically that was also very much rooted in the use of power
""
""
now in nineteen forty-seven with the independance of india a whole
new world emerged 
""
and in the fiftees and the sixtees  some  hundred new
countries joined the global panorama 
""
and this  called for  the  definition  of a new concept
 of our foreign policy  and the conduct of foreign policies in the
country
""
that is  india's  contribution  uh to  the  the
evolution of the concept 
""
now this i think is a very permanent sort of contribution  to
the whole idea what a foreign policy is ?
""
how it should be conducted ?
""
and so on and so forth 
""
therefore this is something which is not going to become irrelevant
 for a very very very long time 
""
those earlier concepts have not become irrelevent today 
""
the idea is to make them irrelevent 
""
what is non-aligned uh  concept basically  they forget the
name 
""
 it's  a policy of peace  independance co-operation among
nations 
""
i think these three concepts are  redundant  
""
now these are concepts which are not likely to become irrelevent
""
""
to come to the second point uhm about the  uh record or the
ledger of this movement 
""
look at the initial agenda  uh of the movement 
""
it was decolonization  uh disarmament  uh  the
disbandment  of apartheid  racialism 
""
all those  most of those items have been acomplished
""
and i think in their accomplishment in decolonization for example
 in dismantling of apartheid  even in  generating pressure for the
 beginning of  disarmament  nuclear disarmament 
""
non-alignment  non-aligned movement has played a very very
significant role  which will be part of human history 
""
now times have changed 
""
mind you times have changed in a very limited sense
""
i think  it's  wrong to take that there are no alliances
""
today nato still exists 
""
 it's  in search of a new role 
""
what happened in the gulf recently  is a good indicator  uh
for us to bear in mind 
""
and   it's  the role of the non-align movement 
""
while the last  alliance block persist  to oppose the concept
of law 
""
it is not uh  the role of newly independent country  uh to
become a camp follower  of  one block because one block remains  and
the other has disappeared 
""
and certainly for india   that's  not the role i
visualised 
""
""
well uh  whatever scepticism about the movement  is
there  it is mostly in non-official  uh sources or quarters  because
governments which are subscribed to non-aligned  concept and   one
word  and movement are still committed to it 
""
and this perhaps explains one reason 
""
the reason why  those movement started with only twenty-five
members  in belgrade 
""
it is not as many as hundred and two or hundred and three members
and more and more   are at  least want to come in either as guests
or as obeservers  or something
""
so mani there must be something in the movement  to attract
them  a
""
and b  they would also  perhaps want to find out and assert
 what non-align movement is going to do ?
""
in which area is it is it going to operate ?
""
because  the areas of uh  imperialism  anti-imperialsim
 anti-colonialism  anti-racism  all that 
""
theatre  is no more a  rationing  exhausted into it
""
in what is a new theatre in which  non-align movement can
operate
""
""
  one or two words   
""
""
viswam scepticism    yes  is largely spoiled by
ignorance  and by destructiveness 
""
and when you say  use that rather  gentle word non-official
 we know that  it's  mostly people who have not spent  time
understanding the main spirits  of not only indian foreign policy but the
foreign policy of a hundred newly independent counrty 
""
who would wonder whether  non-alignment merely is a simplistic
equation with not being involved  in a world which is being divided up 
into rival military camps 
""
when you ask what is the new role of non-alignment ?
""
i would prefer to take mr  rasgotra's  phrase  and think
what is the role of non-alignment in the new  international context rather
than  seek a new role for non-align movement
""
because  the fundamental battle of non-align movement is
against the quest for dominance 
""
we shall  alienate  international relation  for almost
all of human history 
""
the only reason  i'm  not able to say  for all the human
history is that ever since jawaharlal nehru  became a major player on the
international field  and brought to  bear  on international
relation 
""
the better values that has been evolved by mahatma gandhi  in
the freedom movement  there a new concept was thrown upon the chess board
of international politics 
""
that new chess board being  that in the new  uh concept being
 that instead of the  quest for dominance  could there be  a
quest for co-operation 
""
is it possible for countries which are    uneq  
 unequal    in their economic political or military endowments
 to have a relationship of equality between themselves  where we strive
to attain a  one word  optimum
""
a  one word  optimum being one  where  neither 
that no one is better off by being at a different point of the equiliberium
and everyone  is better off by being attract particular point
""
""
 yes  
""
""
well in other words   i mean   what   what
   you're  saying is  inequality  inequality still
persist  and    yeah  in order to remove those inequality
""
""
  a few words   
""
""
 yes  
""
""
 that's  right  that's  what i    one
or two words   i want to  revert  if i may just for a second to
what i opened with 
""
so long as inequality persists  non-alignment is required
""
so long as oppression is there  non-alignment is required
""
and so long as equal respect  is not accorded  that the
sovereignity of every single nation  that long will non-alignment
""
""
  one or two words   
""
""
  yes  professor mishra
""
""
 right right   i was saying that uh  one of the
main reasons for misunderstanding  in so far as the role and relevence of
non-alignment is concerned  has occured  because the  uh so called
soft power  is in the hands of the industrialized countries 
""
journals books universities research institutions and so on
""
and  connected with this is the instrument of mass media 
""
newspapers television this that and so on 
""
this  total situation has in a sense brainwashed  uh elites
in many countries  and it is reflected in some of our newspaper 
""
some of these  uh people are writing 
""
these are the people who have no  appreciation  of our hopes
and aspirations  for our needs and requirements 
""
therefore   you    we   come across 
including newspapers in india some of the national newspapers 
""
papers  there they are writing  articles on non-alignment 
which  which are absolutely out of phase 
""
now this is one thing about uh  i mean the the mass media and
the so called soft power 
""
the other thing which we must keep in mind is that when jawaharlal
nehru  pioneered this movement he was the real pioneer 
""
he had two things in mind 
""
one was that this country was economically poor 
""
politically  of not much consequence except that the leadership
was trying to  fail  on 
""
and at the same time the international situation was very  one
word 
""
in fact the the clouds of the third world war  uh on our
horizon  on the international horizon at that time 
""
he tried to float the idea of non-alignment in order  to
subserve  national interest of india  in an international atmosphere of
peace and harmony 
""
so in his view  the total picture of  of the  one word
 was there in which  the two systems  national and international
 were not antagonistic with each other
""
but they were to function in harmony with each other
""
""
quite right 
""
mr rasgotra you want want   to say  something 
""
""
 may i  
""
""
i just want to  one word  this kind of scepticism 
i find much more evident here in our own country than i found it for example
in europe
""
i was there uh last month 
""
i travelled around 
""
uh in countries like germany and france  there is a strong
feeling  that this movement needs to be strengthened 
""
as if   one word  all kinds of new pressures  uh are
coming up
""
there are new divisions arising
""
among the developed world also  there is uh new  uh scramble
for markets 
""
uh economic pressures and other things
""
now  this movement has a role in these circumstances 
""
in europe i found great sympathy  with objectives of this
movement its way of conducting itself 
""
and i think that should  we we need to  uh rethink 
""
we should not think of non-alignment or non-align movement as a
thing between two other things  russia  soviet union  united states
of america  communism or democracy 
""
but as some an entity in itself with a positive role with a
positive concept
""
then this kind of  scepticism misunderstanding will not arise
""
""
""
mr   rasgotra 
""
""
  one or two words  
""
""
here is in if you permit me i will just say one sentence
""
""
yes
""
""
that  it's  a very  one word  
""
on account of cereberal deficiency  and moral timidity 
""
i say moral timidity because  we are poor or by the  by a
certain power  which has reversed most predominant  and we are all very
uh  this  mantra  of uni polarism  is unnecessarily
amongst us
""
""
quite right
""
""
try to  stress that
""
""
non-alignment is basically an alternative moral power
""
and  the reason why  the perception that mr rasgotra have
visited europe 
""
of people in europe thinking   we're  all relevent
adjust the time when sceptics in our country are thinking  that  we're
 perhaps less relevent 
""
is that there is a type  one word   between the
polarities of the global politics  and the polarities of the global
economy 
""
in the global economy there are only two  really resurgent
players 
""
there is germany  and   japan 
""
""
 japan  
""
""
neither of them has a role in the global polity 
""
and the global polity  is now dominated by one power  which
is in the mist of the worst recession 
""
this is as experienced in
""
""
domestically right
""
 a few words 
""
""
and therefore everyone is searching for a new role
""
and at that point in time  everyone is looking for a new role
""
""
specially those who used to be the dominant power 
""
for us to say  that there is now no role for us in the new 
uh situation would be the biggest  mistake we could do
""
""
no i have we not heard about  india's  role  
 a few words  
""
""
  a few words   
""
""
viswam i want to refined uh  with  mani's 
permission his phrase a little
""
he said  alternative  moral force  
""
i think uh 
""
""
moral force or no moral force
""
obviously there is a force of some kind when hundred countries get
together 
""
""
i think  it's  a an alternative vision of the world
""
""
not a world of power  but a world of justice  peace 
co-operation  equality among nations 
""
so that  everybody goes together 
""
but the vision  vision of one world  and one world can come
about only  not on the  basis of power  but justice fair-play
equality peace  co-operation
""
""
if you permit me i would say this  one word  to me to
be a little idealistic 
""
  i i   i   remember a sentence which  e h
 kirk  said in his famous book   the conduct of foreign
policy is not an exercise  in sainthood  in morality  
""
therefore modern dimension is there but   to to   to
  emphasis it too much  in the context of either non-alignment or
foreign policy i think uh  will not cut much ice
