good afternoon and uh  greetings to  doordarshan
 viewers  and uh welcome to the  shiv chhatrapati sport city
 at balewadi  the outskirts of uh pune 
""
uh pune of course  one considers something to a paradise  and
uh  the speech of course dedicated to the late rajiv gandhi  the
former prime minister of india  on his uh fiftieth uh  birthday 
""
the uh  city of course has been indeed one professional paradise
 is uh today labelled as a sport city  and uh has been the hosting of
uh  the international marathon over the last ten years 
""
uh we also witnessed the third national games successfully 
concluded at the start of the year 
""
and uh   we're  now watching the  start of the seventh
international uh  uh permit meet  here at  the shiv chhatrapati 
sport city complex 
""
uh just before we uh  came onto the air  we spoke to the
president of the  uh amateur athletic federation of india  uh mr suresh
kalmadi 
""
the president of the amateur athletic federation of india  and uh
he is responsible for the seventh international permit meet here in pune 
mr suresh kalmadi
""
mr kalmadi nervous 
""
""
not at all  fully prepared 
""
""
uh tell me  the meet for the first time is being held in
pune  why is that you got it here  ?
""
""
well uh  pune has got this beautiful sport city  and
 manifold athelitic stadium with uh  synthetic tract
""
so we thought uh  this sport city  should have first
international event  in the form of a permit meet 
""
plus the  track at jawaharlal nehru stadium  at new delhi
 is not up the mark   we've  been asking them to lay a new
track  till they lay a new track  we can not have a international meet
there 
""
""
uh  you are also asking uh looking forward to recognition
from the world for the grand  feat  
""
now  uh in case  and uh we are wishful and hopeful that you
get it next year 
""
would you then be holding it here  ?
""
""
well uh  that will have to be decided by the federation
""
""
uh  we are in a run for the grand  feat  you are aware
that uh  mr  primo nebolio  is the  world president  in the
last meeting he had said that  the grand  feat  will be extended
to asia  and he has named india and japan  as the next country 
where the grand  feat  will be held 
""
so then  this time athletic come to india  and you see 
lot of us  uh champions coming here  as part of their routine  they
will have to come here 
""
so earn their points point world wise 
""
so that will be  really good 
""
""
and talking of this uh permit meet  what do we have in
store  ?
""
""
well  uh  this is uh  no doubt  the greatest 
athletic event so far held in india 
""
 we've  never had  the level of competition we will be
seeing here today 
""
we have got over ten  world champions here  and  the
competition is going to be so good because  a very good crop of athletes
are here today 
""
you are aware that carl lewis and merlene ottey are heading the 
list of world champions 
""
we have started this permit meet  not to give so much
competition to indian  but to popularise athletics in the country 
""
we as a country go more to cricket  as if   we've 
been just watching the match 
""
but i think what is  needed today   two words  for
athletes that  more attention to be put to  athletics  that's 
why we get people like  carl lewis and merlene ottey here 
""
so the youngster in this country look towards olympic spot 
""
""
and uh  obviously  uh you are also looking at uh 
this as a preparation for  the indian contingent for the  uh asian
games
""
""
 that's  right 
""
you see luckily this timed well  so the indian team is  uh on
its  last lap to  the asian games hiroshima they are going to get
tremendous competition here  especially bahudar prasad and  shiny
ibrahim saramma  shakti singh  uh also relay teams will get tremendous
 uh competition here today 
""
so it will be very good uh  for them at the asian games 
where the  standard of the asian games will not be as high as the standard
you will see here today
""
""
mr kalmadi thank you very much
""
we wish you the very best  and we hope that under your guidance
 indian athletes continue to grow  from stature to stature  thank
you very much
""
""
thank you 
""
""
well uh  the uh guest of honour uh  shri 
vidya charan shukla the union minister for water resources  along with uh
 uh  shri  mukul vasnik the union minister for sports and
cultural affairs uh  are here 
""
the festivities would get under way soon 
""
uh but uh to  uh tell you what scheme store over the next four
hours  uh is my colleague commentator  john castro 
""
""
this seventh edition of the  i t c international  is an
inspirational excercise 
""
bringing these foreign athletes to india  is basically  to
give them an exposure  where  watching the others in action  and
running aganist them  will help our own boys and girls 
""
these men and women who are  representing india  both in
india and abroad  to do better 
""
now   it's  very obvious  that indian  athletes 
rarely get a chance to take their to take part against  some of the best
performers in the world 
""
now this happens  in  this i t c meet  where you have
world champions  olympic champions  and uh some of the best performers
 in the grand  feat  circuit 
""
and the exposure definitely  is helpful
""
and which  especially in this exercise  with the asian games
coming around the corner  the exposure  will certainly help our men
and women  to  hopefully do better because  whatever performances
 we record here  then probably the same could come at hiroshima or even
better  because all depending on the morale
""
""
well john just breaking away from you for a movement
""
these are the  uh girls from dastur high school pune 
""
hundred of them  and uh  they start the march past 
""
 they're  going to display the rainbow  uh the colours
which we all know as  vibgyor 
""
as the cheer goes up  for a fine display  we are marching
 as one would say   kadam  se kadam milaye jaa  
the band in attendance here  is uh from the national defence academy 
uh just a few  kilometres away from the  sports complex 
""
and uh along with the band from the national defence academy  uh
is the band of the maratha light infantry  belgaum 
""
the band masters  uh subedar major  sumer singh  and band
master subedar major  uh kishan  shetty 
""
they are playing   kadam badhaye ja  
""
we have a host of dignitories present here 
""
and i said earlier on the  guest of honour  the uh
honourable minister for water resources  uh  shri 
vidyacharan shukla along with uh  uh  shri   mukul
vasnik the union minister for sports are here 
""
and this is the march past 
""
john a little deviation  they're  marching in a jumbled
formation 
""
""
yeah because uh   it's  uh just had especially we
have  an opening ceremony  in say the asians games or  the olympic
games 
""
but here more  it is a friendly exercise  but of course 
not in competition 
""
that is why  it is uh  it has been decided here  that they
walk uh  without  the regular marching  regimentation that we have
normally 
""
""
well a broad moment for the girls and  that's  the 
section of the v i p box  uh you watch  uh the union minister for
water resources  shri  vidya charan shukala  uh along with
mukul vasnik the president of the amateur athletic federation of india 
 shri  uh suresh kalmadi 
""
the uh g o c m c southern command lieutenant general moti dhar is
also here 
""
six from belarus  two from belgium  six from china  john
there you are for the first time 
""
""
yes the chinese are here for the first time  and you we
really do not know much  about their performances
""
it is when you ask them  something about what  they're 
really doing they don't understand our language 
""
""
yes  we're  certainly uh  look for a surprise and
 that's  vibgyor which goes up for the  uh indian contingent 
""
this is a big meet for them 
""
just a few weeks uh before they depart for the asian games  in
uh hiroshima  uh p t usha the darling of the crowd she is there 
""
 she's  going to be running today as well  along with uh
 shiny wilson  and uh 
""
and of course you can't miss out uh bahadur prasad   who's
 won  laurel's  uh  for india in the international circuit 
""
a proud moment for the girls from dastur high school pune  a
hundred strong  as they march up  in unison  and uh  that goes
to prove that uh  we in india are all one  as they march together
""
""
""
this indian team which is here  comprises those  
who're  going to hiroshima  as well as  some of the prominent
youngsters  who are in the a a f i camp   that's  the amateur
athletic federation of india camp  those youngsters are getting the
exposure  so that uh  they also get a chance amongst  against these
world champions  and it could   helpful    be helpful 
 to them 
""
""
between john yes  uh this is uh the thing in the right
direction isn't it  ?
""
""
right you have to give them exposure  well as cheer or with
applaud  and thankfully  are the indian athlete  have had the quite
a good measure of exposure  in europe and elsewhere this season  and
hopefully  they should uh  come with some medals at uh  from
hisroshima  like at beijing  where it was all silver  and a couple
of bronze 
""
but uh  this time  we are expecting better much uh  you
also have to be a very realistic  about the fact that the chinese  and
the athlete from the middle east  have uh  gone  away away from us
and uh  it is going to be difficult 
""
""
john the presence of uh carl lewis  and uh merlene ottey
here  is certainly going to be a big inspiration uh  not only for the
athlete but uh  the thousands of youngsters who have gathered 
""
""
to kipta i mean kiptanui  the uh  moses kiptanui of
kenya 
""
he is the world record  holder for the two miles  and uh
also for the two thousand metres in  one word   and he will be
running here shortly this afternoon 
""
he says my hero  is  a few words   who came to india
 and previously in previous years and  he says that in kenya  we
all these  old athletes who are  greats and greats in their own way 
as ideal which is at one time i used to look to  crieno  
""
and uh my ideal and uh  first to do  i'd  like to feel
like  and today he says  everybody in kenya says  we'd  like to
be like moses kiptanui  if he is wearing a new hairstyle then  but uh
 you'd  like to see him better  when he runs 
""
""
well they all trooping in here  the youngsters uh 
along with the mothers and  i'm  sure they are going to be the 
stars of the future 
""
they are coming here to watch the big stars in action 
""
 they're  going to go back home  wondering what they
must do 
""
and uh  we have the president of the amateur athletic
federation of india mr suresh kalmadi now  addressing the uh  athletes
""
""
well that was uh  mr suresh kalmadi  the president of the uh
 amateur athletic federation of india 
""
uh his words uh  to the congregation here at uh  the sports
complex 
""
a complex which of course uh  is a city by itself  with uh
so many beautiful stadium  uh which are capable of hosting almost 
all the sports
""
during the last national games the last national games which were
held in  uh  uh january  uh start of the year  uh only six of
them were held in uh  bombay 
""
mr mukal vasnik the union minister for sport  uh looking at a
vision  in the distant future 
""
uh he spoke of a four year plan for all the federations  of
sports 
""
and uh  this mission would take india from uh  strength to
strength  as we march on into the 
""
and uh the national record is in the name of shakti singh  at
uh sixty-one point seven two 
""
we are watching the start of the  women's  three hundred
metres 
""
""
which has two indians here 
""
we have rosa kutty  we got shiny wilson 
""
now  that's  the  well  shiny wilson has got about 
a good rate yesterday  where you have  some good athletes you come to
win here again  come to gain gold medal 
""
 a few words  
""
chinese second position at the moment 
""
""
but the national record is in the name of jyoti  sikdar
 at two minutes o one point six zero  a beat record in the name of
yuan   grabbermine of germany 
""
""
  it's  very hot chase   
""
very hard chase this 
""
katherine maenhout belgium  in the first position at the
moment 
""
shiny wilson in third position 
""
shiny coming up now let us see what she is going to do now 
""
oh that looked like big break of shiny wilson  and  let's
 see now whether she is going through 
""
striding strongly  is natalia dukhnova   she's 
second in the world championship  silver medalist in the world
championship 
""
and shiny going for all she can 
""
 she's  done better  in uh  europeans on european
circuit  and  it's     shi    shiny  
can do it just now 
""
dukhnova striding back shiny also coming through  only a little
bit more for a stride  got through the back stride  very close 
but she just cannot make it 
""
 that's   dukhnova natalia  the second in the world
championship and  champion here  the one with the dark glasses 
number two two six natalia dukhnova  of belarus 
""
second  close second was shiny wilson 
""
normally shiny never comes up  with such a finish  but it
definitely looks like that she has improved in the finishing business 
""
and the  european circuit has done her well
""
""
well  that's  the action replay for you i think shiny
is  starting a wee bit uh  at the bitter end  and uh  dukhnova
of belarus  full of experience  striding away 
""
it looked so near for shiny but uh  it wasn't to be  as uh
 natalia dukhnova of belarus there she breaks the tape now  to win
the  women's  eight hundred metres final  and uh edging out 
shiny wilson from india  and to complete uh the event  uh in third spot
was uh  cydesen  karen of  denmark 
""
so the teams here  uh taking there first medal 
""
and  we're  watching the uh  prize distribution of the
  women's  four hundred metres 
""
the uh  prizes being handed out the medals by  the union
minister for sports  shri  mukul vasnik  uh to anja rooker
of germany  who won  with the time of fifty-two point two zero 
""
richa hedid of  the united states fifty-two point five eight
takes the silver 
""
and  bi  ziagun of china  coming in third spot uh 
happiness all over her face  fifty-two point nine zero 
""
and uh that certainly makes a very happy picture  for uh the
albums of these three athletes  posing with uh  shri  mukul
vasnik the youthful minister for sports 
""
remember we are here at uh  the   shri  shiv
chattrapati sports city in pune  for the seventh addition of the
international permit meet 
""
held  on six earlier occasion in uh  new delhi at the
jawaharlal nehru stadium 
""
and uh  it's  this is the first time that uh  it being
hosted at pune 
""
as we move over to the  uh  men's  discus 
""
a hundred and seventy-one ajit  bahduria of india 
""
the crowds on their toes at the far end  trying to see the
 finest athletes uh  in action 
""
 that's  ajit bahduria  with the discus 
""
jurgen schultz  the world record holder  much expected from
him 
""
and uh these children in colourful clothes just going off your
screen watching  uh jurgen schultz  at the discus  
interruption 
""
we had a very colourful opening  uh today here at pune
""
 that's  jurgen schultz  a fine action replay  his
uh  body coordination 
""
 that's  what has made him uh  record holder at the
discus in the world  and the germans have always dominated this event
  interrupton 
""
""
they all set for the eight hundred metres  which has
record  olympic champion  william tanui in full black 
""
willaim tanui is  one great sensational runner  alternating
between the eight hundred and the fifteen hundred metres 
""
 it's  unfortunate that paul ruto expected here  didn't
finally come 
""
otherwise it would have been a sensational race  between one
the world champion  and the other  the olympic champion 
""
but we have william tanui here  and in the  interruption
 here the six uh  we have two indian runners avtaar singh  the best
for the four hundred metres in india  and jercy matthew 
""
they are  organised deliberately put put  both of these
indian runners together in three hundred  because  avtaar singh
probably  could come in  in the relay  basically the relay for
india  is very important four by two hundred metres relay and of course
both the women  four by hundred and four by two hundred metres relay
""
""
and just for the statistical minded the meet record  in
the name of billa contella of kenya  one minute forty-five point nine
three  and uh once again surprising john the indian record  still 
quite old  shri  ram sing one forty-five point seven seven
""
""
yeah they don't make them like  shri  ram
singh and milkha singh these days
