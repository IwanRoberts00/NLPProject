uh prof deshpande  the coordinator for  this particular
course in english of the  academic staff college marathawada university
 prof shastri visiting professor here  and my friends 
""
professor deshpande of course  uh was attempting to  apply
cosmetics  to many of the short comings that i possess 
""
and he was praising many of the things which i don't deserve  to
the power of yen 
""
so  you've  got to take everything that he says with a 
pinch of salt if not with a ton of salt 
""
uh having said that  uh god only knows how  desperately 
i wanted to become  what uh the standard coach  of the marathwada
university  says as a  non-teaching employee of a non- agricultural
university   laughter 
""
so   that's  what i wanted to become 
""
and uh  unfortunately  various development took place  and
uh as a consequence i am here  trying to discuss things with you share
some of my thoughts with you  so  that's  the background 
""
but anyway it gives me a lot of pleasure  to meet many of my old
students and old friends in this congregation 
""
although i had initially promised to  uh lecture to you  of a
 seven hours in a weeks time unfortunately because of various factors i am
unable to  meet you for this uh  duration 
""
but i think i am going to think of it  what i would have
normally spoken in seven hours in just two lecturing units 
""
i am going to cover  most of the things  in these two
lectures
""
the first topic  would be on  the broad fields and 
conventions in american literature  and it would be followed up  by the
various fictual concepts  that are employed in any discussion of american
literature 
""
now  to start with let me  establish a  comparative frame
of uh  reference  between indian writing in english  and american
literature 
""
i fondly recall  that both these topics were introduced at my
old alma mater andhra university way back in the year nineteen hundred and
sixty-two 
""
that was the year when  one of the earliest of  one word 
scholar  to have collected a degree in the united states of america
professor raghavacharalu had come back with a ph d from the university of
pennsylvenia  and my old teacher  professor shrinivas iyengar  had
uh  written a pioneering book  on indian writing in english
""
so these two streams  came to a head and we were very fortunate
to be  students and that was the year when i graduated and  i wanted to
pursue  my research
""
but uh  in the department itself there was a good deal of
discussion  about indian writing in english
""
even the topic itself  had become controversial debatable 
they were toying with the idea of  employing the term indian english
writing or uh  indo- anglican or anglian uh  writing and ultimately
iyengar thought that indian writing in english  would be broadly 
descriptive and proper
""
and raghavacharlu introduced american literature
""
so we belong to the first generation of students who were exposed
to these two  streams 
""
and surprisingly we also had the  a sort of exhibition  every
fourth year  the university organises an exhibition  it's  so easy
for  people belonging to the various science faculty to display all their
technological wonder and innovation
""
but then  for students of literature what can they do  so
what we had done was to  graphically visually represent  various aspect
of american literature  indian writing in english and we had drawn various
charts 
""
and  i still remember  uh we drew a x axis and a y axis 
""
and there was a confluence of influence  between the political
happenings and  the    li    literary  
development 
""
a crucial periods of time  remarkable text was produced that was
the end result of our own  research
""
i wish i had kept an old copy of uh that visual display 
""
and one would notice that in many respects  the  development
and the growth of indian writing in english  and that of  american
literature seems to have taken  a broad pattern  a particular
configuration which is comparable 
""
and uh  if you go to the beginning  you would notice that uh
 the elements of indian writing in english  were triggered off  they
were given the necessary   one word  mainly because of the famous
minutes  of lord macaulay in the year eighten hundred and thirty-five 
""
and uh  if you are student of american literure  you would
notice that uh  we normally divide american literature into  the usable
path  and the  the vibrant american literature  which uh 
acquired a particular  shape and a dimension  in the year eighteen
hundred and thirty  particularly when uh  uh emerson  delivered that
famous  speech  addressed the phi betta kappa association of howard 
even it is cool  the  speech which is  one word  on  uh which
was later on come to be known as american  scholar  speech
""
and now a days everybody come to this  this particular speech
delivered by  emerson as uh  the literary declaration of independence
""
""
so  that's  the importance that they give
""
so  one notices that uh  in terms of uh  the time sequence
 the growth and uh progress   they're  comparable although
america was  discovered technically within course because we are
celebrating  the quincentenary year of  the discovery of america
""
columbus  reached the shores of america in the year  fourteen
hundred and ninety-two perhaps in the month of uh  august and uh 
precisely on august sixth 
""
and uh  you know the  basic thing he was in search of a
passage to india  and then he discovered a passage to the  new world
""
""
and uh  in the initial stages of course most of  the
literature was in the  nature  of uh letters addressed to relatives
friends back home  in portugal and in spain because he was commissioned by
king ferdinand to undertake this uh  trip
""
and uh  this sort of a epistolary exercise  formed the source
of american literature but uh  most patriot americans would like to claim
 that uh  even the name of the person who discovered america had been
rather portugal 
""
his name is christopher columbus 
""
christopher meaning christ bearer  columbus meaning the person
who illuminates column   that's  the unit which measures  light
""
so this is symbolically  speaking christopher columbus
discovering america  established the influence of light over  the
forces of darkness  that's  how they symbolically tried to explain 
the significance of columbus discovering america 
""
and uh the  later immigration took place in the early part of
the seventeenth century  uh particularly with  the  myth lover 
compact  and uh  the pilgrims  landing on the plymoth rock 
""
apart from various jokes that are bandit about  one of the joke
says that uh  instead of the pilgrim father landing on the  uh plymouth
rock if the plymouth were to land on the pilgrims  one word   uh
things would have been much better there won't have been any genocides of
indians in america  not to speak of the genocide that was committed in
vietnam etcetera etcetera
""
atleast the ugly americans  would have been saved the image of
the ugly  americans
""
so apart from these things one uh  has a  perception about
the influence of religion  uh in so far as the american writing is uh
concerned mainly because of the radical differences of perception 
religious differences the interness and battles particularly between  the
puritans and the anglicans 
""
in england  it's    one word  over and uh  the
immigration to america took place and  the initial writing was broadly
conditioned by these uh  denominational cause 
""
uh the calvanistic street became very very important  and as a
consequence of this  one word  calvanistic street
""
they  thought that  the founding of america was a new
opportunity for mankind  it's  uh  europe had become totally
corrupt and  therefore people are saying what is happening in bosnia 
and herzegovina  and sarajevo which  gave rise to the first world war
because uh  archduke ferdinand was killed and uh  that released various
forces which resulted in  the beginning of the first world war
""
and people are worried  that  one word  ethnic strife
would spread all over europe and who knows  the third world war might
start from this particular cockpit  in europe
""
now  the root of uh the migration towards america  uh
refered in the broad denominational fight that took place all over europe
between the anglicans  who were one variety of uh catholics and this
puritans
""
and uh  they believed in the calvanistic dictum  of  
 determin    determinism    and all these things
they percolated into the general psyche of uh  the american immigrant
there
""
and initial literature  in america is conditioned by  uh this
sort of a  uhm shall we say  denominational and uh  religious 
conflict and strife  okay
""
we have uh  various calvanist fighting it out  to establish
mainly because they thought that uh  uhm the discovery of america opened
up possibilities  of man going back to the condition of the pre  one
word  had 
""
because uh after  the saviour redeemed mankind  over a period
of time man has succumbed to evil forces 
""
wherever man goes he carries the seeds of evil with him 
""
man is corrupt and whatever he touches  is corrupted
""
so this was the broad belief  and uh  instead of the new
maseih  america itself provided  the image of the new garden of eden
""
""
after uh jesus  got back the paradise that was lost because of
stone passion crusification and sacrifice  here was another great
opportunity so they wanted to transform america into a new  garden of eden
""
so this was the bold  possibilities that they envisaged  in
america they thought there was a glorious opportunity for a new beginning 
""
so all the literature reflect the search of perception 
""
a new opportunity and with an advance fall with  two words 
until a greater man redeemed us  but even the sacrifice   of 
jes    of jesus   has not helped us
""
now  they thought that america is going to provide another
opportunity for the redemption of mankind
""
so  generally one notices this sort of a reflection  in the
early american literture
""
now  thereafter one notices that uh  we had the
transcendentalist presenting their own point of view particularly uhm 
thoreau and uh  emerson  but the speech that i was refering to 
becomes a very crucial part of  the growth and development 
""
and one notices that after eighteen thirty  american literature
 acquired a new vibrancy of its own  where people like whitman 
""
whitman was not trying to immitate  the romantic poets  he
had established a native idiom  and his rhetoric was filled with the
ringing world  that the americans had employed
""
and it was transmiter  but then it represented the new
democratic  america 
""
so this is reflected in the  leaves of grass 
 and in the poetry of uh  whitman
""
i mean as though  it appears as though whitman was just waiting
for somebody  to give the green signal  so that uh  he could publish
all his poetry  without much of uh   innovation  and uh 
there also one notices that the contemporary  of uh  whitman
particularly hawthorne  and melville  because of their  deep study
of elizabethan literature the renaissance  period they started uh 
writing a particular variety of english employed many of their literary
devices  which uh had become important in the whole world 
""
they were still tied to the apron string  of most of the
english  writer
""
but the great  divide occurs when it comes to walt uh  mark
twain
""
 that's  why  one normally says that mark twain is the
lincoln  of american literature 
""
we have uh  a conferable frame of reference between what
happened in politics  and what happens in literature here
""
i wanted to  notice that one 
""
if anybody has seen the picture of uh  washington  the first
president of the united states of america  washington is modelled after
the classical pattern
""
he looks like one of those great roman senators wearing a show
guard  and even the face is so impressive  as though it is chiselled in
marble 
""
but when you come to lincoln  by no stretch of imagination would
one call lincoln  a person built on the classical mode
""
he had  none of the gracian  features  he was uh 
homespun  and homely and  but then there was a certain dignity
""
 it's  like the writings of  melville  and the
writings of mark twain 
""
so  even in politics one notices that the  balance of power
 to use a jaded expression had shifted  from the tide water region of
america that is the east coast  the applachian mountains and the  the
new england region to the interior of america the river  the mississippi
missouri river
""
so  lincoln came from ohio
""
he spent most of his time  in that particular region the heart
of uh  america
""
whereas  the earlier presidents  they came from the old
aristocratic patricians families of virginia or  new york
""
so in political terms balance of power has shifted from  the new
england region to the heart of  america
""
america was still expanding westward california had to be populated
 the gold rush had to take place later on 
""
the so called resting movement had not taken place by that time
""
""
and uh  one notices that lincoln  became the president
possibly the most important president  in the united states of america who
 brought about lots of changes and the civil war took place and uh 
emancipation of the negros also  took place
""
so all these things gave rise to  a particular culture that was
rooted in  the  uhm genius of the people  the indigenous genius of
the americans 
""
so in literature and in politics this sort of a influence  is uh
discernable
""
and uh  one would notice  a similar thing happening because i
started uh  refering to indian writing in english when you come to  our
own uh uh literature that is written in english  one notices that uh 
after  macaulay's   minute  particularly in bengal i have been
pressing this thesis i don't know whether  uh  it's  acceptable or
whether it is well received or not 
""
in  bengal  which is one of the oldest  provinces of the
british raj  one notices that  there is a  simultaneous movement of
uh what i call as uh  both the reformation and the renaissance 
""
renaissance in literature  reformation in  religious aspects
""
""
mainly because uh people like raja ram mohan roy  and the other
 who are acutely conscious of the decadent aspects of hinduism 
consciously they thought many of the good things from christianity and from
various other religious sources  in order to bring about meaningful
transformation of hinduism 
""
what were the uhm  inseparable  uh inadequacies of hinduism
  sati  child marriages and  various other irrational
forms of worship
""
so  one notices that uh  this sort of a  revival of
interest in the ancient glories  coupled with the conscious approach 
to bring about reformation took place there 
""
initially many of them underwent conversion to christianity
""
but then  they wanted to retain what ever was  residuely good
 in hinduism 
""
and as a concequence they started a movement known as the 
brahmo samaj  
""
there are three movements which could be considered as  part of
our own reformation   brahmo samaj  in bengal 
 arya samaj   in erstwhile punjab undivided punjab 
 prarthana samaj  based in pune 
""
so these  i mean  i'll  speak tilak ranade gokhale
etcetera were all  associated with the  prarthana samaj
 based in  pune
""
so they were acutely conscious of uh  various  defeciency 
in hinduism and they wanted to rationalise an ancient religion  and of
course later on  we had people like ramakrishna paramhamsa although he was
totally illiterate  many of the things that he spoke  were christ like
