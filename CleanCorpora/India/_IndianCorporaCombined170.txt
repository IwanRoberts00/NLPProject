i extend a very happy welcome to dr rajni badlani  the english studies officer the british council division bombay  i am also very happy to welcome to dr shastri  whom we have been missing for quite sometime  uh may i request honourable chairman to offer a bouquet to dr badlani as a sign of welcome and request honourable chairman to offer a bouquet to dr shastri who has come after such a long time claps  and now that dr shastri is back and dr badlani is here i hope that they continue to be with us for quite sometime  when we want the british council help and we want dr  shastri's guidance  so with these words i conclude my welcome speech and well i here request honourable chairman to say a few words a few words  it gives me a great pleasure uh to welcome dr badlani  and our beloved dr shastri once again to join us  we were really missing him for the last so many months  now with the god's grace he is back and hope he will be with us for many years to come  with his guidance and assistance of british council  the board of studies i think has come up with the nice  text book of standard nine  and they are also planning to have that the same book  of the same type  as i understand this is a this book has a new approach  it is a quite a good blend of structural approach  and uh  communicative communicative skills  in fact i don't know what is exactly structural approach and communications  but as you are mentioning it again and again i am getting to it  any good change is always welcome  but as you know dr badlani no change is accepted properly  or whole heartedly unless it is properly delivered or  people are made to understand it in the right direction yes  so it should be our endeavour it should be our  one word it includes board of studies state board  teachers and students  we must prepare them to accept this change  and unless we prepare them to accept this change unless we convince them what is good in this we'll have  very difficult great difficulty to drive home  it is not only true for this english this will be true for whole syllabus since our approach to the new syllabus is also changed  we have included many new topics in the syllabus  the board is thinking to have orientation of all teachers  in all subjects  it may be not may not be a exhaustive one  but at least two-three days orientation to all teachers  and particularly for this english language we require more orientation because it being a foreign language it's not our mother tongue it is altogether different and difficult one  to understand and learn  and as we all know the condition of english in rural areas in particular   we'll have to have more efforts on this one   it's of high syllabus exercise it's a communication skill and here only we lack in communication  teachers themselves lack in communication  they can only read and ask students to hear listen  and repeat the same thing  but they hardly speak  so we will have to inculcate them inculcate into them  skill of speaking  if they speak then only the students can be able to  speak something  so in order to prepare them this board of studies has envisaged a programme  and for that programme atleast we will again request  british council and particularly mrs badlani who has extended  help  we intend to in the initial stages we are  have thought of preparing cassettes  am i correct ? video cassettes video cassettes  but somehow dr shastri was not feeling well that scheme has also not come up very well  nevertheless we have not dropped that we have modified the scheme  we will modify it  instead of having a video cassettes we'll have audio cassettes   we'll have audio cassettes  and uh i think sixty percent work of the audio cassettes has been already completed  even if fifty percent has to be completed we will complete it and after the completion of recording we will have  efforts we will make efforts to supply at least two cassettes  per school so that each school will have a cassette to listen  listen in a proper intonation listen correct english  and if they listen correct english they may speak correct  for that also we may request british council state board and other voluntary organisations to help us  secondly we're also planning to have master trainers course  nearly there are sixteen thousand secondary schools  if we take one teacher per school we'll have to train minimum fifteen thousand secondary school teachers in english for english  to train fifteen thousand secondary school whether   two words itself  for that also we'll have to have first resource persons  to train the resource person we have to have some master trainers to train the master trainers we'll have to have the help of board of studies then teachers what you call them  uh experts then book writers and british council  for you also madam we request your organisation to have  uh your help  we will also request central institute of english to extend their help  because if we can if we can train good master trainers  then we can have the good resource persons and then only  there can be percu good percolation to the teachers there  if master trainers are not good the resource persons will not be good  and if resource persons are not good very few will be very less will be percolated to the teachers themselves  uh in that way let's have straight way from the  original resource only that is english british council  we will have master trainers from there only  so that is also one request  and these master trainers or these workshops here we'll  prepare or we intend to prepare teachers handbook or teachers guide  atleast then we'll have something to fall back  in the school they will have nothing to fall back  in big villages or big cities teachers have got  what you call that seminars workshops but in isolated  villages they hardly get any or guidance  so our teachers' handbook of particular subject  will be very handy for them  so one good teachers' handbook will definitely help them for that also we will have the assistance  i will request for them as for dr shastri i'll get an assistance  i think it is worth  i request representative of british council to extend their fullest possible cooperation to our endeavour and make this project a successful one  if uh with dis discussion   any finer points will come up uh i'll not spell out each and everything  uh they have still some scope for the discussion otherwise  laughter  what will be the use of this meeting  thank you very much  now dr shastri is here  we have regained our all hope  he is our hope he is our moral support   and he is our guide   right   right  we were really missing him for last nearly six seven months  now he is here but even then we don't worry trouble him much  sure  he must relax rest and work only when he enjoys it  you must work as long as you enjoy it otherwise you should not you should take rest   yes yes  with these words i conclude my opening talk and we'll  have one word occasion  thank you very much  uhm i   may i request mrs badlani  at first i like to thank you all very much for giving me such a warm welcome  and uh i must say that uh professionally i have been english studies officer of the british council  i have been extremely pleased with the work that the maharashtra board has been doing and uh with whatever little support we have been able to extend through what ever limited funds we have  when i compare it to this uh extremely new project in the central board of secondary education  i find that uh we have definitely not got even one tenth of the facilities and one which they have got because they have been funded by another agency the o b a  ah but nevertheless with whatever limited funds we have had at the council in bombay i have kept maharashtra board my top most priority in my budgeting claps  thank you and uh i will continue to do so  i am going to now put in a request for you know the other uh help that you have asked for which might mean uh may be more than one specialist  so far we have only been managing to get one specialist and uh for her also it has not been very easy to be working on three or four different books a centre  and now with the teaching training uh module i think we will definitely need more than one person  so uh i'll like to uh reiterate the fact that i am going to continue my support as much as i can for the board and it's very heartening to see that you know the books have actually been produced and are supposed to be out from the press in may  ah in this context could i make a request of support uh since our funding also is very strictly evaluated and monitored it would be very helpful for me if i have i am given even if it is the rough draft of the book  so that i can say okay this we have produced  this is the output of our input  and now for the further output we need this much input it will strengthen my uh case where my asking for fund is concerned  because here i can show concrete evidence  it is no good saying that the thing is taking place you know  it's in the press etcetera  so uh and why i am asking it now and not when the final printout is out because uh i'll be asking for funds in april or may  so it's at the time of asking the funds that i would like to show some concrete evidence of whatever input we have made so far  uhm i think i will not say much about uh what i want to at this stage because we it'll a lot of points will come up in the discussion  uhm but from our experience with the c b s e project  uh we have learnt a couple of lessons  and that is it is important that whenever such uh  project is on to have a committee of people with of course one convener or whatever to monitor the progress of the project so that if for any reason some one member is not able to  come the other members can continue the course and in this way i hope  that what happened in you know when professor shastri who as you were very rightly said has been the guiding light and in fact he is the one who approached us the british council  and i think the board is very fortunate in having a person of professor shastri's experience knowledge and qualification to be the convener because he is so well versed in e l t  he has had lots of experience  so he was able to pitch everything at the right level  uh ask me for what kind of suitable help i could extend  uh he i know put in a lot of effort  i think too much efforts which uh took its toll and  and i i also would now think that it is unfair that all the stress should be only on one individual so that we   that's what kadepurkar said  sir again it will be one individual  i would suggest that if we have atleast a member of a committee of three or four members  because even harsh might at some points say okay now i have my  son's exams or my something i cannot come  so i think it is better to have a committee and not then again pressurise harsh uh as much  so it will and all sudden done three or four heads together is better than one and also the stress which is on one person will not be there  so i would strongly recommend that for the project you form a committee and let that committee uh work together so that if one or two people cannot come atleast the remaining two continue the thing  because this was a big gap you know i was waiting in the council office for some information  and of course i knew about professor shastri's illness  i we did correspond over new year when he was he was much better than stuff like that  but then we lost out on quite a lot of our you know  activities here which is in much one can always catch up  there is no i mean nothing has really gone uh uh array but i think i would recommend that you formulate a committee  rather than just keep it on one or two people  for the teacher training project  for the whole project not only the teacher training project for the whole project of division of classes nine ten  eleven twelve  we have now come to uh we've finished nine and eleven we are now at the stage of uh looking for identifying texts and selection of texts for ten and twelve   looking  so uh you of course spoke only about the teachers'  awareness programme  am i to assume that you are also expecting uh rightly i hope uh some uh input into these two text books as were given for the nineth and the eleventh yes we should include  that's it i have included so that is what so it is not only teacher awareness programmes i would prefer to look at it as the whole project uh which is the textbook revision and because the syllabus was already made we couldn't change the syllabus but we have tried to put in as much communicative skills as possible within the constraints of the syllabus  and teacher training and somewhere i also read that you are looking forward to some kind of evaluation of question paper as well yes it should be part of the whole thing so in a way it is  it covers everything  so i i would not just say for the teacher training programme but for the whole project  and we depend of course on everybody's views that is just my suggestion  and for our looking at past experience i would say that uh  it will be beneficial to the project  do you think the committee to plan or to execute  uh plan mainly plan  mainly plan  the committee cannot execute  committee cannot uh really take up the whole thing they will plan for the execution naturally  the three or four people will then the work of the committee will be only the policy nature  not necessarily only  it is not necessary only depending on uh the persons own uh  inclination his own expertise his own willingness  like harsh i'm sure he as a member of the committee would still like to be actively involved in uh the teacher training programme  in the execution  so it is not either or you don't have water tight compartment it depends like professor shastri might just be there to give us overall advice because he has so much experience  he can tell us what he thinks about it  so he even he is very actively involved he might just oversee everything  so that again is very open ended   it's not either or  but for example if uh uh uh a specialist has to come and say if two people on the committee are not available for discussions atleast two other people will be available
