whatever may it goes i think people have to accept it uhm  incidently haan ho  how is the disturbance in your part about dandia   haan  no there are no such celebrations here yours is the perfectly peaceful residential area it appears because  ah  uh are there any in rajarampuri ? the they are there are in rajarampuri  accha so everything is really no no not in the area where i am staying ah  so  i think sykes extension there is a photograph in  today's sakal   accha  uh i think there are many enthusiasts there  ah but they didn't have the uh requirement of getting up early next mo morning and going for work  same thing  ah  so they can relax  today is a holiday  ah  but i think this has been going on for the past few days  that that is for all   it'll continue i think till the uh end of the festival yes from first that is the from pratipada  to navmi   haan  and dasara is the tenth day right right  so so does it go on for all the ten days ? yes  ahm uhm it start from navratra first day ahm  then you go on upto tenth dasara  is tenth   even if the  i think in yesterdays or day before uhm there was an article in the times   uhm  yes yes yes yes   what's in it  how i mean noisy and uh the spirit behind it has been lost completly and it has now become you see more or less uh a commercialized uh laughter all sorts of things can take place ahn and you know it's an excellant opportunity to see girls right right mix with girls you're right and girls  i mean from the families where you would probably not be able to pick your say nose also  you're right  right right so that is and unfortunate part of it is the community which you supposed to have this kind of skill ahn is  not uh aware of the risk that it involves right  in exposing the members of the senior members of this family  ahn   right   perhaps you see  we have been pushed into the background ahn  others have taken over it   ahn  ahn that's what it seems now   it it appears  and nahi also it got mixed up with you see western thought laughter culture kinds of you see entertainment  nahi  with their tiparies in their hand they have all those western dances   uhn  but you accepted uhn  that indeed there is no longer you see either religious or devotional like it seems to have lost its meaning altogether that is that is but then the i don't mind if it has lost meaning to those people themselves ahn  you know it's certainly disturbing to the others right right  it goes on till three two or three in the morning   and  and the the times of india report says that the decibels are hundred haan which is  which is very high pitch   haan  right  a nine tunnel truck laughter you see as we see it on our highway in front of our college ahn everyday when we engage the classes   ahn   yes yes  hardly anything can be heard you see whenever uh if the vehicles pass uhm through at the same time   uhm  that is true you know we can't help it  but fortunately in nagala park there is no such disturbance and you should be really pleased with it correct  how is akshay ? nice he is ahn  it's a holiday for him today  ah ha so he's at home   accha  he was not well for quite sometime really ? yes  what was it ? i don't know i see he hasn't got an appetite that is  that seems to be his main trouble i see  uh either he has no appetite haan  or has i mean becomes so i mean angry at times   haan  ah ha  over himself  i think he must be very playful that is one of the reason  he's of course playful ah if he is playful you know they just forget right  ah very often that they have to eat and suddenly when  they feel very uncomfortable they start crying and we were all you see   and don't realize  for a fortnight uhm  uh on a tour for south india oh i see ah ha perhaps that too is a strain you see uhm correct  so after his return uh he wasn't well for a day or two i see  but now he seems fine   fine accha uhn  incidently i hope you know  uhn  i lost my dog   achha yeah sorry   yeah  uh i mean what brought about the the end ? nothing it was just a natural death  out of old age   maybe i think   old age  you see  yes  ah  see after a particular stage ah as it happens in case of uh man  ah  yes yes of course any living thing you see  ah any living thing there are there're  the process of degeneration start  yes everything has yes come to an end  yes  yes  then how did you i mean dispose it off  uh we buried him in our uh compound   ah ha   that's what i too thought  yes  i had i had i i had invited a pe vet  ah about a month back  ah  right  and then i just sought his advice because you know i had earlier gone to dagade  ah  dagade i mean just out of curiosity i said look here if you don't mind i would like you to tell me something about this ah  and we just settled on one point that is china ah  because that is the one which can   yes yes you told me that you had been to china and there you  yes haan  so he was just kept on it  in the meanwhile i he say dr dagade adviced me   haan that i should get uh the vet   haan and seek his opinion   haan   haan  so that we will be able to diagnose what is the problem ? i see  so he came uh and he said sir i think this is just old age  ah  and i was not very much interested in torturing him at  this age   right ah  so i just went on feeding him whatever usual milk   you take   that's right  and uh a ju just allowed him to be   that's right the way he can live   that's right  sick people will be  ah nursing of it was necessary for a   the last fortnight  ah  because i had to clean him ah every  uh twice a day and then every other day i had to give him a sort of a uh uh sponge bath or something like that   ah  but uh that was only for about a fortnight and the end was damn peaceful ah  even the earlier night he was alright because the last one uh  four days i think ah all that he could have life was in his eyes   ah  ah   cough  he keep kept looking at us  so you just found him i mean dead or  uh no  it just happened ah that the earlier whole day he was a bit uncomfortable moving sides  perhaps shifting sides   ah   ah ha   perhaps  uh there were indications uh no but then that was a sense of activity also ah  then the evening which he lived and then we put him in a small kind of a cradel like thing that i have got done for him ah  and uh then twice or thrice that night i went to him  saw him ah breathing normally  ah  ah but one thing i didn't like was that he had not changed his position in which he was kept ah  and then early morning i went to him to to find out what is to be done for him and then whether he needs cleaning ah  whether he needs water   ah  ah  he was breathing  ah  then i went there and he just had a sort of a something like he uh a few words in kannada  ah   a few words in kannada  he must have just slept ah he just ha he just belched once ah ah  without anything coming out of it it was dry thing  ah ah  ah  and uh then he did it again a bit of it  just belched   haan  and then that was the end that was the end  so when i was very much in front of him ah he just slowily reduced his breathing   ah   when did it happened  ah  when did it happened ? this was on saturday morning saturday it's about almost a week  ah yes because on saturday i was on leave  ah  but have you bought another pup ? well i don't have ah we have yet to think of it we have not given any thought to that ah let us see  ah  because you need it you see  yeah we need it   of course you have been  we need it but   it is a necessity  but prof goud there is other part of it also ah  it involves certain amount of attention and other things yes that is true  ah so  but then the you see purpose why you kept  john for him so long   yes  right ah  so but i i also sometimes no feels guilty about him ah in the sense i had to keep him chained  right or keep him indoors ah and then i felt well  was i doing a right thing ?  right   ah  yes yes now once i had it him haan   i had no option  haan  right  and you could not uh change his habits  after having uh   i see  ah  let him out and i mean wander about freely  no that's no no that was not very easy but with difficulty i could have done it but then the trouble was he was kept indoors when he was strong and he could fight others ah  now at a later age when he was not so strong ah  and perhaps he could not fight with other dogs   right or tear them  right  ahn  then exposing him to lot of unknown or stray dogs right  and inviting infections for himself and for us  right  ah  was not very desirable uh  so that queston is at the moment not taken into account it is left entirely to veena and therefore i'm  not thinking about it  she must have come back yesterday or yeah she came last night  she came last night  and what about vishvas has he  vishvas has gone to hyderabad now  transfered  ah ah  with his wife  ah so he's posted there or ? no he's not he has for the first time gone for his divisional training   ahn and the divisional training is supposed to be in his own division  ahn  right right  so since hyderabad he's supposed to be his division ah south central   ah  ah  he has gone there and then he rang up ah  he just told us that he will be uh back here somewhere on thirteenth or fourteenth   one word  uh   that's his zonal head quarters  zonal head hyderabad is zonal head quarters  ah incidently ah uh in your college   uhn is there any possibility of finding a trustworthy painter  ?  ah   uhn  painters you mean  painting the house  uh yes i'll i'll try you see  no i mean i just  i'll tell you somebody ah  ah  i mean a man whom you know and who happens to be a student and he has been in the college for few ahn  ahn ha  i think even in painting ahn uh some students have done a course in the i t i  ahn  really  i remember because ah i asked them causally you see  ah ha  they come to me for admission or for one word  ah you meet every student  ah everyone who comes to me  so they tell me you see uhm what i mean  training they have had and or what job they do   uhm  uhn and all i mean sorts of skilled hands are there ahn even including masons are there laughter for actually i mean working as masons   i see really or undertraining you see  i see  because if some some of them  uhn they are children of masons  ah ha
