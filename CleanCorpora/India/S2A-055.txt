up till now  we have seen  the semi- poses  and some
other bends 
""
today  we are showing you   bharadwaja asana 
""
""
before  going into the  way of doing it  i would like
you all  to see  so that you can get  the imprint of the 
asana  
""
you can look now into the pose   music 
""
this  asana   is dedicated  to sage bharadwaja
 the father of drona  the preceptor kauravas and pandavas  who
fought  the great  mahabharata war  
""
as you look at this pose  it will tell you  that we have 
the forward movement  and the extension backwards of the spine 
""
but we do very little about the lateral movements of the spine 
""
so this is the first  primary  asana  to rotate
the lateral muscles of the spine  so that the spinal muscles  on the
side are strengthen  so that it prevents  what we call today the split
disc  cases 
""
now we go into the technique of the pose 
""
first  one has to sit in  danda asana  as you see
""
""
here  the foot should be vertically doing  tada asana
  and the legs should be doing horizontal  tada asana
 
""
so that  the whole leg from the hips are like a stick 
""
after  sitting in that pose  flex your knees  move the
feet towards the right feet  placing  the right foot over the left
foot  which gives  a grip  or a support or an anchor  for
rotating the spine to the maximum or optimum level 
""
again repeating  reach the right hand  towards the ceiling
 extend the upper form  from the right feet  and revolve the trunk
even maximum from forty-five to fifty or sixty degrees 
""
without disturbing  the left knee  and the hip  so that
the knee  and the hip run parallel to each other 
""
then along with exhalation  bring the right arm down 
""
form a cup shape  then  take the left hand back  near the
elbow  and revolve using your behind as a friction 
""
revolve your spine  from the pubic towards the right hand 
and adjust your spine from the tail bone  to the neck  so that all
the thirty-three vertebrates of the spine  get an even rotation 
""
stay there with normal breathing  lifting the lever  up 
and turn the diaphragm from the right to the left  in order to feel the
spine more 
""
when you secure that pose  bring  the left arm  behind
the right  and catch  the right arm above the elbow  and keep it
like a stick  the right arm facing the fingers against the ground
inserting into the knees 
""
then  pressurising your finger  against the upper hand
revolve the pubic  the lowest trunk  the middle trunk  and the top
trunk  and  stay  at the left shoulder to the maximum 
""
this gives you  an idea  that how the spine  moves side
ways more and more  which relieves soreness of the back lumbago  
one word  hip pain and adjust  the body in such a way  that it
lessens the pain and relieves it 
""
similarly the pose has to be done on the other side  releasing
the hand  bringing it to the front  take the right arm back  come
to  danda asana  
""
stay for a while  do normal breathe one or two  then with
an exhalation  move the feet nearer flex in  and move towards the left
hip 
""
pressurising the knee on the ground  walking the right outer
knee  and the right hip  to keep them run parallel to each other 
bring the left arm above  stretch  extend the body maximum 
revolving the trunk towards  the right arm  to the maximum 
""
without  retarding the rotation back  bring the arm down
along with the exhalation 
""
keep a   cup   cup   shape  move the right
arm back  and pressurising your foot against the other foot  turn the
lowest trunk to the maximum 
""
lock the ligaments of the knees 
""
there  they should be compressed  in order to get the
rotation 
""
revolve the spine to the maximum  and set the kidney into the
kidney  so that  the blood is sucked  by the kidney  for it to
function better 
""
i just see   it's  the simplest of all  asana
  but the effect is enormous 
""
any person who have got a slip disc  can begin this pose like
this  before they attempt any other pose 
""
here the fibre which picks the spine is taken off 
""
and it gives a tremendous relief on the  back 
""
then with an exhalation  move the left arm back  and catch
your leg  no  i'm  sorry hold it  catch your hand  behind
""
""
extend the left arm to the floor  using the finger to
pressurise grip  revolve the spin coming to shoulder the shoulder blade
the kidney the weight  even the bladder should be lifted up  and then
to be revolved 
""
this is the final pose 
""
then you come back  revolve release the finger 
""
take the left arm on the back side of the hip on the left 
remove the leg to the front  this is  danda asana  
""
when there is a back ache  people having slip disc  
it's  very very difficult to do on this floor  because they cannot
 move their bodies at all 
""
in order to make them  get the mobility  we make them to do
on a chair  which you are going to see now 
""
you take a chair  near you  insert your legs  on the path
of your chair 
""
sit firmly on the seat 
""
then  catching on one edge of the armpit  supporting the
elbow  as you see  keep the other hand behind  grip the corner of
seat  pick the support of your outer knees will contact with the leg of
the chair  and turn your spine to the maximum 
""
and  this is a real panacea  for people who have got salip
disc  or who are in the process  of getting injury to their spine 
one word  of the spine 
""
this can be done  on the other way also
""
without changing the leg  you turn  and we revolve  so
that both side  you can see this spine now better  which has tremendous
room  because when we sit on a chair  we have no compression of the
spine 
""
it gives a tremendous room  for the spine  to revolve or to
rotate 
""
hence it is called the lateral rotation of the spinal movement of
this arthrites 
""
those who have back aches  strain or    pa  
 pain   they can do this pose conveniently anywhere on the chair
""
""
your relief today  is  a permanent cure forever  provided
it is continued regularly 
""
so  keep this in mind  as the doctor says  take four
doses a day  if you do this pose  with an interval of one hour every
now and then  the soreness of the thigh pad disappears  and there is
a tremendous freedom for the movement  and  you'll  recover from
the disease  sooner than one anticipates   namaskar  god
bless you  
""
""
 today   namaskar   today  we are
showing   parshwathana asana  
 as i said before   it's  good  to have a look 
into the pose  to get a mental picture  of  parshwathana asana
 
 now you can look at them   music 
 this is   parshwathana asana parshwa  means side
  thana  means stretch 
 from there we go to  prasavika padastha asana  
 this is step pose  to  parshwathana aasana

parshwathana asana   and  prasavika padastha asana 
""

pose 
 first we have to stand in  tada asana  as you see it
""
 when we do  tada asana  remember  that the bottom
feet should be very very active the skin should be very sensitive  at the
bottom 
 you know the pointer which you see   that's  the brain of
the foot  that should be circularly  curved  in order to get a firm
grip  which help the shin  and the thymus to come in 
 then extending  evenly from the middle of the  arch  we
have to stand erect 
 then  we do  namaskar  normally  saluting to
one to the other 
  namaskar   this is how  we salute  the
soul  of the other person at the same time saluting our self 
 it has to be done in the same way  from behind 
 let the body turn 
 spread the palm take the  pa  join the palms to the back
 allow the fingers upward  and then raise the fingers to the maximum
to reach  the upper portion of the shoulder blade 
 and join the palms firmly into the wrist

 now if you look  at this lady  you see the two triangles
 evenly divided  from the side of the chest  to the lower and the
forearm  forming a right angle triangle 
 so when  a person presses the hands like that  this perfect
 double  trikon asan  as we followed 
 in order to get it  we have to press the wrist together  and
push  the forearm muscles towards the elbows  descending the upper
arm down 
 this is very good  for dropping shoulder  and drooping
shoulder blade  dislocated or displaced shoulder 
 and normally people suffer from tennis shoulder tennis elbows

 from the ankle  downward towards the ground which is a gripper 
you have to turn the  one word  muscle of the left which is above the
knee  towards the right 
 and extend this  chin further down  to rest on the shin 
shin is a lower bone of the leg 
 then linken your body from the  floor of the bladder
