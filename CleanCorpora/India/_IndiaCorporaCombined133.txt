as most of you must be aware parliament conveyance tomorrow  for its first session in the new year  it will be a very important session not only because it will be a fairly long one stretching right into the middle of may but also because because it will be the budget session  and the most crucial among all the parliament sessions  the railway budget and the annual general budget will be presented during the session  there was a time when the budgets were just mere fiscal exercises  exercises in balancing the revenue account and the capital account but those days seem far away  the present day trend is that the budgets are regarded as  very strong and major indicators of the governments political ideology and its approach to the economic problems of the country  it has almost become a fashion with us media people to predict that every session of parliament will be a stormy one  well looking uh into the issues that have been  figuring in the newspapers there is enough of the element of controversy  in them to make this coming session of parliament perhaps a really stormy one  it has been my experience that although several issues  are identified as likely to dominate uh parliament sessions  invariably it so happens that some other issues come in and take not only the parliamentarians but also the people by surprise  but this time to my mind cough the issues are fairly  clear because i expect at least uh the issue to dominate the current session of parliament will be mostly economic  in nature  to identify some of the issues and to discuss them and analyse them with me tonight around this table you will see sukharamjee  and murali bhandarijee of the congress-i on my left shrimati sushama swaraj of the bharatiya janata party and shri gurupadswamy of the  janata dal and shri somanath chatterejee of the cpm  you might have uh read in the papers that the   national front and the left front  parties have decided to boycott the address of the president to the joint session of the two houses tomorrow morning  uh before uh we really begin to discuss the issues i would like uh the representatives of the two parties with us here today to enlighten us on the logic and rationale of this very very drastic step of uh deciding to boycott the president's address somanath would you like to begin set the ball rolling  yeah  yes i want to make it clear at the beginning that our decision to boycott the session is not any not a   reflection on the president personally  we have high respect for him as a as a person  but we feel that the president's joint address  address to the joint session as uh even the constitution uh provide for is not meant to be a ritual  and the president is expected to announce the government's  policies economic policies primarily as well as other policies  but so far as this government is concerned during in the inter-session period they have taken very important decisions on matters affecting the people affecting the economic situation in this country  and all those decisions have been taken without taking the parliament into the con uh confidence  bypassing the parliamnet behind the back of the parliament therefore we said  just to go and listen to what has already taken place will be a mere formality because the parliament has been has been reduced to irrelevence and this speech all this address to joint session will serve no purpose  therefore to register our protest to the governemnt's  way of functioning and taking the parliament for the granted  ignoring the parliament in vital issues we felt that we should register our protest in a more and a very democratic manner without showing any disrespect to the president's personell murali would you agree with this point of view or would you think that the stand taken by the opposition is the little uh little well i think they are fulfilling their role eminently yes that is to oppose oppose and oppose but propose nothing  there is no logic in this at all  because firstly in the last budget which was only in the month of july the whole policy was unfolded  steps were taken to implement that policy  there have been very important lengthy discussions on all aspects whether it is the industrial policy whether it is devaluation  whether it is free market economy whether it is the entry of the multinationals whether it is the export policy  we have had extensive debates not only in the last budget session but also in the winter session  now i cannot understand their saying that all this has been implemented behind the back of the parliament  i think they are merely finding an excuse because they are today without any substantial issue in the parliament   i think they are also conscious that after the punjab election and particularly if i may take the events of the  just last four weeks the excellent manner in which  particularly the prime minister p v narsimha rao has held the whole situation  look at the unfurling of the national flag on the twenty-sixth of january ending in the fiasco of the ekta ekta yatra  the determine manner in which we repelled any crossing into kashmir on the eleventh of february  the way in in which we have bro  brought democracy back on the race in punjab  and in the process we have achieved a position where there is little threat to the survival of the government  one word  well murali you have begun already talking about the achievements of the government where as i thought first we will identify the issues that are likely to come up what sukharamjee in view of your party are the main issues  that are likely to come up ? or what do you expect the major thrust to be on ?  mere khyalme teen kism ke jo samaseyein hai ya masle  parliament mei ayenge ek to arthik economic issue aur doosre defence of country  aur teesre socio- political issues jaise jharkand hai jammu kashmir hai doosre hain magar mai aisa samajta hoon ke sab se jyade jo debate ya parliament  mei jo uhm jyada samay lagega woh economic issues ke upar hai abhi jaise aap ko malum hai sare desh ko malum hai ke jab is  government ne karyabhar sambhala to hamare  one word position kya thi mushkil se hamare pas teen hafte se kum ka hamare pas ayat ka woh foreign exchange tha  aur uh phir external hamare pas jo foreign loan ka tha ek uhm uske liye bhi hamare paas badi samaseyein thi  to is baat se bade kuch harsh step lene pade waise  sare sansar mei itne democracys hain usme hamesha  democratic government jo hai woh sakht options  opt karti hain magar is sarkar ke samne hard options  ke siway koi uh chara nahi tha is baat se ye jyada taur par  financial problem jo hain yeh dominate  karengi yeh debates  gurupadswamy do you uh share this view that uh the  government had no option but to go in for hard decisions ? and the hard decisions taken have let to a kind of a reforming of this economic structure which in the view of the opposition  has not been on right lines  see let me uh answer your first question yes  why national front and  left front have decided to boycott the president's  address  you appreciate for last twenty years at no time  so many important decisions have been taken without reference to parliament  my friend bhandarajee said many of the issues have been already discussed in parliament  discussion on difference of issues is one thing  many issues are discussed in parliament  but i am talking of issues where the government takes decisions  i do not find in the annals of parliament so many important and vital decisions have been taken without the approval of parliament gurupadswamy will you identify one or two such decisions  when you are making a distinction between a policy implementation and a decision   you'll you'll uh you'll see  you will know that uh functions the agreement that has been reached on various issues in the international monitory fund  and world bank  duncan proposals and one word intellectual property rights and so on uhm  they have not been thoroughly discussed  and approval of parliament has not been obtained  their vital issues is affecting the economy of the country itself so after a good deal of thought we came to this conclusion  and uh i just say that president's address is a very important occasion  a unique event which comes once in every year  and the president has to tell parliament tell the country  the present situation shoud also say what agenda will be taken up by government ? what are the issues on which decisions are taken by the government ? so i do not want the address be a a dreary affair a dull affair a ritualistic affair  it should be it should be a very important document  and i think that one word has been destroyed well bharatiya janata party is the major opposition in the lok sabha  and the bjp as you see has not shared the perception of the national front parties and the  left front parties  and they are not boycotting the president's  address  does this mean sushmajee that bjp is  more or less in agreement with the congress government's  economic policies ? or is it because they think it is not wise to announce a boycott ?  in hindi   accha murali do you agree with this conclusion that the rise in prices and the growing growing graph of unemployment is a logical corollary of the structural reforms that you have carried out in the party in the last one year ? and secondly that uh parliament could have given its green signal to many of these policies and then you could have walked on them  their complaint basically is that the government has unilaterally more or less gone ahead with very very vital decisions in the economic field even though you had acquainted them with the broad orientation  well i won't agree with that because i think the most important issue is the price rise  because inflation is the cruelest form of taxation on the poorest of our people  and no government can afford to impose that taxation on our people  i think my party as well as my party's government  is conscious of this fact  undoubtedly we were placed in a as it has been explain by my  colleague sukharamjee  we were placed in a position where we had to do certain thing not uh willingly in a sense that we had to take very hard options  we didn't choose soft options  all of us had predicted including the treasury benches they had predicted that the budget would result in price rise  and the inflation has to be controlled  so i do not think that something new has happened   everybody's expectations in this case unfortunately have been found to be true  therefore that is one thing i don't think whatever has been done by the government is a sequence  now taking what my friend gurupadswamy says for example on the duncal proposal we have set up a high powered committee under the chairmanship of arjun singhjee  and he had been have been having  talks with all sections  all the leaders of the opposition parties all sections of the society  and no decision has yet been taken  i think these are all the excuses one must in a democracy not anticipate that the  presidential speech will be lacklustre or without substance  it will be full of substance there will be a motion of two words and the motion of thank would be voted upon   yes  that is true that is the convention usually but murali you made uh one or two points  the first point is that uh there was a uh in the  system itself there was an inbuilt provision or compulsion for the rise in prices and therefore the rise was anticipated but you must remember this government came into being on the basis of a manifesto which had promised that prices will be rolled back to the july uh nineteen ninety level that has not happened  on the contrary the criticism of the opposition as i see it is that the country does not only have inflation but it is also beset by  two words  now somanath uhm your party uh has had uh serious objections if i remember to the very idea of approaching the  imf  and all the oppositions parties have had reservations on the kind of conditionalities which the imf uh imposed  now the claim of the finaince minister has been that the the benifits of this reforms that have been introduce will be felt in the  only in the next three years and not before  meanwhile prices are going up  what is the perception of the opposition to this situation ?  uhm  you see all our apprehensions have proved to be correct ah unfortunately in the sense that the common people are suffering because of the policies of this government  it is very easy to say that for the next three years the prices will rise there will be inflation  but what is the government going to do to come to the rescue of the people common people  we have been uh stressing on strengthening the public distribution system making um essential commodities available to the common people at a vulnerable sections of the society at a a reasonable price  but instead of doing that we have had to find during the inter-session the government has increased the administered price of the commodities namely rice wheat etcetera which are distributed through public distribution system  therefore this government has not only not made an attempt to contain the price rise is well i think fuel to the fire  why administered price increased ? now this is very easy to say there will be prise rise because of so called structure and reform  we by structure and reform i mean we find that there is a complete surrender to the imf  we have never said one word one need not or one should not go to imf  we say we should not go there on bended knees  we should not accept conditional deeds which will be destructive of our economic one word  and which will mean abandonment of our national committment to self-reliance  and precisely that has happened in this country  today you find every section of the community is feeling the pinch of not only the pinch the weight of this inflation  and not only the poorest of the poor even the middle class today are talking of this  now apart from this the very economic dir   direction of this country has been altered totally  without the parliament being taken into confidence
