back to our i s l m model that we had discontinued  last week  and uh a continuation part of it is the second set of the market and that was the monitary sector equilibrium  and when we come to this already we have seen how the real sector reaches to its equilibrium position and the result of which is the i s curve   we've drawn the i s curve also  now here we come to this l m curve  the equilibrium in the monetary sector would ultimately give diagramatically the l m curve  and why l m as we know well l is liquidity m is money now following almost the same pattern of explanation as we did in case of i s curve we can very well present this whole thing  but initially the proposition is that the monitary sector equilibrium is reached at the rate of interest at which  money supply equals money demand  a very simple kind of an identity you can take into account here  its a situation wherein money supply would be equal to  money demand  so this equality between money supply and money demand is the condition of equilibrium here  to put briefly then m s h to indicate supply of money  is equal to m d small letter of capital letter and this we say is the condition of equilibrium  and this will be our first equation  first equation very simple thing  and now you will find that the rest of this analysis when we progress would be by and large within the keyntian  framework  almost much closer to your explanation of tension liquidity preference theory of interest  much of that is adopted here  so the matters become quite simple for us  for example as we did last time left side right hand side  now what determines the money supply ? we have already given an answer to this when we discussed tension theory  what determines the money supply ? the state of reputation   it's the monetary who determines the monetary authority  so money supply is determined by the monetary authority   b b writing  and it is because of this we will not be able to get any equation so far as money supply is concerned because there is  no set formula for determining money supply at a time  that is just on the basis of the needs of the time that the monetary authority goes on contracting or expanding the money supply one side is open  and therefore now for the rest of the thing every emphasis will be placed on the demand side  now when you come to the demand side of money this demand is determined by b b writing by the tension method  three motives three motives haan   we'll put in general say by the three motives b b writing  which govern liquiditive preference  and we follow this particular line cough uh when you say after three motives we group together say in general say transactions and precautionary motives  now when you come to the transactions and precautionary motive  say broadly they will be calling it as transactions motive  both are combined together  now when you take into consideration this one this transactions motive that is liquidity preference for transaction motive  depends on  level of  level of income level of income b b writing  it depends on level of income  now in tension language this transactions demand for  money is indicated by the term m y  level of income is y  therefore if you would like to put this by way of impression  means say m-one is a function of income  m-one is a function of income  now this is second equation that you are able to get  so one part of the total money demand is taken care of  then you come to the second part of it and that is what comes now ? speculate speculative demand  now speculative demand for money b b writing this depends on ? rate of interest  correct it depends on rate of interest  and therefore you want of this speculative demand is described as m-two  the notation m-two has been used by kens and therefore we put in that m-two is a function of you can use any notation to indicate function f or k anything is a function of r that is the third impression  what we are doing here is just using the tension model of liquidity preference  and it's mostly that which hicks and henson have used  in order to give us the monetary sector equilibrium  now given this two things equations two and three now  what we know that m d that demand is equal to m-one plus m-two b b writing  this is what we know  if that is so given this therefore we can say to put this in equilibrium one or this condition of equilibrium  so we can say then that substituting b b writing  in substituting two and three in equation one  this and this we would be substituting in equation one  therefore we say money supply is equal to let us initially put m money demand just derivation every step i would like to put before you and m d is uhm one plus m-two  and we know that m-one is a function of y  so instead of m-one if you put in or substitute f y  its a function of y that is income  and n place of m-two put k r its function of rate of interest so this you're able to get ultimately that money supply is equa function of y plus a function of rate of interest  this becomes your equation number four  as we derived fourth equation in case of the real sector equilibrium  and once you come this this is the equation of l m curve b b writing  this is the equation of l m curve  so in a simple way we have derived these four equations  just see the stage by which we have progressed  we began with the fact that the equilibrium in the money market or money sector would be establishd at the rate of interest at which  money supply is equal to money demand  money supply is determined by the monetary authority at any given time  money demand is determined by liquidity preference  so you will find here the l comes here and the m comes on the other side  the right hand side of this equation is all liquidity feature the left hand side is the money feature  and therefore liquidity money they are the two dimensions which are used  in case of liquidity the transactions demand for money  m-one is determined by income level  so m-one is a function of y income  whereas the speculative demand for money m-two depends on r  rate of interest  and therefore m-two is a function of r  naturally substitute these two in one and ultimately you have come to this part  so as i said the left part denotes m money supply  the right part determines l the liquidity preference  and therefore this is an equation of liquidity and money  in graphical terms it is described as l m curve liquidity money curve  so again you find that this part is so easy to present  because it is nothing but a repetition of tension presentation by and large  what you teach in the tensus liquidity preference theory  the same part is used we've put in terms of four equations  now once we have done this basic exercise then we go to draw  the diagram  and since there are four equations by which we are putting this  we again follow the four diagraphic chart for coming to the l m curve  and therefore in this case again i'll suggest you to take a full page for the diagram  the four diagrams we will be drawing side by side  as usual we take up one two three four in an  anti-clock fashion  and the direction would be the same as we have now notice  you start from diagram one reach to diagram two then come to diagram three and from three you come downwards to diagram four  now to begin with in case of uh the first diagram  we begin with the speculative demand for money m-two  the first diagram begins with m-two  so on x-axis you measure m-two which means speculative demand for money b b writing  and then on y-axis what would come ? rate of interest rate of interest r would be there  now we would follow the same technique as we did last time taking numerical scales because the matters become very simple for our understanding b b writing  just the usual figures perhaps i've taken  now again the second stage that we follow is to have the vertical and horizontal faint lines  so that the graph sheet would be ready  and we know here the relationship between the speculative demand for money and the rate of interest  is it positive or negative ? negative  negative negative  so m-two is negative function of the rate of interest  that is what we note in this case also  if at all you can add this particular no e it is l negative function m-two is a negative function of r the rate of interest  they have a negative relationship  so naturally as usual you find if the rate of interest is suppose eight percent quite high the speculative demand can be just hundred  a quite low demand for speculative purposes  if it comes down to seven percent the speculative demand will go up to two hundred  you move to the right on x-axis as you come down on y-axis lower the rate of interest more the demand for speculative purpose  so rate of interest if it comes down to six percent you have demand three hundred  if it comes to five percent demand is four hundred  and if it comes to four percent say demand is five percent and we join these points get a curve  now this curve can be described as a curve for m-two  m- two curve and if you wish to write here the demand functions speculative demand function m-two is a function of rate of interest  so you have taken care of equation number three here that is represented well  now from there you pass on to equation number uh the diagram number two  and as you know that the usual way of drawing that whatever is presented on x-axis in diagram number one will be repeated on x-axis in diagram number two  and therefore in this diagram you will have m-two represented on x-axis  so let's first have the scale of m-two  transfered to this b b writing  and let's have the vertical lines drawn  so here you have the speculative demand or money   b b writing transfered here  now this second diagram will take care of the equality identity money supply equal to money demand  but this identity will represent not simply by saying  money supply equal to money demand but that we would be taking with the help of one which was here money demand was is equal to  m-one plus m-two  and that part we will be taking money demand equal to m-one  plus m-two  and here we assume its certain total money demand which means money supply it equals money supply  suppose here we assume that money demand which means money supply also is five hundred crores of  rupees  if we presume this then this graph what would come on the vertical part of this diagram ?  it's n  no  you have to concentrate only on that equation  if on x-axis you are able and you have taken speculative demand for money that is m-two what would come ? rate of interest rate of interest  where comes the rate of interest in this equation ?  one word  its two words   laughs  this has to be understood correctly and properly because  this can be an accidence for for any any person while drawing the diagram  other things would follow very automatically  interruptions laughs  no income business should be there no rate of interest should be there  supply of money is equal to demand for money and demand for money is broken into two parts m-one plus m-two  if one axis takes care of m-two the other axis must take care of ? m-one  m-one laughs  see how it comes i'll explain to you  but let us put this and have the diagram ready for drawing this one  say m-one which represents now you are coming to equation number two which is an equation of m-one uhm and you are bringing in m-one plus m-two both together  which make up the demand for money and which is equal to supply of money  so that identity can be represented this way  let us first go for this scale  we follow the same numbers here easy way to put in  you can use any numbers b b writing  but normally i presume in all classes that the students know number upto ten maximum one to ten  so that very easy to go with single digits if at all a class like yours is there i presume that you know numbers upto hundred  uh because calculations orally become very easy the whole thing is that what figures you take do not matter what this hundred means it can be hundred rupees  it can be hundred crore of rupees  hundred million of rupees whatever you can put into bracket  so how much amount you put in it is immaterial that  so let us have the horizontal line to get the points corresponding to x and y axis  now let us see how this comes into  we have presumed that total demand for money is five hundred  and this total demand for money is m-one plus m-two  now given this m d equal to five hundred if i give you  an amount equal to m-two i think you can do some subtraction  and find out the value of m-one  now let us go this way that given that if m-two is hundred what will be m-one ? four hundred four hundred you know subtraction very well  then sub herein comes the first point that both together will make up five hundred rupees  so m-two is hundred and therefore remaining is m-one is four hundred  the transactions demand for money
