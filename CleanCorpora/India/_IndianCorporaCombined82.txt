well the they represent not so expert little  warden and uh they're planning to one word   as a one word of  what was the main reason for that ? no particularly particular reason at all just and we feel that he is not caring about his job  hardly ever comes to the mess and all  or do the students demand something ? no no no no we we've got i think all things that we need  but so far the warden has never been quite good in his job  he hardly ever comes to the mess he's supposed to look after the food and all  he doesn't come to the mess at all  ah ha ha  just he atleast food about the   he's least bothered about anything except his  uh residence and telephone and all those things  one word  but don't you find any other way to convince him that  to show him how by some other means no we tried to convince him but unfortunately he's  beyond convincing  uhn but i think that this is the usual problem in almost all the hostels of d u uh that the authorities when they get  uhm residence didn't pay attention on hostel its  organisation this is the usual problem   uh  so in all the cases these the students feel that the authorities are doing nothing then the authorities should be one word   yeah yeah you people are justified and what i am saying uh that maybe that uh are something which uh which directly affects to the students that's why these people are very much one word  uhn  yeah   that's it uh and the thing is that the managing body and other things they are supporting  uh  how about the other one word part one word  they are okay  okay and uh they are okay means in the sense that they didn't create any problems ah ha  the warden as a matter of fact never created any problem but  he was useless laughs  as a matter of fact if we if we if we  don't have any authorities at all we're better off ah ha  i think that  ah ha  what about your r t ?  he's okay okay he is doing his post uh  yeah well whatever we tell him to do he does  was the concept of r t as the one word post no concept at all i don't know about any concept why don't you two words any authority in the hostel  especially in our hostel  yeah  or we don't just care about that authorities we do whatever we want oh  i thought you just say yes and one word sign of the  one word   i came to know that in one word  every hostel is like an institution and so that's why  they've appointed one r t uhm with other trainee   uhm  the question is may be uh that was the basic answer but our hostel i don't think has is an exception as   yeah   it's an exception  yeah  and if you say for that matter my hostel is fortunate in  fortunate enough to get uh r t uhm like you see we have ah your hostel has got a lot of problems for example  it is two words rowdy and all then the new  for whose one word he started kicking off the students without  uh one word   these problem are there   yeah yeah   problems are there problems are there what  i'm saying is that uh we've got an r t who does care about the study of the students study of the students yeah because if suppose you have got some problem in  ge getting your things done then he will come and ask   okay if you have any problem just say don't hesitate and one word   i don't know no our r t doesn't do that  our r t just comes once in a while shakes hand with all the boys then we start talking to him and he talks back we talk about all the to topic except the hostel topics  still you people are one word  yeah  and anything that's just  so yeah what do you think that just their target was to get uh get the two words   yeah  yeah yeah that's the main thing  they are not interested at all in this welfare of the students  why should a person care ? why should he throw his family means he don't care about his family rather than yeah he'll come and start looking after boys who know very little   yeah  yeah and uh what manner you people are approaching to the higher authorities ? no we've the higher authorities to just uh give the warden's notice they refused so we are planning to go on a hunger strike  yeah fast unto death  when you'll start ? it was supposed to start from today but the managing committee has asked yes that give some more time to one word   yes   but don't you think that uh its good to uh  in to inform other hostelers also means some hostel one word  of other well the other hostelers can't do anything about their own hostel so why should they do anything about our hostel  you you should just just inform that these people no that was therefore i'll tell you one thing my hostel is far far better from the other hostel  uh ah atleast jubilee there used to be a time when jubilee was like that but jubilee couldn't two words  now police enters jubilee without much you know but in our case  it's impossible for the police man to enter but i think that uh there were people in jubilee case they they attracted with the hostel itself uh one word also and one word and they two have given some  some sort of uh statement in papers regarding the students   uhn  well in favour of the students first of all there is one thing we must easily understand that whatever was happening in jubilee was wrong  that there are boys who were staying there for six seven years and they have never been enroll in any uh department  it was a matter of fact that sort of   but do you do you think that this is the fault of the students only ? this is the fault of students only because  the students themselves  no no  authorities i suppose no no no if the students uh do one thing you know  they can't do anything they will just keep quite there are two types of students one is that uh cool type  he'll just go on with the studies and doesn't bother about what yeah exactly is going around other type is that type they'll just interact with those very hoodlums   yeah  yeah just to be on the safe side yeah yeah  now this is two types the cool type will never do anything and the hoodlums just doesn't keep quite but this at that time i think it is the duty of the authorities to just have the matter straight   i've heard that jubilee people even most of the jubilee people i'll say appreciated it  yeah particularly lot of uh the many guys who were arrested in mid-terms   no because the image so see the  that's important no but it never went to that created in the paper no no no now see in our hostel that is different  because we realise of course there are a couple of students we just  mean they just seem to stay without just listen this really is one very important thing that any uni uni university especially in post-graduate courses there is no clearcut i mean time limit for session  and so you see in hostel they will say you  no no no  there is a clearcut no time limit but   then only for those people   no   how only somebody has got some problem in enrollment  this is its only for those people who don't have much say  who can't shout it's only for those rules are there but they apply only to people who are how could people were living from six or seven years and nobody went and asked that these people were   because there is sort of gadbad  that does us that's it that does us they seem to take out a knife a few words   no it is no because even authorities what  i'm saying that the authorities were were the main responsible persons you see  that they did not take care of the hostel and after that when somebody is dropped there and it is there  no some personal interest that's why they  the authorities in the beginning for example take your  this pundit was there  yeah see what he is used to do he used to interact with those very people  and if he wanted to get somebody one word  going down in a very bad way  he used to meet them and he used to manage that  so he uh  no he was a but he didn't get one word in it he doesn't want their help because i've heard that he himself claim to be a goonda or something he was a  goonda  yeah yeah that's what i'm saying no he is not afraid of those people  yeah but the pundit he because of his own act he used to do it no he he used to take the help of those he he never he never did take help  i've i've heard there was one chap in uh  jubilee who said that uh i can't do anything about uh this guy uh pundit because see he has helped me he has given the hostel to this person who didn't have any right to the hostel he gave one word  to this person because of my one word  uhn but the thing is in our case that's it if its okay in that case the authorities is itelf responsible unless authorities  one word it is not corrupt they can't do anything  no but you see and students were supported students or you see a student cannot be a very gentleman  two words  no no i'll tell you in my hostel there are about  ten boys who are sort of dadas you can say clearcut dadas  and there are other one eighty guys one seventy guys you can say who are this cool type okay this ten people will go fifty people will be watching their particular programme on t v  and uh these ten people will go and they'll do all of a sudden they'll come without saying anything they will simply turn the channel to the particular programme they are are not   then you can thus agree it was the authorities were responsible there   wait wait  what happened is they will change programme and the fifty guys they'll just keep quite   it's not the fault of those ten guys it is the fault of fifty guys who just keep quite  why do they keep quite ? yeah okay if i want to watch that programme that is not my one word i have to fight for it yeah  otherwise i can't watch it  one word   yeah  yeah no doubt  there are two things only either you join those people  or you fight those people  no there are and one thing about those people is when they realise that somebody is capable of fighting them back they will just join him they will just keep him in means they have very good term with him all the one word which is temporary you know controversial matter laughs  no no no but after all i don't think it's a controversial what do you think about your department infact uh about your study and the way they teach students here ? well fine  yes  uhm it's okay  do you think that there should be something else which should be included  no i don't think  i think  it should be no no department okay syllabus is also okay  the teachers are okay  and they give proper only thing is that uh the avenue should be large avenue should be job avenues and all facilities there is no job avenue facilities are also okay i think no no facilities to students and those who get get the degree yeah they didn't have an opportunity there don't have any opportunity yeah  almost zero   that's why no instrumnetal motivation and just adding one word   laughs  a zero  that's very good  ah don't you think that the the teachers should continue this department uh during late evening too ? that the students come no it is difference difference in the students i don't think students feel that there is any need of it  yeah i think just two words i have been here now for i think three and half years and i feel it's okay  it depends on the students if you want to carry on studies you can just go to lab and study whatsoever you like and if you feel the need of they all think that we cannot study but they if they want to  co co consult he can he can consult i don't think there is any problem so far i've never faced any problem whenever i feel somehow i've gone to any professor and he has been very glad to help me  yeah i feel so i don't know
