in today's programme we bring you a talk on the british policy towards the tribes of north east india in the nineteenth century the talker is dr anwar hussein lecturer in the department of history dibrugarh university  after the first anglo-burmese war of eighteen twenty-four  twenty-six the british established themselves in the valley of the brahmaputra expelling the burmese from the country  then they now face the new problem the problem of the hill tribes in the north east frontier  so the reason to formulate a policy which was not a static one  but it had to be geared up to beat the exigencies in the frontiers the aim and object of the policy was to control the tribal areas for the excercise of limited administrative authority  the political aspect of the policy and all states was to use the tribes on the eastern fringes as a screen between the newly acquired territories and the kingdom of burma was initiated  with a view to using the sinko's tracks as a screen  east of armies treaties were signed between sinko chiefs and the company chiefs  the mamoir tracks were also kept separate from the upper assam principality of purander sinha who was enthroned in eighteen thirty-two and allowed to rule till eighteen thirty-eight  for securing ready supply of provisions for british troops passing through the region  but exodia and jaitu contingence of british army  were deployed to observe the in what activities of the frontiers  the austro mongoloid hill tribes in north eastern india on the other hand had maintained a potential isolation for centuries the mountainous character of the territory linguistic variations inter-clan feud and inter-tribal warfare had prevented political union among the hillman  while the superstitious customs of head hunting and sorcery practised by some of the tribes engendered that  a policy of indifference on the part of the neighbouring rulers  in the plains  the hills were clotted with dense forests and bordered by patches of hollows and swamps  the physiographic conditions rendered inter-communications  almost impossible  and while the climate was extremely innovating and the people of the hill areas had to live in seclusion  so the tribes except towards the west outside the western boundary of bhutan there was no organised kingdom hence they were not capable of resisting the british arms  beginning with the bhutias of bhutan a series of engagement enter with the tribes by which they undertook to surrender their rights in these territories for a consideration of regular payment of compensation by the company's government but the government in return intended not to interfere in the internal affairs what were left alone in the hills  in primitive times the payment of compensation in the form of pasa or assignment of a part of revenue was a system interlift by ahom to reoncile the hill tribes on the frontiers of the kingdom  but british made a substantial change in the system which was existed during the ahom time  it stopped a direct collection of the dues by the tribes  themselves from the rayats because it led sometimes to quarrels  instead of it begin to pay them some cash which was known as black mail and it was collected at the same time through dues from the rayats who were exempted from payment of dues to the tribesman  this system actually cut off the direct link between the  rayat and the tribes  to begin with the attitude of the tribes towards the british government did not seem to be hostile  the kamtis and shintos accepted the british overtures of friendship and their by british was successfully the entering  into sort of ties with them  abars was also friendly till the middle of the century  the dafalas and aakals agreed to accept the money payment in lieu of their right to collect their pasa   in the due in the doers  but after the consolidation of the british rule in assam  the tribes became alive to the ensuing danger of the new system and became restless  though the kamtis revolted with the assistance of shintos  or in the pandal was suppressed by the british arms and divided the whole country areas into four tracks which was under the direct control of the government  like the shintos the abars the aakal the dafalas  created problem during the british regime  the nagas of the tira district continued to committ petty theft and loot for a quiet long time  so the guzzling feast of rich and other tribals had to do  due to their frustration and poverty in their economic and political reason  so the british government had gradually begun to substitute cash payment in lieu of articles and the money payment  which was fixed with the then market price remained fixed all through the british period  in order to solve the tribal problem the british government  introduce certain policies  for example number one to set up out-post along roads of the tribal movement to set the encroach of the tribe  number two restrictions on plains people entering into hills for which the innerline regulation was passed in eighteen seventy-three  which restricted the entrance of the plains people into the tribal hill areas  and thus minimised the contact between the hills and the plains  number three to popular popularise  the british manufactured products in the tribal hill areas  in popularising the european products all good  and promoting their sale they first had vital importance  as a result tribal products mainly raw materials  came down in the market and european good powered into the tribal territory etcetera  apart from this it is predict if we see the character of the british policy then we'll find that the hill areas in north eastern india enjoyed a distinct feature in the administrative map of british india  the system innovated tended to serve the colonial interest anxiety for the difference of imperial frontier with china and burma protection of villages in the plains from tribal rage  and exploitation of economic resources of the hill had prompted the british authorities to abandon the earlier theory of non- intervention  the traditional institution were not disturbed and the tribesman were allowed to feel that they were still governed by their hereditary chiefs  but the concept of a free man was completely lost and the chiefs were no better than government servants  the excluding regulation created a gap between the people of the hill and the plains and even in the hill areas there were several administrative blocks like excluded area and control area a series of the administrative borders were created in the region and stringent restrictions were imposed upon the outsiders in this area  tribal and non-tribal were infused as new social term  in indian social structure  the lost balance of unrestricted trade in the hill borders  and a process of social assimilation was began in the foothills  the seat is set back due to the segregrain  policy of the british  the other factor was education which was left entirely to western missionaries who were invited by the government to undertake  post le postalisation and the schools were supported under gram scheme aid system in the beginning bengali was the medium of instruction and tribal languages were written in bengali script  but subsequently english became the medium and bengali script was replaced by roman  the integration of the hill people with the rest of the country  would have been accomplished as a natural process but the colonial attitude of the british segregating regulations and creations of the administrative artificial walls create a big vacuum large number of hillman converted into christianity but those who believed traditional religion and practices the age old customs were reformed as non christians as if they had no religion  to be mentioned  there is no reason to accept the western science of civilization as in a wastage  while some traditional customs are highly scientific  and many in indian situation  so the aim of the british was to safeguard their imperial  interest and try to justify the colonial control by projecting  some wrong understanding about the indigenous system of the hill people as backward unemployed their own way of administration  in the hill areas of the north eastern region
