a few weeks ago  we didn't know about plague 
""
now  it's  here 
""
we don't know whether  it's  here to stay  or going to
vanish 
""
what i learnt  and most of us  here today learnt  that
this was eradicated in nineteen fifty-six  but it has resurfaced after
twenty-eight years 
""
  most of    most people   of my generation
today think  that  it had  just  occured way back  in 
at the end of the last century  and over twelve point five million people
had died 
""
but now it is again here
""
there is total confusion
""
 it's  spreading 
""
there is panic 
""
 we've  a panel of  eminent doctors here today to
discuss  the cause  and the cure
""
to know whether it is going to  stay or  be controlled 
""
now let me introduce the panel to you 
""
to the extreme left  is dr b chakravarty 
""
he is medical suprintendent of the safdar jung hospital here 
""
next to him  is dr ashok rattan  from the all india institute
of medical sciences  and just next to me is dr k k dutta  director of
the national institute of communicable diseases 
""
now   we'll  like to know from dr dutta  that 
this disease  we everybody thought that it has been eradicated  how it
has come back  ?
""
""
actually  plague   is   is   known to
be associated uh with uh  epidemic  not only epidemic   two word
""
""
so the plague means epidemic  plague means  one word 
""
""
it is not true that uh  we've  been able to eradicate plague
 uh though the last human case of plague   is in nineteen  
in india is nineteen   fifty-six 
""
but what  we've  told that you know after nineteen fifty-six
we  we don't have a evidence  i mean confirmed evidence of human plague
""
""
but  we've  uh the evidence of uh  rodent inflicting
disease 
""
to know that the  rats  were  a few words 
""
now one of the importance  one word  which covered safety
 in andhra pradesh tamil nadu and karnataka   a few words 
because  two words  see adjoining areas anymore 
""
another important focus is maharashtra  another  one word
 himachal pradesh 
""
you know we had focus site in in madhya pradesh  uhm uhm and
some other areas 
""
but basically   a few words  is existing  in india 
""
it continues to live in india 
""
and plague is known to come   inside 
""
and how  what is the  e   one word  period what
is there you know it could be in decade  it could be few years 
""
and nobody knows exactly 
""
and not only it resurfaced in india it has resurfaced in many other
countries also 
""
as  i'm   one word  even in nineteen ninety-two was
this organisation has reported plague  human plague from nine countries
""
""
so is it here to  stay now ?
""
  what do you   what do  the  n i c  
 say ?
""
""
 i'll  not say that it is going to stay  because the
human plague uh would be definitely brought under control 
""
and uh  once the human plague is  in district  occurred
 it was sympton that there is a need for a continous monitoring of the
situation 
""
we know that  we've  uh a plague surveillance in the
national institute of communicable disease at bangalore  which insisted
there is some  violence  i don't know if they control measure for
plague   in the    in the   adjoining cities 
""
we had another even if they uh uhm  i mean uhm i  a few words
 one unit was working in maharashtra 
""
uh but as that ceased to function after nineteen eighty-seven 
""
though uh  from the national institute of communicable disease
we can see the focal point for uh  plague uh  monitoring 
""
 we've  warned actually   we've  told them that
the that the plague control is continue to policy of the power in india 
""
it was also recomended  the last  uh inter-state
co-ordination committee meeting which was held in nineteen ninety-three
""
""
i strongly remember  sell  when it was sell that the plague
 contrareversal  contra repulsion of the  a few words  because
if you said  a few words  we do not know  what is happening in the
 in the  one word 
""
because uh we don't have any picture  uh uh what is happening uh
""
""
but did we know that uh it has  it can occur in india ?
""
""
yes  because the plague is known to occur in cycle 
""
as  we've  been
""
""
no because you see  when we first heard from date  that
was on september fourteenth
""
and four plague cases were detected in beed 
""
it was dismissed 
""
in the respective states government said it is not 
""
even n i c d said there was nothing 
""
and all of a sudden some four five days later  we heard from
surat  that people are dying there 
""
people are running away 
""
""
 that's  not true
""
 that's  not  one word  communicable disease actually
""
""
confirmed to the  the organisation of plague in beed 
""
actually the  the first uh the the reported thing of of the
clinical   one word  which occurred in  one word   that
was on twenty-sixth of august 
""
then  they've  you know the delegates of this planning of
beed district  then they approached the local medical college
""
they came  they saw even most of the doctors have not seen a
case of plague 
""
they saw the cases
""
they collected some critical material  a few words  
""
they collected uh some rat also which was sent to the haffkin
institute 
""
and and the local medical college  they declared  it's 
not a case of plague 
""
but thesis continue to to  uh to occur 
""
and not only that the rat fall also continued to occur 
""
then uh  uhm they asked our help  then they actually i got a
telephonic message from from uhm uhm from  joined director of  two
words   on second of september  that uh they want uh  one
assistant in where in understanding the problem
""
""
and that they detected as early as september 
""
""
so second september immedietly i requested them you send the
 some of sample which  you've  collected
""
they suspected four cases 
""
they collected four set of samples  and has been
""
""
uh uh how did that  one word 
""
""
so that i kept the  two words 
""
we told them that the uh it is uh you send uh 
""
we informed them that there is positive for plague on sixth 
""
and immediately they started distributing the contraband 
""
but in the beed  one word  what has happened they took very
good anti-plague measure  then uh then  one word  exchange house
to house salvage
""
so the situation was coming under control 
""
but unfortunately  there is something you know which occured you
know first confirmation it came to us  it was on twentieth of september
""
 we've  some couple of cases and i
""
""
excuse me dr dutta
""
""
yeah 
""
""
can i ask you one question
""
""
yeah 
""
""
have you has the  frequent relation with an earthquake 
because it has occured about the earthquake 
""
can you explain it    whe whe    whether 
 it has  one or two words 
""
""
actually you know when the last earthquake when this
earthquake occured in latur  our investigative team  that's  not it
was only one team
""
our team went there
""
we can held the  one word  
""
and we made   the a   a   forecast
""
that forecast in the sense that we told them  that because this
particular their case is is unknown of  one word  focal
""
there may be focal  one word  there
""
idea struck like focus was there  and now because of the
earthquake because of echo disturbence  that've  occured this  one
word  will start migrating in different directions 
""
so keep a watch on this
""
and i would  we'll  not be surprised that we gain certainly
""
but that is not there is rodant uh uh  plague and infections how
could in  few word  domestic area and human being affected
""
we made them 
""
not only we told them in our report  we also published in in the
science section 
""
""
 accha 
""
""
should i try to put it in    one word  
""
""
 yeah doctor  
""
""
see uhm  plague is a disease of the rodant 
""
and it is transmitted from rodant to  another rodant through
fleece 
""
man is not required for  it's  transmission 
""
and uh in the world you would find that fossil of plague are
present  uh in america  and they are present in u s s r  and they
are present in other country 
""
and uh  it's  also  present in india
""
so  it's  there that  man is not required for the
transmission 
""
 it's  uh a disease of the  rodant  which is carried
from one rodant to another rodant through the fleece  and  it's 
been there are some disturbances  when they fell over  it's  like
uh the milk boiling over  that the plague infects a man
""
""
 to aap ke kahne ka matlab hai ke  matlab jo khet
ka chuha hai  woh usse phailta hai   it's  not  ke
aadmi aadmi se  plague  phailta hai 
""
what is it that we talk about  bubonic  plague ?
""
""
so  that's  what   i would like to  tell
about the
""
""
  one or two words   
""
""
yeah dr rattan
""
""
so what  dr has told about is very correct 
""
it is basically  a disease of rodant 
""
man is an incidental  bit 
""
but suppose a variety of  well uh this uh  disease have all
other  one word  a plague  suppose a  bubonic  type of
plague  where the  all the plague has occured uh which is uh 
develop  one word   uh there is a fact  it has  larva 
and it has develop demand  at this time  man can  one word  into
the  one word  because by near about the drop in infection
""
becomes rather sick  so the bacteria are being stored  as a
support which it nearly get
""
it is the beginning
""
""
 matlab  matlab aapke kahne ka matlab hai ke agar
chuhe ke hi  state  se jo ke khet ka chuha hai aam chuha nahi
 agar usi ke  state  se use rok diya jaye  to 
what  we're  facing today the  bubonic  plague which is the 
worst  among the three  plagues we hear about 
""
can  can we prevent it ?
""
""
yeah
""
you see what happens is  that from uh  from the rodant 
wild rodant they travel to liven rodant 
""
rodant which are nearer to domestic 
""
so as uh dr dutta was mentioning about  one word  plate 
 one word  plate is in the wild uh  from the wild to liven rodant
which come in contact with human being  domestic rodant gets infection 
""
and from domestic rodant  we get infection 
""
once it starts it could  stop only at debonic plague 
""
that means  we would in the envinal region  there are
swelling  or in the  one word  they are swelling 
""
and uh  it stops there in ninety percent of cases 
""
in about five to ten percent of cases  it goes on to the blood
""
so it becomes ceptic in  it's   one word  
""
while only in about five percent of cases it becomes neumonic
""
it goes to the lungs 
""
then it is infectious to man 
""
then it becomes a very dangerous plague  and it is infectious
from man to man
""
""
 matlab jab chuha  khe khet wale se aam chuhe ko
hota hai
""
aam chuha jo kat ta hai ya use jo  fleece  jo safed
hote hai woh jo kat te hain nabbe pratishat  cases  mei woh
niche wale hisse mei rah jate hai
""
aur agar woh paanch pratishat uske baad agar woh chadta hai khoon
mei ajata hai aur baki jo  worst cases  hai jo 
neumonic plague  hum kahte hain jo aaj kal  dilli mei bhi hai jaise
 cases  jo do huve hain kuch  cases  main woh
 lungs  mei chala jata hai aur hum thook se  matlab
baatcheet karne mei ya usme phailta hai woh 
""
""
   a few words  i would just tell 
""
""
  a few words   
""
""
before we go into that  we'll  observe how  was the
clinical presentation of    yeah doctor  how does it produce 
that's  very important thing 
""
""
 yeah doctor  
""
""
so that will  we've  to do  one word  as he has
already told  that uh  actually  it is it is this fleece which
bites a rodant  and that in this fleece have got the  one or two word
 out what and what to do  a few words 
""
so that when  they'll  bite  they were when lies on the
 uh ground or while walking in the  leg area 
""
so it was dependent area 
""
so it is found that  cough  if fleece bite  from there
it infection grows  and the  one word  period is there
""
if there were two two  one word 
""
""
okay 
""
""
if  there're  two two  cases   so the base
uh  whenever the first thing that this fleece sort of  one word 
 and other thing  and they doesn't doesn't divide your  one word
 group
""
""
what is the is do you come to know when the fleece bites you
 ?
""
""
 it's   well  it's  not very much noticed
about it because it is  uh it goes unnoticed 
""
and uh   one word  three types of presentation  we'll
 find about it
""
the neumonic  neumonic  one word  but  generally
when the first of the rodant it comes with a fleece of band 
""
generally it comes with the neumonic type of because whenever it
it is    bi    biting    and then by  one
word  emphatic  and the the  lean  note  which is 
leaning drip  note that gives you  even by the delayed  they gone
 lean  note gone in the sense    uhm uhm  while  we've
 the   a few words  regular affected 
""
""
 uhm uhm  
""
""
any worst  one word  so this is the way  and the
patient generally feels disordered belly  hence  within very short time
within twenty-four hours  he feels pain and the gland is swollen 
enlarge  and he becomes excruciating painful about it  with all sign
 about improvision  and other signs also particularly  one word
 other things around it 
""
""
what what are the other symptons  through which a common
can come to know of it because
""
""
generally  it's  the   it's  a fever which
 one word  fever is very high rate of temperature and the patient
becomes an extremly frustrated and  one word   and often there is a
  one or two word  dead  i'm  telling of neumonic death 
 one word  becomes very tender acuted this much so  that he doesn't
want to move  to a  and this whole area about the gland is inflate red
 and there is  vegetal harmones  also  some sort of uh  a few
words
