hello i am usha  and i am rukmini  say tell whatever you want  you studied   studied have you studied for tomorrow's  paper  oh no i have to  and don't talk anything about the teachers because professor patil will be reading about it laughs  i am scared about grammar what about you  i am scared about linguistics because we have to be very specific while writing the answers we have to study the definitions and all that  and i think grammar is worst  but grammar we can apply what we have studied to something yeah but suppose we mistake in the class i will oppose we will make mistakes we will make mistakes however we try good shot  that's what i am scared of  what are you planning to do after you go to hyderabad  after going there actually i didn't want to go  they will force me to go and after going there i have to go to the two words school and attend that uh youth parliament  how many days is the two days parliament  two days   two days   two days july first and second  and you booked your uh ticket from uh hyderabad to  two words  bangalore  bangalore  so when will you be joining school  on uh fifth  fifth of july  fifth of july  and your girl daughter  my girl is there in bangalore  my husband is there mother is there   she is in bangalore  so other day all of us will leave from bangalore on fourth  uhm  fourth evening  and uh then you can't take leave na  once you join there yeah i cannot  i must say in one way i am quite happy to go back to school but then everything will start all at once  and uh we cannot   house activities and teaching tests you can't even take leave exact and once we start we cannot uh no question of stopping in  between also   no question of stop  i thought actually that i would take some days off and take a holiday but it's just not possible you know with  and uh what about your uh that official order regarding the consideration of this no i don't have any such letter as yet for the time being i am only given a letter saying these three days you know twenty-seven twenty-eight twenty-nine i'll be considered on duty  but it seems neeta has nivedita has uh letter   yeah she has got a copy yeah of her letter please pass it on because i have got one copy uh this uma wanted it  yeah  yeah i know even i'll send it is the same letter we got at hyderabad yeah hyderabad  oh then i have given a copy of that this geeta had given it to me yeah yeah got it i had given a copy of that to school  but uh they have to get clarification about that  who who has to get the school authorities  yeah actually what happened was that in my case   because that letter to me it's true  copy yeah in my case what happened know they send this to the assistant commissioner  and then a letter come from that assistant commissioner saying that  uh so many days can be treated as on duty   on duty  so you will be given earned leave accordingly   earned leave yeah   that's what uh even our principal wants to find out but i think they won't find out we'll have to go back and set out start the whole thing  so he is not uh he will not  no no i mean she is not refusing uhm  but uh she won't write to the assistant commissioner   you know i mean unless i remind her   why why   i think she's will do  she will do it unless only if i remind her  how is she  she is okay i mean laughs  no i tell you she rang me i mean know she has sent a letter  uhm  to my house and i was supposed to go on the sixteenth and it was for eleventh standard admission  oh god i tell you   uh ha  now what about the twelfth standard results  god knows i don't have any idea about school result i haven't been to school  i heard that in our shool the highest was eighty-four percent the highest rank  but uh how did you get the news  oh letter  two words  not letter before i came here no i went to our  prinicpal's place and we had got the information from somewhere else uhm  like that i came to know  because i haven't botherd to ring up school and uh  secondly there is nobody staying near my house  still i had asked savita na her son is in our school eleventh satandard  now in twelfth he he could find out from the neighbours and all  but our one word must have forgotten also  everybody so worried about the exams and studies  now today grace madam has aksed us to write that uh   go back  oh yeah oh god that in about uh the  we had suggested actually about practice teaching to  our teachers only we had suggested that that they should have you know first of all some sort of a syllabus even for that  and the two teachers who teach should preferably teach as a pair  that is you know you start off a topic i continue and complete it or something yes  instead of like one doing composition and other doing poetry and thing like that  certainly you can write that again in hour  uh what day uh told was we talked about this to julka madam   study  uhm  and then uh she was telling that uh this kind of a thing would actually limit the scope of a teacher  like if we prescribe a syllabus we will have to adhere to the syllabus and so we cannot uh  true but see they are not very happy when we do poetry  or prose yes isn't it  so why not nea completely eliminate that all together  because one side you also have to see the learners  they have come for some particular course  yeah one word  and you are sort of just throwing anything at them which you  find conveninent and then plus the tutors are going to turn around and say that of what use was this to the learner and at the same no that's what she told when uh  a question was raised like this last time  i think others uh proficiency classes by the faculty members  uhm it was started just uh two years back   it's because of this some other participant they complained about this and uh then they started one word they started this particular  method uhm  because such a one word  so they'll benefit out of the faculty teaching uhm  and notes but even that is not fair no it's like we use them for one hour as guinea pigs yeah  only for one hour they are taught by the other professors  no this way what will happen is we could try out new techniques  otherwise poetry or prose we follow the old method  say we would uh get other variety you know like  writing skills there are so many you can teach them  and you may take up speaking skills listening skills i think that area is big enough yeah no  areas which have not been touched upon till now   it's not really as for two words   yeah you could easily do it and that one month would really help them   it's not only one month it's a three week course which they have  and it will also give us the chance to try out new methods uh i am not very sure how many will go back  even means like i try out some methods but with the time problem always over there you can't always have all kinds of new methods to do cough  so may be then secondly again like we had talked abot having only one practice teaching instead of two  it seems before they had three yeah i know that and julka ma'am was telling that they were lucky because they could take the best two  best two  now here bu but when we told that here we have to take only one they should take but they are not doing that they they are not doing that they want to combine both and keep on the average and people like me who got the first chance do you know it is really difficult for us  uhn that's true  no no no then i think they could you know either start the course a little earlier and give us say three four days to get used to the idea or because though they send you material saying you must get ready for your lesson when you don't know the learners  i know how will they prepare   and not only that they have told that they will help us with the materials if we don't have any materials with us  but here after having come here i don't think uh there was  nothing was available  the library was not available   uhn library uhn library facility was not there  it's a big draw back and specially jaikar is quite a good library  so i think we should have had the chance  though how much reading we would have done is anybody   anybody's guess yeah that's what uh  again classes bit too long i feel five o'clock  is tiring  and what happens when special classes are taken in between uhm some two to three three and all one word very sad thing  you have to go quite a long way from here  yeah quite a way  uhn  uhm it's an hours journey no almost   you have one bus or you have to change the bus  two words  no i have to change because there is no direct bus and specially two words  but at what time you start from home in the morning  today i started at about eight eight quarter past eight because the exam is at ten  the exam the classes were at nine then i left home by about quarter to eight eight  okay because it will be now in the school they haven't started  and marathi medium school timings are different so it's  okay  otherwise it's a problem  like for my own shcool i leave my house at half past seven  what about your school is it near your house no not at all  the same distance my house to the university the same distance from my house to the school  another direction  completely  did you go to main street  no no i have never gone anywhere   you didn't go shopping anywhere  no  i will be going on twenty-ninth twenty-ninth evening  when when is your train  thirtieth  thirtieth evening  thirtieth evening  oh ho so you have to stay one day more  i will be staying in my cousins place uhm  so her mother is here she told she'll take me for shopping uhm and then after that next day we are going for sight seeing what about this c i e f l rama matthew's  evaluation  uhm i think they are starting that uh workshop from  july fifth  something like two words this uma's got a letter my letter stuck in i met rama matthew from here uh she had come here actually  when  uhm during the first week of her  course  uh course  uhm uhm no i didn't meet her when rajni badlani had also come  i don't know who visited that time uh she had gone to one of the classes  uhm uhm  uh  you mean  one word lady with bobbed hair yeah yeah fair very fair   that women no  and uh she drapes her saree like that yeah  she doesn't one word  exactly she's rama mathews she is rama mathew  she is not very fair  she is rama matthew i met her at hyderabad in december when we went for this uh the r p training she had come over  two words  it seems there is a letter which says that this workshop is some something one word you   no but its not compulsory only if you   want you can come   no it's not compulsory but i would like to go definitely but then   i told her i will be in hydrebad till second then she told you stay back for five more days  i told that's very difficult from seventh may i have been travelling yeah   it's really very difficult i am sorry  she told okay it's okay uh any way you have done this much  i didn't do much you know i only did two uh ob  uh observations you sent the second one  i sent both yeah both i sent  but i couldn't observe any uh old class change  uh even i one word  it isn't possible only the new nine  and our school is also not so near to any other school you know and with the main problem is that board exam is on my head  so what happens is i cannot take a half day off and go and observe in other schools  but like this year if i have to do it i will try to be a little bit more systematic  secondly more time that we came to know so this year there will be tenth standard observation also for the new tenth for the new and the new nineth she told the materials will be sent by the end of july uhm no that's okay because you get august september that time it came very late by the time i got that it was settled   i got that even got that two words  even i got in the third week because no pro point in doing that and by the time all the students had left for the study leave and all that all sorts of things yeah so i wrote a letter immediately saying that i will not be there and when i sent mine i also wrote a letter saying this problem is there and the two observation that also the first observation i did in rough thinking i wouldn't be able to manage but it was okay  so i sent it in rough with my report set up and uh second one of course i did  and you get the xerox uh done after sheet observation sheet no no no then
