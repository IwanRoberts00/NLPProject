sir in this matter  the prosecution has examined 
prosecution has examined in all  five witnesses  to prove the charge
 against the accused  who is charged under section three nought two
 that is for committing the murder of his wife 
""
the presecution case in brief is  that on eleventh of september
nineteen ninety-two  at about  four thirty  there was a quarrel
 between the present accused  and his wife 
""
the quarrel was  on the ground  that  the accused wanted
 his wife  to assist him  in the  job of his alleged job of
pick-pocketing
""
""
joint venture
""
""
joint venture 
""
and since she refused to do  do that  there was a quarrel
""
""
it has further that  she poured kerosene on herself to teach a
lesson to him  and  the accused threw  a lighted match stick on
her  set her on fire 
""
thereafter  the accused  goes away from that place  and
this  burnt lady  is taken to the hospital  by one of her
neighbours 
""
there the  entire case is on circumstantial evidence in as much
as there is no direct eye witness in this matter 
""
""
yes
""
""
the prosecution has relied upon  dying declarations 
namely  the first dying declaration made before the special executive
magistrate that is p w one 
""
""
yes
""
""
then  the second dying declaration  is in the form of
the f i r  which is recorded by the officer and obtained her signature
""
""
now since she is dead  this f i r will become  a dying
declaration 
""
and then the third  dying declaration which should be oral 
is  alleged to have been made to her mother  who had gone 
immediately to the hospital  on being informed  about the alleged
incident 
""
""
 in marathi  
""
""
the  first  dying declaration that is  which is
alleged to have been made  or have been accorded by the s c m  that is
deposed by p w one who is the s c m himself  who has stated that on
eleven nine ninety-two he recorded the dying declaration in k e m hospital at
about  na  eight p m 
""
that declaration was  made by one mrs  binaka bakat  who
is deceased in this particular matter 
""
she was in a possession to make her dying declaration 
""
he asked a questions  and she replied 
""
now if your honour takes a look at exhibit five  which is the
dying declaration which is recorded by the s c m p w one  it is in form
of question and answers 
""
written in question an answer form  and it bears  the thumb
impression of this deceased 
""
it was after it was duly read  uh recorded it was read over to
her  and then her thumb impression is  obtained 
""
now  it would be argued by my learned friend  that there is
no endorsement of the doctor on the  uh alleged dying declaration  to
which my submission would be that  p w three  and p w four 
specially p w four who is the doctor who had first treated this patient 
has said that the patient was in a condition to speak 
""
that would show that the patient was never unconscious  and
therefore  coupled with that
""
""
p w number
""
""
p w number  is four is miss  ram   who has 
treated this  patient 
""
she she has deposed  that  the patient was conscious  was
in a condition to speak 
""
then sir if your honour sees the cross examination of p w one 
that is the s c m 
""
sir a question has been asked to him that  and he has answered
 i did not obtain permission in writing from the doctor before
recording this dying declaration  
""
but then  no other questions have been asked to this s c m 
as to why he has not done it  or was it his duty to do it 
""
such questions have not been asked  or no explanation has been
sought from the s c m  regarding this fact 
""
the evidence of
""
""
the evidence of p w four
""
""
yes  yes  p w four has also stated  p w three has
also stated  and
""
""
p w number three 
""
""
the doctor who has perform the postmortem 
""
he has given his opinion that with fifty-six percent superficial
burns  the patient will be in a condition to speak 
""
""
then
""
""
and if your honour sees the evidence of p w four  fourth
line  the  pa   the deceased  binaka bakat  had fifty to
fifty-five percent burn injuries 
""
the patient was in a condition to speak 
""
p w four  in the examination in chief the fourth line 
""
then  the other most important witness to this fact would be 
p w two who is the mother of the deceased 
""
who   was   had   gone immediately to the
hospital  on receiving the information  and the deceased  has told
her told her about the incident 
""
""
then
""
""
then sir
""
""
was patient speaking to p w number two
""
""
yes  yes yes 
""
i will come to that evidence 
""
but p w one there is no suggestion to the s c m  that the
patient was unconscious 
""
there is no suggestion  or  n   no cross examination
to the effect that the patient was unconscious 
""
""
p w number one and
""
""
to p w number one  yes
""
""
she herself told uh
""
""
told her about the incident  and as to how she got burnt
""
""
so there is no suggestion to p w two also 
""
sir as far as p w number two is concerned  her evidence is to
the effect that on eleven nine ninety-two at about four thirty she was in the
house 
""
at that time the accused came to her  accused came to her 
that is p w number two who is the mother of the deceased 
""
accused came to her  told her about  that her  daughter is
burnt 
""
and then  and then at that time accused told her  that he
would bring money for medicine 
""
and then he does not come back to the hospital 
""
that is the conduct of the accused
""
""
he   told  that p w number   two 
reported about the incident and asked her to bring money    no no
 and
""
""
 he  
""
""
 two that  
""
""
 no no  
""
""
he said that he would bring money 
""
""
he would bring   money 
""
""
 money   to the hospital  for medicine
""
but he does not come back to the hospital 
""
that is the conduct of the accused 
""
""
yes
""
""
that your honour will find on  p w number two page 
your honour will find it  on the very first page  paragraph one  uh
sorry 
""
""
yes 
""
""
page  the first page of uh  p w number two 
paragraph three 
""
your honour has got on eleven nine 
""
""
p w number
""
""
two  that is   maibai 
""
""
yes para
""
""
para number three  on eleven nine ninety-two at about four
thirty p m i was in my hut 
""
at that time accused came to me and informed me that your daughter
is burnt  and he admitted her in a hospital 
""
i immediately came to k e m hospital 
""
at that time accused told me that he would bring money for medicine
""
""
he did not return to the hosptal 
""
at that time my daughter was in a position to talk 
""
now  further 
""
""
yes
""
""
the next page  i asked her  as how she sustained burn
injuries
""
she replied  accused was demanding money for uh drinking
alcohol 
""
she    req    refused   to give money
to him  
""
he started beating her  and told her to assist him in
pick-pocket business 
""
""
so that  two words 
""
""
yes  so  that will show
""
""
her position  she was in a position she had people talk
""
""
yes 
""
incident two  so  this is the second dying declaration 
""
again  again if your honour sees  she noticed the burn
injuries on her part below the chest 
""
on page number first page itself  on the first page last line
""
""
earlier page
""
your honour is seeing  paragraph  three the  earlier
 earlier page earlier page 
""
the last line i noticed burn injuries on her part below the chest
""
""
that would show that  this part is  alright
""
there is no burn injuries  and  doctor   are  
is   when i come to that evidence i will point out to your honour
that those burns were superficial 
""
they are not those deep burns  where the patient would be 
uh sort of coma or unconscious 
""
it is not the case 
""
then this witness has also given  the  her in her evidence
 as to how  this uh  her daughter was burnt 
""
she has said that  yes she poured kerosene on herself and
the accused throw  lighted match stick  
""
there is no improvement if she wanted to improve she would have
said that the accused threw the kerosene and set herself on fire 
""
this is the most natural conduct of this witness of coming before
the court and deposing the truth 
""
the truth  which has taken place  and    whi 
  which   she has heard from the  deceased 
""
""
yes 
""
""
the cross examination is nothing much to the effect  to
distort her evidence  and  there is no suggestion to her  that
 the her daughter was unconscious 
""
""
then
""
""
then sir the next witness is p w three  doctor  ramesh
     ba      bane    who
performed the post mortem 
""
""
yes 
""
""
he says that  it was a case of homicided death 
""
page  uh paragraph two the very first line 
""
due to burn injuries 
""
then  immediately the next line  i noticed following
external    in  uh  in  uh injured   injuries 
 on the dead body  superficial to deep thermal burns over  the uh
various parts  
""
""
yes
""
""
then  internal examination  fa  noticed the
following injuries 
""
cause of death was due to the complications following fifty-six
percent  superficial to deep thermal burns 
""
then the next  next page would be    i   
important   that is   i notice burn injuries over dead
body from the chest to abdomen 
""
the injuries were fifty-six percent burn injuries  nerves ends
were damaged of the dead body 
""
in the given case though the patient    sus   
sustained   fifty-six percent superficial burn injuries  she will
be in a position to talk  
""
""
yeah 
""
""
then  the cross examination 
""
even the patient sustained fifty-six percent superficial burn
injuries  she can survive except if there is no toxamia developed 
""
in this case toxamia had developed 
""
both the hands of the deceased were burnt 
""
i cannot say both palms of the patient were burnt or not 
""
that has been clarified by p w four 
""
""
in this case toxamia had developed 
""
""
yes 
""
""
yes
""
""
if no toxamia had developed  she would have survived
""
""
survived
""
""
yes  here he has stated that toxamia has developed 
""
then the next witness is p w four  doctor  maya ram 
   who was     who's    the doctor who
had first treated this  deceased 
""
""
then
""
""
she has stated as i pointed out the patient was in a
condition to speak  the fourth line 
""
""
yes
""
""
then she has  proved    cer   
certain   case papers of the indoor  papers she has fairly stated
that  certain papers should not conversant with the  writing or 
she'll  know  does not know whose writing it is 
""
that portion has been marked x 
""
but the portion which she has said or which she had accepted 
uh it is written by the registrar and there  her signature or initials are
there 
""
so this doctor  uh in the cross examination  has stated in
the last line  left upper limb had zero percent burn 
""
the last line 
""
""
where  ?
""
""
the right  uh uh the line above that the right upper limb
of the patient have five percent burn injuries 
""
sir this was asked with the purpose  that the thumb impression
which is on the f i r  the thumb impression which is on the dying
declaration  because of suggestion was put to the s c m that that is not
then the thumb impression 
""
in order to  uh support the defence story this question was
asked  which the doctor has opined that there were no burns  or zero
percent 
""
therefore the    thu    thumb  
impression is of the deceased 
""
""
it is of her mark  the s c m has obtained or the
""
""
yes yes on the dying declaration
""
""
on the dying declaration
""
""
as well as on the uh  f i r 
""
""
yes 
""
""
then we come to the evidence of p w five the 
investigating officer  who has recorded the f i r  and drawn the scene
of offence  panchanama  that is exhibit eight 
""
now sir  he has stated that he was on duty  then on
receiving the telephone message he he had left  to k e m hospital 
""
thereafter he called the s c m  that s c m recorded the uh 
dying declaration  and then he himself again recorded her statement which
he has treated as an f i r  where he has obtained  the endorsement of
the doctor that the patient was in a condition to speak 
""
that is exhibit fourteen  given by doctor  khubchandani
 
""
doctor   khubchandani's      e  
 endorsement   has been proved through doctor   ram  p w
four   who's  conversant with the uh uh handwriting of doctor 
khubchandani  
""
""
it is endorsed by 
""
""
by p w four  whose conversant with the handwriting and
signature of doctor  khubchandani   and who has stated whereabouts
of  khubchandani  is not known 
""
""
yes
""
""
then sir  on the f i r  the endorsement is after the
 uh body of the f i r is written  thereafter the endorsement is written
 to which the officer has given an explanation  and that explanation is
on page eleven 
""
the doctor was very much present while the complaint was being
recorded 
""
since the doctor was very much present while the complaint was
being recorded    thereaf    therefore    i
have not obtained the endorsement of the outside of the complaint but at the
end of the complaint 
""
there is no challenge to that effect  by my learned friend that
 this endorsement has been subsequently obtained  to that effect 
""
