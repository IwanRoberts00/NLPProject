 you'd be happy to know that you and professor shastri they are preparing a cassette of the spoken indian english   english was very old in this country from the time of the east india company  east india company which came to india in seventeenth century  they started english in the coastal areas of andhra pradesh to begin it  and then with the establishment of east india company at madras calcutta and bombay things have improved  and during seventeenth century as well as in eighteenth that is finally english was systematized and standardized by the macaulay's minute  it was introduced in the schools which was started by the east india company and english became one of the subjects of study  people have been studying english for last so many years  and uh it became a big a matter after the establishment of the three universities at the provincial cities of madras bombay and calcutta  english is studied both for its language as well as for literature  english has influenced the indians and very much it has given strength and source to them to fight against the british later on through english only indians have came to know what is a democratic system how the government works in england and the speeches of burke and many other uh leaders in the british parliament  influenced the indian leaders  and english is one of the motive factor for many people  who started writing in indian languages even bankim chandra chatterji  who wrote such a beautiful novel like uh anandmath  was influenced by english and he gave a slogan called  vande mataram  so english has become one of the important languages in india english is studied today in schools colleges  universities  english is the lingua franca  and i think through english only for the first time  india is uh made one uh otherwise it will be difficult for most of the indians to know each other  because there are so many languages in india there are nearly seven hundred languages in india there was a cultural unity but a linguistic unity was not there and uh therefore english has provided this and in this  unity of language people began to be united they used to exchange their  opinions they used to read newspapers which were coming in english and therefore the people like uh uh srinivasa iyengar who has written about the development of indian english through his book indian writing in english it is a good thing the english have done to this country  during the last two hundred years the language was  developing in different ways  english is not spoken uniformly by all the indians  as a matter of fact english is not spoken uniformly even in england  only r p is spoken only south of london  there are other dialects like uh uh scottish dialect or welsh dialect or other dialects which are not standard dialects of english  like that in india also uh the english is influenced by  indian languages  every indian who speaks english is influenced is by by his mother tongue  and there is a telugu english there is a tamilian english  there is a punjabi english there is a hindi english like that various dialects are there  for these things we had to bring out a standard a standard to understand each other and a standard which can be useful to have a  to systemize the this international language  english is essential today in the modern world because english is spoken by the largest number of people in the world  english is spoken in america english is spoken in australia  new zealand canada and many other countries  i think nearly one third of the uh people of the world they are speaking in english english is adopted by even other countries who are   do not speak english because of its uh business  purposes and transport purposes and many other purposes  therefore english is essential today to the country probably the old classic classical and uh english is spoken in the colonies as pointed by rushdie in a better way than his own mother country  so english is international nobody can say that english is not wanted today  english is required for anybody to become international in communication  they therefore english is going to live in india even  uh against the wishes of many other people  and there are people in this country who're talking that english is to be replaced by hindi and regional languages  regional languages are to be studied as well as the national language is studied and at the same time we require an international language which will uh make us a part of the world  because the world is only a global village today  india cannot survive without english or a international language like english  and uh it is important for every country  therefore english will remain with us  and english is studied even in the central institute of english and foreign languages which has come into existence in nineteen fifty-eight  this institute was established when the government of india  in the education department and by the british council as well as the ford foundation  and it was established with a specific purpose to improve  the language content of the en english    and english literature is taught by all universities in their department of english literature  but language was not studied  there is a controversy whether english language is to be learnt through literature or literature is to be learnt through  english language  both are important they are the two co uh sides of the same coin  and one can learn good english and by that he can learn good literature  or if one is a constant reader of literature one may acquire  unconsciously good english  but english has many other aspects  it has its spoken aspect  one should be conscious of the pronunciation  and if a indian goes and talks in united states of india united states of america one may not understand what he is speaking because his english contains wrong stresses  and wrong tone probably people will not understand him  therefore it is essential to standardize what we speak  and the institute of central institute of english and foreign languages makes a good effort it at it it has a language lab it has various other facilities  through which it wants to improve the standard of of english  spoken by every segment of the people of india  therefore number of people after their m a or postgraduation in english language or education or some other subject  they come to the central institute of english for studying english language  we have different courses here and uh we have e l t  methodology  we have a language laboratory and the department of spoken english and uh phonetics we have other departments also  these departments during a course of one year they give a systematic training in studying english language  and uh this is helpful for most of the teachers who come here  to learn english because when they go back they can teach better english to their students  it will have a percolative effect because these teachers who are trained they can teach better when they go back to the schools or colleges  and the students are to be taught young because their pronunciation if it is influenced by a trained teacher in english at the central institute of english he will be a better speaker and an effective speaker  communication with proper pronunciation is important to understand each other  therefore english spoken english particularly is important  at the regional level at the national level as well as international level  and english is given the importance in our education system  as a matter of fact most of the publications in india are in english uh every year we're publishing nearly eighteen thousand books in india  out of eighteen thousand nearly eight thousand to nine thousand books are in english and whereas the remaining are published in the regional languages or uh vernacular languages of india  so the publication not only in the case of books even in the case of newspaper most of the important newspapers are in english  newpapers like times of india the hindu  and uh they are very effective communication media most of  the circulation of these two papers are very large  people throughout india they read these newspapers and uh  the english is the lingua franca today in india effective connector between various states who speaks various languages  therefore english is uh unlikely to go from this country  and english will remain for a long time to come  uhm so the the english has uh uh in english is  part of the national life and uh throughout education the students in the schools and colleges they read it but mostly the english is an effective medium only from the college level after school leaving  therefore the english if it is introduced even at uh  at class three year class four that will be more effective and uh a bilingual child or a multilingual child is more intelligent  and the language can be learnt only at the in  childhood  and instead of forcing english at a later stage of life  which will be difficult and as a child will pick up a  languages easier and quicker  therefore english would be introduced at a uh the school level rather than at uh college level  and uh english is also important to get jobs and people with more education they want to go outside their country  if india like i india which has  large population if it wants to export its educated people   to other countr to other countries like singapore or saudi arabia or u s a english is essential  even in the case of the professional uh educated people like engineers or doctors if they want to go abroad they require english language  and uh without english one at one cannot go outside india and even if he goes outside he will find number of difficulties  and uh professionally also if one wants to be up-to- date  he should know and he should read english books books which are coming in english  and most of the uh knowledge which is created throughout  the world somehow or other by translation or by uh recreation it is coming into english language books which are published on large scale in england america australia hongkong and other places therefore through the english language books only you come to know what is happening outside our own country and uh they through them the research is developed  research is one of the important activity for any country  because without research it is you cannot uh develop and uh the development for the development of a country you require information latest technology latest knowledge  knowledge is a resource today  now without knowledge you cannot have anything  it can be other resources  you can have a resource of one word you can have a  coal resources you can have petroleum resources  but knowledge resource is very important knowledge is power uh even you take a small country like japan which is only as big as an andhra pradesh but it is today on the top of the world it is because of the technology which they learn through english language  and even england which is not bigger than one state of our country and england ruled the world for a long time and there was a saying that sun sun never set on the british empire  how did uh the small countries small isles like british isles could rule such a vast world ? it is because of the latest innovations that have taken place  in their country and these are essential if you have come to know about  the developments in science it has it was only possible by reading  english language books  we have come to know about newton's theory of gravity and even einstein's theory of relativity all these things helped us helped our science  and particularly in science and technology most of the books are in english and they are not in vernacular languages  the defect is the international terminology is in english  and it is a standardised terminology it is not possible to have the translations of the same terminology in our vernacular languages  the our languages have haven't developed that much
