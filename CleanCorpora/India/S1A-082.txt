""
""
anjani i have always wondered how did you enter the linguistics
 can you  tell me   something  ?
""
""
 sir    that's  the very interesting question
""
i  started my career as a teacher of english  and in post
graduated classes  i was  uh i started teaching  henry james 
and browning    ahn 
""
henry james because i was working on him then
""
and browning because no one in that year was teaching browning 
""
""
 ahn  
""
""
which year was that  ?
""
""
that was long time back sixty-eight sixty-nine
""
""
sixty-eight 
""
""
and then in under this graduate classes  uh  something
very interesting happened
""
the university introduced  courses on language 
""
""
ahn 
""
""
and there was a professor  i won't name  who was trained
in c i e f l  in the earliest c i e and then in  uh pune   
ah ahn  in linguistics 
""
""
 ah ahn  
""
""
ah ahn
""
""
but when he was asked to teach that course  he refused 
""
""
oh
""
""
he said   i'm  a teacher of literature i won't
do the job of this course  
""
and now the head of the department of english in science college
 was a student of london university  and had undergone  rigorous
training in linguistics during his days  but in his whole life he never
got  chances to teach linguistics other than  that he was teaching
only english and the english courses in classes 
""
""
uhm
""
""
i was the youngest person    he said  
okay    uhm uh  now there is an opportunity for you  this is
the syllabus  and either you teach in the class  or i teach it 
""
""
  laughs   
""
""
 uhm  
""
""
uhm 
""
""
and if you agree to teach i will teach you    uhm 
how to teach grammar
""
""
 uhm  
""
""
i see 
""
""
so i availed   those   that   opportunity
like this yeah
""
""
was it a sort of modern linguistic or it was a  
traditional grammar 
""
""
 no no it   was grammar in under graduate classes
""
""
i see    it was 
""
""
 it was  actually
""
""
traditional grammar in  one word 
""
""
you know hornby books and some other books
""
""
i know
""
""
but hornby was the main    uhm  and some books
which c i e f l has just published in linguistics 
""
""
 uhm  
""
""
so i said  okay  i'll  do it  
""
""
ahn 
""
""
and when  in off hours  he gave me  very good
background for nessasary 
""
""
ah ha 
""
""
and of  jesperson  particularly jesperson and in the
library at all college professors and all there so i got interested 
""
""
ahn ha
""
""
then  when professor verma came to  science college 
 he  i was his student his brother was my classmate so he 
persuaded me to join the central  institute of english  hyderabad 
""
and there  somehow i came in very close contact with professor
gokak
""
""
 accha 
""
""
 one word  he was the director of that  one word
 institute in sixty-five
""
""
uhn
""
""
and that also was interesting in a different way 
""
in patna university we had a book  paper on  practical views
  where we were not getting the name of the author  or the period
when   there is   something was written   
""
and we would argue   with   in   the classroom
 as to which period it could belong 
""
who possibly could be the author  just observe it for the style
of writing 
""
and professor gokak started during that class of  kind of thing
in this class there
""
""
yeah 
""
""
in hyderabad 
""
so i could do very well
""
""
uhm 
""
""
 that's  what brought me close to it 
""
but i was never very close to  oldfeild  who was teaching
grammar
""
somehow i didn't like him
""
""
uhn 
""
""
i didn't like his assistant  uh  who was an 
american   but i got along well with yadurajan and nambiar
""
""
uhn 
""
""
and my  pronounciation was very much  influenced by the
 bihari  atmosphere although  in high school i was the
product of an english medium school 
""
our teachers were mostly  but nambiar  you know  helped
me in speaking nice english  and all his lessons particularly with
reference to long stresses  we used to talk a lot 
""
anyway then i went to   south  there was one
""
the other was  masica
""
""
uhn   for the 
""
""
 we   became very friendly  for non- academic
reasons
""
we just became very friendly 
""
and then i wrote a paper that paper you know   uh  which
was written  in the train 
""
""
 uh  
""
""
i see 
""
""
you know i was  uh called very urgently i had to go from
 hyderabad to  calcutta then to patna and back 
""
and the day i was back  was the day when we were supposed to 
submit the term paper 
""
so i had no time 
""
touch  and go  i think
""
""
in the train
""
""
 one word  and in the train  and uh  he was his
best because of conditional causes exactly and all that 
""
and then i got scholarship to go to chicago  i would say 
masica was  some what influential he introduced my name there 
""
uh i was  one word  to go there and then  one word 
these people something happened  and uh  that was political 
""
""
uhm 
""
""
so i was  my name was chucked out  and then i went for
 under this chicago scholarship 
""
and there i  uh in the beginning i was very  one word 
without  one word 
""
i did not like  phonetics
""
""
uhn 
""
""
you know bansal was not there when i was there  i i didn't
like it 
""
and uh  once or twice  guide told me if you want to sit 
in  to literature  he had no objection 
""
i said  no  i'll  study phonetics 
""
so  that's  how i came in  but the main point i would say
 was  that it had been a very  boring experience  to remain a
teacher of english
""
""
yes 
""
""
and  i've  no  one word  of boring in the sense
that  you are   in  destined to teach the same author because
nobody else is ready to change his subject
""
""
you are right 
""
""
so you go on teaching the same
""
""
year after year
""
""
go on repeating the same thing year after the year 
""
whereas in this discipline  whatever i learnt in chicago this is
the best job
""
""
uhm 
""
""
but what i teach in the classroom  like what  i'm 
 i was going to teach is very difficult
""
""
is very difficult 
""
""
what what i acquired there
""
""
yeah 
""
""
so  it's  a process of  one word  and patience
which goes on time
""
what about you  ?
""
""
no when we went to chicago i  one word  interesting
 when we went to chicago those were really the hot years 
""
""
yes 
""
""
i think we were
""
""
yes
""
""
and that  debate between uh generative semanticists and
    that's  it  what chomsky was trying to say 
""
""
  that's  it  
""
""
yes
""
""
although  it all started with chomsky himself
""
i mean it all came out of   respect in a sense 
""
""
 other  that's  right    that's 
right
""
""
and  they were also m i c at that time  a few words
 college uh  a few words  uh george lakoff
""
""
 that's  right 
""
""
and uh  it now seems that the issues were not really
substantial    i mean the 
""
""
 the issues   were very substantial
""
""
i see 
""
""
the issues were very substantial in the sense that generative
semanticists  were the ones who took these  basic  thought 
assupmtions and conclusions of this standard theory  very seriously 
""
""
uh ha 
""
""
and in that process they ran into trouble 
""
you  you know one of the basic assumption was  that all the
meaning is there in the basic deep tructure
""
""
uhm 
""
""
you know  you  you remember the earlier argument as to
why  one or two words  is better than the deep structure in that 
manner  is that  it's  not part of what you hear  but one can
analyse what is here is the basic thing  that's  the deep structure
""
so if all the meaning is there in the deep structure 
""
then  you have to  think about  uh  ways  in
which  sentences  develop from deep structure 
""
""
yeah
""
""
which made the process very complex 
""
generative semanticists didn't find it 
""
they made it as complex as was necessary to  maintain this
assumption
""
""
uhm 
""
""
chomsky on the other hand  did not  do that  when he
realized that it   was   has   become very complex 
he withdrew himself 
""
""
yeah 
""
""
and he said well  one word  structures  one word
   let's  play a role as semanticists 
""
""
and he
""
""
and that was it he  uh conflict  in the hope  so
actually it was a better theory  people had then trivial views of  one
word 
""
""
you know  for including  one word 
""
""
but still he he maintains the point  to the extent that
 one word 
""
but as i was a part of this thing i can see that the issues were
really very very serious issues according to us 
""
""
but uh  certain things  disappeared with the  one
word 
""
""
it it disappeared uh  with what has suffered  two words
 not exactly the semanticists to  uh uh founder of chomsky
""
""
uhm 
""
""
uh you see if you make something very powerful
""
""
uhm 
""
""
and he becomes so powerful that you can't control it 
there is no
""
""
it is not possible i know 
""
""
no that is it 
""
then it is no longer your methodology 
""
""
uhn 
""
""
do you remember the  story of this fossil
""
""
yeah 
""
""
so the methodology with the generative semanticists developed
""
""
""
uhn 
""
""
which is so complex and so powerful  that it could explain
anything  but in a very very complex manner 
""
and  there may be point  two words  george lakeoff
withdrew things like  one word  that i wish  one word  had
constructed
""
""
yes 
""
""
and things like global   concect 
""
""
 global  
""
""
anything could be explained in terms of global concect 
""
and he also introduced what he called  you know what is
technically is called  one word 
""
""
uhm 
""
""
you know like it is uh say  uh  po  point  uh
three two seven 
""
""
uhn
""
""
percent  uh now
""
""
yes 
""
""
that type of calculation
""
""
pure mathematical conclusion 
""
""
and that turned majority of practitioners
""
""
yes
""
""
 two words  
""
it is true that uh you know the the financial crunch which you
mention the other day
""
""
uhm 
""
""
that plays a very trivial role because there were other
people who had  chicago   like  uh have always have big problems
that is including  one word  themselves
""
""
no the point is how can  two words  trying to make is
that  that cohesive group was not there 
""
and there was no   attempted   attempt  
forming of
""
""
no no there was
""
""
society like group 
""
""
no no there was a cohesive group
""
""
uhm 
""
""
i think that  uh also a kind of  a few words 
""
""
no no  it seems to me 
""
""
there was a cohesive group  though not located in chicago
throughout the year 
""
""
the other  one word 
""
""
  chicago was   chicago was   the centre
 all the participants used to spend  there  lot of their income on
 two words  
""
""
i see  okay
""
""
and free  you know free publication articles were  uh
available as soon as they were titled
""
""
yeah 
""
""
and in some cases you know like sometimes  one word 
like  writes the script time thing 
""
""
uhn
""
""
and he just get it xeroxed  two words  it could be 
one word  
""
and then there would be you know further xeroxing also 
""
so it was not that 
""
and chicago linguistic society was the centre of learning
""
""
yes that you mentioned 
""
""
yes that was the centre of
""
""
for a while
""
""
for those it was known  not there
""
""
not there at all
""
""
he doesn't know how  uh how much    one word 
 was there
""
""
  one word   
""
""
ah how much fun was there how much excitement was there 
""
you can imagine that somebody comes up with the bright idea 
and he doesn't  wait for the next day to go and meet macaulay  
 uhm  and he writes up a note for pages and  you know  just push
it inside the door    uhm 
""
and macaulay comes   and  looks at the notes and decides
this is something which  is really exciting and must be done 
""
so  it's  macaulay who might justification for that
analysis
""
 i'm  talking about electrical precomposition
""
""
 uhm  
""
""
 uhm  
""
""
 yeah  
""
""
ah ha
""
""
which was  actually if i use the term invention
""
""
uhm 
""
""
it was invented by  his students not he
""
""
uh ah 
""
""
but he gave the justification  so there was no  in in
terms of macaulays  one word  
""
""
yeah you were asking about me    you know  how
did i
""
""
 yeah  
""
""
yeah  one word 
""
""
how did i get into  because i was also like you teaching
literature  at the university  and uh  joined linguistics  not
very seriously to begin with 
""
but one thing was there that i  i did wonder about the way
literature was used in language  this is one thing   that's  
one word  
""
and then i was very deeply influenced by professor pundit 
""
he used to be the head  uh english department 
""
and we had a very distinguished uh  two words  was there
then  one word  
""
but professor pundit in particular  and i got attracted to
socio- linguistic  and i did a piece of work  uh with with professor
pundit on the teachers of hindi  trying to show how hindi was 
diverging into different directions  one would get sanskritized  one
word  
""
and then i did quite well in my m ed  and mr pundit thought
that i should be in  two words  in england 
""
and there i was quite deeply influenced by professor  one word
 as a socio-linguistic including also the work of  a few words 
 parti  particularly the work of  one word  because he was my
 one word 
""
""
 accha  
""
""
and i worked on the punjabi  immigrants there 
""
i think that was the first uh  research thesis on 
immigrants assimilation of the local language  maintenance of their own
language and culture  one of i think quiet often quoted 
""
then i came back and uh  fortunately got a job here 
teaching linguistics since  but  yeah
""
""
we can talk 
""
""
uhn 
""
""
uh well  that's  very fine i have no news since
nineteen eight years    one word   sometimes eighty or some
nine
""
""
 yeah  
""
""
eighty-seven perhaps
""
""
uhn 
""
""
little before that time  seventy-eight seventy-nine yeah
""
""
no seventy-nine    yeah  because i came back in
seventy-nine
""
""
 yeah  
""
""
yeah okay,
""
we met in hyderabad
""
""
ah yeah  that's  true  and since then  all we
have been introduced to each other 
""
""
why is it that uh  you and i  not have  problems
 differental issues 
""
""
uhm
""
""
whereas i find that most  socio-linguists    uhm
 do not get along well with their colleagues 
""
""
 uhm  
""
""
you see
""
""
i i am not talking just for personally
""
""
yeah
""
""
purely of academic level 
""
what is your view  ?
""
""
you see i think uh the problem is that uh  most
socio-linguists i know  particular in the indian context  have opted
for socio-linguistic as a soft option 
""
whereas they they don't want to understand  i don't think you
can do good socio-linguistics  without uh  sort of fully understanding
the structure of language 
""
i think you have to be  i think socio-linguist  is  is a
way of being a link  and really  it's  just a bit  one word 
""
""
so you have different perspective 
""
""
you may have a generative perspective but you may socio-
linguistic perspective
""
""
but both are trying to be linguist 
""
so i have  i have always benifitted from what chomsky had to
say or what the  one word  say or what other  theoritical linguist
have to  have to say 
""
i have never had any cult    of socio 
""
""
  that's   one word   
""
""
there is a point  that if you are doing socio- linguistic
or  one word  linguistic  you are concentrating  from the
linguistic point of view  either on phonology or morphology or syntax or
may be two of them or three of them
""
""
yeah 
""
""
and each one  has to had statistical approach  other
than the question of  socio-linguistic variables and how to analyse it and
then what kind of conclusions you want to draw 
""
ah  keeping that in mind  do you think that  there
should not be a conflict between theoritical linguistic and  you know
socio-linguist
""
""
no i don't think  i think they  that the goals are 
common except i will add one  one word   now this is my recent in
the last three or four years 
""
uh  so far  i'm  concerned it should apply equally well
with theoritical linguist and socio-linguists 
""
but i think it applies more to socio-linguist because theoritical
linguist can always find other justifications  which socio-linguist i
think will not be   justify   justifying   with that 
""
""
i think socio-linguist  has a social responsibility 
""
he cannot escape the question of language at all 
""
a pure theoritical linguist  who is dealing with it pure as
pure form  and a pure mathematical form  will say  i'm 
interested in abstract logic and mathematical development  although  he
may not  you see  but
