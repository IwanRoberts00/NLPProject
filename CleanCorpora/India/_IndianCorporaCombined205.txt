the vice-chancellor of goa university and today's  chief guest dr dubhashi pro-vice-chancellor of shivaji university dr yadav dr fernandes dr devasthali my colleagues from the shivaji university and the participants in this orientation programme  it is a pleasure to be associated with the inauguration of the twenty-second orientation programme being organized by the academic staff college of goa university  this also happens to be the second programme we are organizing in kolhapur  and i am grateful to the vice-chancellor of goa university and to his colleagues for taking all trouble of co  coming over to kolhapur every year and organizing such a programme without this attitude of yours i think it may have been difficult for many of our lady participants to take advantage of  the facility which the university grants commission is offering  at the outset i would like to welcome dr dubhashi to this campus on a formal basis  he has visited us on a couple of occasions but was   that was more of a personal visit and today we have had the pleasure of having him here to give the key note address of this orientation programme  dr dubhashi enjoys a unique position amongst the vice-chancellors of india  most vice-chancellors like myself look upon the job from inwards  we have been a part of the university system and we see  only what we have been seeing for say twenty-five thirty years  but dr dubhashi being an administrator and an administrator  par excellence has the advantage of looking at the education system from outside after taking into account what is present therein  and i am sure this these two factors being able to see from the view point of others and to able to understand your own problems will go a long way in seeing that the goa university develops at a very rapid rate  i have had the previlege of hearing him at two or three conferences  and i must say that all have been impressed with the fresh view points which he has been presenting  dr dubashi has jokingly said that we should not underestimate goa no sir we certainly do not do so  we understand goa is a place where there is an integration of two cultures where the temple of mangeshi stands next to the old cathedral of goa where the scenic beauty provides the very necessary background for the development of the cultures and where you have got research institutes of the stature of the national institute of oceanography  we know therefore that goa is an education centre goa is a place which can really provide something new in terms of knowledge something new in terms of developng the human mind  and it is therefore our beloved previlege sir to share from your staff member as well as from ours the a different view point on culture a different view point on history and a different view point on scientific achievements and the ways  education should develop  dr dubhashi had mentioned the conference of vice- chancellors of commonwealth universities at dehli which was held earlier this year  one of the main problems which was discussed at this conference was that of mediocrity vs excellence and quantity vs quality i am putting it the other way to what the westerners would put it because today in india in the education system at least we find that mediocrity and quantity has held a sway over quality and excellence  and what is absolutely essential from the point of view of the development of education in india is that excellence should be there if there is excellence with quantity i'll be very  proud of it  but at least excellence in smaller amounts would be absolutely essential before we can really give to the next generation what they deserve  and from this point of view the concept of academic staff colleges which the university grants commission has developed in recent years  was is of great importance  it is unless we train our minds unless we enlarge our own knowledge i do not think we can deliver to the students  what dr dubhashi has again mentioned that the students has an idea that what they are getting is really something which is old and outdated  many years ago i read in the readers' digest  a small anecdote which they usually publish but which has stuck to my mind  in the scenario was two young children of about five or six were playing in the school courtyard  an aeroplane went over  one child said it is a v h naming some uh number of the aircraft  the other said no no it is a v uh nine look at the angle of the wings  and then the bell rang  and then one child says to the another now let's  go back and count those silly bits laughter  so it is a fact from knowledge the young younger generation know so much more that probably we probably we  who never had that training in our uh younger days would not be able to transmit it and therefore this question of upgrading of knowledge has to be taken very very seriously  as dr fernandes has pointed out the academic staff college has  three or four major objectives  these are giving you the skill for meeting the new challenges making you aware of the linkages of education with society  making you aware of the current trends in knowledge making you aware  of the educational technology and giving you a practical aspect  to what you are going to do  and i think all of these are very important from the point  of view of a teacher  you will find that the new challenges which are being put  before before us will require absolutely new skills what i as a student learned would probably be next to useless i just cannot handle a computer  but a school ch ch child  today knows the basics of computers he can handle it and five years later unless we all can handle the skill i don't think we will be able to give anything in terms of knowledge to our students  what is most important is having an awareness of the linkage between education and society  many years ago we had the traditional system of education where  the teacher lived in his ivory tower he dealt with different aspects of his subject he gained knowledge he distributed the knowledge  but it was all very abstract  and what sidney smith said was very important the teacher  had the right to do everything  in a university system you had the right to be wrong  that was the uh expression there that even if a teacher taught something which was very abstract which was wrong it was his right and the right to be the wrong was one of the biggest previleges of a university  today the times have changed  the whole social system is financing your education and therefore you have something to pay back to uh society  and this is the university society linkage which has got to be very important  the third aspect is also of developing our knowledge  today we are in an age where you have to draw from every other subject before you can really put forward what your own subject says  and this i don't think can be done on the basis of what  uh we have learned during our bachelor's programme or in our  master's programme we have got to go to the right and left and we have got to draw from every source which we had  uh later in this afternoon i will be telling you or i'll  be talking to you regarding the science and technology policy how our science and technology has developed uh since the days of freedom and what are the problems  now one of the basic problems which i will try to tell you is that our background has not been broad enough  and it is from this point of view just like it is essential for the scientist to know his ancient heritage and his culture it is very necessary for the uh uh student of social sciences to know what the scientific development is and it is from this point of view that uh we will have to enlarge  again when we transmit our knowledge there are certain techniques and then there are certain skills and there are certain limitations  very uh jokingly i will tell you one thing that uh when i  had something to do with the educational mis uh me media research centre at poona university they were developing cassettes  and at that time one thing was said that when it's only an audio cassette one only if there is a speaker and there is nothing else to be seen the cassette should not be more than fifteen minutes or eighteen minutes because you do not hold the interest of a student for more than that period laughter  in brief a teacher uh uh a speaker should be not  should not dwelt too much on a uh special topic  dr dubhashi has drawn our attention to the fact that there is something wrong with our national spirit  we have come to a stage where we have become very much dependent upon other countries  i mean the present economic crisis uh is a very good example and he has also pointed out that the idealism which gandhiji and nehruji had the spirit with which they had fought for freedom and the spirit with which they looked at the future is quite different twenty-five years ago or a little more than that i was in the united states i was studying uh i was doing my post doctor research at that time  and i came to know some of the american professors very intimately one of them in the context of the foreign policies of india and pakistan said like pakistan why do you not co-operate with us if india co-operates the america will lay down the red carpet for your country  at that time i told him very prou proudly  we have been under slavery for a long time we do not want red carpets we want to be independent we would like to stand on our feet clapping twenty-five years later i think  we have failed we have asked them to lay down the red carpet and we are now willing to walk on that red carpet  i do not think this is the proper attitude the proper spirit at which we are looking at our problems  but i do hope that we will not only change ourselves but we will act in our manner when the young generation changes  and for that if you want the younger generation to change then  they should not look down at us they should look up at us  and if they are to look up at us then i think the basic requirement is that when we go into our classrooms we are fully equipped for the next fifty minutes' or sixty minutes' lecture  we know our subject thoroughly well wer are able to enthuse the student we are able to draw from them certain amount of information and we are able to make them to interact with us in the search for knowledge  this is the spirit behind the academic staff college  all of you have been enthusiastic enough to register for uh  this course  i am sure that during the next three weeks you will be provided with a lot of information  my only hope is that you will take this information you will imbibe whatever is given to you  you will see that mentally what has come together it is co-ordinated and a new flow of knowledge emerges  and this flow of our knowledge these new thoughts are not confined to us to our colleagues but they go down to our students  it is our duty and i think all of us here realize this  and all of us are willing to do our job   i must before i conclude i must again thank dr dubhashi for coming here i must thank uh him for allowing the academic staff college of goa university to hold its orientation programme here and i am sure that with the fare dr devasthali has put out for you the next three years would be next three weeks would be  not only very invigorating but will be a very happy  vacation or so called vacation period for you  thank you all clapping
