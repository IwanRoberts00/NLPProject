""
this is the beginning of novels  beginnings of novel in
india 
""
now before i take up this uh  subject there is query from a
colleague of ours  from bombay 
""
she has uh  she is willing to know as to where we can get
material critical material  and creative writing  on australian
literature 
""
because australian literature as you know is quite new 
""
uh from amongst uh  uh commonwealth literature  uh  lot of
work is being done in canadian literature
""
this is    main    mainly   because 
i am giving you this piece of information  uh  because there are number
of fellowships  and scholarships available  for commonwealth uh studies
""
""
and uh  not many people are aware of these 
""
now uh  literatures in commonwealth again be divided into two
parts one is white one is black 
""
in white we have three major  literatures  australian 
canadian  and new zealand 
""
uh  and in black you know most of these literatures nigerian
south african  indian pakistani  and other literatures 
""
now there won't be many fellowships in  as far as uh asian
countries are concerned or african countries are concerned  but there are
some in west indians 
""
and we also have a   one word  meeting next year  in
uh  kingston jamaica in west indies 
""
so those of you who are interested they could send their papers it
means there are three themes 
""
 i once  i remember  on which i am presenting a paper is
the theme of voyage  theme of flight 
""
uh  this you can take up study one novel or one novelist or one
writer  how she or he has projected this theme in his  uh writing in
poetry or fiction
""
for example uh  it could be a voyage in case of one anita desai
 desai  from  uhm outside world into inside world
""
then she talks of  you know inner world 
""
this is a voyage
""
so voyage can be interpreted  in several ways 
""
even this east west encounter is a voyage 
""
so you  we  don't have to be scared of the theme you can
write anything  with  voyage as the  as the basic modem 
""
this will be in west indies next year nineteen ninety-two 
""
and uhm  uh all applications have to be made to  at  one
word  london or  the professor in charge there  in jamaica in
kingston 
""
uh  apart from that  west indies  we have uh 
fellowships in canadian literature
""
i think most of you know that  at delhi we have an institute
known as the shastri  uh institute institute of indo-canadian studies 
""
and they give  large number of fellowships  uh atleast twelve
to teachers of english
""
and these fellowships they  arrange in at three levels 
""
one is the five week fellowship  one is the three four months
fellowship and one is nine months 
""
uh again  five weeks fellowship is divided into two uh part 
""
one is those who are persuing there research 
""
second thing is  uh  faculty in recent uh programme  that
is senior lecturers who are not to persue any research in canadian studies
but they would like to be acquainted with the  canadian literature or
canadian studies  and come back and teach  uh at b a and m a level or
 as guide  for m a m phil or  ph d students 
""
the so  these uhm five weeks scholarships are for students you
know students in the sense scholars who are working  who are researching
 for their m phil ph  d's   and also for those  you know
there is a different caption
""
and also for those  one is known as  uhm study programme 
another is faculty  improvement  
""
and four month is again for those  who want to study  in a
more comprehensive  uh comprehensive fashion 
""
and nine months is mainly for those  who are persuing their
research in  uh canadian literature 
""
uh  terms are very lucrative both  one word  and uh uh uh
very good uh  amount of payment fellowships  during your stay in canada
""
""
this is about canada 
""
application forms are available 
""
and uh  then third is australia
""
australia has not uh  instituted any fellowship  as yet 
but uh   they are  they have a very  uh uhm uhm  ambitious
programme  and they have set up as professor pandey said the other day 
australian  indian council 
""
uhm  this is just being set up   it'll  come into
operation next year ninety-two  early ninety-two 
""
and uh  under this programme they will be  instituting
fellowships 
""
they are going to set up a centre  uh centre for  australia
 india studies 
""
similarly indian society for commonwealth studies  of which
professor pandey is the chairman 
""
uh  our society is going to set up  an indian centre 
centre  which will be known as indo  australian centre uh  of
studies you know 
""
indo uh  sorry  uh centre for indo-australian studies 
well both the names are so similar 
""
their is australian-indian  ours is indo-australian 
""
uh where we set up  this only time will tell  uh australian
government is very helpful  and fellowships   will   are in
the offing 
""
apart from that  as far as the availability of books is
concerned  uh australian government has a very liberal norm in giving
books not to individual but to institutions 
""
and there are certain universities   cough  which have
been identified as  the universities where commonwealth literature 
research is going on
""
poona university is one of them 
""
the other universities  uh the universities i know of which 
one is delhi university   one word  university  of  anantpur
 poona university is third bombay university calcutta university bangalore
university  mysore university  chandigarh punjab university  uh
these seven eight universities  then osmania  then central university
hyderabad  these are nine ten universities i remember
""
out of the nineteen universities which have been identified as
centres  uhm  which can promote the study of  australian literature
and  commonwealth literature as a whole 
""
so if you need some books on australian literature  it is 
that through  uh get in touch with these uh  uhm universities 
""
poona university has just been given some seventy or eighty books
""
""
so from time to time  they receive books  uh from the
government  australian embassy here  and these books are dispatched to
various universities 
""
so amongst australian writers  the most popular has been 
patrick white because he is the only  writer who got nobel prize 
""
and uh  as far as patrick white is concerned  i think all
novel  most of it  most of the novels  by patrick white they are
available  in india 
""
a lot of fiction is also available 
""
but other writers which are coming up  like rodney hall  who
visited delhi university as a visiting  uhm fellow last year for about
four months 
""
uh rodney hall and   leftmary   and uh judith  one
word   lot of coach who came to india some three years ago 
""
a lot of work has been done on these writers 
""
i will be very happy if uh we take up  research on these writers
""
""
uh because i should have been saying so  british literature uh
 is any way dying  uh even american literature has become stale 
""
so  it's  time we  focus our attention on new literatures
 which are coming up 
""
so if you want uh books on    aust   
australian   literature you please get in touch with  these
institutions  these uh  bodies 
""
but by next year we are going to have lot of books 
""
penguin  uh  has got into australian now some two three
years ago 
""
and they are bringing out a series of books 
""
they are monographs and literary books 
""
recently they have brought out  no less than i think  forty
to forty-five titles on australian literature
""
i have some with me  uh specially one   which is 
which is the literary history of  australia  it's  an excellent
book
""
if you were to look at that book  if you read that book  you
get to know everything about australia  specially about women studies 
about aboriginal literature 
""
there is so much common  between india and australia 
""
and uh i am very hopeful by next year i think we are going to have
 many more books 
""
so from that we come to  the beginnings of novel in india 
""
uh  as all of us you know that  drama  lyrics  and
short stories  and other forms of literature  they have been there 
both in england  in europe in india  india since ages
""
but drama  i am sorry but novel  came into existence only
very recently
""
this is a recent phenomenon 
""
in england as all of us know  the novel  uh the origin of
novel  or flowering of novel i should say  is uh  uhm linked with
henry fielding and richardson  eighteenth century 
""
uh  we always say that it takes about hundred years for a
movement to come to india from england or from europe or from america 
""
so but in  ind  as far as india is concerned  we have the
first two novels in nineteenth century only 
""
uhm  and uh  there is the controversy which is the first
novel 
""
but we can talk of some first great novels  and one of them is
chandu  menon's   indulekha  
""
now when we talk of  a novel in india  it has a  different
uh meaning connotation than what when we see novel in england or novel in
europe or novel in america 
""
because novel in india is a classic collective expressions 
""
it comprises fiction from all regional literatures
""
we don't have what is indian literature we  we can not define
indian literature
""
indian literature means  literatures of all the regions 
""
hindi is uh  just now a national language
""
it doesn't have a identity of its own
""
so hindi could also be termed as only a regional literature
""
so hindi urdu marathi bengali punjabi  these are all literatures
and all  put together they form indian literature 
""
so this is a collective expression
""
so when we talk of indian novel  we talk of  novel in all
branches  uhm  in the country 
""
now  how did it come to flourish  ?
""
in ninteenth century  practically there was no novel 
""
and uh  uhm till uh  middle of that nineteenth century there
was no novel 
""
it is precisely and mainly because of the efforts of  christian
missionaries 
""
when they came to india  they wanted people to read bible 
and since they wanted people  to read bible  they learnt  our
languages they learnt  south indian languages
""
first of all tamil  uhm then malyalam  these languages they
learnt
""
and they translated the bible into  all living languages  of
that time 
""
this is the basic  uh  so if you want to note down the
certain points  you can just say in point number one that  uhm novel
 as a literary phenomenon  is new to india
""
now novel you put in double inverted commas 
""
novel as a  the novel as a literary phenomenon is new to india
""
""
we all know epics  lyrics  dramas short-stories fables 
they've  been they have there uh  respectable uhm industries going
back to several centuries 
""
but it is only during the second half of nineteenth century 
that  novel took its root in  in india 
""
now uh  for the novel popularly popularly uh so called we have
to wait till the second half of of nineteenth century 
""
and it is because of uh western impact on  so you can take down
second point is that   it's  because of the western impact on india
""
""
western impact on  india 
""
this is because of the western impact that there was a formal
development of prose
""
and i said  as i said  that the christian missionaries they
wanted indians to read the bible  so they read our languages and then
they translated the bible 
""
so that gave a fillip  to uh  prose writing in our country
""
and then from the prose medium  it uh brought into currency 
uh  translation and then  from a novel  the proper 
""
then third point is write down that  the term novel is a
collective expression
""
these are very important points
""
so once you know these points you can explain them 
""
novel  in india is a collective expression 
""
it comprises fiction of some length  produced in several 
regional languages of india  comprises fiction of some length produced in
several regional languages of india  like bengali  hindi  urdu 
marathi  punjabi etcetera 
""
now  as you know that it was mainly in bengal that  indian
literary renaissance  took place  in nineteenth century  with the
establishment of sir william fort college  and uh setting up of  a
printing press in sarempore by christian missionaries 
""
they  they  of course  had  motive  was  only
to popularise  christianity
""
but in the process it also gave fillip to the spread of education
 and uh specially prose uh writing 
""
now once it became popular  uh people started writing uh  uh
 prose and novels  and uh  the first attempt  which was made 
uh in south india  was that of chandu menon  when he wrote his novel
 indulekha  
""
it has been rightly held as a first  first significant novel
 in malyalam  and also of course as a matter of fact in india
""
but there is a controversy because there are so many so many
novels written during those two three decades 
""
so it is the first significant novel  in malyalam 
""
it it was written in nine eighteen hundred eighty-nine  and
published in eighteen-ninety 
""
it faced some controversy you know year this side or that side but
these are the most recognized  dates 
""
uhm  now one thing we have to keep in mind is that chandu
menon was not a professional writer 
""
he was a judge by profession
""
he was a lawyer then judge  and he can be compared for that
matter  with henry fielding who was a lawyer and then a judge  and it
was his passtime 
""
he was very fond of company over cup of tea he used to discuss
novels 
""
and uh  he was greatly    impre   
impressed   by  english novels 
""
and uhm  very often he  uh  he felt that he should write
a novel 
""
and he was thoroughly impressed by english manners  english
people english language 
""
uh he was a typical indian person who was  uh accost to english
culture and since he was in a very high position he was highly impressed by
it   cough 
""
and uhm his wife was also of the same views 
""
and very often she used to exhort him to write a novel 
""
and one of his friends  he uh suggested that  uh there is a
novel by disreily  and the name of the novel was  which henrietta some
henrietta i remember  uh he wanted  him to  uh this is henrietta
temple
""
please just write down the name of the novel 
""
this was written by benjamin disreily 
""
 henrietta's  spellings are h e n  h e n r i e  t t
a  henrietta temple 
""
this is the name of the novel by disreily 
""
and his friend asked him to translate the novel
