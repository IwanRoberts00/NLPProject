 and suddenly our treasurer had to i mean vice-chairman had to go out of bombay that too also within at a short notice he had to go  therefore i told my views to the secretary to carry on the meeting because we have to hold one or two words meeting and some urgent matters are there  these are the views you carry it out and it will be in the minutes it will be read and approved so that's what we've  done  so all of you approve the meeting minutes  yes one word  uh now  anything else uh yeah arising out of this  uh yeah  the matters arising out of uh uh the meeting  previous meeting  uh i have to inform that uh after the last meeting uh all the necessary provident fund papers uh have been uh properly signed they were prepared by the school and i have signed them about uh twenty twenty-five

payment is consent every pie has been given as for the teachers' contribution our contribution and all that that has been done  uh and h m has been reminded to uh follow up  then karate classes uh have been informed uh about the deposits and they have started functioning  now i am happy that actually dance uh for some years were being held by mrs uh darwekar mrs darwekar  darwekar  in the last two years she had become very flat and uh  in the last academic year for uh one term she didn't run at all  so she used to give us uh hundred rupees per month  for the use of hall and uh electricity  uh she was running also on only two days  but uh this uh academy is running the classes uh in number of  institution we use it only for  institution  there is nothing wrong i tell you  this is an institution nothing serious that but you see we can get funds compensation like borrow steal sometime if it is necessary steal you steal it  this is a  yeah this is the for building the institution yeah and but not to put in anybody's pocket  yeah and  uhn this now uh mr ambujaksan he runs classes in  uh large number of schools here cough  he has got trained uh teachers and he also has classes in bhandup and all that he had approached us  now committee last time in the discussion they said minimum three thousand you should try to ask  now vice- chairman was here and uh h m was here  he called him he said initial years uh i don't know what is the response  so let me start by paying you two thousand five hundred and from next year uh we will see how whether we can pay more so it is uh or we have agreed and the classes have started and uh parents uh some twenty thirty parents have already registered the classes are run on saturday and sunday without affecting uh working of the school  then uh initially we have made the enquiry  but we have not uh uh still taken action and in due course we will take action  and uh uh i would i would suggest uhm one attitude uh in fort area uhm there is one sardarji he is a good assembler and uh good service also uhm uhm  atleast last twenty years in our whole building most of us are using that assembled one uhm uhm  actually he makes the whole thing uhm for your voltas also have he has given yeah to them and voltas only puts their level endowing  so therefore you can also consult krishnan yeah  for the price and other thing one word and only thing is known devil is better than the unknown devil that's   uhm   uhm   uhm uhm   uhm uhm   uhm   yeah   yeah   yeah  no here we have got quotations for about twenty thousand known people  known uh both the both parties are known and voltas is charging uh twenty-eight thousand plus taxes and that's a lot the discussion was to find out from these uh  assembled persons whether during the service which is free one year guarantee is there  parts are also free or whether we have to pay somehow i had not been able to ask them  it is free service minus the part   include the part  that confirmation we wanted committee wanted and that i have not been able to do  uh so that is and this uh you see uh we decided to open the account uh for computer education  now little bit of background is necessary for some members office bearers are fully aware  now last year we had agreed uh according to the contract  to collect the fees ourselves and uh then uh transfer their share to the party  somehow we were not able to because bank didn't agree and the the one word collected the fees  then uh we our contribution uh actually came back to us after lot of correspondence and then uh we wrote finally a letter in may asking the party to see us along with the  cheque cheque and uh that day all the office bearers were here and h m was there he brought the cheque according to the cal   calculation it was about twenty four thousand or twenty-five thousand it is reflected in the account statement which is declared  cheque
