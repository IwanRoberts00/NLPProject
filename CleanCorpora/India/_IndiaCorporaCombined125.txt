we are here to discuss the priorities of the eighth five year plan  the other day the national development council met and approved of the directional paper  uh which is preceeding the actual meeting of the eighth plan uh there used to be approach papers before every plan and as  an economist who also had a sense of humour once quipped about the fifth plan it's not the it's not the approach to the fifth plan but the fifth approach to the same plan  emphasisng the similarity that exists in all our plans  now one wonders whether it'll be different this time and to discuss such issues we're going to talk about whether the planning concept is still relevent into these world  and if so in what way is the eighth plan going to be different from the past plans  we are going to discuss i think the main thrusts of the eighth five year plan whatever they are and whatever the priority there may be  we are going to reflect on the size and the shape and the structure of the eighth plan  and finally i suppose the financing aspect where the resources are going to come uh to meet the needs of the plan  and while doing this major issues like budget deficits uh shortage of resources uh shortage of infrastructure and also the balance of payments questions all these will come up  may i first ask uh uh dr nitish singh sen gupta who is with us  other then and he is the secretary of the planning commission uh other then dr syed hashim raza who is advisor in perspective planning in the planning commission and dr uh arvind veermani uh who is advisor in the ministry of finance  uh it so happens that all of us uh are doctors here you know and as alexander pope once quipped who shall decide when doctors disagree  however let me ask uh dr nitish sen gupta whether he feel that the planning concept is still relevent today and could we think of the eighth plan as a a matter relevent to todays time and change circumstances  well at a time when all over the world there is a general uh debunking of the concept of planning we feel that  planning is very relevent  although it is another thing that any planning has to build on  the gains reached earlier by the previous plans and also draw on the development experience of declinations following different   it's way slightly different routes  in our opinion planning is very relevent although it has to  shed off a lot of the past traditions  it has to acquire new traditions and new experience empirical knowledge so as to make it uh so as to acquire a new meaning  it is relevent  what do you think uh dr hashim raza ? uh the relevence of planning in our country is to be seen in the context of two very important and major areas uh where we need to keep on the developmental phase  one is the area of human development human resources which includes the development of taking care of the health by and large  uh taking care of the education building up training  uh along with the provision of certain uh items of minimum needs fulfilling the basic essential needs of the people in general  now this is what public sector will have to take care of  particularly in a situation where large gaps still exist  in the need for the services these items public goods and  uh the provision which already exist  another important area where i think planning will be  remain relevent in our country for quite a long time is the building up of infrastructure  this include energy it includes transport infrastructure communication uh and it also includes infrastructure like you know certain essential one word variations  uh therefore in both of these two though in the later part  uh uh the eighth plan particularly welcomes the involvement of private sector wherever possible for example in energy private sector has been invited to take part ah ha  but it's par  participation in the coming next few years will only be at the margin for private sector has to learn how to come in we've  to learn  but hasn't it learnt considerably in the last forty years  uh i would like to ask dr veermani an in-view of this new trends towards privatization  uh an in-view of the fact that uh the new policies of the government in this country too uh are talking of deregulations and decontrol and handing things over considerbly to the private sector is there still some need for economic planning ? uh yes certainly  uh and i would like to add one more area uh which has been  uh not mention by dr hashim and that is the area of micro-management in some sense uh even countries which don't have uh planning in the sense that we have used this word uh still have to plan their micro-economy  and that is the area which will remain in a sense even after all these other three uh have passed the way  then now let us come to the aspect on this and i would like to ask dr sen gupta uh in what way is the eighth five year plan different from uh the past plan ? are there any innovations that are peculiar to this plan and can we talk of it as a different entity compare to the past ? eighth plan uh prof khushroo is different from the previous plans in quite a number of ways  as i said in the beginning it tries to build on the experience gained earlier  we are starting against the backdrop of very significant growth rate of five point five percent throughout the decade of the nineteen eightees and five point six percent during the seventh plan period uhm uhm  now so this on the at the same time because of our inprovidence in the recent past   we've been subject to the need for this kind of rather  uh dramatic process of adjustment in our economy   which is which makes our task somewhat difficult now this plan will seek to ma make  ta take the maximum gain out of the investment already made  it will be a plan for consolidation  it is time we give up the uh earlier race about necessarily making a plan bigger than the pa pre previous   one in terms of allocation  it is time we give up accepting let us say five hundreds schemes when you've got resources to complete uh only about hundred schemes  it is time to uh give all attention to completing project some time so as to avoid time over run and cost over run  again it is also time to give up this earlier uh uhm you know misplace priority on a number of things you know like for instance we give a lot of attention to running industry  now government has given up uh vacated a large number of areas in industry hoping that private initiative will take over uhm  then secondly uh let us say things like literacy and population control  now sixth and seventh plan we practically gave up population control  uhm  uhm uhm  now it is now understood that if only if the all the growth that has taken place in the industry services agriculture if only we have been able to control our population growth to the rate achieved by let us say china  i think how much that el how much difference that alone would have made in part of the terms  uhm then secondly so today government will concentrate on infra-structure as prof hashim mentioned mainly transport  communication agriculture irrigation  not so much on industry now except certain basic and heavy industry whose area also has been drastically reduced  uhm uhm  then we neglected social development very much  we give up a any attempt to achieve literacy  uhm now eighth plan will concentrate on achievement of literacy and universalization of primary education by the time the plan ends  and then vocationalizing scondary education  it will not give enough of direct governmental uh attention  uhm to higher education etcetera etcetera except to the extent necessary for upgrading the requirement   uhm  and there a lot will depend on uh utilizing private initiative to supplement government efforts  so many respectable governments role will be the role of  a facilitator for desirable activities  and doing tha taking direct action only in the infra-structure and only in social human development  so it appears that uh though there are important areas which planning will address uh even now  uh there are other things which have to be done by other sectors of the economy  the private sector also would have something to do with it  uh dr hashim do you fe feel  that there are innovations in this plan other than what dr sen gupta has mention uh prof khushroo i will suppliment what dr nitish sen gupta has said  by emphasising one aspect of approach to this plan  in contrast with the earlier plan is that this plan very prominently relies on the involvement of people for achieving a number of things ah ha  which earlier was thought to be achieved just by an outlet  by financial expenditure ah ha  it is very explicitly recognized in this document that it is not the financial expenditure that can achieve everything in fact in course of time expenditure has diminishing return in terms of its effectiveness in achieving target ah and therefore involvement of people which brings you to the development of rural institutions ah the proper institutions uh a phrase which was used in the second five year plan  i think is becoming much more relevent now developing institutions adequate to the needs of the people  and that will be one of the very important i feel  this plan this plan for the first time talks of indicative planning  ah  ah ha  infact in india we had a mix  mixture of indicative planning as well as direct planing of investment and targets in certain areas of public sector  uh our achivements of indicative planing can be seen in the sector of agriculture  uhm where the production is done by millions of farmers  and yet when the sixth food grain target when we decided that we have to become self-sufficient in food-grain production  we took a number of steps indirect steps by way of creating infra-structure by way way of way of a package of policies including controlling prices and of stocking  and to which we were able to achieve agricultural target  now we will be paying a little more attention to the instrument and the methods of indicative planning and in large area widen the area of indicative planning  so this will be another  now uh i notice that we have had a series of plan in this country  every plan has had a huge budget deficit  uh there has been a shortage of resources from taxation and borrowing  and therefore borrowing from abroad and particularly borrowing from the reserve bank of india has been the order of the day that has let to all kinds of uh inflationary pressures in the economy  and the story of indian planning generally is a story of inflation it also is a story of balance of payment deficit partly for the same reason that the domestic economy has been inflated and exports were not released from the domestic economy considerably  uh dr veermani uh would you say that there are some new things that there is some new thinking or some innovations in the  in the area of budget deficit management and in the area of balance of payments management in this plan  yeah let me uh uh just give couple of examples where i think of genuine effort has been made uh to take account of the resource constraint  as the popular expression is to cut your coat to to fit the cloth  uh one uh both things have been mentioned by secretary of planning  uh one is the area of social expenditure where uh the focus is on realistic and achievable targets rather than spreading the money uh too far and wide and not achieving uh specially ta   targets like literacy population control and so on  and second is in the area of infra-structure where if one may put it a little strongly uh earlier government may have had a kind of  uh dog and the manger attitude that uh they said that everything had to be done by the government and if the gap could not be closed it was postponed indefinately sometimes for decades  uh the attitude now is that if we can not do it uh let us uh have the private sector do it so that the goals are achieved  uh so this is basically is a reflection for this attempt  uh to take account of this resource constraints  uh i would like to add one kind of word of caution in a sense  uh because there are still assumptions uh in the plan that public savings uh the adverse tre trends  which have marked the the short decade would in a sense be reversed and the public saving performance would be improved  i think that is critical uh to the plan and perhaps later on we can discuss in what ways that may be achieved  thank you very much now i would like to come to the area of the main thrust of the eighth five year plan  what are the sectors which are being regarded as the priority sectors ? what are the areas of achievements which are being uh regarded as uh thrust areas ? if you were to order priorities what would be the list of these your priorities dr sen gupta ? i will give this priorities but they would not necessarily be  in terms of one two three and four yeah now agriculture for instance the idea is to carry the  green revolution from the north of india where it has been very much uh manifest to those areas parts of the country where it has not reach reached before  and secondly to use agriculture to build up exportable surplus the plan assumes that indian agriculture has tremendous capacity and elasticity about uh to create providing a surplus which can be used to meet the requirement of other parts of the world and also to keep us a valuable balance of payments support  then population i've already elaborated on the importance but the idea is that the crude birth rate should be brought down from thirty point four per thousand till to about twenty point uh six by the end of the uh seventh five year plan and the growth rate of population will automatically come down from uh two point one percent which it is at present to about one point eight percent  we still have to go to achieve the rate which china has achieved and you can see what how china has progressed in terms of economic development  then poverty alleviation in general especially by concentrating on the rural areas and on the urban property   poverty  and then employment the plan promises to create ten million jobs a year  and hoping that uh by that by the end of the century with all the problems of all the problems of education all that we'll be able to largely solve the unemployment problem  then literacy  literacy because that is very important and we propose to uh achieve full literacy by the end of this century  by concentrative attention  then coming to infra-structure well roads have to be given importance communication has to be given importance and irrigation has to be given importance and energy  but irrigation again there is a kind of idea to switch on from  the earlier exessive concentration on big project  recovering a lo involving a long gestation uh period and a lot of resources on to medium and smaller size  irrigation projects which can be applied very sort of operative  implimentated march more quickly  so uh and then uh of course irri uh energy of course is very important because if we cannot uh have proper electricity of the one word proper mix of hydel and thermal practically all development will come to a stop  but there the problem of resources come in dr sen gupta i i did feel that bringing the the ambition and the aim of bringing the growth rate of popula no not the growth rate   the the the the fertility rate or the birth rate of population from thirty per thousand to twenty per thousand within a five year period is a is a i think a pipe dream really
