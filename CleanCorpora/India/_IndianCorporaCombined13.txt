i am malini bhattacharya  i am anita working as a language assistant in c i i l  how do you like mysore   it's okay i miss my friends in hyderabad  don't you miss your home  i stayed two years in hyderabad so i got adjusted to hostel life and didn't miss it but  here i miss my friends in hyderabad don't you have friends here  i do have but the close ones i miss i can't say i don't have friends what about you how do you like mysore  okay the climate is nice the place is nice but even the same case with me also i do miss home and do miss my friends  but otherwise how is it how is the place  quite good isn't it how do you feel okay fine did you go around mysore  not much uh you see we have such busy schedules  it's so many we get less time you have a little socialising to do and then on one word so  not much but okay  i have been to a few places and uh and the remaining few i plan to see later  how about you  uh i have been to the palace and spaces uh places like that  i went to chamundi hills  okay it was nice and i joined here much later than you so  i think it takes some time to get used to my work also yeah how do you like the work  okay isn't it quite challenging well  i do find it interesting i hope you'll also find it interesting  what about this weekend what are you planning to do  nothing as such  maybe i will go to city see how it is how life is here  how about going to ooty some day  how far is it from here  uh its as far as my knowledge goes its around one fifty kilometres  so how many hours it will take  by bus not more than six hours  it should be actually around four but since you have the mountain routes and the one word it will come around say not more than  six hours am i wrong  i have no idea actually but uh is the journey comfortable by bus  or i suppose the project people all of us could hire a vehicle and go would that uh yeah one word  would that be very nice i mean it depends on what uh all of us agree upon isn't it  yeah then you have to talk to everybody and decide about yeah and uh but before that uh for the weekend we can plan something and go somewhere no  spend some time outside atleast away from your work  uh not this week actually uh this week i am going down to the friend's  place in uh bangalore  i am planning to leave saturday morning and be and i'll  be coming back around uh say sunday evening  what about you what are you planning to do since i'll not be around  then i'll have to look for somebody else because  laugh i still don't know many people around  okay somebody else's some somebody else is there i can go to city atleast and have some good food have you ever been to ooty  i went when i was very young like a child almost so i don't remember anything clearly  i went just uh this year around june  it's a one word place  yeah i heard so  yeah and i  it's a nice place for honeymoon couples   one word  uh laughs  that is the main you're one word to go there  laughs  so how do you find the difference from hyderabad do you find any different  and you have been in calcutta also  yeah i loved calcutta better than say mysore or hyderabad that's because uh attachment to the family  not with the city  uh it's both laughs   it's attachment with the place   how do you find it there  i found calcutta very lively city yeah like which do you prefer  it's calcutta or siligudi  no i am basically from calcutta so i would like to uh stay in calcutta no but you spent most of your uh  actually when i was   you were in siligudi isn't it yeah but we were forced to stay in siligudi because my parents were working there but nobody actually liked the place much because we used to miss our home our friends uh relatives everybody because everybody was in calcutta but how many years uh you were in siligudi  i was there after my birth i spend some four five years in calcutta when i was in uh siligudi that means the entire span school life i spent there  but still you have no liking for the place i don't have really i found it a bit boring  is it  i like the place and the activities in calcutta and calcutta somehow like wherever you go in india  it's different   yeah i mean it's it's city of joy  yeah it is different  you can do something or the other and keep yourself busy busy   that's how it is  compare to that even hyderabad i don't like so much but okay in hyderabad i had the friend circle yeah so we slowly develop  so   a few words  we could make the place enjoyable well did you watch the match on t v today uh yesterday no i couldn't because i was still in the office and this is what i miss  i think i should get one pocket radio or something  laughs  but it's so disgusting everytime the team keeps losing i mean something should be done isn't it  there is something wrong over yeah   something is going wrong somewhere something is wrong with the yeah indian team i think they don't have that uh team spirit or something  yeah  team spirit that's lacking  because uh i mean and that's why they keep losing yeah initially we had problem with uh they had problem with all the captains like when kapil was the captain they had problems  very badly  they had then other who became the captain they had problems  now they can't possibly blame tendulkar because he is doing a very good job very good job  but still they're losing there must be something wrong with them like whole team  it's high time all of them got together and did something about it instead of losing each and every match and  we just look forward to those eleven to do something for that  yeah  yeah  so you are interested in cricket also yeah  what else  uh i haven't played cricket really in the formal sense in college we had a ground where sometimes we used to put on gloveses for the heck of saying we were playing cricket  in fact the right pose i mean the boy used to carry the bat also was never taught but okay we picked up on our own but i uh play tennis and uh badminton i love the game  so it just goes on  and what about uh books and music and how do you keep yourself busy in leisure time i read lots of books only english  you know both the languages you have uh edge like  uh you know telugu and bangla both yeah  so which books you prefer reading  telugu and bangla i am more comfortable in bangla frankly speaking i haven't read any book in telugu i see  so so even the telugu very famous poems are coming out now on i know never one word  you have a very famous uh feminist poet like jayprabha and all so you haven't gone through  no i haven't  i have gone through but i didn't understand  i see somehow i read some of the translated poems of jayprabha and i like them a lot yeah but its sequence are not understanding if you went through it in telugu true because my vocabulary is only the limited and the  coloquial sort of what you call how much of vocabulary can you get at home  i understand  outside it was entirely different  no i didn't really pick up the language as such but i can converse and like that   so when you write to your parents which language you write in  to my father english to my mother telugu to my grandparents telugu aunt telugu so you know the written variety of telugu also  the written varieties i write down what i speak that should not be one word  but don't you find any difference between the okay letter writing would be uh would have a different style like it won't be exactly spoken variety of a language that i have picked up to some extent with the replies i keep getting from whoever i had written   did you ever had paper on telugu  no actually two words have in m a  till your m a  so with my one word  okay i two words  so don't you find it very uhm different like you being a telugu uh using another language and more comfortable in another language which is not your mother tongue so how do you feel how do you take it uh actually uh some thing more like one word  laughs  uh i haven't thought about this actually from childhood only i was brought up in the same atmosphere like if papa still has shifted to another place i would have got the feeling of not having comfortable in a particular language but on the whole i think it doesn't matter exactly how we go about chosing or selecting a language  so you are really an indian  thank you laughs  what about today evening  okay we might go somewhere no  because if sitting here and uh i think yeah  doing nothing is very boring  yeah  you are really getting boring yeah and uh as far as when i haven't yet started my work   yeah  even i haven't because i just joined and i have to know like what exactly i am supposed to do i have got an idea but uh yeah  no but that is uh  even uh okay even after office hours like no what else  that's true and so we can go somewhere else  that's true  make the evening enjoyable  so we can go somewhere to eat how do you perhaps  like it  perhaps  uh  i am thinking about but only certain things i mean not all the time so okay i am one word to some extent we are usually blamed because people say the girl is  uh a few words   a few words  don't talk about like this laughs   it's just food and food and food  seventy-five percent of fair income is spent on food but don't you ever notice once like we had a teacher in  uh hyderabad university who used to say like uh for breakfast you should come to south and for uh lunch okay you can go anywhere but the snacks you should go to calcutta laughs  because i think she not only came there you can't get any where else no i remember novels and the chalks  see you don't get it anywhere no else beside say west bengal in general  no  yeah  and famous rasgulla of course  haan  you can't get it anywhere else  i don't think laughs there is any  person who would have not tasted it  are you crazy for sweet   i know one word  not exactly but uh calcutta sweets i think they do have a little flavour and that i haven't got anywhere in india yeah that's it  but i tend to be very crazy for sweets than chocolates so   i'm actually i actually go for good food  i don't like quantity but quality should be there yeah laughs  so whatever it is whichever country whatever preparations i don't mind but it should be tasting good yeah tasty  that's what matter   but here   do you have chinese food  yeah i enjoy it  uh a few words so lousy it was not chinese because the chinese they never put sugar in chao min  yes sugar in chao min they put tomato yeah i mean i could have made a better preparation  that's not a chinese preparation  half of the people don't know how to cook them no   don't know how to cook and you should go to a typical chinese restaurant  but why so that you have lots of these chinese restaurants in calcutta while its comparatively less less  in mysore or even in hyderabad why is it so   less   i do have a feeling that in south specially  the people uh do go for their food preparation mostly no one word  i haven't seen people uh going for other dishes no and i think another reason is the percentage of people who spent money on outside eating is comparatively less  on restaurant than in the north in general  even i suppose the punjabis and uh the gujratis also do go in for all this stuff  on restaurant   less  yeah they do
