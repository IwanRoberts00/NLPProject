ah like we were talking about the hostel  yeah  now what is the system of the hostel uh  system system is all corruption you see laughter  better we should you see we say in punjabi one word   laughs  better we should not talk about the corruption  no what i am telling is i am staying in the hostel  and it's the vacation time  yes yes  ah ha ha so there is no rule to for students who stay in the hostel there is no time study for one word  ah ha ha  since i don't have any study one word so this is all that uh yeah which we say in punjabi uhm uhm  somewhere then you might generally like uh we have heard about uh the electricity usage  uh we can use uh what uh this kind of uh apparatus  or uh we can use or not like heater  and some boys use it and uh some some are allowed and some are not allowed   appliances  depends laughs uh upon his relation with the warden yeah  yeah well like uh i think heater taking heater is not the useful now a days because uh in the bathroom they have geysers now a days  geysers are there uh one geyser for twenty boys for twenty boys   for twenty rooms  ah ha ha  and uh there are twenty boys and geyser you can initially get two three buckets  and after that water is cold   water is cold yeah so   that's the problem more than we get ready within time before nine and may be sometimes geyser is working right or sometime it's uh   nei it's no problem  ah ha  actually department is okay  ah ha  but uh you can have two three buckets after that  it's all cold water  right  that mean uh cough most of the students uh needing this kind of heater electric rod or something like that  they think their bathing is necessity not luxury  laughter what warden says ah yes  so what kind of uh uh fine they put  fine is according to the appliances  means i was using uh heater plus rod ah ha  plus two tubes plus two table lamps  ah ha and uh laughs uh one thing more stereo and t v ah and t v everything was on ah ha and i was sitting and reading magazine   ah ha  okay lucky you have social room  warden came laughter warden knocked at the door and i just opened the door uhm  he said what are you doing ? then he saw the  as a kind of fine they charged some amount of money  fined he  he fined me rupees five hundred but i paid nothing laughs  he must have a this is what i told you earlier depends upon the relation  yeah ah  uhm uhm uhm  so vehicle is not uh in the rule i mean you can have it not  scooter or motorcycle or car you can have anything   these things your personal matter it's  not a hostel matter right  i mean that like uh there is no such parking problem or some no there is a  garage problem or something no no there is  one word some boys have cars with them  one word  not uh common everybody some occasionally they get from home for month or two  some  for month or two enjoy laughs  right  and fifty percent may be having scooter or motorcycle  scooters fifty-five students have actually yeah  mostly hostel number one has cough most of the bikes two wheelers  right  since they are a goonda persons most of them laughs  students are there uh because uh when one person is living very near to his institution just fifty metres or hundred metres away from his college or department so he can go on by foot or he he has he has some other work to do yeah  not only study laughs so he faces problem yeah right  everytime you can't walk yeah  and you can't have a bus chandigarh ci city you know how it's working ah ha  you can't have bus even for one hour  yes yes  sometimes  ah sometime you have to go away to meet your teacher for some collecting notes  yeah  or to meet some friends  this is really laughs these things happen really since teacher teachers have efficient way provide everything in the department  oh yes laughter    want to try ? okay  what did you eat this in this uh noon ? noon yeah something you have rice chapati  and one sabji plus rice  rice chapati  uh what quality of kind they gave uh in uh your quality is not that much okay  yeah but for some old students that is okay since they  old students they get uh i mean uh what kind of preparation they prepare it they are well cooked and uh or not or half cooked or something in between ?  preparation  preparation is okay for it depends on see it is uh subjective  yeah depends uh if a person is older yeah  and he is bullish like that  ah ha  so he gets uh well food ah ha  but if uh  taste taste ? but it depends uh preparation is not okay for  in general  and uh i think you go sometime outside to have a  better taste and better food  food  generally  two three times a a week  two three times a week once the routine ah ha   change  just to have a different taste we go to sector eleven  lady market  eleven  or sector fifteen there is a prince restaurant ah ha  that is cheap and best for students  cheap  but might something   we can't afford that much uh expensive hotels like one word  ah ha  and so we go  right  and uh about uh dinner ? dinner is something better than the lunch  ah ha  yeah  so dinner we have a daal and sabji    daal is good  no daal always daal is okay  yeah  means you have desi ghee that you  laughs so that you know that like me that i   oh yes  and uh about the conditions are this year i am planning to be in the food committee i've talked to the warden  accha  right right  so he said okay uh he will appoint four five members uhm we are trying for cooperativeness  yes  ah so if he has the a a all of them like  chapati and daal or chawal  they are well cooked not overcooked sometime or not uh  no this is not the case case is the spices are not good qua of good  quality or the ghee is not of good quality   ah ha   so that way you can't say you can't tell it is really well cooked or it is cooked is okay sir cook he is one word   uh like chilli they use more chilli then you can't tell no this is not this is not the case  uhm uhm chilli they have they have a routine  like there is a joke you know uh when a person went to in a hostel  he was married uhm  and he was uh staying alone  so he said uh hello waiter bring me some burnt  chapatis ? bring me some burnt toast ? he said sir why ? because uh i'm you know feeling sickness of my home laughs  you know i want to have rice at laughter  so you know uh some sometimes uh a married person he want to feel free so he goes to hostel  when he want wants to uh remind his  feel uh bachelor days some kind of feel a new bachelor  i have my mamaji here  uhm uhm  not exactly my mamaji but a relation like mamaji  uhn uhn  so he used to talk to me that food bring some thing uhm uhm  sabji from your hostel laughter  two words so that i too i too want to feel that those old days even then that some kind of things that reminds you some  uh uh when you were young everything is related to laughter something else something else  no while not also not only of food but  something else   you think of something else exactly like that and all  so there in uh those enjoyments so fun   this phase is the best phase of  someone's life yeah yeah   that's what i think  ah  even i don't want to be out of this city laughter  that's why i'm staying here after my completion of post graduation   oh yes yes    you have some two or three meals uh breakfast and  lunch and dinner and  yeah three major meals    yeah what what all what do they serve ? in breakfast uh you get it's upon you  it's upon your taste  you can have parathas you can have bread  butter bread omelette  you can have bread jam  so many things like you feel they'll have in the hostel  or in home  so it's your taste  and you can have tea cold drink milk anything  what you can think of in the in a breakfast  what else ? and uh breakfast you know there that's the place where cooking is not okay  since in the morning there is a great rush  everyone has to go to their department before nine  great rush yeah  yes  so most of the students get ready by eight thirty  and everyone rushes in the mess and canteen eight thirty and they ask for quick supply   eight thirty   that's what has some times we noticed that a  a little more time can be can make it more better that uh  food but this is not possible means uh   right yeah   that's why i was talking how they cook i mean they  overcook see or less cooked  see  afternoon and uh uhm dinner and lunch is okay since they have plenty of time  they are back from their department but in the morning they have to go to the department  ah ha  yes yes  and if they get late they may they may miss  their class  and that  then they do not bother about the taste they have just eat it and rush like that   they don't bother about anything  laughter  this is uh punjab  they have to go those are points where the problem arises yeah  they ask for quality plus quick supply plus quick supply yes yes  uhm even the cook has to his matlab  it depends ke us ke pas uh that material is there  he has to make something raw material and then cook it  it takes sometimes   so  now you have uh completed your m a second year yeah  so what's your planning now ? what you have planned ? i am just two words was there four five old  laughs  i have four five years uh one word  ah ha  but i am unfortunately couldn't decide till now  ah ha  and i i am planning for a teaching profession  i have been offered a job as ad hoc professor of english  in my college where i've studied i have done my graduation ah ha it's very good i am also planning for m phil or ph d  since i have discussed the topic with my professors uhm i don't know anything about the what we have to do  what is there  so i have to is the teaching system i have  how that we should read why we have to read why what we have to study ah ha  what is the procedure  is there any exam is there research so i don't know anything i just know it's m phil it's ph d  it's ph d just like m a  so i don't know anything and uhm i am planning for  career in customs  i have applied uh filled the forms for there is a post  inspector customs and income tax  and for the one word   ah ha right right  that means you have no definite programme where wherever you get the better opportunity you'll go   not only not have a definite see which is if you uh stick to one thing cough  uh you take the case of i a s preparation uh  one word aspiration everything uh  so if we take a single option  uhm right  yeah  and we uh didn't succeed in future yeah   it's a problematic one word  yeah  since i have seen persons persons that's right who have been staying here for last six seven years in my hostel uhm  and they are trying only for i a s yes  and unfortunately many persons they are not that much of that much level or may be possible luck  doesn't favour them  they did not get through   yes yes  ah  so they are nowhere now a days right  and uh three or four of my best friends uhm uhm  two of them have left for their homes after wasting their seven years oh  so you can think if you stick to single option   i don't think we'll ever succeed  yes yes  uh now a days we have to   since there are three four options yes  so you go any try three four ways uh  and if you succeed in any one way it's alright  right  and uh same is the case for u g c  uhm if anyone everyone ask i have to be professor   it is difficult since population is increasing and jobs are that much  oh yeah  limited  yeah  in every fields jobs are limited this is all case of population  yes laughs  since people are doesn't bother even the uhm  family planning programme is not okay i don't think they advertise on t v on radio  if a person is poor how can he afford t v or radio  oh yes even if he uh watches uh television or hears radio he doesn't imply to his own you know  one word
