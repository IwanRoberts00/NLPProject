hello my name is  uh biradar 
""
""
hello  i'm  mrs  mamta raybage 
""
and we are having a discussion on todays children  and maths 
""
so sir what you feel about uh  todays children how they are in
maths  ?
""
""
uh childrens are okay  depends upon there  coach 
""
""
coach means they should be coached from  when they are in
nursery u k g itself 
""
the basic  of maths should be taught to them  means they
should be taught  in a funful way about the numbers 
""
they should be introduced to the numbers 
""
so that  they'll  make make might be  uh good in maths
when they  go in the higher classes 
""
""
uh then it became this  uh good 
""
so then it became nice only otherwise  they'll   didn't
follow  what is maths 
""
""
no means uh  i wanted  to  say that uh  they
should be taught the basics of maths
""
now i teach in  fourth fifth and  sixth seventh standard
maths 
""
the children are not quite good in maths 
""
but why they are not quite good  ?
""
what do you think  what more  something else should be done
 so that there maths  will become perfect 
""
""
uh suddenly it will be  become perfect only 
""
so  it depend upon that  uh their environment 
""
and even home  did  condition also 
""
if they be in always that this is  one word  there are 
 not improve   no improvement   only 
""
""
no means they don't know
""
""
no here i will not  uh that think that students are very
weak 
""
actually they are good only 
""
uh if suppose sometimes if they will not  ge   get good
 uhm diagrams or 
""
""
i see what actually i feel
""
""
all the types only 
""
""
but even the bases  uhm for example  write in numbers
 write in figures  which they are taught from  first  standard
even    uhm  still they reach the fifth standard  they don't
know even the basics 
""
""
 uhm  
""
""
so  what we call to it here  uh i q  some students
having different different i q 
""
so some some of them if you told one time  they are going to 
uh understand quick and some of them 
""
""
for three years sir they are going in the same programme 
say from first second third fourth 
""
""
ah 
""
""
and till four years  a child  normal child  take any
normal child  if he doesn't know the difference between thousand  and
ten thousands and  crore  
""
atleast  the basic should be good  of maths  that is why
 if the basics are not at all proper how can they uh  do the eighth
ninth and tenth standard sums 
""
addition subtractions are the basics 
""
so what do you think about that  ?
""
what else efforts should be done  ?
""
no  i'm  asking you because
""
""
uhn that means here  actually they must do more practice
""
""
by doing more  uhm either sums either that  uh writing  so
they   are going  to improve
""
""
 no uh  
""
""
for example take seventh standard 
""
 i'm  teaching there maths  but i take each and every sum
on the board
""
i make the students do the sum on the board  but uh  i
finished my portion  in  ten to fifteen days earlier 
""
i take revision  but still there are  failures in maths 
""
so you being a higher  uh this teacher  i'm  asking you
 you give me   a   the   guidence on how should i
prepare the students for maths  ?
""
because  i'm  taking fifth sixth seventh for the first time
maths  so you give me   a   the   guidence so that
 na  let the number of student failing be less 
""
i teach my best  because i take  each and every sum on the
board i make them solve on the board i take tests also i take revision also
""
""
what else should i do  ?
""
one week i go on with only four to five lessons i have done 
""
so what guidence   you may give for that 
""
""
 no by doing more practice   we can improve
otherwise only that one time it is not possible 
""
""
means what else should i take  ?
""
 i'll  take   tests also 
""
i have to take make them  i keep    i  competitions
between the girls and the boys also
""
""
 ah ha  
""
""
 i  
""
""
ah so  if it uh  if you teach that is in one day 
""
so you can take out there again  give the same sums 
""
all type of students  some normal medium and  uh
extraordinary 
""
the extraordinary they are going to  take up quick only 
""
and uh  med  medium class they can't understand  soon 
""
and you join with that one that uh  brilliant one that medium
 and so they are going to that means one by one they are going to discuss
""
""
and suddenly they are going to improve 
""
and we must do  uh like before that you told that regarding
competition    uhm  that is essential competition that 
""
""
 uhm  
""
""
no because i take competition between girls and the boys
""
i make one boy solve if he doesn't no i make one girl solve 
""
let the competition spirit be between the both
""
but even though in for having such a lot of efforts on them 
still  in their paper they have done nil  might be my paper was hard
 because i didn't 
""
""
ah now 
""
""
and i don't trust in giving the paper sums for revision 
""
""
papers we can't say hard only  because they already taught
that same 
""
""
no same matter i have taught only just i have  i jumbled up
the numbers here and there 
""
all the sums were there in the text book itself  but still they
have not done  properly in the exam 
""
now what else guidence should i   give  because 
 this week  
""
""
 ah that  
""
""
 in that case we  
""
""
in that case you must improve their  writing only 
""
writing and  uh uh   exercise 
""
""
 means   they do the same exercise in classwork
they do the same exercise at homework 
""
they do it on the board also 
""
means what do you think that the basic itself is not  good or
 now they are getting interest in maths 
""
""
no by doing these all  uh that means taking uh  test
and uh that  this way they are going to improve and we can't say within
that one month either    this two month they are going 
""
""
 not one month   now two to three months have
become the school has started we finished our first unit test also 
""
""
no afterwards that they are  impro  going to improve
suddenly   laughs  so step by step 
""
""
our fifth standard also is giving problem 
""
do you know even they write  one word 
""
""
not even that fifth standard  so all the side  even
higher classes also the same problem 
""
even if  we've  given many times they can't understand 
and if once  one time if they understood they are going to tell  soon
they are going to understand 
""
when after that  one week either two weeks leave they can't 
  again the excercise  because that means uh
""
""
  they'll  have  one word   
""
""
then
""
""
uh repetition is not there
""
when we left  other that  four five days we even that  it
is  uh we can't tell express our views  one word 
""
""
but how come we will be every time doing the same thing 
""
we have to complete our portion within time  isn't it  ?
""
and again hammering the same and same and same sums we should
complete our portion also
""
we should have  all the revision also 
""
how is it possible sir  ?
""
""
so in only one week  daily we must do  one one sum 
on that all exercise 
""
""
sir we are having only half an hour period sir how come its
 uh possible to do  because in one week time  we're  having
seven period of maths  isn't it  ?
""
""
uhn
""
""
and in seven period atleast we should complete two to three
excercises  in seven period 
""
one exercise  teaching and doing the excercises and their
homework and their classwork  then assignments are also there 
""
and completing this much is impossible sir
""
everytime to do one exercise one sum  na   of
each exercise 
""
""
even it is not possible by even  in school also
""
but in home parents  they must take interest 
""
""
that is the main thing  na  here  that
would again the main thing that they don't take at all  interest in the
 their children at all 
""
if both husband and wife are working husband should do 
""
""
no both not only husband
""
""
he should help  na    laughs 
""
he should help   in their 
""
""
 because if they   are working both  they must
do both 
""
and it is not possible  uhm either that uh  one side only
""
""
either husband or  wife  who  who is getting that
""
""
but no sir when
""
""
time
""
""
when both of them reach home okay  the first thing is the
wife should get up and make tea for her husband why  ?
""
 it's  not like   that that 
""
""
 no that is   not rule
""
""
no no no
""
""
no
""
""
 it's  like that sir 
""
never a husband says that   i'll  make a cup of tea
okay you sit  i'll  make a cup of tea  never he says everytime
a wife should get up and make 
""
both works same hours  isn't it ?
""
both of them are uh earning    ah  both of them are
earning for the same house
""
""
 ah i  
""
""
okay it depend upon that even that wife also 
""
if she did no smoothly one time two time he is going to observe
 and why if she she prepared and she can't give that  daily  i'm
 preparing this way that way  uh if  if she started like that only
saying then he will never do 
""
husband no  i'll  do  i'll  prepare it
""
if she  told and uh suddenly  no with you so  i'll 
prepare he is going to say that 
""
it depend upon their that uh 
""
""
but i don't think that any husband is   willingly
saying that   that  i'll  come to   okay you sit for
a while   i'll  uh prepare a cup of tea for you  
""
indian husbands don't   think like that you see  so
""
""
 no no it depend upon that  
""
""
 no no don't don't  two words   
""
""
uh not indian husband that  depend upon that uh  one
word  woman 
""
""
no no 
""
it also depends upon the atmosphere in which they live 
because when  husbands don't see their fathers working they also don't
work in the house 
""
my husband doesn't work at all 
""
he never prepares a cup of tea he never does anything 
""
sir sir you prepare tea  ?
""
""
oh yes yes   laughter  i prepared as
""
""
so your wife is quite lucky  na  having you as
a husband sir   laughs 
""
""
no that uh here was that  uhm understand between both the
 husband and wife 
""
and even she is helping that all at my 
""
""
in what  ?
""
""
uh that uh in home even  uh  one word  she is also
engaged in that uh  regarding home  uh uh  two words  this way
 so we two we help in that   she is also get relax 
""
""
 no but they   say  na  even now
 for example take that the husband doesn't work at all  okay  the
boys  one word  doesn't work at all
""
and then he gets married  okay  and he works 
""
and that time the in-laws start blaming that ahn when you get
married you start working this and that and he stops 
""
like that is also they do 
""
""
it may  depend upon their  parents 
""
""
no but why do the  uh husbands again change a lot  ?
""
""
they never change 
""
""
they change sir how come you say like that 
""
when everytime  you're  no it is not possible for your
husband okay  to do the work
""
he is also tired we are also tired isn't it  ?
""
so for this we say sometime  to do something 
""
i don't think that  he says generally   yes come on
 i'll  do it  
""
some once in a while  once in a blue moon they help they say
that  okay okay  i'll  do   but regularly a woman
have to work  in the kitchen  isn't it ?
""
""
actually that is indian concept what you say that  uh uh
that  you'll  that  man that  one word  that
""
""
okay okay  indian culture says that women should work 
  yeah  isn't it ?
""
she should cook she should look after the children  it's 
alright 
""
but even if they women   is   are   working
as much as a man  she is earning the same  uh monthly saving  as a
man itself 
""
then why should he not work at home  ?
""
isn't it the ego of the   man in which  i'm  trying
to  one word  
""
""
 yeah  
""
""
 no he must work if they are   working both the
side  both husband and even she is  getting the same equivalent to him
""
""
and there is no difference between a husband and wife because that
 that two are  equal weight only 
""
""
but they don't think  na  indian society never
thinks that man and woman are equal 
""
ninety-nine percent of them say that women even if she works for
the whole day  she has to look after the kitchen only alone   laughs
""
""
""
but don't you think that they are uh  changing now 
""
this is changing
""
""
that only  i'm  saying sir but not uh  only sir
 might be in a society  seventy-eight percent sir  or the in-laws
say that   two words  
""
""
see for example  uh my wife    uhm  i mean
i do a lot of cooking    uhm  i enjoy it  that's  all
""
""
but then now that  i've  become a little  old  <{3
 uhm  i feel it is difficult to do
""
see i do my  one word  in the department  uh i do my
work  and when i come back in the  evening 
""
and when i feel very tired i may even sleep 
""
so now  i'm  sixty-five  sixty-two now 
""
but then you know when i was young  i used to go  uh i
mean my wife she does not work 
""
she has not work  but she had four children 
""
""
 uhm  
""
""
 uhm  
""
""
 uhm
