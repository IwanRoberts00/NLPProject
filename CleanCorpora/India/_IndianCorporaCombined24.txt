yes i am from kerala   i'm kuriachan  i am working as a teacher in a school  yes sir i'm anthony  i am joy joseph from uh kottayam kerala a central part of kerala and uh i am here on a special uh session  and uh you one word last week when uh you came from your own place from the yes yes i came from uh nelambur nelambur uh oh then nelambur comes somewhere in the northern part ah northern part of kerala northern  but it is a border district i believe  it's border district between karnataka and uh   between karnataka and tamil nadu oh i see  so i'm teaching there uh in one of the uh private college uh ha you teach in some uh higher secondary school yes i teach in in some higher secondary  but basically i am a mathematics teacher but uh in my school i teach uh english oh ho ho it's fantastic job you are doing no   it's it's a rainy season in our place and we have plenty of rain this year so our crops uh agricultural crops are very good  then what about you sir uh in your village is it a village or town ? yes it's a village   it's village not uh big town a small town   what's the main cultivation there ?  it's paddy and then uh rubber  rubber and uh maize that's all  and   rubber  uh in our place no uh the main cultivation is rubber  usually in ke kottayam is supposed to be the i mean uh  a place where you have we have maintained that uh uh so you get uh more income but you know the pro uh recent uh trends because now-a-days more over though the labour charges have gone up now the good prices are not coming  oh that's everywhere in kerala we can't uh  that's it but the only advantage we can't help it because the population only advantage is that uh rubber is now enjoying a basic price or something like that in a fixed price which is uh almost good not that bad so but actually we still remember the day one word  years till a few years back kottayam was one of the most affluent the uh places even in the whole of india  yeah that's right and you know educationally culturally by all means and you know uh or uh our area i mean the who the whole place  it's almost cultivable cultivated and uh we have access by roads  trains and one word  so we cannot say that it is in a one word  we have a stationary ways etcetra etcetra uh ours is a remote area and our people uh yes hilly area our people they are mostly depend on this agricultural products  uh like uh pepper paddy uh then coffee coffee seeds uh tea plantations  these are the main crops we we   hilly region  you have yeah we have  and uh educationally our area is very backward ah uh  because most of the people uh migrate to from southern part of kerala  but they must be uh be belonging to some i mean uh good i mean families no  they a few words we don't have enough uh facilities  for education and or plant rotation   facilities that should be arranged   one word is there  and uh a very good percentage of our population is uh  uh tribe  so they are backwardly you know they are educationally and socially they are backward  actually they don't want to live with us  they want uh their own lives as it is ah i still remember i was told by some social workers  that whenever the people uh responsible people go to the uhm tribal people they are show their uh uhm what to say uh unwillingness to come forward to mingle with the main stream etcetra is there yes yes now there are various projects i think to give them for  a main stream even then you know i personally don't uh uh agree with many of the policy because you know one way we are destroying their natural habitat  yes uh there are uh yes  uh where they are used to yeah yes that's true that's true and you know the days are gone when we could see we could think of uh people bringing honey etcetra from the forest and forest and uh they had a very good life ah yeah they have their own cultural i mean we destroyed everything anyway whatever it is so one way it's a good i mean when we think about uh this one of government policies are concerned government have to bring all the people to the main stream or whatever it is and uh uh what time you have come ? uh today what about your job and uh family in nelambur sir ? yes uh as i told you everyting you belong to that particular district no no i belong actually to uh yernala district oh ho from yernala you see i'm settled in nelambur uh then how do you a few words work  yeah my field of work is uh i teach i told you know i was i am teaching in one of the private colleges  you see we don't have uh it's run by you   it's run by me  it's run by you  ah ha ha we don't have uh many regular colleges or any high schools run by the government or recognised by the government and nominated   it's a migrated area yes so this a boon your step it's a boon to your uh progress and your people in a way you can say you provide certain education facilities for them  yeah uh see i am actually running a parallel college  a parallel college yes ah a parallel college and uh who else is there to assist you some other teachers or employees ah to assist there some teachers are there and uh together we conduct the classes  and there are many people uhm many people  because since there are no recognised uh aided uh colleges and schools uh many in our area  you see this parallel colleges they run a group  uhm  yes of course but still i have a doubt uh  actually these parallel colleges uh are the main reasons for the uh melting of so many graduates in india  and uh actually they create a lot of problems uh in unemployment uh and uh after getting education they don't want actually to do other work other work uh like uh what uhm you call  aga agriculture  other work  yes especially the indians have the uh uh tendency to keep away from parrallel work and uh  tendency  ah parallel work yeah  everybody wants a white collar job white collar job yes this uh  it's a big problem  so we have uh what you call this uh unemployment problem  uh in our uh place in plenty so people wanted to go abroad in search of jobs  not only in your place everywhere in india these these unemployment problem  ah yes uh  the tendency to so they seek job in other countries  but uh to go abroad uh it is very difficult one or two words because uh the problem of language the financial background everything comes in the way  uh uh when we talk about these things uh what do you feel about the standard of english  is it necessary these english education is necess is it necessary in our country ? so that's a one word i'm a strong uhm arguer for the main maintenance of good standard of english throughout uh across this life yes yes  because because the reason is that it's a world language you know and and uh and uh language see in india in particular if a country like ours we need uh what you call a link language because uh our country has a multi uh  lingual background lingual background  lingual background  every state has uh their own languages so in order to communicate with them uh i think we must have uh a link languages and we usually depend on this english or in other words uh if you don't know english if you want to communicate with people from other cities you need to know around uh ten fifteen languages  whereas if you know english you could serve i mean it could serve your purpose throughout india and even outside the world but actually the politicians spoil the one or two words  i think so  yes they actually spread the regionalism communalism and all because they have uh their own uh motives you know  they have their own personal motives uhm they have to  stand for i mean their survival uh their survival  and uh once such issues are out of the scene uh they cannot  have any thing to to go to the people uhm i mean again for something else or so  so i think there are two sets of people i think  one is favouring uh this uh english language and there are other people who are those who're against them against them yes that's true  but when we consider the facts uh we are supposed to follow  this english language as long as uh we have another link language link language yes   that's very important important  but not only that for our higher studies uh purposes   one word  if you want to go through any material this is the only uh language by which we can communicate uh i mean uh we'll get the only material in english in especially higher upper higher school higher level   upper higher school  what about the cultural uh uh background in your place do your people still uh maintain that uh traditional cultural programmes  like kathakali turgal etcetra in your place ? yes they do  but even they are on the decline no it is very you know in our place you know many of the items are not uh there  but it is because of the influence of this uh city culture you know  they are always after these uh so called modernism  yeah that is the inevitable reality for example in our childhood you know even uh my own i mean the school where i studied our i mean usual uh uniform was the very much traditional kerala  mundu and uh shirt  now most of the schools in have changed to uh uh one word  but i i feel it has become an inevitable uh  that truth uh and we blindly follow the tradition of uh european people uh  but does this mean that you know my sir i mean my guess is that you know people must have uh  chosen a convenient way rather than uh  no i don't think how can it be a convenient way because  uh wearing these uh boots shoes ties  it's a one word you mean uh that  it's not at all suited for kerala's climate uh  one way it's true  it's not hygenic especially during the month of june july but you know still more than that uh cough sorry there is an element of uh imitation or uh going after the uh foreign traditions in every country  yes of course we can follow the language european languages i mean this english but the practice being   but the practice if we follow their culture uh tradition  but you know see anyway english study is that has brought a number of good things to india and whatever it is yes then i see what about the cultural no see the cultural uh  programmes and other items uh mr joy you said that uh the there's  a decline in your part yeah sure and uh what is the reason behind it actually there the thing is that you know for example kathakali art i mean this uh uhm cultural items like kathakali turgal  it needs a life time i mean uh mean practice  for example six or seven years to master ha true and you know nobody is nobody is  that patient enough to practice it  even from our area know it's entirely different know that people they like they wanted to study all these uh old uh things older things you know uh not only that uh usually these days the people have a tendency to look down upon such a traditional yeah yeah uh programme you know traditional uh cultural programmes of  yeah yeah  i see that is the one of the main reason  uh people always go after pop music uh dance cabarait dance uh and all those those things  of course this is well and good but should we  yeah that's not uh our own   yeah  but in our area it is totally different i think uh now people have uh more liking or you can say  they love to learn uh kathakali bharatnatyam and uh see people do
