principal madavee shri suresh pendse who has been put in a position of eminence in a most unexpected manner dr shastri prof pradhan shri  dhuri who is sitting just below me on the right hand side  and shri tatyasaheb patwardhan or tatya patwardhan if not tatyasaheb and members of the resource person team  members of the staff of the english department of this college and  fellow participants in this two day seminar on the method or methods of teaching or trying to teach varieties of english  to the twelfth standard boys and girls who happen to join our college when prof uppar it may be pronounced as upper also you see  laughter that also is there saw me in my residence at bombay  and showed me the letter of the principal i said see i am most innocent into bracket ignorant of the subject matter of your discussions or participations  on my great teacher later on i'll have his i have something to say about him uh dr v k gokak  uh it was said of him that he had a first in english we don't say first class we say first means first class  in english language and literature in the university of oxford in the year nineteen hundred and thirty-eight  and i matriculated in nineteen forty  and karmveer bhaurao sent me to this great teacher in sangli  and i was a little student with a gandhi cap  when i first told that our sir had got a first class in english language and literature i didn't understand the distinction between the two  later on i came to know what literature was and what language is or is likely to be  and being a teacher of english for nearly twenty-three or twenty-four years i was never in charge of teaching grammar  my acquaintance with english is through tarkhadkar translation number one number two number three  perhaps you do not know who tarkhadkar was ? laughter  or why he bothered to write these three books of translation when one was quite enough ? a kale's lesson in english translation rao was kale's  younger brother satara r r kale   kale's lessons in english translation  so i matriculated as i said in nineteen forty so our method of methodology of teaching english at satara was to put it very  roughly very crude  but having come into contact your principal said prof patil is a living example i hope it is still living laughter  and as i was telling my old friend suresh pendase in the bus in the car that he was so kind enough to place at our disposal  i received letters from my friends barrister p g patil  ajeev sevak rayat shikshan sanstha satara  now the word is aajeev sevak they said  ajeev sevak ajeev means nirjeev  laughter  and if by looking at me if he has that idea i wouldn't quarrel with him laughter  so this literature the horizon of literature was open before us in that small college with a population of a its enrollment was dr shastri i myself don't believe when i joined sangli  willingdon college sangli gokaksaheb who had come from oxford the strength was three hundred and fifty  all four classes of arts and two classes of upto inter-science  six classes three hundred and fifty  and the professors were about thirty-five that means per every professor ten students which is a good good quota i see  and as i said dr gokak came from oxford trailing clouds of glory do we come from heaven from god who is our home  now i am in my proper element uh not grammar but literature  i had these two lines young men and women are from wordsworth ode on intimations of immortality from recollections of early childhood  this is the mouth feeling type ode on intimations of immortality from recollections of early childhood  and there wordsworth is developing the thesis of  samadhi  when we are laid asleep in body and becoming living soul  samadhi uh don't think about samadhi because you are very young men and you not bother about that just now  laughter  and there is a famous stanza which begins with where these lines occur our birth is but a sleep and a forgetting the soul that rises with us our life's star hath had elsewhere it setting and cometh from from afar not in entire forgetfulness  and not in utter nakedness but trailing clouds of glory do we come from god who is our home heaven lies about us in our infancy shades of the prison-house begin to close around the growing boy and he sees it in his joy until at last the vision fades far away into the light of common day  now i have quoted about ten or twelve lines which i heard from  the lips of my great teacher  when i was sitting on the very first bench that was my only distinction  sitting on the first bench because sometimes mr president our one of our teachers in sangli was not speaking loudly enough  so i said sir you are not being audible even on the first bench whereas our teacher said and the principal the dr shastri has allowed me the free use of marathi language occasionally  so he said you can't hear me ? i said no sir i can't hear in marathi  laughter in marathi  a man who thinks about this filling things etcetera he has missed his way in the college  so dr gokak this is how we see he used to and dr gokak never stood on one spot on the platform  he used to move from one end of the platform to the other those of you who have visited sangli willingdon college you know that f y arts class  and in those days dr shastri as you know the professors had to wear a dark gown  town and gown town and gown this is a a terminology from the university of oxford and cambridge  town means people from the city and gown means people  students from the university  town and gown that has become very brown now so uh that is  laughter  and so dr gokak used to play with us as if we were little children in the family  he used to engage two periods in the f y arts classroom which  which principal would engage f y arts students or p g students  i understand these days principals don't bother to take any class at all laughter  i hope you see this time dishonour rule does not obtain in this college laughter  because basically uh i was so happy to know that your principal gets a salary of eight thousand rupees  laughter eight thousand  and when i started teaching in sangli uh satara under karmveer bhaurao my salary per month after b a london bar at law was seventy-five basic and forty-five days allowance laughter  this is arabian nights stories laughter   b a bar at law b a london bar at law salary one hundred one hundred and twenty rupees  this fellow should be sent to the yeroda or mental home  laughter  and when uh dr shastri was saying uh sir what about  vice-chancellor's pay i was getting two thousand rupees as v c  vice-chancellor v c  but the work was so difficult that rather then be v c i went to w c  laughter  and my salary at that time was two thousand rupees  and income tax and other tax cut i use to get fourteen hundred  rupees per month  but money is neither here nor there what what salary did karmveer bhaurao get ? no salary because he was an honorary worker  and hence boys and girls i am a a very senior persons so you are all boys and girls for me laughter  i was taught this poem in the fourth standard the eighth standard now fourth standard in my time abu ben adham  adam means aadam  really it is aadam but this lee hunts did not know aadam  so whether it is aadam or adam or adham same thing   abu ben adhem a d h e m may his tribe increase this is a famous phrase in english may his tribe increase  today our tribes are increasing by leaps and bounds on the family front laughter  so abu ben adhem may his tribe increase  and i'm quoting this poem please remember the way i am keeping time keeping rhythm  this is how our teacher used to teach us abu ben adhem may his tribe increase awoke one night from a deep dream of peace  deep dream of peace  some of you uh gentlemen have dreams  some of the dreams are black and white some some professors get into technicolour dreams but that is alright laughter   awoke from from from one night amo from a deep dream of peace and saw within the moonlight in his room making it rich and like a lily in bloom  lily not name of a girl lily or leela   like a lily in bloom making it rich and like a lily in bloom  he saw in his dream an angel writing in a book of gold  exceeding peace had made ben adhem bold  gold rhyming with bold   exceeding peace had made ben adehm bold and he wri  he asked him what writest thou  tarkhadkar translation today you don't know what thou is ? i write we write thou writest he writes she writes they write  where is thou now ? t h o u thou that is now planted and supplanted also  janabai that famous saint of maharashtra says yega yega veethabai maze pandhariche aai  uh i remember this not because i am pandurang patil  you see yega yega veethabai maze pandariche aai   vitthal is suppose to be a mother and so yega yega veethabai  we say this is unmannerly you should say yaho yaho vithalrao kuthe gela hota magapasun laughter  so yega yega veethabai maze pandhariche aai  so that thou thou pronoun is to be used when you are addressing god  when you are addressing your parents or mother and when you are addressing your beloved forget about the third thing but if you say god laughter  and our mother  whenever most of us go barefooted in our childhood and whenever you see a thorn pricks into our sole s o l e sole of our so we say aai ga  do we say baba ho ? aai ga that is the significance of yega yega veethabai  so thou what writest thou  the angel was writing like this  the vision raised its head and said the names of those whom love of lord has blessed  i don't know what your name is mr so and so i am writing down the names in my book of gold the names of those whom love of lord had blessed  now this is a list of successful people   so abu ben says is mine one  is my name in the list of successful lottery winners ?  is mine one nay not so  nay of course today you don't use nay  we say n e i g h that's different neigh laughter a horse neighs and the lion roars which is neigh nay n a y means no nay not so your name is not there  when abu knew that his name was not the poet has used the word  in the next line abu spake more low   nav hai ka ? nahi ararara  abu spake spoke more low   then write me as one who loves his fellowmen  if my name is not there in the list of people whom love of lord has blessed then write me as one who who loves his fellowmen   the angel wrote and vanished  generally angels don't come back a second time   the next night it came again with a great wakening light  the light which woke up abu with a great wakening light  and showed the names of those whom love of lord has blessed  and la last line lo l o  means beholds   lo ben adhems name led all the rest  means he stood first in the first class  i have recited this sonnet a poem with fourteen lines  because this is the description of all benifactors of mankind  whether they are people like sadguru gadage maharaj  i was professor at sadguru gadage maharaj karad and beyond our college there is a another college started by yashwantrao  chavan's institute science college yashawantrao chavan science college now venutai cha arts college now  and those colleges had very majestic and imposing buildings as your principal has said six buildings worth sixteen  lakhs of rupees  so i can't i have not not only cou not counted but i can't see so much amount of money haven't seen so much amount of money  and our gadage maharaj college was only a a monastery  math of sadguru gadage maharaj a small building unimposing building and me and mrs patil working there  and the boys used to be matriculates from our high-school  because as the principal said we run forty-four colleges and three-hundred and seventy-eight high-schools  not even your director of education department run such an enterprise  so we asked the boys you see why is it that you see you are over stepping us and going to that college  they said sir your gadage maharaj college is only a math  gadage maharaja's math  laughter  and that is true this person gadage maharaj gadage those of you who come from rural areas know what a gadage  is ? laughter  these days nobody has seen a gadage  we have only seen  he had this royal insignia this earthenware pot was the royal insignia of this great saint gadage  ladies and gentleman when you were born very few of you have  been born in a nursing home because to be born in a nursing home you have to give a previous notice to the doctor in our case no notice was ever given laughter  why we were born is a mystery ? laughter  how we were born is a still greater mystery ? and where we were born is a matter of conjecturing  because my father was a primary school teacher and therefore he has written out written down noted the date of my birth  but some of you not know your dates of birth  gentlemen if you read a famous book in english  autobiography of booker t washington booker t washing t means telliferd booker telliferd washington the negro educator who died in nineteen hundred and sixty  karmveer bhaurao has been influenced by him also  booker t washington's autobiograpy is named as   up from slavery up from slavery translated into marathi as atmaudhar  and the very first sentence of that autobiography is i was born somewhere and some when  where i was born nobody knows and when i was born nobody knows so this we were born in a dingy room on a makeshift cot  not a modern cot but a makeshift cot  and when our mother have delivered us or must have delivered us we were heated by the coals put in an earthern ware pot  so our association with this earthenware pot  gadaga is from our birth  and when we are about to breathe our last may it be a far off event you see when we are about to breathe our last somebody has to carry an earthen pot before the funeral procession
