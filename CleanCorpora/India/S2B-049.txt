i am extremely grateful to the executive committee of the
indian association  for american studies  and to my fellow delegates
 for electing me to preside over the twenty-seventh annual conference
""
""
as the president of the  i a a s   i deem it
my previlege  to welcome you all  distinguished guests from india and
abroad  delegates  members  fellow academics from the goa
university  ladies and gentleman  to the twenty-seventh annual
conference 
""
american studies in india  had a chequered growth during the
last forty-five years  as indo-u s relations constantly  came under
the clouds  caused by the stresses and strains  of international cold
war 
""
american studies in a systematic way  leaving it mainly to the
american funding  uh funding agencies or the binational agencies like the
 usefi  and the  a s r c  
""
however indian policy makers  have not thought it  necessary
do their own bit  to promote american study 
""
a facile reason sometimes offered for american studies not being
considered  as an area of study is that it does not require  study of a
foreign language 
""
thus in india and america  uh thus india and america are
separated by common language  english 
""
hence outside the j n u  i doubt whether there is any university
in india  which has a full fledged centre for study of america 
""
in university of bombay for instance  american studies were
sought to be introduced  in the early    ninety-sixties  
nineteen-sixties    with the help of university of pennsylvania
""
""
but the conventional  departmental boundary  was so strong
 that readers  recruited to study america got scattered  amongst
the department of history  politics  and literature  rather than
remain as one unit 
""
but since then one person specialising on america in each
department  has not even grown into two  contrary to  parkinson's
 law 
""
this is in contrast to study of the erstwhile soviet union 
""
what the indian americanist have   offer   often 
  encountered instead  is a charge of being a c i a agent 
""
however whenever any discussion has taken place on the question of
increasing contact  between the indian scholars and their american
counterparts  obviously on the american initiative  our educational
bureaucrats  have not hesitated to plead  that they too be included in
the academic exchange programme 
""
be that as it may   i've  always tried to find answers
to the question  why study the u s  ?
""
be its politics  or history or literature or culture or
civilisation 
""
there are many reasons  which could be advanced to answer the
question 
""
one vital reason  is that  the u s today has emerged as the
only veto weilding  major power in the united nation  with a will
power to commit  its superior military strength for the  collective
good albeit as it sees it 
""
to learn about the u s therefore is to remove our own ignorance
 so as to enable us to make our policies more effective  in achieving
their goals  uh their goals 
""
such ignorance galored in our  general public  and policy
makers  including law makers 
""
public ignorance  deserves to be eliminated  but its impact
on our bilateral relations is indirect 
""
but ignorance on the part of policy maker can cause avoidable harm
to the friendly relations 
""
to give one example very few of our policy makers are aware  of
the fact that  a segmented governmental structure in the u s  cannot
always act  or speak without cacophony 
""
thus in nineteen eighty-three when a few legislators  along
with a very low level state departmental official met some sikh separatist
outside the committees home  the indian  mp's  created an uproar
 alleging the u s government interference in our internal affairs 
""
another reason is that  as a developed political system 
with a continous history of two hundred and sixteen years  i  feel
that  the u s can offer us some insight  as to how to organise 
our ever evolving political system 
""
this is true of our  literature  to  to some extent 
""
most of those who have contributed  a great deal to creative
work in our regional language  uh language literature  like marathi or
kannada  have themselves been teachers of english  or more specifically
 american literature 
""
if i do not venture to mention  some names of such creative
writers  it is for the simple reason  that i do not wish to generate
 a controversy from those who are left out  as well as those included
""
""
in the area  of comparative political systems  where i can
claim some expertise  i wish to submit that we can  search for some
answers  for our own political problems  from the american political
system  and experience 
""
there is nothing wrong if we look at the american political system
for answers to our own problem 
""
as the american political  experience has given to mankind 
certain unique political concepts  to organise sharing of political power
like federalism  and presidential system 
""
the countries of south asian region for instance  look to our
democratic political experience  to develop their own democratic
institutions 
""
today india as an ancient society  attempting to build a modern
political system  is facing three major challenges 
""
first communalisation of politics second  political instability
 and third as a consequence of the first two challenges  a threat to
national unity  and integrity 
""
as india has faced many challenges in the past and somehow 
managed to survive  there is a false complacency that we could overcome
 present challenges as well 
""
but it is my considered opinion  that we are sitting on the tip
of a volcano  and it might errupt anytime  if corrective steps are
not taken 
""
hence before these challenges go out of control  i strongly feel
that we need to switch over  to uh a presidential system of government
""
""
tinkering with the existing parliamentary system won't help us
anymore 
""
presidential government need not be a copy of the american system
""
""
but    bio    by   borrowing essential
from american system  and applying modifications to suit changed times 
our major political problems can be brought under control 
""
india is a multi-regional  multi- linguistic and multi-religious
society 
""
this diversity and this uh  hetrogenity  our founding
fathers tried to hold together  in a parliamentary system within a federal
structure 
""
this was  imitative of the british parliamentary system  as
introduced by the government of india act nineteen thirty-five 
""
this is unlike the american experience  after their
independence from the british colonialism  americans though familiar with
the british parliamentary system  created a unique system of presidential
government  within a federal structure to hold together  their
hetrogenous population 
""
the parliamentary system can function well only when  there is
a two party system 
""
in a more homogenous society as in britain  parliamentary
system add political instability  whenever the labour party  face
splits as in nineteen twenty-four and nineteen twenty-nine 
""
basic problem with the parliamentary democracy in india  is one
of our failure to develop  two or three national political parties 
""
with the indian national congress inheriting the mantle of glory of
freedom struggle  the congress party enjoyed one party dominions
nationally 
""
but by nineteen sixty-seven  there were clear signs that all
india national congress  was loosing its national character  and
emerging as only vote catching  and power sharing device   in the uh
 device  
""
in the process  the congress developed a pluralistic 
political majority in different states by putting together  dominant caste
and uh  minority community based on  coalitions like kham kshatriya
harijans adivasis and muslims  in gujrat 
""
the  system of appealing for voters  selecting candidates
 appointing  man to  executive positions on caste and communal uh
 basis is the congress strategy to begin with 
""
this was only vulgarised by v p singh in his uh  effort to
develop an alternative to the congress 
""
he started with uh  majgar  muslims ahirs  jath gurjars
and uh rajputs coalitions 
""
and later tried to expand it by adding the o b c  by announcing
the acceptance of uh  recommendations of mandal  now uh  mandal
commission 
""
the b j p answered  it by taking up mandir masjid issue  and
trying to bring together highly pluralistic hindus  under their political
banner 
""
today  all political parties from the left to the right are
basically communal  as once asserted by  former  justice krishna
iyyer 
""
why this communalisation of political process  ?
""
it is mainly  because in the parliamentary system an m p 
who aspires to lead the  nation as the prime minister must command a
sizable following  within the party to be the leader of the legislature
party 
""
to do so indian leaders have found it easy to appeal  on caste
and communal basis  and present themselves as protectors of one  or the
other section of the community  instead of developing issues  uh issue
and programme based party 
""
in this kind of caste and community based politics  power
sharing  blatantly  come to uh blatantly has come to be on the 
bas  same basis as the stunt of the caste  or community in the
parliament 
""
as a result it is better to be a leader of a small party commanding
loyalties  on a communal basis than  to the   to be a part 
of issue based political party 
""
when uh  too many parties get elected  forming a stable
government becomes difficult  and a coalition or a minority government 
becomes inevitable 
""
but from the caste or communal angle  a cabinet post in a
coalition  is assured to a caste oriented party  rather than when the
particular caste or community  follows the national issue based party 
""
this has tended to fragment indian political parties 
""
thus inspite of the congress and janata dal  and others wooing
scheduled castes  they have found it necessary to found their own party
 bahujan samaj  party in u p as jaths from western u p have come 
out from the janata dal after it lost the power in nineteen ninety 
""
today there are thirty-three political parties  all fractions in
 lo   in the  lok sabha  
""
while the first  lok sabha  after fifty-two election
 had only five political parties 
""
in the process  no political party has been able to get a
rolling majority after nineteen eighty-four elections 
""
so long this trend of appealing for votes and post on caste and
communal basis continues  fragmentation of political parties is bound to
continue 
""
the result of communalisation of electoral politics   has
been political  has been uh  political  instability both at the
states  and at the centre 
""
instability in state is not a new phenomenon  but political
instability at the centre  is a new phenomenon particularly under the
congress party  dispensation 
""
what has brought this thing at the centre  ?
""
clearly the absence of a ruling family 
""
mrs gandhi and rajiv gandhi   cough  tried to maintain
their individual control over the party  and the government  through
the iron rule of political instability  uh political destabilisation of
individual chief ministers  in the congress party ruled state  whenever
they showed any  one word  to independant action 
""
since the end of the nehru-gandhi family rule  the centre has
seen  political instability as well as uh  as well on a day to day
base 
""
it is politics all the way 
""
hence the government has no time to govern 
""
if in the past non congress efforts to form the government  at
the centre have invariably ended in the political uh in the vertical splits
in the ruling party  janata party in nineteen seventy-nine and the janata
dal in nineteen ninety  whether the congress party can avoid it  is not
cleared today 
""
in contrast to this  american presidential system has been able
to provide  a reasonable degree of political stability 
""
reasonable because  after constitution imposed a two term 
on presidential aspirants  after franklin d roosevelt was elected for a
fourth term 
""
only two  eisenhover and reagan where able to complete eight
years in the office  as against it  seven presidents were in the white
house for less than two terms 
""
it still  appears reasonable stability  when we note that
carter in his four year term  dealt with three indian prime ministers 
and bush in  four year saw four indian prime ministers 
""
this stability  this uh  stability in the american system 
is based on the principle  of the separation of powers  between the
executive and legislative branches  which has made president co-ordinate
and independant  with congress in respect of term  powers  functions
 and  one word  
""
president thus enjoys a fixed tenure  and cannot be removed by
the congress except through impeachment  which is extremely difficult and
rare
