what i propose to do this morning is to reinforce  some of
the points that i made yesterday  and  then move on to  two or
three new points 
""
let me say firmly  and with all the  uhm  with  with
the power underlying my perception of teaching in india  that grammar has
a very important role to play 
""
so grammar is not out 
""
don't go back with the impression that grammar is out 
""
grammar is in because as i said yesterday  grammar is the heart
and soul of a human language 
""
no grammar  no language 
""
language means grammar 
""
now the question is that we are teaching and learning english as a
second language  how should we  present the facts of grammar in a
classroom situation  to facilitate  the learning of english which
means  use of english  effectively in a variety of situations 
""
so  it's  not a question that we are not uh sitting here 
to say that alright grammar is out now 
""
what we are trying to say is what is going to be the best way of
presenting the facts of grammar 
""
so  that's  point number    o    one
  
""
point number two is  that   it's  very difficult to
draw a sharp line  between grammar and lexis 
""
and therefore in producing our teaching materials  you will
have to have  two types of materials to be highlighted   b b
writing 
""
and these two types of materials will be  sentence-based grammar
 and word-based grammar 
""
and one of the excellent  reference books  at the secondary
level is  even now that old  palmer's  grammar of english words
""
""
he selected about thousand productive words  and he has
presented the grammar of those words in the form of a dictionary
""
 it's  an excellent book even now 
""
and we are going to do  these two  within the over-all
frame-work of   b b writing 
""
so  we are going to organise our materials  grammar materials
in two parts  sentence-based grammar and word-based grammar 
""
but whether  it's  sentence-based grammar or word-based
grammar  the actual presentation will take place in the context of 
discourse of  because the point that i made yesterday  we are not
interested in grammar for the sake of grammar 
""
we are not interested in rules for the sake of rules 
""
we are interested in  making the rules function  making the
rules function 
""
how do we make use of rules  to produce language texts or
discourse materials  ?
""
so  that's  second point 
""
uh an example of word-based grammar will be   b b writing
 the choice of verb 
""
you have a network of  verbs  and then which one to select
 in a given context or in a given text 
""
and then the grammar will say  once you have selected this
 then your choice here is  restricted  which will also mean that
  b b writing  this will rule out the possibility of 
 a  that clause coming after this  whereas if you
select  c   then you can have  a 
 that clause 
""
third point which i would like to reinforce is   b b writing
""
""
the  learner's  mind is that mysterious  black box 
and our ultimate objective is  language as i said yesterday is a
meaningful human activity 
""
this is the meaning  this is the experience  this is human
experience 
""
 how do i say 
""
what are the possible forms that i should be using to convey this
meaning or this experience   ?
""
and the whole thing is processed  mysteriously  by this
learned  black box 
""
so once again we are moving from we are not saying that form is
useless 
""
what we are saying is   language is a meaningful
activity 
""
so what the learners have to have their focus on is  
this is the meaning  this is what i propose to do  
""
language  that's  why one of the titles of  halliday's
 important book is   learning how to mean  
""
this is a very important concept 
""
second language learning a second language means  
learning how to mean in a new context of culture  
""
learning how to mean 
""
how do i mean  ?
""
i know how to mean in my mother tongue 
""
how do i mean in my other tongue which is english  ?
""
so learning how to mean is   learning to categorise
human experiences  you remember the point that i made multilingual
view of the universe  bi-focal view of the universe 
""
this is when i have english glasses on  this is how the world
appears 
""
when i have my marathi glasses on this is how 
""
now i am using english in the marathi context of culture 
""
how do i use english  ?
""
again inspite of all that you keep on saying  your students are
going to address you as respected sir  which is not english  but 
 chalta hai  
""
in our context of culture   it's  something which is
very important  they want to  show their respect for their teachers
""
""
so we are moving from  meaning to form 
""
 it's  movement just as yesterday we said  we are moving
from fluency to accuracy 
""
ultimately our ultimate objective is to help learners produce texts
""
""
and once they  start producing texts  the text must be
linguistically also accurate 
""
but we are not going to   clears throat  to put a check
on the fluency right at the beginning 
""
we are going to encourage them to play with language 
""
just as a human child in the context of his l one  plays with
language  tries out experiments  tries out all kinds of tricks 
""
so we will allow a second language learner also  to play with
his language 
""
but as a teacher we are around and we keep on saying   oh
i see  what you meant to say is   has he come this morning
   ?
""
and things like that
""
so  what we are doing is  as a result of interaction what
you are doing is  exposing him to your  concept of  the standard
variety of this language 
""
so in fact all movements are  from dialectal varieties
idiolectal varieties  to a frozen standard variety of language for the
time being 
""
so we are moving  from dialect  from idiolect to what we
consider at a given point of time to be the standard  formal  variety
of that language 
""
then i said  that  every teacher of a second language in
fact i will say  also of first language  has to have a set of  
b b writing  reference tools 
""
and the two important tools are   b b writing 
""
as teachers we must get into the habit of looking up  a
standard reference grammar and looking up  something in a standard
dictionary 
""
when in doubt  go to  cobuild   or
 longman   or  we have had for years  in the
field of e l t   advanced  learner's  english dictionary
 which we have been using
""
but we have now better dictionaries  as reference dictionaries
""
""
grammar i said  we need three types or three levels   b
b writing  reference grammar 
""
 what do i say is this alright   ?
""
now you will find that  in all the states in the country today
 newspapers they have i don't know about maharashtra but  down south
  deccan herald  hindu  now  deccan
chronicle news time  they have a column every week  either
 know your english   subramaniam  or  
mind your language   or  yadurajan's  i forget the title
of his series 
""
so there is a big demand  is this the right kind of english that
we are using  ?
""
and this demand is coming from senior i a s officers  senior
executives 
""
 am i really right  the way i am writing the way i am
drafting   ?
""
so there is a big demand for grammar 
""
 it's  not true that there is no demand for grammar and 
it's  not at the  learner's  level   it's  at fairly
advanced level 
""
people feel that if they are going to make a sophisticated use of
language  then they must be accurate 
""
so accuracy comes at that level  after you have  started
handling the language in your own way then at a particular level you feel
that it must be  grammatically accurate 
""
of course there is nothing like one standard form there are
varieties of standard forms also   b b writing 
""
then we have  teacher's  grammar 
""
now the reference grammar derives all the insight from a 
linguist's  grammar  a linguistically oriented description of a
language  and  for example i will treat  quirk  greenbaum 
and svadvik   a comprehensive reference grammar of modern english
 
""
because what they have done is  they have captured the insights
from transformational grammar   chomsky's  generative grammar 
 halliday's  systemic grammar   filmore's  case grammar 
traditional grammar and then put them together 
""
so it becomes an exhaustive  comprehensive description of
contemporary english 
""
 teacher's  grammar  at different levels for teachers we
have to have different levels of grammar  which the teachers will need
 in order to teach   b b writing 
""
 learner's  grammar will have minimal of technical terms 
and the main focus will be use of language in a variety of situations 
""
i will give you an example in a minute 
""
for example   b b writing  we set an exercise on 
ramu's  routine activities every morning 
""
the focus is on every morning 
""
what does he do every morning  ?
""
now see  our emphasis is on  every morning 
""
a person  who does something  every morning  as a matter
of habit  habitually 
""
so although we are not saying that what we are going to have in
this text is  simple or habitual present  but we are highlighting that
indirectly 
""
because our main thing is  characteristic activities of this
person every morning 
""
what he does every morning  ?
""
so he gets out of bed  at six every morning  he brushes his
teeth  and so on so on so on 
""
and then at end  we have a box item 
""
after they have practised language  you have a box item and
this box item is for  generalization in the form of grammar 
""
and we say  this is what in grammar is called the simple present
""
""
and you underline the simple present 
""
so we are not teaching the simple present for the sake of the
simple present 
""
we are saying that there are certain things activities which a
human being does  habitually repeatatively again and again  regularly
 and that gets focused you can underline that and then at the end you have
 the simple present as a box item 
""
in fact this mechanism of box item was used by  i forget 
the name of that american linguist uh  felix   it will come back
 to my mind later 
""
""
lado
""
""
 haan 
""
""
fries and lados
""
""
no no not fries and lado they you we had   rapid
review of english grammar  we have ten or twelve copies 
""
""
prininska sir prininska
""
""
prininska prininska  yes  prininska
""
""
 trusty  matter  that's  all
""
""
ah ha yeah 
""
""
some prininska
""
""
 haan haan  yeah
""
""
 a few words 
""
""
 let's  take    anothe    another
  example   b b writing 
""
the passive   b b writing 
""
even in our text books we have to organize it in two parts 
""
right at the beginning  there should be  uh some kind of
 some instructions  built into the text  which the teacher is
supposed to follow  in teaching  presenting  that particular lesson
or that particular  text item 
""
for the teacher  it's  very important for him to know that
  b b writing 
""
this is the formal representation 
""
if  it's  not there then  it's  not   be 
passive
""
it may be some other kind of passive 
""
so the teacher must be familiar with this  that the real form
of the passive will be a choice of  a form of the verb to be followed by
 the main verb or whatever verb comes after it in the past participle
form 
""
 that's  one thing  that the teacher must know 
""
second thing that the teacher must know is   it's  a
 mechanism a linguistic mechanism a language mechanism  for promoting
the object and demoting the subject 
""
but this is for the teacher 
""
what are the situations that are  that may necessitate the use
of the passive  ?
""
the situational factors are  that we are either not interested
in the agent in the doer  or that the doer is unknown  or that the
doer  doesn't need any mention 
""
then the sufferer  the affected  the receiver  comes to
the front 
""
this is subject position  and the verb has a marked feature
 be plus  in  past participle 
""
so the teacher must know  that the use of the passive is
context governed use 
""
 it's  the context  that gives you a clue to the use of
the passive 
""
and if you look at  your text 
""
you see blood transfusion 
""
now this is a kind of text  which belongs to the register of
science 
""
and in the register of science unless it is biographical or
autobiographical  the doer is not so important 
""
 it's  the action that is important   it's  the
activity  that's  important 
""
 it's  the thing done  that's  important
""
so i have marked on the first two pages at least ten  examples
of the passive 
""
where they say  now this is done every day with good results
""
""
uh very little can be done now about this because it has already
been done 
""
change may be caused if you do this 
""
a soldier may be brought in and put to bed 
""
a  man's  blood was changed 
""
man could be put into  something something something 
""
these were the things which were asked 
""
this  was tried out 
""
it was done and so on 
""
so on the first two pages i find  that the focus is on
activity on the action done  on the  thing achieved rather than on the
agent or the doer
