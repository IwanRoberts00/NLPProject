the development of painting in india   interruption 
on page number three hundred ninety-two 
""
as far as paintings are concerned  here comes the role of frescos
""
""
today  the colours  are much faded 
""
but it is of its own kind 
""
another type of frescos we find at barhat  in bihar 
""
and  luckily ajanta paintings  are in  maharashtra 
""
the line used by the ajanta artist is unique  unparalleled 
""
though i have mentioned the example of barhat  in bihar  but
 ajanta frescos are  are of its own type  of its own class 
""
depicting various stories  in the life of  buddha 
""
in northern india  the frescos  at  bhag also 
""
the mughals brought with them the traditions of persian painting
""
""
can we call it  indo-islamic  school of painting or art  ?
""
anyone  of you  ?
""
can we call it  indo-islamic  school of painting in art  ?
""
""
it can be called as  it can be called indo-islamic
""
""
it can certainly be called  because of fusion 
""
  aini akbari   mentions a number
of artists  abdul samad  mir sayyed ali  miskin  dasvant 
dasvan  mukand 
""
so some of the famous names of the painters of the then times 
have been mentioned here 
""
now page number three hundred   ninety-four  
""
""
 sir ninety-four  
""
""
jahangir was a great  patron of painting 
""
patron means  supporter  helper 
""
one who helps us like a father  is a patron 
""
one who helps us like mother  is matron 
""
and original words they are  from sanskrit coming to latin 
and then in modern indian languages like english 
""
so original word is  pitro   and  matro
 
""
jahangir was a great  patron of painting 
""
was akbar also a great patron of  hist  uh  painting  ?
""
or only of painting  ?
""
wilson smith has mentioned in his book on akbar  that akbar was
a patron of all fine arts 
""
and i will include literature also in it 
""
so foundational work of the development in painting  was
already done during the period of akbar 
""
from  second battle of panipat  fifteen fifty-six 
""
closing year of  akbar's  life  sixteen hundred and five
""
""
so foundational work was done 
""
but his son  who took the name  jahangir  came to the
throne in sixteen hundred and five  and died in sixteen twenty-seven 
""
so during this period  of twenty-two years  indian fine art
 specially  painting  got tremendous  stimulation  and
boost 
""
so painting in india  both  of miniature type and mural
type  have been developed  during the period of   jahangir's
 special 
""
but only to be a patron  not knowing anything about the art
""
""
is it possible ?
""
anyone of you ?
""
""
no sir no sir 
""
""
why not  ?
""
now raise your hands 
""
yes 
""
""
without knowledge how can we draw our  various things and
ideas can not possible
""
""
correct 
""
so a man who knows the work  can only get the work done 
from others 
""
 that's  why rigorous training is  imparted  in
india  to the cadet  who become officers in future 
""
so he must   had   have   a fair idea about
any type of work 
""
then only he can get it done from others 
""
that is he can command perfectly 
""
hotel de matol must be a good cook  himself  otherwise
holding that post in five- star hotel at bombay or any other international
centre  is not a joke 
""
so not only we see but quite profeciency in any  branch of work
 or discipline is a must 
""
specially painting  and various schools of art in painting
developed during the period of jahangir  mainly for a reason that he was
master of the art himself  that he has mentioned 
""
then nadir murad  bhishandas  manohar  govardhan 
mansoor  and faruk baig  they all got help  from  emperor
himself 
""
darashiko  was a patron of painting 
""
who was this darashiko ?
""
""
eldest son of shajahan 
""
""
youngest son of 
""
""
eldest son of shajahan  was darashiko 
""
what is the speciality about darashiko ?
""
can you mention one point    in one sentence  
""
first stand  and then give the answer 
""
""
 he was   a   the   greatest  
""
""
yes  ?
""
sit down
""
yes ?
""
""
he practised what he preached 
""
""
 haan 
""
you please explain that 
""
""
means uh  he never ignore for interested in art  so
that he get man  and what he told  he would himself 
""
""
yeah 
""
i would give the answer to this question myself like this 
""
he was a liberal minded man 
""
he was a follower of sufism 
""
he was tolerant to all religions  and therefore he was a patron
of all  schools of arts 
""
all types of religions  wherever he found some sort of spark 
he was always ready to run there as a patron  to help it 
""
so  all types of  artist got encouragement from him
""
it was not that only the muslims got it  hindus were in
majority 
""
perhaps this might not have been liked by aurangzeb  and  may
be because of that  darashiko  was disposed off 
""
even put to death 
""
and the rule which aurangzeb afterwards introduced  was full of
fanaticism  too full of debauchery 
""
that may be the  reason  darashiko is a great personality 
""
he got many and various books  of sanskrit  translated into
persian 
""
such type of liberal man 
""
can he  encourage  arts in india  ?
""
raise your hands  and answer  because  my next question
will be please explain 
""
yes  ?
""
""
he was learned scholar and free views on others  means 
""
""
yes but 
""
such type of man who is a you can say  a saintly type of man 
""
can he encourage the arts  ?
""
""
perhaps 
""
""
no  not so 
""
sit down
""
yes ?
""
""
as he was  in  interested in painting therefore  he
 used to encourage 
""
""
 accha  was he encourage  uh uh was he
interested only in painting
""
""
no he was interested in literature
""
he translated many book  of that indo-persian books  and he
used to read them 
""
""
yeah 
""
so literature  painting 
""
was he intersted in architecture  ?
""
""
no 
""
""
anyone raise the hands 
""
no 
""
jahangir was specially interested  in painting  exclusively
""
""
and therefore  this book which is the publication of n c e r t
has specially mentioned the name of  jahangir here  though 
darashiko  in with his limitation  has previously tried  to
encourage various arts 
""
the most important schools of painting emerged where the 
rajasthani  and     pahari   schools 
""
""
  pahari   
""
""
what is this  pahari  school  ?
""
if anybody knows 
""
""
sir it is  one word   pahari  school
""
""
""
anyone else  ?
""
you ?
""
""
it is from  pahad 
""
""
 haan  pahari  work comes from 
pahad 
""
 it's   pahadi   so  pahadi  da
  is many times pronounced as  ra  
""
so in mountainous region  in the himalayas  various
schools of art developed 
""
in painting also 
""
so all of them put together  are known as  pahari
 paintings 
""
what is this rajasthani painting ?
""
""
sir desert  desert 
""
""
yes ?
""
""
developing in rajasthan
""
""
developing in rajasthan 
""
it has got nothing to do with desert  because mainly the
paintings in rajasthan are  about life of shri krishna 
""
and the period of the early life and afterwards  desert period
 was around mathura  and then in gujarat  because the new city
which he established  can you tell the name of that city  which was
established by  shri  krishna ?
""
""
dwarka
""
""
dwarka  which has now seen the bottom of the   
ocean 
""
""
 ocean  
""
""
please sit down 
""
""
it has been unearthed by  one word    noise
""
""
""
 haan  under the supervision of him  it
has been located now 
""
so it is a very good proof  about all descriptions  which
you find about that city in  mahabharat  
""
sit down 
""
then languages and literature 
""
two main groups of languages  the indo-european or indo-aryan
and dravidian 
""
why he has said indo-european and indo-aryan ?
""
""
because aryans came from  aryavarta 
""
""
no i would like to suggest you one method 
""
yes soman  ?
""
""
because aryans  came from the  north uh  northern
track of asia  and they have got their own language 
""
""
yes  ?
""
""
the aryans came from the region of caspian sea 
""
""
yes 
""
around the caspian sea  from central asia 
""
some of the tribes  went to europe  some of them 
reached in india 
""
but they are included in the  indo-european group 
""
so indo-europeans or indo-aryans 
""
why this uh  word  indo  comes there  ?
""
""
sir they came to   india  
""
""
 india  
""
""
river indus 
""
""
means that  tribes of the aryans who came to india 
can they be called indo-europeans  ?
""
""
if they centralised form of culture of india
""
""
if they can be called as indo-europeans  then what is the
 need for the use of word indo  uh uh indo-aryans  ?
""
you think and answer 
""
not just your guess 
""
""
because they are the aryans now settled in india
""
""
then only you call them indo-aryans 
""
then nothing about indo-europeans at all 
""
because they come neither from europe nor from india 
""
they come from central asia 
""
so indo-european  what do you understand by the word
indo-europeans  ?
""
""
europeans coming in india
""
""
europeans settled in india 
""
""
europeans settled in india
""
""
never 
""
there is no record  because indo- european is a false language
 indo-aryans is correct 
""
and  aryans who settled in europe 
""
what word he has used for that  ?
""
""
indo-aryans 
""
""
aryans who settled in europe  ?
""
  indo- europeans  
""
""
 europe  
""
""
it looks simple but it is not simple 
""
so now finally last question 
""
to what branch do we belong today  ?
""
""
indo-aryans 
""
""
dravidians 
""
""
dravidians 
""
""
anyone else  ?
""
""
indo-aryans
""
""
indo-aryans 
""
if we are indo-aryans  and one boy said dravidian  then what
is the difference between indo- aryans and dravidians  ?
""
now  burden will fall on your shoulders 
""
""
dravidians were in india 
""
""
yes ?
""
""
they were 
""
""
they were original inhabitants of india 
""
""
they were original inhabitants of india  before coming of
whom ?
""
""
aryans 
""
""
before coming of    indo-europeans  or aryans
""
""
""
 aryans  
""
""
or indo-aryans 
""
where do they live even today  ?
""
""
southern part of india
""
""
what is this method  ?
""
means what part of india  ?
""
""
southern part of india
""
""
southern part of india only 
""
then those who have settled in forest  because of the onslaught
of the aryans  original inhabitants of india as you have just now said 
who were defeated by the aryans 
""
history records that they ran away into the deep jungles and
forests 
""
what are you going to call them 
""
you say  you uh dravidians are settled only in south india
""
 that's  why this question i am putting up  ?
""
before coming of the aryans all the people they who were living in
india  according to your definition are original inhabitants of india 
""
did all of them run to south  ?
""
nobody ran to the east  north or west  ?
""
""
ran
""
""
ran 
""
then what are they ?
""
what are you going to call them  ?
""
are they there today or not ?
""
""
yes sir 
""
""
then what is their names  ?
""
""
tribes
""
""
schedule tribe
""
""
tribes 
""
whom we have scheduled in the constitution
""
so we call them scheduled tribes 
""
now my final question 
""
those dravidians who you say that are in south india  can you
call them scheduled tribes  ?
""
""
no
""
no sir 
""
""
why not  ?
""
just now you gave the definition  i am only clearing your ideas
""
""
yes ?
""
""
these are minorities  that is they referred  they have
been  a few words  
""
""
then ?
""
""
from there orissa 
""
""
imparts yes ?
""
""
there have been means uh indo-aryans  sir indo-aryans then
 some of these split into 
""
""
dravidians 
""
then what is the use of calling them dravidians 
""
""
they are not called as dravidians 
""
""
you see  the reason is like this  aryans came 
conquered india  defeated the original inhabitants
""
but all this drama was played in north india 
""
or such a long period aryans just could not come to the south 
for two reasons 
""
first thing  north india is not a small place 
""
it is very big area 
""
thus they would be going by slope only 
""
if they come across the mountains naturally they are going to
avoid that  side  or direction 
""
so their journey was eastwards  till the conquest of 
modern  bengal  assam  arunachal pradesh
""
that is  upto  uh uh jaintia    patkoi hills 
and patkoi hills
""
""
 patkoi hills  
""
""
sir hills
""
""
garo khasi
""
""
patkoi patkoi
""
""
then  they would turn to the south 
""
so it took a very long time for them  to defeat the people who
were already settled in south and who had   developing  
developed   their special culture  and they had developed their
languages with the different scripts
""
this is important 
""
cultural heritage is mainly this 
""
so  kannada  andhra and was telugu  malyalam  and
tamil is basic  languages  of the original inhabitants of the country
 or of dravidian nature 
""
but they were not misplaced 
""
they were not disorganised  they continued  to prosper and
develop their own way of life  which is known as culture 
""
so dravidian culture is mainly in south india in that sense 
""
sanskrit was a language of the indo- aryans 
""
does it mean sanskrit was not the language of the dravidian group
 ?
""
""
yes sir
""
""
but it might 
""
""
pointed question  you think and answer 
""
last boy  ?
""
no 
""
""
no 
""
""
no 
""
""
 one or two words 
""
dravidians people may have learnt that language from the aryans
""
""
""
from the aryans only  ?
""
""
because   yes sir 
""
""
 unless  
""
ah  unless the aryans penetrate into the south  they can
not understand  nor they can come in the contact of uh  indo-aryans
 language  that is sanskrit 
""
can there be a language without grammar  ?
""
""
no 
""
""
no  then what is first grammar or language  ?
""
""
grammar
""
""
language 
""
""
follow one method 
""
what will take first  ?
""
what will come into being first grammar or the language  ?
""
""
the language and 
""
""
first language 
""
""
first language only will come 
""
the child who imitates the parents and tries to speak doesn't know
anything about grammar 
""
but once that pattern is set  then someone had to bring it into
rules 
""
then once the rules are framed  all the things or writings 
or your way of speak  is not according to those rules
""
then we say this is not correct grammar 
""
but is it a language ?
""
""
yes it is
""
""
it is a language 
""
so sanskrit language  aryans brought  with them only from
central asia 
""
but the period is early  the people were in the form of tribes
""
""
war type of warriors  better conquerers 
""
but once they settled  on the permanent footing in the 
sapta  sindhu areas that is punjab  then someone  must give
some rules also 
""
to consolidate it  to classify it  to make it classical one
 panini did that work
