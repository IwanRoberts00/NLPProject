hello everybody my name is ramesh and i would like to speak about indian culture and indian art  first we have to know what exactly is indian culture ? indian culture flips the whole and soul of the the spiritual life of a person or the spiritual mentality of a person now when we compare the indian culture with the other cultures indian culture is considered as the one of the ancient and the oldest and the topmost and the critical culture of the world  now we should know what exactly is the culture ? and what exactly is the art ? culture as far as india is concerned is a way of life  but the way we are culturing it now that is totally we are going in a different concept  that culture is totally apart from the culture what i'm  going to speak   india's cultural heritage actually it's not only one of the most ancient but it is also one of the most extensive and varied  uh tu it has contributed uh throughout the ages many races and people uh who have either temporarily come into contact with india or have permanently settled within her borders  joining the lines of her children and helping to evolve a distinctive indian culture  the key note of which is synthesis on the bases of the eternal values  now it gives us glimpses of vedic civilisation that indian culture which is having a history of four thousand more than four thousand years ago that is including indus valley civilisation now the indian culture was laid and of the china the buddhist movements which tried to spread their accumulated spiritual wealth among the masses and classes of the country  that actually is the foundation of the uh two great ideals of india that is synthesis of culture and spiritual regeneration of a man uh it have has been uh truely laid in these early phases from which the future structure of india's  culture has been raised  as a matter of fact uhn the great culture of india is basically a synthesis  you know a synthesis of not only blood and race but also uh speech and uh what uh we can say the ways of thinking of which their different speeches are outward expressions as well as the  cultures that is material culture and intellectual culture and  spiritual which gives ideologies and determine attitudes and actions  the uh geographical background actually it uh  it it should also be taken into consideration  because man in any area any area of the world is the product of as much of his geographical and economic environment as of his racial and cultural bearings and movings  no culture or civilisation now this is actually going to be a important point whenever we speak of culture this is going to be a very very important point  no culture or civilisation have come into being in any country and at any age in a completed and a perfected form  like an athena coming out of full grown and fully armed from the head of the divinity vision  you know that's a actually a story  now man is for ever becoming and like all things within and uh  his affairs are ever in a state of flux  uhm now let us come to let us jurisdict ourselves to india  uh india some would prefer to describe it in other way as the expression of a basic and original univa uni uh what do you call it as uh the universal uh unity in its various uh uhm we can say it as manifestations  this other way of looking at the matter has something attractive in it for those who believe in a progressive uh degeneration from a golden age of their imagination rather than in the in uh  evolution through the ages  but in fact in the face of the observed facts it is a case of unity gradually becoming established out of diverse and uh contending elements  uhm and the first human habi habitants  of india that actually they represented various different races whose origins and whose language and basic cultures when started were different from each other  it was not totally a different uh altogether from square one it is from differnt squares  now let us come to the evolution of indian way of life  here this indian way of life is totally the foundation of this indian way of life is totally indian culture  now the uh as a matter of fact considering the vast amount of uh uh what literally we say it is uh like your name in our knowledge of india  in the formative period of our culture it will not be possible for us to obtain the full picture out of a welter of race and movements  and of the ideological exchanges for mens and uh we can only see dimly the gradual establishment of a way of thought know and the way of life that we can associate it with india uh as a distinct entity among geographical units and uh you know human innocence  the various races follow each other as a face to sequence that is making ultimately for that richness of life and experience and thought and spiritual prospective that are in the civilisation and the culture and uh uh the basic uh ethics of india  the neolithical negroids from africa the protoastroloids and  ostroids people and probably if may know that is from asia and the mongoloids from far east  no but congeries of asian peoples who appear to have brought the dravidian language and culture to india and indo-europeans in their various elements racial and linguistic uh all these things counts a lot  now indian way of life as it emerged with a birth of the indian man  i'm i'm specifing here indian man which took place as the result of uhm uhm what uh they say that uh the mythology and uh  histories of the india at the time of the aryans that is  the mongoloids the ostroids and the dravidians and indo-aryans and the indo-europeans  this this is going to be a very very huge list  now the second half of the second millenium that is b c it was the period of large scale tribal movements and racial one word   throughout the whole of the near east  in the as far as indian culture is concerned i wanted to tell you one thing that is excuse me that is exactly based on the the vedas and the upanishads  and uh philosophical concepts of life  uh in a well known rigvedic hymn that is describing the battle fought by the indo-aryan king surdas with uh the confederacy of ten kings one word  actually they were uh a love people  harikrishna dev he is one of the well known philo   philosophers and culturist  he said he had suggested with great plausibility that the tribes mentioned in the rigveda were the same as those mentioned in the egyptian documents  and uh this would suggest that external influences from the near east was not absent even in the ancient period of india's  emergence as a characterised cultural unit  and uhm this person harikrishna dev would identify the farmer with the people known to egyptians as uhm the purasati who were the same as the uh philistines and palistines  and uh that's convincing but nevertheless noteworthy  in uh these proposals to identify some king mentioned in uh  shatpata brahman  now all this all this why i'm mentioning the sanskrit names is totally based on the indian culture  indian culture actually these all these names what i'm  speaking of that is all its each and every brick of our indian culture you know it's a dream house  now until recently it was generally admitted that vedic sanskrit was the oldest indo-aryan language as far as the indian culture was concerned  uh later finally the hitite question came before us  that uh and it is now admitted that the discovery and the reading of the language of the hitites has brought forth the history of the indo-european and the earl earlier  visitor  this would make the ancient greek language interior to the  vedic by atleast a couple of countries  so by observing all these things we can come to a conclusion that indian culture actually it was not brought up on its own it was brought up through the the influences  through the the way of thinking of the other cultures  that means we may come to know that before indian culture  there were some more countries who were who have developed their own cultures and their own systems and their own way of life and their own uh way of thinking their own way of uh expressing themselves  now we will look at the universal ideals of indian culture  now we should look upon the pilgrims programmes of humanity as being essentially one in this great question of uh which mankind has undertaken  ever since man became conscious of his intellectual heritage  india in its own way has made a contri great contribution  in formulating this contribution of india  from the very fact that its genesis are the people its genesis as a people i am specifying here india has had to take note of the thoughts and ideas and actions and behaviours of so many different people so many and uh take note of them sympathetic and uh  what we can say that uh you know uh all embracing spirit that would be the the better word all embracing spirit that means it is the spirit which which welcomes all the cultures and all the concepts all the way of life  and that is what it has that is what has given the basic tone or colour to the uh uh culture of india as representing a great synthesis  so this synthesis word actually i have already mentioned that indian culture it is the synthesis  and it is philosophical as well as spiritual and mystical synthesis as well as practical expression of which is the sum total of the all the philosophy which developed in india with the great ideals of uh the vedas and the upanishads and looming in the background and uh even forming the basis  the aspiration and the way of life as proposed by this culture and  and accepble acceptable to the entire mankind  it can be theoritically put in a one word form  that is uh a few quotations from earlier indian literature actually i am taking this uh literature from from one of the  references  it says thus that which is is one wise men speak of it in many ways  now this i'm specifying here that which is is one and wise men speak of it in many ways  and uh to refrain from all evil to cultivate that which is good to discipline ones own mind ignore evil cultivate graciousness develop universal love and do at your good to all  now when we observe all these quotations we will get a   very very very very clear clear clear   cut crystal clear idea that indian culture it is the base is very broad very broad and that broadness that uh broad single base and different buildings have been constructed and the different religions has have been constructed that different philosophies have been constructed and different concepts have been constructed  now when we study indian culture actually we should look at the geographical influence in the on the development  and evolution of indian culture  now i will i think that uh in studying the cultural development of any country not only india i i'll i'll take it out the general this thing the general country  in studying the cultural development of any country the importance of uh its geographical factors okay it can can hardly be minimised in the early periods of human history geography determine to a great extent to the that the leads and uh uh activities of the people as well as their thought and literature  now i'll tell you geography shaped history largely than uh  as it does even today all over the world though in a different manner man has been independent on the physical facts of nature but he has not been content to live under these limitation  and he has always driven progressively to break through the barriers placed by the nature  and uh history of india is uh no exception to this point  so this interplay what we call it as interplay of uh the forces of geography and human will and genius  actually it is uh indeed very interesting subject and now we'll try to uhm what shall we say evaluate we'll try to uh enhance the influence of indian geography and the culture of its people on the one hand and how the challenge of geography has also been met on the other  now let us come to physical facts  now this physical facts uh which have uh directly or indirectly influenced the history of civilisation of india and it has been the size of the country and its comparative isolation uh  afforded by the himalayas
