when did you go to the u uk  so uh what are you to say about your marxism and things like that  marxism is supposed to one word  uhm  when did you first start reading on marxism actually  well i didn't read at all  i think it was from my locality that i i got the idea uhm because you happened to be with marxist you thought it is a very good ideology  well i didn't know anything about ideology aspects  in the beginning uhm  in my place i mean in our locality there were people who were not who called some some marxists uhm and they had a peculiar way uhm which attracted me  uhm   uhm   uhm   what are that what are that  peculiar way  well you know the so called co-operation uhm  the way they see with the way they treat people uhm  the way they talk the way they behave   uhm   uhm  so this this attracted you  you struct your something yeah uh which which the other ideologists didn't had   yeah  yes  uhm is that   that's what i think  which means that uh if you were brought up in a different  en environment say for example among the christians or among  among the muslims or among among the jains and buddhists say you would have accepted that ideology no no no because you know uh i was among the christians i was among the hindus uhm but neither christianity nor hinduism affected me uhm  only this particular way of living as we call  it is the marxist way way of living it only attracted me  because it had something speciality uhm uhm  something this something that uhm that  that makes it uh distinct from hinduism or christianity i do not like hinduism and i do not like christianity  but i like marxism because it makes a man think about people it makes a man think about his own fellow men and also about his place in the world   uhm   uhm   uhm uhm  well what has marx to say about the things which happened  before eighteen what is it seventeen eighty wh when was marx born seventeen eighty eighty-three eighty-five no no marx was born in the  well i think nineteenth century but marxism marxism began with marxism began with property  marxism lived through uh no no plight okay  uhm  it was a democrator and then that this was followed by  a generation of thinkers and finally uh it came to hegel  hegel had his views  and then marx marx had his own views and he developed into  an ideology  the form that we have now  uh no no   uhm   uhm   one word uh that's fine  well how does a marxism help you in your class uh in your teaching whether it it help you  will it help you to teach shakespeare or uh language   does it help you   well we can look at shakespeare from uh a marxist angle for example in hamlet we can we can  uh take the case of hamlet   hamlet sees the fall of his mother  uhm not of the fault of that particular individual   uhm but as the defect of the world in general  this is the bourgeois approach to human experience  an individual experience cannot be the experience of  everybody in this world uhm  so in that way one cannot according to marxist thinkers  one cannot universalise a on a particular experience  uhm   uhm   uhm  uhm uhm uhm so once you explain a text like this uh  so  when we explain a text like shakespeare uh a shakespearean play the interpretation will be in that way  uhn  one or two words  okay how does it help you in your teaching of language  well there is no answer uhm how does it help you in your family life  talking to your wife and children   family life in family life it helps a lot  uhm  because in indian society uhm which follows one a particular system uhm  i mean a male dominated indian society uhm uh it's rigid uhm  and marxism makes it flexible we uh we are told to look at women in a way we should look at a humanity  uhm   uhm   uhm   uhm   uhm   that's what even feminism says  feminism didn't say anything very different oh feminism may be imitating the marxist  uhm uhm uhm  so why did it fail in russia  why  why did it fail in russia  why did it fail in russia  see it was the fault was not with marxism  it wasn't with it was not with marx it was with the people who were in power   there they were corrupt   if it is applicable to marxism is not applicable to any other ism then  well i'm not aware of any other ism at present why marxism failed in russia is an open question  people have been discussing for a long time  and people once you say that there is something wrong with the people  and nothing wrong with an ideology   know  there wasn't anything wrong with the russian the ideology that russians had  well the people in power were wrong they went wrong  and they and their system two word  and the foreign intervention intervention from the part of  american and all other capitalist nations were also there  they were trying for a long time to destroy the soviet union since its inception in uh in nineteen seventeen  they have been trying for a long time to destroy the set- up well stalin with his iron hands could uh prevent the soviet set-up from destruction  but the later rulers couldn't   if any other ideology one or two words  uhm one word it's okay uhm can a thing be prevented with iron hands  yes many things could be prevented with iron hands means they are prevented for example that was what that was what stalin stalin did in russia uhn  but if they are prevented with iron hands what  or if something is prevented with iron hands  uhn it means uhn the person who prevents  uhn is likely to be again uhn destroyed by iron hands  uhn   uhn   uhn   uhn  suppose someone is going to destroy your society and suppose there is strong person with a very strong force to protect the society well he is doing a good job  he is saving the society  so that was exactly what stalin did in russia   but those who oppose you know the but those who oppose if you destroy them uhn  then it means that you are doing a something good for the society   uhn  yes if the society has a cancer of hand it has to be cut who is going to decide  it is the people  if it is the people then other people had any voice well if is a person goes on destroying everyone communism cannot succeed without the support of the people that was what happened in kerala for example marxsism failed in kerala and west bengal  why did it fail in kerala and west bengal  because it wasn't a popular movement  so communism failed not communism marxism fail in kerala in west bengal also the movement failed  it was because the those people who who were the  opponents of that particular movement uh could not influence people  okay fine means uh if if it failed in russia uhm it means people are not with communism   uhm  people are still with communism in russia  you know the way they uh the way they executed communism  i mean the how they practised communism that was wrong  in what sense it is one word  what sense it is what what those who are in power uhn  then they have something like politbureau yeah and the members of the politbureau ahn infact again become previleged people  uhn   yeah   ahn  ah yeah that was there   and if they become previleged people   corruption you'll find ball is in their hand  corruption  yeah that is that is corruption  it means any ism for that matter ultimately leads to hurt see there is nothing called ultimate  because you know these people went wrong  who went wrong   e e this people those people who were at the helm of affairs   those who were the as you pointed out   ah supporters of communism   ah  not supporters of communism the people who were in power for example in russia  there was gorbochov   but who comes in power  now actually these people  he he accepted the prize who got the nobel prize  no no  uhm why did he accept the nobel prize  what was bernard shaw's reaction when he was awarded the nobel prize  bernard shaw was not a pure communist but this man gorbochov  secretary of the c p s u accepted the noble prize  and who are noble uhm the inventor of uh weapon intended to destroy humanity  marxism stands for humanity  it is for the preservation of humanity  and this man gorbochov accepted a medal meant for the  capitalist profit motivated people  so in that way he was going   uhm   any person who comes into power he comes because of popular support  but once he comes into power he becomes power crazy power greedy he is after more and more power and ultimately what happens he finds everything is centred in him and because of that uh again  he goes at basic principles of one word  see this was not what happened in the soviet union  you may know about uh that perestroika and glasnot  see see and there but there also again what happens we find that members of the politbureau they were previleged people there ah  but with if marx was under   ah   that was not so in the past and the society in which there are one word he wants to have a classless society  and that dream he had  well uh i do not agree  okay fine i think we talk about something else uhm uhm how did you enjoy your stay here  i enjoyed your company very much  why  because you know it is a very different sort of experience because in our state it is uh raining uhm  and it is very unpleasant uhm  we can not sit like this and chat because of the uh tanned  atmosphere and uh chill uhm  so you know in that way and uh again it's a change uhn uhn from the what we have been doing there  now i'm in a different atmosphere uh both physically and mentally  and so uh uh i feel that i can enjoy it   uhm   uhm   uhm  yeah how did you enjoy your stay here  very fine to be here in company of  fine ka matlab  well how fine  because all the while i was in the company of very nice people uhm educated again refined those who have very nice ideas to propogate hm hm hm and  uhm   hm hm hm  well in that way you too have an idea to propogate  you propogate hinduism and he propogates uh islam  islam   islam  uh yes uh you have recently been to your  yeah family yeah what about your children wife  how are they  yeah   yeah  in fact uh my son and daughter they had asked me to buy buy them uhm this thing the sunglasses have they missed you a lot  yeah they did miss me in fact they were waiting for their sunglasses as soon as i went home my son asked me uh asked me for the sunglasses  luckily i bought bought two bought two  for the one the one i bought for my son was very loose  so he always wearing it and slipped on his nose and he was  uh he asked me one or two words putting in back  then when my daughter it fitted very well  so luckily i i could i could bring i can buy them if not i would have had a tough time  then then my daughter wanted some jewels something like that she she cried she wanted jewel somethings like that  then i promised to buy some silk sarees for for my wife from mysore then she she wasn't very keen she said okay fine i think i get good one to buy  then my wife's sister also wanted a saree then two of her sisters also wanted sarees so i  now i have to buy about four six sarees from here  these are going to come about four thousand rupees  i think i'll have to spent  so yes i one or two words you don't worry yes i can get get the whole thing for about three thousand five hundred even that  i'll find  so i'm just thinking what i should do what  but then of course i have a hell of time travelling uh i mean from here to erode and erode to trinavelli and trinavelli to uh once again to ooty  no this is in mysore stays and here and back rather bit too much  for for first time i've been experiencing so much of trouble travelling now after month of travelling sitting in a bus and for two nights continously a bit too much  but then i really think whether whether i should have been taking so much of trouble  this one month uh i mean my i mean my od od not not i mean not being sanctioned till now
