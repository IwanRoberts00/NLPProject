thank you baldev  east bengal  play a long ball  stay
in their position  majeed  chapman  chapman  playing away to
the left sushanu dey  making room for chapman 
""
and here shanti majumdar  sushanu replace vikas panje 
""
few minutes to go 
""
taking attempt to cross from the left 
""
east bengal earn a  flag  kick 
""
""
tushar rakshit  he is leaving for sushanu dey 
""
dey is uh  shirt number six as he positions the ball 
""
he will take that gentle  left footer  which will come 
swabing  away 
""
and ball  by majumdar 
""
up go mohun bagan  gunabir singh 
""
long ball on the right 
""
and  going for a goal kick  in favour of east bengal 
""
mohun bagan  got a couple of positive chances  to forge ahead
 again  they haven't succeeded 
""
sushanu dey  moves here  gently forward 
""
pasha  looks for chapman 
""
he has in the world lot of  uh  coverage he darts very quick
 to this  uh nimble feet 
""
and here is a long range shot   in hindi 
""
 it's  going net across  the stadium  all through the
feroz shah kotla  cricket ground 
""
so  a new ball  has been requisitioned 
""
alok das  who will take the goal kick now  he instead gets
a pass from tanomoi bose 
""
ranjan dey  back to das 
""
referee gulab chauhan blows the whistle  to stop play because
 suddenly the old ball has also come back into the playing arena 
""
now the referee will  throw the ball he drops it 
""
and east bengal move out with sushanu dey 
""
he is moving very acute on to the left  full swing 
""
but the ball in any case had gone over 
""
section of the spectators of the ground level 
""
""
really that place of the ground level you  you just cannot
enjoy  the game of football at that uh  level from that eye view 
than uh perhaps where we are in the commentators box and those on the upper
terraces  laughter 
""
""
 in hindi  
""
""
ranjan dey is header 
""
butia 
""
rakshit 
""
sushanu dey 
""
oh god here the chance  and sanjay majhi  again ideally
positioned  just above the  one word  he succeeds in getting the
angle pass tanomoi bose 
""
but that angle is  a little too much  and the goal just
rolled across  the goal line 
""
few uh metres away from the uprise 
""
so east  bengal's  first chance in this second half  to
have forged ahead 
""
watch it again  sushanu dey  puts the ball ahead  sanjoy
majhi runs in  from the left 
""
goal keeper bose turns  rushing out  and  that angle is
 wide  by a few metres 
""
majumdar leads the ball for majhi 
""
majhi slow satyajit gets the ball 
""
gunabir  gets it to back  down the line 
""
foul committed before the ball rolled out 
""
satyajit  ancheri  doesn't trap cleanly 
""
tarun de  biachung butia  carlton chapman  gunabir
kicks it out 
""
iliyas pasha  for the throwing for east bengal 
""
swaroop das  won't let  vijayan anywhere close 
""
in the air  the  dole  won by alok das 
""
this game is also has its  highs and lows 
""
the sweet and sours  both the teams having missed out one 
opportunities to  mohun bagan as has had  a better share 
""
dulal biswas  butia 
""
butia tackled  by satyajit 
""
 it's  sushanu dey in possession 
""
and  it's  a faulty forward pass  looking for majumdar
""
""
swaroop das  got a very clean ahead  pasha clears 
taken by gunabir  waits for the bounce   it's  too long 
chapman puts it out to play 
""
gunabir  satyajit chatterjee  suryan mark akeel ansari 
""
ancheri  very quick indeed 
""
to ansari ansari again coming down the middle  cannot get
passed 
""
tarun de 
""
ansari  very agile player 
""
""
despite the fact that he looks lean and hungry 
""
""
scrappy struggle on at the moment in the mid field  ball
running left and right a few yards 
""
now in mohun  bagan's  possession 
""
and certainly the crowd doesn't like that 
""
supporters of both the teams  present in thousands 
""
the score board is blank in the nineteen ninety-four durand final
""
""
butia 
""
pasha 
""
yes sushanu dey looking for the open  and  there is nobody
there for that pass  played on the left 
""
nil nil 
""
foul  there uh again  mohun bagan  referee chouhan
going towards  outside right robin ghosh giving him bit of warning 
""
swaroop das it shall be for the free kick 
""
gently chipping it away onto the left flank 
""
stopped by dulal biswas  the big centre 
""
alok das 
""
amitabh chandra 
""
back to das 
""
long ball played 
""
and  akeel ansari in no mood to oblige vijayan is on his own way
 mohun bagan forward  constantly on the run 
""
athanu bhattacharya sensing a bit of danger in vijayan  did the
right thing to come up to the ball 
""
foul was committed by vijayan 
""
here comes the  a free kick 
""
tushar rakshit  dispossessed  biswas backing up 
""
 it's  uh  stretches  
""
twenty-two minutes of the  game gone this is the near outpull
eastern stand 
""
very popular  with the football lovers of the city 
""
oh comes inside the box 
""
here is the chance for chapman he raise for the  second bounce
""
""
alok mukherjee gets to the ball 
""
butia controls back passing to swaroop das  back to butia 
""
and butia  again attempt to pass iliyas pasha who has gone two
yards ahead  acknowledges  to butia  saying well  my fault my
friend in the meanwhile  mohun bagan uh  defender  alok mukherjee
 is on the ground  very close to his own penalty box 
""
time off has been called by the referee 
""
""
and gives a little bit of time for uh  two players to have
""
""
""
a gulp of water 
""
those two the uh touch line is the satyajeet chatterjee 
""
a stretcher being called  alok mukherjee  going to be taken
out  for first aid 
""
chatterjee is throwing 
""
ancheri 
""
pasha  now  chapman gets the ball pasha again 
""
butia  for east bengal  he is  quick  but he hold
himself  but it is given butia moves upon to the right chapman  with
the first time pass 
""
""
and uh  vikas panje 
""
""
uh sanjay majhi that was  unable to control  gunabir
""
""
long ball from vijayan  ansari is there  vijayan is quicker
""
""
again with east bengal  positioned  swaroop das 
iliyas pasha 
""
sushanu dey is ahead  in the dual  ranjan gets the better
 off majumdar 
""
satyajit chatterjee  sets up akeel ansari 
""
square pass  amitabh chandra  there is it for gautam ghosh
 the linesman flag goes up for off side 
""
dulal  mohun bagan playing with ten  the moment they could
be looking for a substitution  for alok mukherjee 
""
but no  it's  not alok mukherjee who is going out  
it's  going to be bernard who is replacing gunabir 
""
so bernard is one of the  many important players today donning
 the colours of the calcutta football club 
""
it started many years ago  with the  iranian  then came
the nigerian  and here is bernand  in position for mohun bagan 
""
east bengal defence kept back 
""
akil ansari too much of time 
""
and ancheri  waits for that opportunity swaroop das rises to
the occasion  but mohun bagan again come up 
""
amitabh chandra now  takes a shot 
""
it goes wide 
""
east bengal goal keeper athanu bhattacharya  takes the kick
""
""
rakshit fails to stop it 
""
ball to ghosh 
""
on the right flank gentle chip for vijayan 
""
vijayan will look for ancheri 
""
pasha gets to it  no he cannot break  the hold of mohun
bagan 
""
this time tarun de aheads it away 
""
butia 
""
east bengal at the receiving end 
""
slowly pull the ball out chapman  resting it  ones the ball
gone how to play 
""
alok mukherjee  back onto the playing arena with the throw in
""
""
satyajeet chatterjee  akeel ansari now 
""
pushing forward  amitabh  to a good over lap 
""
in the ball  and uh reverse bicycle attempt  kick  from
ancheri 
""
""
atanu quiet yet 
""
""
behind it  was not really in position  not in the ideal
situation 
""
so even attempt  trying that reverse  meanwhile a foul
commited 
""
rakshit  playing square to pasha 
""
east bengal fearing to lose  the stint  which was evident
earlier on 
""
tanomoi bose  rolling it for alok das 
""
satyajit chatterjee  up come chandra 
""
ansari 
""
ball to gautam ghosh  dulal biswas in front of him 
""
ansari again  the ball went lose 
""
to the right back chandra 
""
passes it inside the box  headed out 
""
vijayan now  and butia gets it 
""
he will have to gather speed  he will have to give a long ball
through  gives it to majumdar  gives enough of time to the mohun bagan
defender to fall back in position 
""
here comes the cross  but the tall alok das  will have
nothing go pass him 
""
vijayan all over  up and down  he is like the human machine
""
""
he and ancheri really haven't  stop things going for mohun
bagan 
""
swaroop das  and tarun de have been outstanding in the deep
present as indeed iliyas pasha  dulal biswas has been doing a good
overlap on the left for east bengal 
""
here is bernard  back passing you can see he is giving it away
to east bengal 
""
majumdar  chapman  chapman  chatterjee here is bernard
now for mohun bagan 
""
gentle throw to ancheri  ancheri is crossing  but quiet
harmlessly  to atanu bhattacharya 
""
sushanu de 
""
there is a too long  alok das  sanjay majhi  one to one
situation 
""
easily outwitted satyajit  akeel ansari 
""
gautam ghosh  fixed it up closes attack on line  mohun bagan
looking dangerous now 
""
""
what you say to that  ancheri  with just a goal keeper
to beat 
""
with the out step of his left  he doesn't collect  to the
way  and expectations  of  the mohun bagan team man 
""
""
here watch it again  a good piece of workmen gautam ghosh
 and look at ancheri  he is all by himself  vijayan has moved up
""
""
and all ancheri is to do is to kick it away with his right he
prefers his left because  probably it is the defender  coming in his
view 
""
and he had so much of time  and plenty of uh  angle as well
 to beat the goal keeper  wasn't very far 
""
that makes the mess of it 
""
so east bengal survive 
""
nil nil  as we move into the thirty-first minute of the second
half 
""
yes mohun bagans attack again there is going up ancheri 
""
well  it's  a goal  applause   oh  one word
 ancheri gets the first goal for mohun bagan  in the thirty-first
minute of the second half 
""
movements again from the right  warmed it and mohun bagan were
looking dominating  looking threatening  as you watch  gautam
ghosh on the right  pushes the ball forward  and here is  ancheri
 number eleven 
""
this time he is not making any mistake he controls with his left
""
""
he outwit  the deep defence swaroop das as top on the wrong
foot dulal biswas is left behind  and here comes that whacker  which
is  narrowing the angle  beating goalkeeper tanu bhattacharya  and
 it's  one zero for mohun bagan 
""
so luck eventully running out for east bengal 
""
ancheri  scoring the first goal  drawing the first  
two words  in the final of the nineteen ninety-four durand cup 
""
throwing for mohun bagan  and for commentory baldev 
""
""
 in hindi 
""
""
so  it's  going to be mohun bagan for the kick off
with vijayan  back passing 
""
akeel ansari  he is just behind 
""
alok das  ranjan dey 
""
vijayan  gurudas  gunabir singh  just to net 
""
east bengal gain position gunabir again now  to mohun bagan
""
""
""
gunabir is a link man 
""
""
back passing  amitabh chandra  inside the box 
taken by  tarun de 
""
 it's  there sanjoy majhi  give there to vikas panje
""
""
panje looks for carlton chapman 
""
alok mukherjee is there 
""
ranjan dey 
""
alok mukherjee  the long left  vijayan will not get
through it  clear 
""
""
comes to butia 
""
butia for east bengal  in the mohun bagan half 
""
""
short pass 
""
rakshit 
""
tushar rakshit  going into the open he is being tackled  by
 alok das 
""
gautam ghosh  gunabir singh now 
""
mohun bagan in position 
""
up comes amitabh chandra  right back 
""
to his right striker  right  winger   ghosh 
""
tackled by dulal biswas as he crosses 
""
iliyas pasha was the men carrying away from there 
""
satyajit  gunabir again looking for satyajit chatterjee 
""
butia  sushanu dey  on to the left now dulal biswas 
the left back  vikas panje
