question number one forty-three  shri  chitto
basu  
""
( a) whether exports are expected to register a twenty percent
growth rate during the current year  ?
""
( b) whether exports growth rate has declined below the targeted
growth rate during the current financial year  ?
""
( c) if so the details of monthly growth legal rates of export
during the current year in comparison to the corresponding period for the
last year 
""
( d) the reasons for poor growth rate of exports  and ( e) 
the steps taken to remedy the situation 
""
""
sir question one four three  the statement is laid on the
table of the house 
""
""
sir  uh from the statement  it appears  uh that there
has been wide  fluctuations  in the percentage growth rate of exports
 uh during the months  april ninety-four to august ninety  uh
august ninety-four 
""
sir it was  uh sometimes it declined  to six percent  in
august  uh not in july  it declined to six percent  and the next
month it shoot up or it rose to twenty-four point six percent 
""
sir  it   to me  this phenomenon seems to be unusual
 and that also indicates  that there has been  some fundamentally
wrong  and defective method  in  in this uh  in the effort of the
governemnt to  step up the exports 
""
may i know from the honourable minister  what are those
fundamentally wrong and defective  uh uh defects in the system  ?
""
uh if those systems have been  id  uh this  if those
wrong fundamentally wrong defects have been identified  and if identified
growth in the  export in the month of  april 
""
april it was twelve percent    uhn 
""
may june july these three months it was single digit 
""
and thereafter it has started picking up  august september and
october  it has been more than twenty-four twenty-five  twenty-seven
percent     one or two words   if you compare  with
the figure of ninety-two ninety-three and this ninety-three  recording
broken 
""
""
 uhn  
""
""
  one or two words   
""
""
two twenty-nine percent plans 
""
therefore sometimes it happens 
""
one of the reason why it happen during this time  mainly
because the  engineering exports  where one  incentive scheme was
available to them we replaced it  because the gatt subsidy which they
wish to  have to meet the  differences between the  international
price and domestic price that was withdrawn from first of april 
""
so it had some impact and  the contribution of engineering 
goods to the overall market is about twelve percent 
""
because of  local levy our rice  became  less
competitive
""
so the agricultural product particularly rice  that also  uh
rice export came down 
""
because of shortage of cotton we had to  reduce the exports of
cotton 
""
therefore there has been some reasons  one word  analysis we
are making 
""
but  corn case also it happened like that 
""
therefore  i  do hope  that at the end of the year 
there could be two  one word   if i take the average of the first
seven months  the exports goods may not be fourteen fifteen percent 
""
but in this range  from the august onwards it continues  and
one good point  that impact of plague which was thought that it would have
some adverse impact  but from the figure of september october it indicates
that  it is not so 
""
so if this trend continues then we may end with  eighteen
nineteen percent growth
""
but there is nothing  basically fundamentally  wrong in the
system
""
""
sir may i know from the honourable minister  whether 
one or two words  whether it is a fact  that the government of late
has decided to slash down the export target for the year 
""
may i also further know from the honourable minister  uh if not
 what is the target for the current year  and uh  whether it is
also a fact  that uh  the  uh the tariff was on other forms of
resistances  are being increased in our tradition of export market 
particularly in the united states of america 
""
if that is so how does the government propose to remedy that and
attain the target for the current year  ?
""
""
sir so far the target is concerned it is  for the period of
the full five years that is  to co-terminate with the  one word 
""
""
from ninety-two ninety-seven the target was fixed in terms of
percentage  that thirteen point six percent should be the  enhancement
of export in volume terms in us dollar terms it should be around fifteen to
twenty percent 
""
and in absolute terms at the end of the terminal year  our
exports should be thirty-three point five billion us dollar  at the price
level of ninety-one ninety-two 
""
in order to achieve that target first year we could not reach 
ninety-two ninety-three our performance was little more than eighteen billion
us dollars 
""
ninety-three ninety-four it is about  twenty-two billion us
dollars 
""
therefore informally i suggested that if we could reach  a
target of twenty-five twenty-six billion  us dollars  in the year
ninety-four ninety-five
""
perhaps  with fifteen twenty percent step up we may reach the
target at the  terminal year of the 8th plan thirty-three point five
billion 
""
that is the target we have
""
in regard to the question of  having some  uh restrictions of
export of some of the indian products to  us market  one item is 
one word  
""
they have raised some  issues which we are contesting  but in
the first five months  the overall trade  of our exports to usa is
encouraging
""
there has been  of the total  share of us market in our
total exports upto april to  october is about twenty-two percent 
""
""
question number one forty-four 
""
( a)  the number of proposals received and cleared during
nineteen ninety-three ninety-four for direct foreign investment in india
""
( b) the terms and conditions for the foreign investment 
""
( c) whether foreign investment proposals have the potential of
export earnings  and ( d) if so  the anticipated export earnings from
foreign investment during the current five year plan 
""
""
( a) and ( b) during the calender year nineteen ninety-three
and the first ten months of nineteen ninety-four upto october  one
thousand six hundred and fifty proposals for foreign direct investment have
been received and cleared  and receiving foreign direct investment of
 rupees  nineteen thousand six hundred and four point 
three six  crores  
""
proposals are cleared in terms of the new industrial policy
nineteen ninety-one 
""
( c) and ( d) sir yes sir  however the date on amount of export
earnings anticipated from these projects is not centrally maintained 
""
""
mr speaker sir  i have    specica   
specifically   asked for the terms and conditions 
""
the minister has given  a short reply  that there are for
the industrial policy of nineteen ninety-one 
""
speaker sir  it is good sign  that about  twenty
thousand  crores  of foreign investment is coming  in one
year 
""
but at the    si    same   time  it
appears that there are  bad side effects also  because  this
industry  this investment  there is a tendency  to cluster around
 the metropolitan cities 
""
and  because of that  if we take the example of  bombay
itself  the prices of local  flats  have increased from eight
hundred  per square feet to five thousand  rupees  per
square feet because of foreign investors and foreign people coming
""
it is for their executives 
""
on the one hand  and on the other hand  because of lot 
 of lot of  labour employment  there will be growth of uh 
 zhuggis  
""
""
 what is your question mr   ?
""
""
sir i would like to know from the honourable minister 
whether this foreign investors are being encouraged are being asked  to
 set up their industries  in the  newly  uh decided  growth
centres  of countries which are in remote areas 
""
so what is the incentive being given to them  and what  
is   are   the  guidelines for that  ?
""
""
mr speaker sir  in  one word  industrial policy 
statement of july nineteen ninety-one  government had explicitly stated
 that  environmental  protection measures will be taken to ensure
that there is no concentration of industries  in the metropolitan cities
""
""
and that  act is kept in view  while sanctioning approval 
""
so i cannot agree with this opposition  that bombay is  uh
suffering because too much of  invest   foreign direct investment
is coming it is certainly true  that  bombay's  attractiveness as a
financial centre has increased
""
that certainly has put pressure on land prices 
""
i think there is a  way to deal with that
""
we have existing  uh restrictions  uh on land transactions
which in my view  i think are having bad adverse effects
""
well the answer to that is not that we should  uh prevent the
growth of bombay as one of the  worlds'  leading financial centre 
""
""
mr speaker sir  i had also asked  about the quantum of
 export earnings  that may be  obtained  after the full
investement 
""
but it has been answered  that such data  is not being
maintained 
""
my specific query was because  there is a general apprehension
 that the foreign investors  are coming to invest in india 
looking  mainly towards the local domestic market  and  that's
 why  after the domestic market is flooded with  uh the
industrial goods of the    for    foreign  
investors  the local industries will also suffer 
""
that is the apprehension and  that's  why  what measures
are being taken i would like to know  for  uh keeping this foreign
investors  in line with others and for asking them  to export certain
 quota of goods produced  in their industry
""
""
sir  eighty percents of the approvals of foreign direct
investment  since  the introduction of the new policy uptil october
nineteen ninety-four  have been in the priority  sector  which are
 mentioned in the annexe three of the industrial policy statement of july
 ninety-one 
""
these  apparel  oil refineries  electronics  chemical
and food processing  telecommunication  transportation  industrial
 machinery
""
so the  assumption that large segment of this  investment is
going to consumer goods  or nonessential goods  is simply not correct
""
""
even where in certain cases  we    ha   
have   allowed  uh foreign investement in consumer goods 
""
we have ensured  that there will be an obligation on the part of
those investors  to ensure  that their export earnings will match 
the dividends outflow for the period of  one word  
""
also  i would  uh further like to mention  it is not
possible to  uh mention  or to calculate at this stage what will be 
the foreign  ex   foreign exchange earnings 
""
i preside over the empowered committee 
""
my own feeling is  that  is  very large part of proposals
are  directly export oriented and in years to come  you will see the
beneficial effects of this on the countries exports
""
even in terms  of employment uh  here of course i am
mentioning all the industrial enterpreneurs memoranda 
""
this includes the foreign investors and domestic investors 
filed with the secretariat of industrial approvals uptil august nineteen 
uh uptil  sep  october nineteen ninety-four 
""
they show that the total planned investment is  three 
lakhs  twenty-five thousand five hundred  eighty  crores
 
""
and when these projects are completed there would be  a minimum
addition of over three million jobs  to the manufacturing sector
""
so the assumption that these  investments are going to take away
jobs is not correct
""
in fact they are going to add to the  amount of employment in
 indias'  manufacturing sector 
""
""
sir i am grateful to you because you have allowed me sir
""
this is a very important question  and according to government
new industrial policy one thousand six hundred and fifty  uh proposal have
been received and cleared directly  from the  central government 
""
sir may i know from the honourable minister  minister has
admitted that there are some regional  imbalances 
""
sir specially for the eastern region sir the bihar orissa west
bengal and other parts of the country  where the foreign investment flow
is very poor 
""
will the minister see the matter seriously so that  the n r i
can ivest more and more money
""
""
this is uh  this is replied to    sir  just two
minutes back
""
""
 sir  
""
""
sir  sir bihar orrissa and west bengal whether the minister
will take up the matter with the  state government and the foreign
investors so that they can invest more and more money  and specially i
will ask for the agro-based industry sir 
""
""
yes  will you persuade the state government  one word
 
""
""
sir i interact  with the honourable chief ministers of many
states 
""
i find today  uh there is much greater awareness among the state
governments to create the requisite  climate in which investments will
flow  and i believe for examples  uh take the case of the west bengal
 itself
""
west bengal has put out an industrial policy statement which i
think is a forward looking documents
""
today i think west bengal is aggressively seeking foreign
investment
""
honourable somnath chatterjee is not here
""
he had been to australia  he had been to singapore  and when
he was asked the questions about the new industrial policy  he had stated
this is a  a few words   noise 
""
""
mr finance minister  mr finance minister  your  your
praise of his  should not create problem for this house  noise  
a few words  
""
yes mr chavan 
""
""
 aap sunlein to pata chal jata hai  
""
""
mr speaker sir
""
""
 is ka jawab mil gaya 
""
""
the foreign investors commercial board has cleared sixteen
fifty proposals  with twenty thousands co-investments 
""
but sir i complaint  that very few projects have started
functioning and there are no ground taking ceremonies 
""
the foreign investors are complaining that there is still  too
much of red tape 
""
i would like to ask the minister if there is a  machinery
within the government  to monitor the progress of these units 
""
""
sir  the honourable member is right there have been gap in
monitoring  but  in the last few months  we have ensured that the
secretariat of industrial approval in the ministry  of industry  will
monitor  these proposals 
""
with regards to the actual in flow  as against the approval 
which  my colleague had mentioned  in the last three and a half years
the actual  disbursement  has exceeded five thousand  crores
""
""
so it is not entirely correct  that these proposals are being
implemented 
""
total amount of disbursement as of now  as a proportion of
approval  are about twenty-three percent which is not bad  considering
that this policy has been in operations  only for nearly three years
""
""
question hour is over
