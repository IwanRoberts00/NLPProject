after that she hasn't bothered to write a letter to her

lata made a mistake  who asked her to buy a  saree
 for her 
""
""
i know it was not  lata's  idea

""
yeah
""
""
it was  shrinath's  idea
""
""
yeah
""
""
he forced her to buy a  saree  
""
""
uhm 
""
""
because it was her birthday 
""

without pay  to call the  house hold items uh   three of us went
there

 i know you will carry everybodys   problem on
yours  you are totally

you know they are  you know they are like that  they
don't have any  one word

 that's  okay but i have no regrets  so what i am
telling is shrinath shouldn't have wasted precious money

i mean even   they are very like you 
""
""
 buying a  saree    and things like
that 
""
""
even they are like you
