what what how are things one word  well going on and so you your trip was very good it seems yes i think   and did leech remember me very   oh he did yeah he did actually many other people remembered your presence there  yeah  who else did you meet ? ah there was dick alright i don't know what two words yeah yeah dick alright was  around here in bombay haan  no does he remember me ? no i don't know  may be and then you know i contacted uh tomkin  ah allan   allan allan tomkin i telephoned ah  and i even he even wrote to me  ah   haan  because i i was to get some books for the maharashtra board  haan  s s c board  haan  actually i have ordered books   haan  at the last moment haan i thought you know actually it was difficult to get all the books in one place  haan  right  and so there there is a special e l t shop   haan called kelse   haan  yes kelse is very one word  catalogue yes yes  in london  oh then actually you know that is the place from where you can even directly order things  haan  he told me yeah yeah  ah even if you ask for a direct mail order uhm  we will supply  uhm   accha  anyway i have paid and ordered books for s s c board  haan  and he promised to send it at a cost of very marginal charge i see yeah  so many jobs many assignment laughs  oh i know  how was the s s c board meeting ? did you go to this uh meeting on fifteen   fifteen yes ahn ah kadepurkar  see we were we carried work home and this glossary and all that  ahn  uhm  finally there were other changes some rejection uhm uhm  and uh unfortunately there was no electricity nothing you know uhm  there was a total breakdown  uhm  oh i see we were to continue the next day  haan haan  but then there was this holiday and one word strike really so even the s s c board people were going to be away  uh  oh i see so it was the meeting went on upto five o'clock in that sultry heat  and then we i returned home means in the evening   haan haan  was there any any decision about another meeting uh ? yes eighteenth july is the what you call the first language  haan  then third or fourth july the third language third language and uhm this did that uh apte lady come  yes she came  haan haan how how did she of course she was very quiet probably she was just getting to know things yeah haan  and uh she didn't look that one word type   yes that uh   yes  yeah yeah  i was made to believe she would be   worry oh or worried okay uhn well uh everything was fine   i think i think she is not bad  no anyway i don't have to work with her i know i will be in other group i know but even then she didn't seem to be one of those one word though she has lot of weight to throw around  no doubt no doubt i mean may be she has  she is  she is physically very fat   laughs  i see is it no you haven't seen her  i have seen her but i've normally may have  may have put on some more weight in the meanwhile  oh she is quiet bulky yeah  no no no  because it is almost two years since i saw her three  or two or three years  three  ahn  because i i am one of those unfortunate people   haan who have been responsible for uh awarding ph d to laughs so many   haan   ahn i see actually i looked into her thesis also oh i see and that must have been three years ago  haan because i see   and i had gone i felt a lot of consolation looking at her size  laughs  come on and so she has a lot of weight to throw around and she did  laughter  she was good ah and then uh i see some passages were rejected  ah  ahn  and then   from the ones which we had already taken yes yes and then some in some cases  kadepurkar you know see another thing is he is conducting the whole procedure in marathi   oh how unfortunate  oh god  not being audible to half the audience oh it was not it was a messy affair  oh  oh i see so i was telling and wasn't gokhale there  oh he was there ah ha but he did a good job whatever you had assigned to him   i think yeah i think he is we had a session of passages and he had look through ah ha and uh   wa wa was was there more material forthcoming  i'm i'm just e e e  ahn yes yes of course material did come   haan haan  so we have made a fresh selection in the meantime michael west dictionary has come very good very good we all got a copy oh i am glad  yeah  ah so the now we are meeting on the evening itself   haan with some more material  haan  alright and then i told kadepurkar look   haan  we are not going to look at the material one word  endlessly  haan  now you make a final selection and we will start working no no i think that snag is somewhat there  haan  that you know i have i have diagnosed the case but i have got to haan do that unfortunately no   job of coordinating in the sense that people pulling in different direction   haan   haan haan  it looks like one word  like you know the board people ahn want to assert their whatever you know  ahn  it looked like it and they are not able to select  yeah  no no they want to assert there right alright but then uh  i mean i not all not many of them were really academically uh capable of you know isn't it ? yeah i don't know really yeah it's all the you see uh uh what you call  one word was not very wrong yeah  but the way she went about was wrong   that's right anyway yeah the point yes uh   yeah   yeah  but then we have to somehow manage the show  exactly so i i maybe you know atleast in my presence  they somehow seem to agree to many of the things that i  you know one word it looks like that  this time people were opposing  i know  and uh my group is not so bad yeah  except that lalita ghatge everytime she brought a piece   uhn it was one word down to l three   uhn  oh really but she said why don't you all one word include me in l three istead of doing this   haan  i am doing other peoples work ahn she was annoyed  ahn  actually that may be a good really because the small  one word you know ahn and if she can really be of use to l three   ahn  but it doesn't two words material production i don't know  yeah what she is capable of ah yes but you know the whole problem is except wakankar in that group uhm nobody else really knows the job  uhm  i know i know  wakankar has been a school teacher yeah yeah he has uh actually been in the field  ahn  uh in our case uhm we have something called common sense  uhm  uhm in our group oh oh then  a few words yeah we may not have the experience uhn but we have common sense  yeah yeah   uhn  uhn  now your uh gentleman kulkarni didn't turn up  oh i see  yes he didn't turn   he must have had some problem yeah  yes i think somebody was ill  one word   haan  he wrote to me in london  two words he i think his one word    he had gone to bombay yeah somebody was ill and unfortunately she died also actually a relative of his  oh i see  i see and there you know a relative was in london and i was to go and see them  i see  may be anyway yeah   that may the reason i mean in any case i i mean last meting atleast i thought he had got some material and they were accepted  haan  ultimately you know somebody has to do the job anyway  let's see right uh what else how are you ? oh otherwise theek hai then uh uhm you know two words  how is that you take the whole thing   and she asked me no no she is waiting for a letter from the board  i i she asked me did i read letter and uh because  one word he came on the fourteenth no next day  yeah  right on thirteenth right  so raj rajni's brother nothing was right ahn i know  so i said probably it was read at the board level yeah so i said anyway i'll find out i asked to pradhan uhm  so that he watch over there that letter was really  presented uhm so he said whatever we want to tell her we will write over there atleast she must have received but she hasn't received anything from them oh  was the letter read ? yeah letter was read and actually discussed every point was  uh actually mm sort of taken haan  and ultimately this uh see people felt that there is no point in uh  uh you know discussing everything  haan   haan  we just stick to the old decision that she drops out and there is an end of it  yeah  so you know  haan
