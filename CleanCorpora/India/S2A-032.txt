hello  uh recap  we said that  there are atleast
 two schools of thought  when it comes to the scope of economics 
""
one is distribution  one emphasises allocation 
""
depending on the school of thinking your tools of analysis also
differs 
""
for example  when you have distribution as your aim  then your
thinking apparatus will be in this way  where surplus is distributed
between workers and entrepreneurs 
""
whereas when you have allocation as allocation as your aim then your
tools of analysis are calculus 
""
one another distinction 
""
when it comes to  the question of allocation  substitution
between the two things becomes the central issue 
""
alfred marshall  in his principles of economics  if you see
 the eighth edition which was the last one that is there  if he had
lived upto now he would have made further editions of the same thing 
""
it is a very nice book
""
people don't read these days that book 
""
it is very good 
""
for the sheer english language atleast it is worth reading 
""
apart from very perceptive ideas 
""
marshall was a man of tremendous perception 
""
joan robinson once said that he has a  woman's  perception
like that because women are considered to be more perceptive than men  
laughs 
""
uh so  that that  that's  the way she described him 
""
well  if you see in the preface  alfred marshall says 
that the chief merit of this book is the application of the principle of
substitution in every branch of economics  because if you don't have that
substitution  you can't have the maximisation thing 
""
it is an essential part of it 
""
for example if i have a curve like this  i can't take a tangent
""
""
it requires that i have a  a relationship which has a curvature
""
""
here here for example it is diminishing  this but it is
diminishing at a constant rate 
""
whatever i give up in pie  i get in w u and vice versa 
""
whereas here there is an assumption that there is diminishing
marginal rate of substitution 
""
this is at the heart of micro economics 
""
take away this assumption  micro tools are not there 
""
but at this point one another  thing which is normally not refer
to in text books let me  present to you 
""
this assumption of diminishing marginal rate of substitution 
you know it is an assumption  independent of mathematics  independent
of mathematics 
""
for example  take the most important micro foundation that
first chapter the students learn 
""
that is about utility theory  utility maximisation 
""
and when the students come to the classroom we tell them that uh
 that if there are two commodities  and if i  let us say q one 
and q two are the two commodities 
""
and i tell the students  you know that  utility is a
function of the consumption of these two  commodities 
""
right  ?
""
and i make an assumption that the more he consume the more he is
satisfied 
""
more is preferred than less 
""
and we make an assumption that preferences are  transitive 
though you know that it is if a is bigger than b and b is bigger than c than
a is bigger than c and not the other way round
""
this kind of axioms of choice  we teach them  because on that
basis  this is the micro foundage you know micro economic is grounded in
individual behaviour 
""
and those individual behaviour we give in the form of axioms of
choice 
""
right  ?
""
and on the basis of that we try to derive what is known as an
indifference curve or a utility function 
""
first we say   utility is a function of q one and q two
""
""
and in the next page or the next paragraph the text book draws a
picture like this   b b writing 
""
they won't explain how come this equation this picture came 
""
that is why students find it very difficult to understand 
""
and you know sometimes teachers also find it difficult
""
and sometimes you know what happens is the students don't ask
questions luckily  otherwise it will be very   laughter  very
embarassing for the teacher  because from this to this you try your best
 it is near impossible to get that equation
""
i will tell you why 
""
that is what we have to learn in refresher programmes 
""
something on the foundation  because what happens is you know
for twenty years some book comes we teach to our students on the twenty-first
year they say  we have changed this book because this is a wrong book
like that 
""
we also start saying the same thing   laughter 
""
you know in the beginning we didn't ask the question why are we
reading this book and teaching to our students 
""
but before that we try to translate it because we want to have it
everything in  this one
""
and in second  bo  you know it is happening like that as if
knowledge comes  for   from there 
""
it is true knowledge comes from everywhere 
""
but it can also start from here too 
""
and there can be an exchange  that is possible if we look at
these things critically 
""
and therefore if we find that there is some problem  herer 
error here  i'm  not suggesting throw this away 
""
no no far from it 
""
but  remembering that such a kind of a thing is there  it is
not something very perfect 
""
it is imperfect
""
but all knowledge is like that  whether it is physics  or
even mathematics   or even mathematics  uhm
""
i will not go  drag you into that controversy which is a very
interesting one
""
let me come back to this 
""
i am talking of micro theory now  foundations of micro theory
""
""
and in that  micro theory takes allocation as the scope of
economics
""
it takes calculus as the tool for analysis 
""
it assumes about individuals 
""
the major assumption it makes is people are selfish 
""
they don't say  it like this  they say  they
are rational    laughs 
""
because if i say  people are selfish  it looks very
bad  look he is blaming  uh being sales kind of people there we write
 uh people are rational
""
and rational means that i can order my preferences and choose the
best 
""
that capability i have like that 
""
it presumes numeracy  and order 
""
that kind of a capability must be there then only i can  okay
""
""
it assumes like that  and it it has certain a sect of axioms
about preferences  and then we say that utility is a function of
consumption 
""
and then we say  let u bar be the level of utility 
because unless you have this u bar fixed you don't know where is the first
point to this graph  so you take the first point like that  and then
draw this curve  
""
but there is a problem  because suppose  u bar is equal to
hundred   b b writing  right  ?
""
then i get some utility by    consum   
consuming   q one   let's  call it alpha times q one  so
much alpha amount of  satisfaction i get by q one 
""
and then that is the  beta amount of satisfaction i get by
consuming q two 
""
if this total is hundred  then if this fifty that must be fifty
""
""
if this is seventy-five that must be twenty-five 
""
if this is forty-five that must be  know like the it it can't
be  more or less and this hundred can be retained 
""
and if you retain that  hun  don't have that hundred you
can't draw the curve 
""
if you have that hundred  then we find you can try it out any
number of times 
""
then we find that it will be a line like this and not a curvature
like this 
""
but if you don't have a curvature i can't have a tangent 
""
if i don't have a tangent  i don't have a maxima 
""
therefore i need a tangent
""
and if i have to draw this tangent i need to make an assumption 
and economist at the micro level have assumed diminishing marginal rate of
substitution 
""
it is a contradictory assumption to the givens 
""
naturally  the right assumption when you say  u bar is
equal to this  and draw the curve it has to be this way  
""
but we are drawing it this way  for mathematical convenience
""
""
if you take any journal any magazine and start let u be a function
of something twice differentiable
""
we make an assumption 
""
differentiable means drawing of tangent that is finding derivitives
we say in mathematics  but drawing a    capa   
capacity   to draw a tangent 
""
it is  tangent is drawable  such a curve is assumed 
""
if it was natural there was no need for an assumption 
""
we are making an assumption because   this is   there
is a contradict
""
has anybody followed this ?
""
you can ask me questions about all these things 
""
even in between the lecture also you can stop me and ask
""
i will explain any number of times  because this is not there
in books 
""
because striking this out is striking the root of neo-classical
economics 
""
because if you can't draw this you can't draw an isoquant 
""
same principle is true  an isoquant is supposed to give iso
means equal quant means quantity 
""
isoquant means equal quantity
""
if equal quantity is to be there  then substitution should have
been a straight line 
""
because what is happening is  here the x axis  the y axis
 and here is the third axis  this is the utility axis actually 
""
and this length is fixed   that's  why u bar 
""
and what we have here is a projection of this third axis 
because it  it's  a three dimensional picture  drawn in a flat way
""
""
it  it happens to all the artist  when they are painting
 it's  usually three dimensional  but it is written on a flat
surface 
""
but your perception  your understanding is like that
""
so here is a third axis  not seen 
""
 it's  projection  and as long as this is fixed and
straight it this can't be    ano    anything  
other than a straight line 
""
if this is it because scale has to be straight 
""
therefore and it is fixed  and it will be a line like this and
marginal productivity become in fact that is why many people criticise
marginal productivity theory 
""
on several grounds they    criti    criticised
  that 
""
the classical school of thinker don't believe in the marginal
productivity theory as you know  because for them the wage fund is given
 and then the activity of production takes place 
""
whereas for the neo-classical    ec   
economist   the production activity takes place with using those
inputs 
""
and then those inputs are used again on the basis of supply and
demand thing 
""
and brings rational producers and consumers 
""
they will supply and demand in such a manner that the price they
offer     ge    gets   them some return 
""
and that return is  as much as what they contribute to output
""
""
 that's  how the marginal productivity theory comes 
""
with all its difficulty it has a grain of justice 
""
in the sense that  give him what he has contributed 
""
 it's  quite a nice concept  that is why if you give
each person what he has contributed than zero profit condition comes 
""
 that's  how the  one word  theorem comes into
picture 
""
you see how this is micro economic foundation 
""
are you understanding me ?
""
because you can't have your micro economics without this kind of a
thing 
""
one another question 
""
in actual life when you make a choice  the choice is never
like this  because this assumes  that always you buy a combination and
not any one of them 
""
otherwise it would have beeen somewhere in the intercepting 
""
the indifference curve always start from head here  not here
""
""
there is a need that i must have all the time a combination 
that may not be so in actual life  except when women are buying their
 sarees  and they want a matching blouse piece 
""
then only a combination question comes  otherwise  and
moreover a  saree  and a blouse piece are not substitutes 
 laughs  they are compliment  they are compliment and not
substitutes and therefore you can't have law of substitution there
""
yeah  so actual life what happens actual life is you go to a
shop  you ask the various prices and things like that
""
you see the colour this that etcetera and so on 
""
and you know how much you have the money and  and therefore 
then you can order them and take according to you the best 
""
so it will be a line like this  rather than a curve like this
""
""
so but here we have got a choice model  which is uh as if
thing
""
it is a world of its own 
""
we have created a world of choice making 
""
and then we are making assumptions about substitution  and on
the basis of that we are deciding the best using the tools of calculus 
""
this is so in the economics of consumption  economics of
production of international trade any area you go 
""
that is why  professor samuel san when he wrote his book 
 foundations of economic analysis   if you see that
book   you'll  find from page one to the last page  it is
nothing but a systematic application of the theory of differential calculus
""
""
the same tool  the same kind of graph but they are interpreted
 if instead of q one and q two i make it k and l it becomes an isoquant
""
""
and instead of the budget constraint  this becomes a cost line
 isocostline and wherever they are tangential  there it is a question
of commodity substitution  here it will be a question of fact of
substitution 
""
the terminology is different  the context is different but the
tool is the same 
""
at the foundation of economic analysis  you have dispariding of
thinking 
""
that is the first point i wanted to present to you  because if
you say what is at the foundation of micro economic is  this behaviour is
disparidgm
