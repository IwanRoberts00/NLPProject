one of this that is some should know in the true  kshatriya spirit  so here is well provided paradise  so that he need not had any two words  and he could not even believe you see that is somebody  shailender one word life he was brought up  within the premises of the palace  gautama breathed all the sin that a younger prince should have  that is on the previlege within the palace  the father could prepare to see that his son never went out of the palace  once he went out of the palace he would naturally can't face the scene the stark realities of this mundane world  he detected the suffering sickness decay and death for about twenty or thirty-two years it's not clearly mentioned gautama lived secluded within the palace  when he came of age he married a princess known as yashodra and he had a son also by her who became  came to be known as rahul  now buddha was born with a mission  destiny must have its own course  and it it open at a proper time  his trusted charioteer known as channa who had been instructed by the father not to take the prince outside the palace premise  he requested channa let us have a ride outside the palace to see the world outside  channa he must break away the path the life of buddha  he reeling to his pressure of the prince  he took him outside the palace  of course his wahan a coach or riding properly on a horse chariot was going he found some people  suffering with intense pain  naturally gautama asked what is this that i see ? this is called suffering  suffering due to various causes physical mental  psychological problems may be there  but physical suffering is the most notable one  that created impression on him  so he came back  taking that impression within his mind  another day when he went around the city kapilavastu  he saw sickness people suffering from different types of diseases  buddha never knew what disease was  so he asked his charioteer what is this that i am seeing ?  this is known as sickness disease  people are subjected to various kinds of disease  this is a second impression that gautama had  he comes back to palace  he came over this first suffering then sickness  then after a few days again he went he went outside on his ride he saw an old man tottering on his walking stick  a new sight for him  what is this ? he said it is called old age  and everyone is subject to this old age  the lone and sinister old age they may be young people who would have a difficult match but normally people grow from  balavastha one word then praudha  then old age then dehant that is the usual procedure  so this is a third impression old age yeah that gautama had on his mind  he came back to his palace  lot of tremendous disturbance was there  seeing one after another  finally one day when he went out he saw a dead body being carried to the cremation ground   what is this ? he asked channa  this is called death  everyone is one word died none can escape death what is happen they should be either buried or cremated and there is an end of his physical body  so these four impressions suffering sickness oldage  and death led such a strong impression on the mind of buddha  that he went and went back to his palace  then he one word his life  i must find an answer to this  how to escape this four-fold  transformation siddhant one word not be every one as it called  that to turning point in the life of buddha in the life of gautama  finally one day he decides that he will leave  his hearth and home his young wife and a new born baby rahul  in search of that truth which will bring solace to humanity which will solve the problems of this four kinds of  changes that every body is subject to  that night when he decided is called mahaesha  very significant word  he saw his wife lying on the bed took a last glance at his wife and the child rahula also who happened to be the future prince  and left the palace  it is said when gautama took the decision to leave everything in search of truth the jataka stories that is the buddhist scriptures bore ecstacies in describing this event of buddha leaving the palace  there is mentioned that god rejoiced  buddha leaves palace with his channa that trusted charioteer to the forest  and once they enter the forest he removed all his dress the princely dress the outfit the princely outfit that he had  handed them over to channa and shaved off his hair and wore simple clothes ordinary simple clothes  this all is a very interesting anecdote  channa returning to the palace without buddha without gautama  but then that was the prince's order he had to carry out  then began the search for truth  because he he was about thirty years of age at that time  then buddh uh gautama left his palace he was about thirty years  for ten long years he underwent all kinds of austerities  hardships privations trial and humiliations mortification of his own body  subjected himself to various kinds of disciplines physical and mental  in this context i must tell you that buddha was not a buddhist in the sense that we understand him today because  buddhism came into existence much later probably a couple of centuries later on after the demise of buddha  but at the time of gautama he then lectures in religious schools the various systems that we have had from that on various  kinds prescribing various types of disciplines  so he goes to various teachers seeking their advise and subjecting himself to various kinds of disciplines  for ten long years but at the end nothing happened only his physical frame became emaciated  he was losing strength proper food was not given to the body for the maintenance of the body  then he decides this extreme two extremes one we refer to from first term when he was brought up on the lap of luxury that was one extreme  so those important years he was also twenty-five years  then in ten years subjected to himself to extreme poverty privation trials and humiliation the other extreme  these two extreme should be avoided that realisation came to him  in the meantime he was wandering in search of truth  search of illumination search of acknowledge that such a feat that passes or understanding  by the time he comes to buddha gaya now it is known as bodhgaya  he two words  by the time he came to bodhgaya he was about forty years of age  he had decided that he will give up this two extremes then he followed that one better example that is given to us in the geeta in the sixth chapter seventeenth verse a few words in sanskrit  food and recreation yukta should be moderated  no extremes  not over eating hence feeling all its energy in digesting that food  we know our experience tells if by chance we overeat  how much of energy is lost in digesting that food  you feel so lazy whole day  so long back the centuries before buddha gave on the same  shri krishna has told us in the geeta  avoid all extremes a few words in sanskrit he created in excessiveness  but it should be moderate avoid all extremes a few words in sanskrit  even in our activity intense activity should be avoided  and lack of activity also should be avoided  but moderation everything should be moderate that is the lesson that shri krishna has given to us centuries before the time of buddha  a few words in sanskrit  even in sleep and keeping awake a few words in sanskrit this called yoga  moderation never means what happens it destroys all kinds of dukha suffering  so by the time buddha reached the present bodhgaya  some of you may have glance for forty-five forty-three forty-four years ago  nineteen forty-three more than fifty years now i did go there it has developed much later now  many new things have been added  in the last century the whole temple was covered by a big  one word  one english collector of that district it is in bihar  two words by name he just by chance he was escavating something he found  the tip of a brick temple and he asked these people to remove a old temple that is there in bodhgaya two words  temple  here if you view by the side or the back of the temple  there is we have a ashoka tree peepal tree  whether it is the same ashoka tree that buddha meditated under we do not know  it cannot be because two thousand five hundred years a tree cannot  survive  but its descendents it has also a very these are a very good tree  so when i because of sentiment associated with it a few leaves i brought from that tree dry leaves that fallen  so that was again on the same vaisakha purnima  day he reached that place  in the afternoon one village dame sujata by name brought a little payas for him  buddha accepted it  we should think that sujata is blessed because she offered that payas to buddha  and that gave him some strength it is called which had some miracle after years of mortification  after having taken that payas he comes to that bodhi tree there was no temple at that time only tree was there he sat under the tree it's called the bodhi vriksha or bodh tree in english it is called  some some descendents of that bodhi tree have gone in different parts where ever buddhism spread  with deep determination he sat under the tree  one of the most glorious verses that i have cone across in sanskrit is this that buddha sat under the tree with deep resolution having had taken that payas he sat under the bodhi tree  he has an hymn a few words in sanskrit  in this seize let my body triumph and my skin bones and flesh may be destroyed  first a skin a few words in sanskrit let it be destroyed   a few words in sanskrit untill i came that knowledge  which is difficult durlabh it has never been impossible  impossible means it can never be attained  with a difficult one word that is true spiritual life itself is difficult  but nobody has said it is impossible   a few words in sanskrit for beyonds and beyonds people have rights and then they have obtained until i sent that illumination   a few words in sanskrit i shall not budge an inch from this seat  this is the determination with which buddha gautama sat under the tree in the event  that is the story comes a whole night marahans  temptations of various kinds first sensation then terror they go side by side  but no yielding for any of these neither sensation nor terror because he had a mission to fulfill  gautama had to become buddha so he never afraid of every quarter change scene is changing and mara  became languish  and by heard on gautama who sat under the tree became buddha  buddha means the enlightened one  he became fully enlightened  now after this he starts for it is said in the jataka stories that he got up from the seat coming round  now as symbolically they have made stone lotuses as he came up from that seat every step that he put there was a lotus coming under his foot  until he started going out  then starts his spiritual mission  for forty years the first forty years with the twenty-five years happy luxurous life marriage birth of a son  and the determination to leave everything  and in search of truth for ten years hard rigorous spiritual practices  then again his bodhi this illumination that happen  on the same day vaisakha purnima just exactly forty years later  five hundred and sixty minus forty may be about five hundred seventy in b c  then he went on preaching to people about this meaningless  it is a performing yagas shileniyas  because at that time parnivantkas at your  one word they were spending all there energy in performing  yagas shileniyas  it is mentioned in the vedas in sanskrit  you have a desire if you want to attained heaven you have to perform yaga yaga yagnya did not go to heaven you have to perform sacrifice  but all that is meaningless much later thousand year later from shankara lasting life refer to shankara also who was also against the performance of yaga sheliniyas  it was more after the upanishadic way of life  buddha also comes to the same tradition same upanishadic tradition he was never against this upanishadic tradition  but his whole concept that is vital core what he calls  nirvan  he coined a new word  in our hindu tradition also we have this type of  brahma nirvana vrikchse  brahma the highest knowledge it's also called  nirvan  if attained brahma nirvan such a blowing up  because a kind of a negative concept but shankara gives us positive concept content to this idea or concept of the highest realisation  so as he was preaching men and women came this is one notable feature in buddhism  he made no distinction of caste community race or sex  men and women are all accepted and became monks and nuns in course of time  not during the time of buddha but during the late
