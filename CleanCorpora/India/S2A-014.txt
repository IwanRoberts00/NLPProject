""
""
well alternatively we also have the  women's  long jump
 at the other end but we shift our attention  to the  men's 
eight hundred metres  all is set now  and uh 
""
""
just look out for that man in the full black  william tanui
""
""
if natalia  dukhnova  uh went full ahead after the first lap
in full red 
""
this time it is william tanui  in full black
""
but mind you  there are five kenyans in this race
""
you really can't say  about these kenyans 
""
they just run and run 
""
there goes the start   interruption 
""
the first hundred  on the track and then shifting it by  when
you cut into  the first lane 
""
william tanui  in third position at the moment 
""
two kenyans in the track 
""
but looks like vincent malakawen  and henry lebo 
""
but running very easily  is william tanui the man in full black
  applause   interruption 
""
you see that old bunch of there  and here is avtaar singh coming
in there on your screen   interruption 
""
first is the kenyan  interruption  
""
now look in second position william tanui   interruption
""
""
here is they all running crowded   interruption 
""
now that is william tanui now 
""
two hundred metres  free  row 
""
another kenyan in the front  let's  see now  whether 
it's  going to be  like kiptanui  who was beaten but this time 
william tanui  still there   applaud   interruption 
""
oh the great fight between three kenyan 
""
william tanui has fallen behind  and another one has come
through  at number one one two   interruption 
""
robert kibbet of kenya  was a surprise winner here 
""
so as uh  they say in kenya one runner after another comes
through  so here is another champion coming 
""
now look at this robert kibbet coming from behind 
""
he was in third position  and  he stretch right through 
and went on  to first position 
""
william tanui  came in too late 
""
he did manage to come through  to second position  but kibbet
had made  the break through at the right moment  and thus  robert
kibbet the winner  of the eight hundred metres 
""
""
but you couldn't have asked for any finer isn't it john ?
""
""
oh yeah  it's  because  uh they keep saying in the
interview last evening  both this uh  uh kip tanui and  william
tanui  that you can never say in kenya  who can win and who can't 
today and who can win tomorrow 
""
""
well  that's  the stuff that the kenyans are made up of
 and there they are the three of them  acknowledging the greetings
from uh this very hospitable crowd here in pune 
""
i think they will be acknowledging everything that has been good
 and i think uh  john this has been the best race of the day so far
""
""
""
yes this was a very good race because uh  he came right
from the outside and came in 
""
""
well what is it that uh makes the kenyans uh  keep on
clicking in these races  ?
""
""
now   recording broken 
""
""
well  it's  going to be steve watt continue  from
the score board end 
""
""
 men's  javeline uh  as we welcome you viewers uh
 back  to the shiv chhattrapati sports complex  and here is 
vladimir dubrovschik  he has the personal best of sixty-eight point eight
zero metres  and  he's  really gone mad  because  he
obviously has  shown he can be a discus  to the best stretch 
""
""
well john i think  he's  happy because  that's 
what happened  he won  look likes the discus edging out  the hot
favourite jurgen schultz of germany  and over the last ten to fifteen
minutes he has been full of joy and ecstasy 
""
 he's  taken out two or three  of his t-shirts and given
them away to the crowd 
""
and the joy is written clearly all over his face and body 
""
for a man of his stature  top as he is now  he is doing the
laugh of honour  vladimir dubrovschik of the ukraine 
""
and what a happy moment this is for him 
""
well the germans have been a  great favourite in the discus but
uh   it's  uh an upset for uh  the germans here 
""
jurgen schultz  beaten by his own game  toto of mix  one
word  
""
and that that will be victory ceremony for the  men's  long
jump
""
the winner  once more a chinese lan jong of china  clearing
seven point eight two metres 
""
so the chines uh  bringing a few surprises john 
""
in second spot vladimir   maleiwind  of turkmenistan 
seven point seven seven metres 
""
and uh taking the bronze uh  the jumper from oman  ahmed 
obed bashir  seven point four five metres 
""
so the uh chinese uh  continuing with the success story here at
the  shri shiv chattrapati sports city  winning one more gold medal
""
""
and uh  that's  the finish of the  women's  fifteen
hundred metres  which uh  ended in victory for the irish girl sonia
 o'sullivan   the hot favourite for this event as john describe
earlier on 
""
""
yeah sonia  o'sullivan  has  has gone to win 
but i would like to  after  since she has is in the way to winning
streak at the moment 
""
and you can see what a lovely play she  over through to roja
kutty  and then third to run  and of course  two words  she was
the only challenger for her  and she kept away   two words  as
well 
""
that was the  women's  
""
""
seven of them in contention 
""
three from india  jagjit singh   tony  verghese and
uh  satbir singh 
""
the uh  national record is in the name of satbir singh
seventy-five point two two
""
 let's  pick up action in the  women's  uh  uh
long jump 
""
elena  govorou  of ukraine   she's  on your
screen now 
""
the uh   women's  uh long jump record the uh  meet
record in the name of lalita brednaya of russia  six point eight nine
""
 let's  get back to  men's  juveline again 
""
two of the field events uh  going on at uh the same time  at
different parts of the ground 
""
the  women's  uh  long jump and uh  the  men's
 juveline 
""
well we coming on late 
""
""
the other meet is coming on now  first will be the b wing
""
""
and then we come on straight carl lewis  emmanuel tuffour of
ghana 
""
""
well while we are at the  men's  juveline  uh we
and uh while we  did describe about merelene ottey holding on to uh 
the  women's  two hundred metres  where uh  it was expected from
her 
""
there has been an upset in  men's  discus which we announced
earlier on  and uh  the winner there  the official result having
come in  is uh vladimir  dubrovschik  in eight metres 
""
and uh  he upset the apple cart  with uh nick winnie of
irelend finishing second  sixty-one point nine two  and uh the german
the world record holder jurgen schultz  uh in third spot sixty-one point
three eight 
""
so on a day when merelene ottey john  held on to  the
expected title jurgen schultz has lost out
""
""
jurgen schultz uh  did say  but he was not in the best
streak of the moment  and he was not throwing  the seventy-four which
he felt  when he set the world record in nineteen  eighty-seven 
but uh he himself  did not dream that he could throw seventy-four point
zero eight 
""
and even convinced i beleive  for the judges were lying when
they said that that was the world record 
""
but jurgen schultz as i said earlier  is alternating  between
 grip practices for  the discus throw and also  in his sports
promotion business  because as he said i want  to get money  because
uh  he doesn't make as much money  as the carl lewis or sir jack 
whooker  
""
""
well john uh the action is now centred at uh 
""
""
the hundred metre
""
""
 that's  right  the blue ribband of uh  all
athletic races  and the name which is uh  going to be there where all
eyes are going to be focused  is uh the  eight times olympic gold
medal winner  and uh the same time that he won the world championship 
uh carlson fredrick lewis better known to all of us as  carl lewis 
""
he is uh drawn in the  second of the  uh  men's  one
hundred metres 
""
the uh    you have  permit meet record  for the
hundred metres in the name of uh thomas jefferson  another fine u s
athlete  set way back in nineteen eighty-nine  ten point two zero 
""
and uh the indian record in the name of r  uh gyanshekaran 
uh ten point six zero 
""
""
 you have  
""
""
now in the first hundred metres which is schedule for now 
you have two oman runners  and in lane  three you have gurvinder singh
 of india 
""
now these 
""
and i was telling you uh you have  two runners from oman 
in this first  three hundred metres race 
""
and these oman runners  are  good uh for  the four
hundred eight hundred fifteen hundred  but uh these days uh  in the
middle east we are having some of the best best coaches from abroad  to
push their talent 
""
but you could expect uh  some of these boys  to do well 
in uh the asian games  at hiroshima 
""
this uh first race in the hundred metres of course  will be uh
 just uh  a teaser for you  because in the next one  comes carl
lewis patrick stevens emmanuel tuffour  donald and sherry  all great
sprinters  today on the grand prix circuit 
""
patrick stevens of belgium 
""
""
well john if you remember uh  uh there can always be an
upset if you remember one of the first  but uh beaten by a lesser known
 austr    austria  
""
""
  aust   
""
""
as uh  i as carl himself said   i know that the
contest is going to be very good  
""
and this boy from ghana  emmanuel tuffour running in lane five
 for  that kick  ten 
""
and here is the victory ceremony for  the eight hundred metres
""
you have shiny wilson  the  the former record holder for the
event which she  lost when jyoti mohit sikdar set the new record  at
 the european circuit 
""
""
well there is the winner of the  women's  eight hundred
metres  natalia dukhnova of uh  belarus  two minutes zero two
point one zero second 
""
and what a fine run she had  sporting the uh  very famous
sunglasses  uh which has now become a part of international sport 
whether  it's  athletics  football or cricket 
""
shiny wilson uh  second with two minutes o two point three two
""
""
and uh shiny gets a  a warm kiss from uh  the one who
finished first in the race 
""
and  that's  the bronze medal winner  uh cydesen karen of
denmark  the dane winning uh  coming in third spot  two minutes o
seven point three one second 
""
""
all squad there in fact everybody thinking  as gurvinder
singh in the screen  from india 
""
he is one  of the  upcoming hundred metres runners 
""
""
john and this reminds us of uh the man who lit the  flame
today  uh the man who held his national  record and the title for a
long long time  adil somadiwala isn't it ?
""
""
yeah 
""
""
we have a chinese  in lane five 
""
""
now  let's  see what this  chinese man is going to
do  because already  the chinese have shown  even with the very
few that have come out to  pune here  that uh they have some good
stuff in their country  even present uh  well uh  they are going to
do or not uh  well uh  i mean uh they have not got of course the best
from out there 
""

christly incidently  is  also from jamaica but now  uh  is uh
settled in  england 
""
and a good  one word  citizen today 
""
""
and another name which we can't forget is baleri bourgoef
with one hundred and two hundred 
""
""
yeah  the only russian to  be a sprinter which gone
 who has become immortal  because he came out at the time when the
american  were in full sway 
""
""
rajiv balakrishnan from india 
""
he is running in the hundred metres here 
""
""
rajiv balakrishnan is not on the list of runners  but uh
 he is doing the hundred metres free race 
""
and  let's  see  if he  he could come in because he
is training more for the two hundred metres  because uh if  the indian
team goes to  hiroshima then rajiv balakrishnan  will run both the 
fou  hundred four hundred metres relay  as well as the four hundred
metres uh 
""
so  let's  see if he can win  this the hundred metres
free race uh  in the national games here   interruption 
""
 that's  one  close start rajiv balakrishnan  and
 that's  gurvinder singh in your  feature screen 
""
the chinese there  also 
""
""
john and the tension    lying   it's  not
only on the athletes but everyone out here as well 
""
""
 lying  
""
""
yeah the hundred metre is always does that to everybody 
because that is the race everybody looks ahead to  and uh  of course
that is  a day of great spectacle  in any athletic meeting 
anywhere in the world 
""
there is another chinese  in the second hundred metres race as
well  and that is that tall person  standing behind  in second lane
 waiting for his  trial to come over 
""
and the chinese in the first year  in this race  you can
see in lane two 
""

fight between  korea yes it is  looks like that the chinese  china
athlete who has won 
""
and he did it so nicely  one hundred and ten 
""
""
strangely enough his name is not on the list  of
competitors
""
""

""
""
that was rajiv balkrishnan in the blue shorts  one seven
five 
""
and here is the replay 
""
on the first lane is uh   al maksai saidewoma   and
