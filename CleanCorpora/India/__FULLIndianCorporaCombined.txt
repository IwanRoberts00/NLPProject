livelihood lost  because of this time uhm that flood situation  uhm  yeah flood cyclone affected cyclone effects  uh yeah  uh i think  but that death toll is going up for sometime  do you have any this statistical uh data  approximately see i have no idea about that but i saw in paper  yeah yeah  uh nearly four hundred or five hundred members are dead  five hundred members  four five hundred members in flood situation uh because they don't know they don't know how to escape from uh flood because this is first time flood came in raelsima district  is it is it the first time  in raelsima district oh near the coastal area every yeah time it will come  yeah  so what is the useful uh ways to  that flood every year they will uh  in coastal area in manglore and uh  cyclone blast srikakulam coastal area will come cyclone but uh first time raelsima district  so raelsima is also in coastal area but uh in karnataka not always this is first time  so that's why they don't know how to escape  a few words any crop was in the  yeah total so many villages are  drowned in the flood uh drowned in the flood   uh that how many days it was uh lasting this cyclone uh effects no nearly one week  one week uh nearly one week uhm one week  so many bunds and uh  did you get to the state get any relief from other states ? no uh tamil nadu government they gave some relief  fund  what  one one a few words  prime minister uh sorry karna chief minister relief fund  karna  uh like uh uh as well as hear in the news that uh uh deve gawda also  haan central government  two words some fifty crores rupees  fifty crore rupees  we got the  as you said uh that death toll and everything did it a few words sufficient to meet that  uh  the destruction caused uh that cyclones  uhm  a few words might be large area that the population in the  deve gowda saw the situation by helicopter ah ha ha he ca came he came to one word one village when did he come  ah he came in third week  third week third week of this month and we saw him in helicopter  in the one word ordered fifty crore rupees  as a relief relief fund   it is released or uh  released just only in uh one word   uh released released fifty crores rupees  so some industrialists and uh some business magnates in andhra pradesh  ah ha they are also providing ah providing some aid to this flood victims  oh  so anyhow it is very horrible situation in andhra pradesh  so one word it happens almost every year every year but this is first time in raelsima district  ahm  this is very horrible this time it is haan  raelsima   haan  any cine actors uh contributed anything for the heavy toll   but  uhm well they are  two words  they are the hard workers uh two words  big money they are enjoying all the facilities yes it is  but uh i think

cine films  ah nagarjuna is uh  leading actor leading actor uhm  but uh uh since two three years two years his films are good  uhm uhm   that's why so that uh type of uh blind uh support you give him for his  uhm the a few words  yeah  yeah you see his last films also last years uhm yesteryears also you may find something that  films are and i think so good uhm  because we are supporting him blindly we may see his uh even uh this uh one word films uhm or uh a few words  uhm so this uh this type of craziness is now wrong  coming down uhm  so i think uh people are realising or uh something bored with this uh peoples act all  so that they are getting new faces ah new faces and so new faces they are they have to know this whole business and uh  yes actually cine fightings also fightings and stories all are old movie types types old movie stories that's why  south indians one word  uh south indian one word  and they want to build a picture ah ha uh this low budget not high budget high

accha what was that uh uh what was that mr mane telling you that this time when they've sports what do they want your help for  as a common referee  as a to  ah what do you've to do   to  look over the things  what things uh  what things  uh  to know that everything is going properly or not  no but for what programme or  for sports their inter-school or intership or what   you're talking a few words  national style you see  ah okay  so inter-school sports when are they normally i don't know  so he wanted your help  so funny you know he he's so much faith in your expertise  and he he was saying i don't bother you  you were saying that you need that qualification was n i l and he was saying we don't bother about all such things   laughs   n i l  so anyway but yesterday we had our inspection my god so tiring  we really had a tough time  uhm you don't have real qualified teachers  but you you that is the biggest problem in your school  you don't get good   don't talk your teachers are all bastard teachers  there is no hope  you want to have a real good school here  you don't get good teachers over here   there is no professional approach towards teaching  but that really we learnt in bombay  how to be a professional in your jobs   that's it shireen she was excellent at that  she was very good  she would just you know even even when there was bickering between teachers and all that  if ever we went to her with our problems ke  so and so is you know she used to say just rise above all that  because if you just rise above all that just forget about it  you don't be affected by it and don't even try to solve it just rise above it that means you can't have an understand but  you should keep that others you have to solve that problem of with management  you should not neglect your teaching uh you know no but i believe that we people are not   you should be honest with what you're  teaching  not just because i'm i a s i'm appointed as a teacher i have to go there teach there and teach them for thirty thirty-five minutes whatever is in the book you know  most of your teachers are not well prepared   that's true they should do the preparation at home i feel its for school teaching you know all the people who come there half of them are the one who you know haven't been able to get in anywhere else so they've come into this profession look being a once you enter the class na the teacher doesn't have to open a book if she is well prepared she doesn't have to open a book  being a   no  she can carry on for one hour also without opening a book  if she's so thorough   they   and it is not a question of you being properly educated and you qualify if you're honest with it then you can do it and teaching is a knack you can be very qualified but you can't communicate  you can't have a rapport with the children you just can't communicate what you're  trying to say   that's true  what is b ed  those teachers are trained to teach   they're trained  that gives you very basic outline you know on how to go about things  that basic line you have the   but that is also but that is also important  na how to go about things if you don't know how to go about things then what you are going to do  uhm that's true that's the stupid little boon which government has  imposed on everybody  and we've a so all the management should follow the this guidelines  your problem is known you can get qualified english teachers  our management   trained english teachers english but not english teacher english speaking  but  english speaking they all educated through look marathi medium  so we can't we don't have to one-word   look   you you can get it  but then  look if you want the best then you've to give out the best also  they can you know how to  put your hands into your pocket and shell out the money we just want teachers teachers teachers don't run like that  come on give them proper salaries no  no what happens you know they know how to speak english but they don't have the colloquial expressions  they just you know corrupt they are they talk in very quaint uh in a very quaint fashion  they were it's not a sort of and they don't have vocabulary is so limited that they can't express one thing into two other ways also  but then you have to use your expressions facial expressions to explain things   you've to have a good command over the language if you in in an english medium school  no that way in a in any language then you should have a command yes if you want to teach just look  besides doing school work if you're fall falling short on that particular language then you've to work on that  lang language yeah you've to work at it  but then what happens once you get a get set job they're  okay then they become a bit uh  uh you've to do your self-improvement  how many people really believe in that and how many are really ready to do that  how is ajinkya today i wonder he got temperature  body is slightly warm  what shall we do now his exams are getting over by the end of this month  then he is on holiday  and i have exams so how we're going to sort out that problem  one month my work is almost getting over so when by this weekend  by this weekend  then you're totally free 
uhm hello ashokji i'm nice here because i'm  having nice time in your department   it's really a pleasure to me that i came from a distant place orissa   i'm really having uh the time which usually can't be recalled so easily uh when i go back to orissa  i had been to pandarpur cough last sunday and uh what i saw there is uh a temple of uh vithalji you know usually the people of maharashtra they call that uhm vithal vithal and rukmani   vithal pandurang  and one thing i'm surprised to find vithalji standing alone in such a way on a piece of uh brick yeah  that that reminds me of the beech you know they call it uh surely a brick uh uhm is thrown by the disciple maybe the maybe the person who was this vithal previously and they ordered vithal to stand on the brick  yeah  that is pundalik pundalik his devotee  pundalik  yes yes uh exactly  i don't know much about the legend yeah  but what uh is so surprising there in the temple is that i found rukmani standing alone  vithalji has never given any sort of uh importance to a woman called rukmani  no that's not the case what happened you know pundalik yeah that's  bhakta of vithala uhm or panduranga  uhm uhm  panduranga once visited pundali pundalika's house you know yes and pundalika was so engrossed and busy   ah ha serving his parents you know yeah yeah  and panduranga as he went there you know uhm  panduranga wanted pundalika to pay attention to him ah  but pundalika being a very obedient son uhm and very again we can say devoted to his uh parents you know he had no time  to pay attention to vithal vithal so he threw a piece of brick you know and made him stand or made him wait there until he finishes his service service to his parents  yeah   uhm   uhm uhm   yes   uhm   yeah yeah   uhm   ah   uhm   parents   vithal yeah   the work  so that's why that time rukmani  didn't accompany pundalika did not accompany panduranga  and so panduranga the vithal is shown to be alone over there  so faithful it seems   vithalji vithal yes  that is standing on the brick but in other parts of the temple you will find rukmani along with yeah vithal yes yes  but for this particular event ah particular episode you know vithala is alone over there because he alone visited   pundalika's house  yeah   yes yes   ah  but there i found you know uhm the feminine power is hot there when i'm being a female yeah i found uh vithal is selfish enough not to allow rukmani proper position  yeah  i found desciples making long line yeah to visit vithal whereas nobody was here before the temple of rukmani  so it shocked me really  uhm   yeah   yeah   yeah  no the same thing you know the same thing had happened in orissa also yeah   we've the jagannath temple in puri  shrikhetra yeah which usually call it   yeah   yeah puri   yeah  $a> and uh whenever jagannath which is brought there balabhadra comes out in the cart festival ah we found that uh both of them both the brothers they accompany uhm their sister subhadra uhm and on the other hand we find laxmi uhm stays alone inside the temple   ah   uhm  so really i found gods in general they become selfish when  uh they find uh the importance of the disciples must be given to the gods  but we've also temples called mahalaxmi temple   yeah in our sambalpuri yeah we've  samleshwari mandir and where usually we find godesses are worshipped   yeah   yeah  yeah now and uh what happens   haan if it happens to be a temple of panduranga mainly  yeah so it's very natural that focus is on panduranga when it's a temple of mahalaxmi uhm you find mahalaxmi only there not her husband that is in tirupati  and uh   haan   yeah   uhm  yeah tirupati is supposed to be her husband you know  yes but nowhere you find his shrine in the temple   uhm that is tirupati shrine in the temple  her husband   yes   uhm  uhm so it is not a kind of injustice or just subordinating the role of a woman or so  these gods and goddesses you know uhm so once it is a temple of mahalaxmi mahalaxmi has to be in focus  uhm  yes yes when it is temple of panduranga or the vithala vithala has to be in focus okay it depends upon the name name  it depends on  jagannath temple so jagannath they are no laxmi  jagannath  and in those days you know there was nothing like feminism yeah laughter of course you're right so if i bring in that kind of interpretation over here  laughs that's right  you've really i'm sorry in a very good way  you've convinced me and uh i found the climate of  maharashtra is very good people are nice soft spoken well behaved and uh  exactly like the oriya people  the dishes are also uh quite similar to the yeah  dishes of orissa and the system you know the culture the culture differs a little bit i think  yeah  oh it has to differ you know  but as you say that is uh dishes that is food staple food   uhm so staple food in oriya must be uh i mean different from the staple food we've in maharashtra  uhm  yeah yeah because in maharashtra normally we've a  chapati or  chapati then  bhakri we say  bhakri   jowari  yes yes  bhakri made up of jowari    made up of jowari  so we don't have that  we know certainly you don't have because   it is   so i found  actually i found much difficulty in swallowing jowari  that means that bhakri what you call bhakri   bhakri   bhakri because it's not a very crisp and uh yeah what you say delicate  delicate and very soft you know but when it is fresh  but when it is hot and fresh you know yeah you really relish it relish  yeah   delicate   but i like chapati   yeah  but chapatis you know it's a common food all over india even all over the world you know it's common  yeah yeah  you get wheat everywhere   yeah yeah   everywhere you can get it lekin chapati na it is sufficient to supply that much of energy to human body  and uh so far the department is concerned i found all the professors and teachers sounding of bells they are quite uh  you know serious about the teaching  yes sounding of bells in the university   yes in your your department you're the student of this department you know much better than myself cough but within this few one word days of my staying in  uh kolhapur in the hostel ladies hostel  kolhapur  i found uh that the coordinator is really uhm an an enthusiastic boss to encourage hostel life anything no basically all of them are first they all of them are  human and humane uhm both very kind soft spoken and you know that uh kind of hospitality that all of us share here   that's unique you might say haa because you never  uhm   naturally  naturally i was because hardly you know any outsider finds it difficult here to stay atleast on the campus you know yeah  because as far as possible because we've our limitations in a way uhm because office looks after  all these things you know  yeah   uhm   haan  so whatever office provides or offers ah  the same thing we extend to the participants also  but we see that not much inconvenience is done to the   participants so that's always there  ah   participants  or not only the professors or lecturers who are working here but uh office assistant also yeah along with the peons you know yeah and that mr chavan and uh mr bhonsle yeah all of them are quite cordial  yeah   yeah   yeah  yeah and uhm so far you two i've heard much about dr shastri from you since you were a very student of dr shastri  uhm but i haven't seen him with my eyes   uhm   no we we can do we can do one thing   yeah not today uhm but tomorrow or day after   uhm we can go to his place   yeah   uhm   uhm  oh it's uh because i just one mention i just mentioned once yesterday only yeah  because when after the session was over yes  yesterday i went to his place  i'm eagerly   yeah   yes  yes i would like to see him and your wife also specially because i'll take an interview of your wife laughs  so  why she chos she has chosen the life of a housewife oh i see because since i gave a paper on feminine power  yeah uh that i will i must reinvigorate her mind  yeah  but she does exert her power at home laughter  feminine power i mean that she does have   it's not sufficient you know   we're born to serve others yeah  not a single man a husband all family members all of us  have got some responsibility for the society   yeah   now i believe in i give you one example here uhm just one and a half months ago uhm i had my aunty with us uhm my aunty who is above seventy-five  uhm   uhm  yeah you're a maharashtrian no yeah uh and who's above seventy-five   uhm and some six or seven months back yeah  she uh got an attack of paralysis my god  she did just fell down in then in a one word  then she was rushed to the hospital near karad uhm  and then i got the message uhm as her uh condition is very serious or she is very serious  uhm   yeah   my god   then   uhm   uhm  then i uhm went to karad uhm thereafter next day i took my all the members  uhm of my family and we went there   uhm   uhm   uhm  she was there in the hospital for eight nine days  nine days thereafter she was discharged she was given discharge uh how is she now she is now is alright now i uh brought her here yeah  she stayed with us  yeah  ah in your house yes in my house she stayed with us for five months   uh ha  so we two together me and my wife  uh ha  now you're taking care of her now not only to care you no uhm she was it was impossible for her to walk to move everything but since  uhm   to move  so she is very much engaged your wife is yeah  very much engaged in the house-hold activities   yeah   yeah she is engaged  if she were working if my wife   uhm and then so much of attention you would not have taken yeah now she my aunty would not have been able to walk again uhm  she would not have been able to walk again   uhm   haan but uh so it is not a question of working outside uhm  it's a question of serving serve you say though yeah serving the old people  uhm   serve   yeah  yes yes don't think so that's where you know yes so what you gain by serving outside maybe you get returns in terms of say rupees or moneys you know   but this kind of achievement uhm is not possible outside  ah ha   uhm  uhm some satisfaction  no if somebody works outside ah somebody needs to be there yeah to look after the house maybe husband maybe children maybe that is there   ah   yeah   yeah some someone  someone must be there so your opinion i i do respect uhm but when   uhm  but i'm not talking in terms of money you know   i'm not talking in terms of money   not not money  but if you have somebody at home yes to  look after the you know house hold affairs you know  then you know it's very uh it's quite right   uhm that one should go out and work you know  yes   ah yes sure sure   uhm  but if there is nobody to look after in the house you know  uhm why  you should give the priorities uhm and you should  uhm   uhm  yes in fixing of one's priority   in fixing of priority and you should think that at what expense yeah you would work outside  yeah  uhm uhm but we modern women women are very much confused   yeah so far fixing the priorities are concerned   yeah   but at what expense  that's what i say you know  if you think that well she is uh ill i'll  she can't walk   i'll   she is old and say   let her let her occupy one corner  uh  let me do my other duties you know  uh   sure  ah so that's not humane  you're doing a very pious duty you know  don't think that it will be wasted yeah  you will get it returned  that's not human   yeah  yeah that's right in this hour something in your this in this life also you suffer so it is the priority yeah  what you value more  yeah  yeah human love affection   affection money but that one word is also doing the work of  humanism  money money  even the money is necessary uhm uhm it is  instrumental and secondary   uhm uhm  uhm  that's what i think  i've two children  these two children if my wife goes out and say teaches   uhm other children or if   uhm   other children they would be neglected they would be neglected so what is the use of your earning uh na  one thing is i can advise ashokji that you can engage your wife after the children become one word   that's fine because you know   efficient she has done m a in english  efficient  yeah she has done   it's nice she she has done  m a in english  she has done  yeah she has done her b ed and that too after we got married 
uh hello basu  how are you uhm hello  chakraborti how are you  i'm fine uh you for the last uh ten to fifteen days for the last ten fifteen days we are going to have a uh new political uh the transformation both in the state and the centre what is your opinion what you think about it  actually mm what i think is uhm that uh i was reading a newspaper today in the morning and uh i found that uh  some uh some foreigners commented that it is uh why the people of india are crying uh or crying about the possibility  of the future democratic it is that means it is why they are crying so much about the about the uh existence of democracy in india  this is this is their comment and i think that uh okay if it happens like that uh and uh this uh formation of government which  because it is a democracy so so many parties are there  so if it is uh uhm most of the uh parties they if they join together i think the country will run well   don't you think basu in your home in japan in  israel even in uh sri lanka in these countries uh there are many governments which are formed uh by many parties  single party uh is ruling the country like india this type of thing is very rare particularly in this decade and if that be so if japan can have a government formed by man by many parties say three or four parties israel has got a government recently and that government is formed by three parties france in europe france france has uh got uh uh so in the government fre fre french government you find that a communists or socialists have have joined  mitterand has got one uh ca cabinet colleague who belongs to the radical party or that communist party naturally if mitterand president mitterand can run his government for a period of ten years uh why in india cannot have a government consisting of some uh party uh national party national party representing the national capital or some progressive elements uh uh in some some political parties like congress-i congress-s or even janata dal with some uh radical members belonging to uh communist party or socialist party  why we ca we can have a very beautiful government very viable government very feasible government in our country uh and the government and the and the composition of that government can be uh say uh some members belong to congress-i some members belong to c pi-m some members belong to janata dal but all these elements should be progressive  so in that way we can form a government what is your opinion i as i think uh that uh the people of india are not very used to this this kind of situation because uh in the in the past they had not uh this kind of i mean the long past  only only one party uh uh ruled the our country  one party  but now it is the something different  it is different means uh because that is why i i say that  because of we are not used to that because we are traditionally  and we think that uh only if there is only one party then uh this uh our country will progress and if so many parties come together uh there is a ideological differences  so naturally there will be clash and uhm our democracy  would wouldn't be able to survive this is the this is the fear this is the fear i i'm not very much uhm i'm not very much  sure whether uh this government is going to survive  uhm  but uh let us see that is   uhm  okay basu  just think what i what i want to say  first of all the people of india of the sixtees or the seventees were not adequately exposed to the west  one of the reasons of indian people's exposure to the west is undoubtedly television and the proximity between indian people and the western people uh which has been made through different types of exchange political exchange uh tourist exchange tourist exchange or scholars exchange of scholars or ex exchange of technocrats so west is not at present times totally alien to us  i think there is a kind of close proximity between the west and the east  naturally if the governments in those countries are viable  first of all if that gover if those governments in europe and japan and in is israel even in sri lanka if those governments are viable or can run smoothly uh we also can have a government of that type when the so called national party congress-i has disintegrated  uh itself into different segments  first of all congress-i has no power of of what do you think do you think that india is basically has got one culture or do you believe that india has got an unity in diversity  or if you don't believe it don't you think that this is a concept which has been imposed by the british upon the indians  india in the ancient past was not together  india in the even in the muslim period india is not was not  one was not a one country  india became one and united during this time of the british  naturally british united india for the sake of the smooth administration  now we are running after the same cultural uh identity  we are running after that that uh that same cultural identity i i i don't say that india should be disintegrated no not that but cultural uh i mean uh india has got a a heterogeneous culture  heterogeneous national entity and for the sake of the interest of all the communities belonging to different cultures should all the communities should live together peacefully  i mean it is a mutual interest and congress-i cannot offer us at present a a a a cannot ca cannot present us a viable government with the help of which it can rule the whole of the country what is your opinion about the cultural entity of our nation   what's your opinion what do you say uhm now now see chakraborti it is uh the proverb goes like that that uhm too many cooks spoil the broth  uh this is a proverb and i think that in the present situation uh this proverb uh can go well  but still uhm though i don't stick to this kind of proverb because uh yes i do agree with you  sometimes uhm the people uh sorry people of india  they are they belong to different communities and they have their separate cultures  naturally every nation has as india has a particular culture japan has a particular culture british has a particular culture uh america has got a american people have got their own culture so there is there is a cultural dissimilarity  yeah yes uh a separate culture means uh within the country  not so vast uh the variations the variety  i'm talking about the variety  variety in indian culture is something uh something which you  don't find in uh the western countries  uh particularly in european in what sense do you think that  let's suppose our we are bengalis and uh some  there are some other states where some other uh communities live and there is a there is a cultural difference   don't you think that it is the religion which can unite all the people belonging to different cultures  no i don't think that uhm because religion is something uhm something which uh should uhm ennoble the mind of a person  it it it goes like that but you see in our india religion is something which is uh manipulated in some in order to gain something  you are putting some aspersions on religion or those religious  reli religious leaders who uh uh who try to use their religion  actually frankly speaking i don't believe in the  in any kind of religion because religion only means when i say that i am a hindu and you are a muslim or he is a uh buddhist like that that  separates us us that creates a wall between us  only the religion is uh the humanism  humanism is our religion  humanity so uh i think that only this should exist  nothing else  so so you have come to the same point again that india is a country in which peoples of different cultures people of uh divergent states are living together should live together in the years to come atleast in the thousand years to come for the interest of all  so how can you expect that one particular political party say congress-i should rule or can rule such a big country with vast  uh number of pa pa i mean with a vast population belonging to different cultural entities how can you think i can't make out this thing how can you think a political party like congress-i should rule  for our country because he is a single cook and you don't  allow other cooks to work together  i think if all the cooks are invited and the taste will be miscellaneous divergent and as the pople in india are of divergent qualities divergent traits and characters these dishes which will be prepared by different cooks will be palatable to all  so you must you too at if i accept your one word  then also we can arrive at a conclusion that we should have different cooks in new delhi   what's your opinion  yes that is uh okay  that is very right that uh in the present situation we don't have any other alternative  we must have to invite uh so many cooks uh so that uh our country will so that our country survives and uh it can prosper uh it can prosper uh otherwise uh our country is uh you know that it is going through a very uh critical time and uh in order to survive that we must join our our hands together  otherwise uh we are going to face a bit difficult situation in future so what type of difficult situation you anticipate if this government fails in the months to come say two or two three months after two months if this government or or say after three months if this government fails what type of uh what type of apprehensions  what type of misgivings you think you anticipate  i think that uh in different parts of india uh you know that uh about punjab and uh assam  oh it was also during that uh punjab problem was very much  uh the living dur even during the time of mrs indira gandhi uh assam problem of assam was also a very burning problem burning one during the time of mrs indira gandhi  so these problems are new to us almost due due to mishandling of some political leaders uh these handlings these problems have transformed themselves into something ethnic problem  so these problems are not new  these problems are very common to us we are habituated we are accustomed to these problems  yes we are accustomed but uh see that if uh uh punjab was the first then assam came  and we know that uh there are uh suppressed uh supressed  anger in uh different parts of india we know that  so that exact due to the uh is the is that due to the lopsided growth or uneven growth of uh uneven growth of particular regions at the cost of others  do you think so i think uh that is very much true that sometimes uh uh that government uh just intentionally they say that bihar is a very uh backward because the people of bihar are very uh idle  and uh very uh they don't work at all  and so they uhm they uhm they uh this state will not  develop  and if it happens like that uh in the allocation of money  if it happens like that then naturally the people of bihar is going to revolt against this type of uh uh behaviour so you think that mismanagement financial mismanagement management financial mismanagement of the central government is one of their important reasons for uh this lopsided uneven growth economic growth in our country and one region is uh being developed at the cost of other regions naturally the region which is lagging behind the regions uh like eastern regions uh people living in the eastern regions are lagging behind and they are harbouring a kind of discontentment resulting in a kind of political or ethnic crisis or sometimes in secessionist movements 
mr yadav i think we should discuss about premchand and his  workmanship regarding in the literature how do you think like that yes what is your opinion about premchand say art in technique  premchand the greatest of uh hindi novelist  as far as his craftmanship is concerned i think he is the front rank  front ranker  front ranker what do you mean by this front ranker  uh with the development of hindi literature particularly in the genre of novel i think premchand initiated the novel form in its presant context and proper form  so he should be considered as the front ranker  front ranker front ranker  because by the word front ranker i do suppose that premchand initiated the novel form in its true contexts  it its exact form  then by the word novel we suppose a such detail type of prose story and prose composition which can contain a large theme in its full detail charaterisation and everything else premchand utilises novel form in the in this context  so he should be considered as a front ranker  i think premchand is a novelist of   you're you're considering about the quality or the class of premchand as a novelist  no i just uh want to emphasise this about premchand as a novelist particularly about his characters characters   characters  what kind of characters he put in his novel oh yeah that is a very fine thing  i think premchand is primarily dealing with the characters related to the rural life of india he is always depicting the rural picture of countryside and the villages in india particularly in the pre-independence era and also  about the independence era  uh by this word pre-independence i do mean that uh the characters which do occur in the novels of premchand like   godan and some other novels like   gaban and say all these novels  there are lots of characters who just represent the different aspects  different uh see the different colours and different categories of the characters which are which uh are represented by our  rural society as well class  i feel i feel   i one word  i think premchand's characters are very simple yeah no doubt   they are very innocent no doubt they come from low status of life uh from villages  they are living standard is very low yes and they are actually exploited by the aristocrat classes   yes  because you see premchand was a true novelist in its sense he just painted rural pictures in its real serial colour without any artificial ornamentation premchand has represented rural society in its essence true essence for example you see lots of farmers while toiling hard and and reeling under odd type of atrocities and all type of i mean exploitation at the hands of our feudal society and feudal bureaucratic set up he has represented them all  poverty is lying there all glaring poverty under the repressive rules of taxes all type of taxes being levied by the aristocratic and ruling set up these are all glaring and all visible clearly visible it is   i think so   i think his characters are tragic such as uh we can take for example in gaban   gaban certainly uh ramanath he is a steady character  though i think he is an escapist yes  he leaves the hard realities of life he runs away he and he  doesn't show the he doesn't reveal the reality  ramanath   yes  he just manipulates something   i think in gaban the novel  he does something but he says something so there is no unification in his deed and speech i think uh the novel gaban  which uh shot up the popularity of premchand as a novelist too much i think there is a psychological introspection into the characters one word of ramanath the character who has been affronted by so many pecularities of his fate  he is driven to calcutta he goes there he uh joins a very low middle class family there he one day goes and wins a a chess uh quiz and he is able to get some prize in his cheerly he was fascinated for buying so many ornaments to his uh jewelleries to his wife   can you tell me  can you tell me please how does he come to the real point ramanath ramanath realises ultimately what does he realises ultimately ramanath ultimately did realise that his fascination and his over expense o on the items of uh high valued jewelleries costly jewelleries was not a real thing it did create lot of problems for him he had leave his flee away from his home town lucknow and he was forced to go to calcutta and there amidst lots of tragic situations and grim realities  he come to this conclusion that we cannot move or flee away from the hard realities which uh are the pre-dominence realities of life and society i think something like that  what do you think uh about his art and technique   premchand's  yes  as art technique premchand has used the picturised pictures card i think premchand always   pictures  uh uh by pictures i mean that premchand always uh puts before his readers or presents before his his readers of his novels a true and lively and faithful picture of the surrounding or the locale he is going to put in his novel for example if he tries to mention a village then he starts about picturising all the minute details for example the roads full of dust for example the pond full of hycinth and all even men and women are bathing there and even cattles and animals are also there and somebody is washing his utensils and somebody is washing his clothes so this type of lively picturise then gives you a very healthy and lively informatives he used to give yes regarding his location  yes   you're you're you're very correct  his description is really very minute and clear when we read and very live lively  haan lively yes but what do you think about the language which he uses in his novels  uhm in terms of lang uh language i think premchand should be considered as a true artist in the sense he never goes for artificial or ornamental language  he always picks up the words from our local dialects  or even the word he use suggest a kind of our naturality suppose for example he always uses such type of dialogues which are actually spoken by the native people in the remote village side i think like that  yes  and that gives a kind of naturality and directness to the expression their livility and anything else yes you are very correct  really his languauage is very simple direct and very very communicative  even his language is so simple that it is not difficult to understand even a very uneducated person also can be able to understand and can able can be able to enjoy his novel one thing one one word i i do feel that the language premchand uses in his novels do present such categories and such classes in our society for example for the people belonging to lowest strata of society premchand uses the exact dialogue used by them yes very good very correct   and for example people belonging to suppose suppose middle class or the upper middle class or the uh or the upper class elite class gentry he uses that type of uh i mean the standard dialect which has some real touches and everything etiquette and manner all things that are possible for example a feudal chief a zamindar talking to his uh kinsmen and talking to his uh i mean servants he uses there is a kind of two kinds of uh language there the language used by the zamindar or the feudal chief is something high something bombastic something one word  and something high sounding but the language used by the servant is something quitely different and there you come across a kind of representation of the society in terms of the variation of the language itself i think it is also a peculiar aspect a a distinct achievement of premchand as a craftmanship regarding his novels being in the terms of use of languages of  uhm do you think like that yes  alright is it okay  yes   yes  now i would like to discuss about uh uh  premchands pictorial uses of language  he uses pictorial languages also he is his language is poetic very poetic  yes it is  so one word   i'll show you some examples mr yadav   haan  for premchand makes fine or rather far fetched use of  miseries and phrases phrases to communicate uh great ideas very direct ideas for example uh in a beautiful short story  kafan kafan dealing with the  tragic aspects of the li lives of a father and his son  premchand shows how the daughter-in-law of a man is dying  how due to her pregnancy and both son and father father-in-law both are so lazy that they have just didn't care they didn't care to their daughter-in-law and she is dying and which premchand has shown in this way that uh while the daughter-in-law is just on her on her death-bed crying up mercilesly  and at the same time son and father-in-law are sleeping in deep slumber as if two azgars are sleeping  so there the tongue two azgars do indicates such a kind of pictorial touch and there lies the brilliance of use of language in its pictorial manifestation i think something like that  yes  yes correct and you come across uh so many i mean numberless examination of such things and pictorial aspect has been superbly illustrated by premchand in his novels and particularly in his short stories for example you see in panch parmeshwar  also there is brilliant example of this pictorial a representation and picturisation of uh khala  and mausi for human's sake  there is also uh her curly and white hairs and her cheeks  uh swollen something like that yes that's true here you also come across some picturisation aspect yeah that's true his his ideas are also very thoughtful  if it is deep idea so simple language in a very simple say   yes no no doubt   yes   for example you come across uh so many examples premchands original views on poverty honesty friendship  these are the ideas india's age old tradition in india the age old views on friendship trust cooperation friendship all aspects have been yes dealt by premchand in different context and situations and that and those expressions enable premchand to outlet and vent his ideas in a very just stable and very convincing manner i think so  yes  you are very correct now i would like to talk about his satirical aspect  i think premchand is a great satirist because he exposes some foibles shortcomings weaknesses of the society   because  so for example you see in gaban   yes he exposes all the short comings of the society all the happening a real happening of the society yes satire as uh the great satirist   he is a great satirist yes yes satire as a great satirist and classical john ryder has said  satire as the amendment of vices by correction  i think premchand also in his uh all through his literary career followed this dictum   premchand's satirical purpose in his novels or short stories wants to recorrect society  to recorrect it if there are certain anomalies in society  there are some waywardness in society there are some inherent defect  so premchand used his aesthetic features of literary literary art to expose those irregularities which are prevelent in our society and by his critical comments he tried to enlighten the people and be aware  towards all these irregularities and if possible try to remove them so that our society be such a place that we would like to be living  i think so premchand has always attacked on the exact causes of our poverty exact causes of our illiteracy exact causes of of unawareness regarding all the grim realities and grim difficulties that our society face these days  particularly one must remember that premchand was writing uh uh uh premchand wrote all his novels and short stories in the pre-independence era when india was not free and it was under the clutches of british monarchy all type of oppression were being carried on in the name of british queen after a pro proclamation of eighteen fifty-eight so premchand being a one word artist was always awake  to see what our society is what are its chief defects and he always used the literary art to work as a st  as an a stimulus to awaken the people from their deep slumber and subconscious state to see the gruelling aspect of society 
 i'm madhumita from gowahati and you want to tell you  i'm yasmin from one word yasmin we are uh  you  i'm poonam maneja   i'm from haryana   i'm staying in ambala  my mother tongue is hindi and punjabi   i'm ketaki bose from calcutta and my mother tongue is bengali  come let's come  how do you find the mess food over here madhumita ? mess food it's a bit too hot i think so uhm that's true  we're not used to eating we eat chillies but we don't go to very hot food hot food and all   very hot food  could you tell us something about bengali way of cooking way of cooking uh i suppose our staple food is fish and rice that favourite one word  we also take fish and rice  fish and rice  yeah fish and rice you also take ? yes we take fish and rice i agree with get plenty of fish and rice yes but then they go from andhra you don't get it at guwahati there is plenty but it comes from andhra on the way it goes   ah   accha not from uh not local   local fishes are there but they are much more costly yeah  the sea fish from andhra no no we have river fishes here no i mean from andhra that fish goes from andhra is from the river sweet water fish   yeah we may get rom and of course we don't get elisha and eel that  elisha and eel  we we take elish  we also take elish but uh we elista it's  little bit of salt yeah we don't have here this usage as such in our language  we have a ho hon and that's it makes the different you know we people get problematic from phonetics again laughter  so what about you ? what you  i'm a pure vegetarian  sometimes we take eggs  like my family all the people they are taking non-veg but only me i'm the pure vegetarian one  can you tell us something  it's your personal choice  ah my it's my personal choice you like you know it's better things when you feel  one word also even if you are vegetarian and all  could you tell us some recipes that we can learn it ? aha  recipe is simple thing is i mostly i stress upon uh boiled vegetables i think you won't like to take it   no i'm not boiled vegetables when i'm all by myself i had to do that cooking so  that's the best thing i suppose  so uh we prefer more on makke ki roti and  sarson ka sag laughter   sarson ka sag  yeah it should be very much sarson ka sag   i'm very fond of it  just uh this what you call that leaves and you know all   mustard leaves that mustard leaves  mustard leaves  we first of all we wash it then we cut and uh  into small into small pieces very small pieces  and then at least in my house like we have got a choola    we've got a uhm angeethi what you call yes so in that there is uh earthen pot and in that we put in the morning we ca we i mean we put some water in it and in the afternoon it becomes very much well mashed up well prepared then we put all those coriander and something uh   tomato tomato and everything all the masalas we put it becomes very tasty  tomato  but the main thing is we stress upon butter and desi ghee   desi ghee  do you add a bit of flour later ? yeah  you keep some basen of no haan we put some basen   basen and that makes it much tasty tasty  tasty to have to eat tasty that in many punjabi family staying near we get it but then somehow i can't prepare it  it's the burning as per the initials even you can't do it in a pressure cooker ? no we can do it in a pressure cooker but it won't be that tasty  actually that family it's my family is traditional so i've got my old grandmother and making for us you know so like if we have to make we'll naturally prefer a   pressure cooker   pressure cooker you boil the saag  ? yeah we boil the saag  then you fry it  uh not nothing to fry just to put desi ghee  and all those after that cook it for some time  haan onion we pre make it red then put some haldi powder and some little bit of chilli as per the taste  then we put that masala into the mustard  you put tomatoes also in it ?  haan tomatoes also  it gives taste even tomatoes but what you like eating ?  it's uh i mean fish laughter   we'll have it in uh i mean it's a kind of essential for both the lunch and uh   yes that's it is you feel like uh  lunch and dinner you take   yeah both even the chapatis  when we've got  accha  fried fish  fried fish  so we have fish we have to have it uhm plenty of fish plenty of fish if we don't eat fish we feel very we haven't eaten any thing   we haven't eaten any thing  and you know it price is not the thing you know it can go upto seventy eighty a kg and even then you've it  on every occasion you have to have fish  how do you you have kaliya   kaliya i mean it's a very tasty fish you put some curd also making a fish ? yes curd and cream also yes sometimes  that depends upon the dish you're preparing yeah  if you want to make a fried fish what you do you just fry it   fry it in mustard oil mustard oil we use mustard oil for fish preparation i mean even the newer generation which is using uh refined oil uhm it uses mustard oil for the  fish preparation you can use refined oil for whatever  yes you know refined you know postman or  saffola whatever you use its of no use  no  it won't allow the taste to come through   it won't allow the taste to come through  the taste it is very flavour but they say you've lot of cholestrol there   mustard oil   mustard oil  but fish in itself doesn't contain as much as cholestrol as a egg or meat  and i think you must be frying in uh this iron  kadai  yeah kadai yes iron one or iron one hi  or the brass ? better iron one is better because it doesn't stick to the stick to it and those uh non stick things if you don't have because they don't have a rounded base  na they're shal  shallow base  so there should be plenty of  so that uh  then uh then you just fry it and then what you do ? first we i mean wash cut and wash the fishes and then we put some uh salt and haldi uhm in it  and leave it to marinate say for about five or ten minutes  uhm and then we fry it deep fry it more or less in oil  uhm   uhm  and i mean the most common preparation is with uh grounded mustard  we fry the fish and then we grind the mustard put  haldi water and green chillies and put into the  kadai along with the fish and salt to taste and  that's all  one word  i mean that is the easiest way and you can even steam it steam it with the ingredients  hilsa   hilsa you do it  it's like you put in if you don't you know you can put in the pressure if you want it separated and get   it's all means you don't cook the heat or just because the hilsa itself is a very i mean easily cooked fish  and i mean we prefer sweet water fish to sea fish sea fish yes we don't eat the sea fish   it's only occasionally when it comes in the market  occasionally  especially in winter  that too we go for prawns prawns  haan you get the prawns don't like prawns  no laughs   i've never seen anybody taking that in my family  yes of course you know people they when they talk of prawns you know when see you know we people are so considerate that we take  alu ke parathe and gobi ke parathe and  sarso ka saag makke ki roti we're much more concentrated on these type of foods you know  regarding non-veg we take that meat and chicken  and all that  but atleast i don't take  biryani  have you tried uh taking fish in uh in the oven ? yeah no i haven't have you ? yes uh i prefer it more you know that means you have to have less of oil any fish ? any fish no we get this you know i don't know what you call it this side   we've the names of uh supposed to call what do you call it uh no we have we call it semi putthi and we have different putthi semi putthi  and it's very sweet  putthi   semi means sugar and then we just marinate it with lemon or something and all keep it for sometime then i usually make a sauce   yeah  sauce ? maybe a cheese sauce and get into a egg white sauce with egg  and you don't need to do it sometimes i just just fry a bit slightly and then put you know i just put into a tomato sauce and onion then ginger and garlic and big chillies or capsicum whatever you've  then you just give a topping you give uh cheese   ginger and garlic  so that cheese melts and one word   i've uh actually i've got this griller also in my gas stove  so the easiest way you put it inside and then you are studying you don't have to fry it it takes time then i make the fish uh one or two words  press inside the fish cut it from one word

uhm mr yadav you told something about your native place na  yeah which is your native place  native place is uh u p azamgarh  oh i see  so when did you finish your m a degree  in fact i finished my m a some uh from the university of jabalpur madhya pradesh  uhm i see  that means uh you finished it in the university itself  which year could you tell me the year  yeah  right in nineteen eighty-seven  after that what have you been doing since then  infact after uh in uh nineteen eighty-seven almost uh  in july i got my degree m a degree and uh after that i taught in a college almost for four year uh four months and uh of course and uh after that  since it was a private college and uh i didn't hope much from this college  and meanwhile fortunately i got a job in state government school and uh i took up this job now i'm  going on with this job   oh is that  uh uh are you happy with this present job   it's all it laughs to a certain extent  uh i'm happy  but since it's a very interior part of uh jabalpur city  so sometimes i don't find uhm me at ease  eh in the in the sense it was uh high i'm  appointed there as a english teacher uh but things are quite different there i don't find people who can uh speak with me in english ah or even whenever i teach in in the classes uh i quiet often i used by mother tongue hindi so from uh my part i like something that uh   ah   it means uh since you do not get the opportunity to use english outside the classroom or even inside the classroom you are not fully satisfied with the present job   oh yeah well i'm not uh fully satisfied  because in fact uh english is a second language for me and  uh unless uh we uh take up or continue with the uhm unless we follow the uhm four available skills of learning second language  then i don't think it will be better for a learner to develop or uh okay i understand that now since you are doing the p g c t now after going back  is it possible for you to use simple english in the classroom itself yeah i would like to uhm use simple english as much as uh possible  since uh student there where i teach they're  not able to understand uh even simple sentences  but even then i would like to do uhm my best particularly i would like to use english sentences simple sentences so that uh they can uh make an effort to understand the sentences  yeah that's what i also feel better because  to to begin with you can use simple english simple sentences and uh after one month or so on after one month or so  you can increase the standard step by step  and i think you'll be successful in using english inside the classroom also  and when you meet some friends when you go here and there to different places you can use uh english and so i think uh you can improve a lot  then what's your future plan  that is uh to continue the school or to search for another job  well uhm infact uh i need a lot of improvement  particularly in my spoken english and uh particularly pronunciation stress intonation and uh there're uh other fields of english there i find myself uh uhm but i realise that uh i lack something  so my next plan would be eh to take up diploma course from c i e f l hyderabad and i wish i would be able to do my best  yeah now i've understood uh much from you i've  understood your carrer and so on  but so far i've not informed to you anything about me  uhm well you as you know my name is chandrashekhar  and actually i belong to the south india tamil nadu  kanyakumari district  and presently i'm teaching in st joseph's college  chakama kohima nagaland  teaching in a college where there is p u degree pre degree  then b a also is there  b a two year plus one year  b a pass course and b a honours   i'm teaching there for all the three year students and i'm happy with my job  uhm salary is okay  then the people the students are also well co-operative then my wife is also working in the college so everything is quite okay with me  uh if you want to know something more about me you are free to ask  uh when did you get this job  i got this job in nineteen eighty-six nineteen nineteen eighty-six  and uh when did you finish your post graduate my post graduation degree i finished it in uh mid june nineteen eighty-six june nineteen eighty-six   yes  and immediately after that in july nineteen eighty-six i joined the post yeah all right uh in fact since you're also doing your uh post graduation certificate in teaching english uh after i hope as you are doing well and laughs and uh you are supposed to get good grade as well in the what would be your next step  are you going to take up your diploma course or uh if you get suppose if you get uh uh a grade or a plus  then uh would you like to take up your m litt certainly master of litt yeah certainly  i my ambition is this one to do my diploma and complete my m litt then if possible m phil also so that i can cover the literature side also english literature then at last do my ph d it's my aim  but i think things will go on well  shall i take your opinion about your  academic career  uh you talk talk about your m phil and diploma as well but i don't think it's my own opinion uh once you have degree of uh diploma in the teaching of english from c i e f l hyderabad and most of the universities of our country uh have uh accepted this diploma equivalent to m phil degree  then i don't think it would better for you to do again  your m phil  and it would be better to do your m litt after your diploma yeah what you've said is correct but uh after doing m phil uh diploma i directly wanted to  do my m litt course  and then if possible i'll cover up in order to cover up the literature area also i feel like doing m phil if possible suppose if uh you finish your m litt i think it's  your ambition and is a desire as well  and then uh would you like to think something uh about your ph d  quite often we find people interested uh in doing ph d  uhm somewhere even some from the from some universities but uh doing ph d from c i e f l hyderabad is not an easy task  because uh we are supposed to perform well there only then ph d degree is awarded there so uh what is your next plan what about your next plan in future to do your ph d from c i e f l hyderabad or some uh other universities of our country  it is yet uhm uhm very interesting question that you have asked me  actually it is not an easy task to do our ph d from c i e  especially in e l t  but before that i want to give extra reading to improve myself  so that i can when i finish my diploma m litt and m phil  with wider reading i think i'll be able to uh complete my ph d very well in a satisfactory way  okay you have told me all about yourself now could you tell me something about your family background  your parents and how many children are there in the family and so on  right i infact my family is cons consist of  uh six seven members seven members  uh my parents and uh my two brothers and uh two sisters and i've a wife and i've a son as well right infact my father is uh at calcutta he is in port trust as a cargo officer there and uh next year sometime uh in june he is going to  retire  and uh as far as uh my question is concerned i'm  the man uhm yeah  are you the eldest in the family  yeah no my one of my sister is the youngest  i'm sorry eldest and uh i'm the next to her  i see  what about you would you like to uhm give some details about yourself why not sure see in our family we're five children to our parents  three sisters and two brothers including me  my both the parents are farmers only  my eldest sister is married to a police officer  he is in tamil nadu  the second sister is married to a n j c o serving in the army and myself you know a lot about me since we've  been staying for a long time  not long time about two weeks back  then my youngest younger brother he is doing his b e now then youngest one is doing her b a class b a economics   so   what about your wife ah i forgot to tell me laughs tell you about my wife  i'm sorry  uhm she is also a post graduate in english  and she is working in the same college  along with you along with me  and i've got a son also yeah that's the thing yeah laughs he is one year old and one year and two months old  a very naughty boy  naughty boy  yeah very clever he has got after you say like this quiet naughty boy cough  yeah children are supposed to be naughty at the beginning hope it is  but he is very clever so everything is well  and uh i like the family i'm a happy man so to so to say  that is the matter uh for you its good that you have uh a wife and a son  you must be very happy man having a wife who is working with you in the same college  and uh don't you think uh whenever you work in the same college you find some sort of uh uhm problem  problem i mean uh working in a same college in same in the same de department  don't you find uh some sort of trouble or some sort of  cont or controversy as such  you see uh  there is no trouble or problem as such  but the only problem with us is getting leave from  the principal   that's the only problem  when she wants to do any course or anything she can't get leave and when i want to do anything i also i'm not free to get leave  this is the only problem we face when we work together in the same college and nothing else  the other things are okay because we're working in the same place  and we have the opportunity of being together always and it is something interesting  a few days infact i would like to take you to uhm i would like to take you in this politics  and uh i think uh you you must be familiar uh with the conditions going on that our country is facing  uhm political disasters and uh disorders and election has taken place a few weeks earlier  and uh what shall would be your opinion and that no party again has come into power and i think uh uh in your opinion as far as my opinion is concerned i would like to uh uh i want uh if india needs uh  british rule or uh next alternative  what would be the next alternative would you like to suggest  but uh clearing the throat what has happened this year is really a political disaster  but even then i still have faith in democracy  but all the political systems ha have their own defects  even then i believe in democracy and uh india needs a better leader  one who can do and one who can do well for the people now we have been talking about everything since you belong to  since you belong to m p could you tell me something about your state  it's alright infact i went to jabalpur  a well known city of uh m p state  i went there in nineteen eighty-five  i uh before uh i had uh no sort of any idea about uh m p and uh but there i found people particularly in the field of pol politics  there politics is based on some sort of principles  and uh leaders are supposed to do some work concrete work  uh for the public  and infact uh same people sometime they favour uh  congress-i and sometime they favour   bharatiya janata party but they're but infact there uh politics is based there uh on uh some sort of principles  they are not going to show the same beaten track like uh  other states u p bihar where politics is totally based on uhm casteism 
 laughter  really  just imagine we have to wait here for half an hour  and just doing this  they must be wondering what we are doing no ? yes laughs  and nobody is going to find us here  because we are locked here laughs  locked from outside laughs  feeling nice  but next week by this time uhm finished most of the papers which ? how many days ? two days more uhn today is the final day so naturally we have uh  nine more days to go say  nine  isn't it ? nine ten uh ten because sun sunday is also counted you know  and whatever it is i am waiting for the thirtieth  ah  because i was actually waiting for these classes and not for the exams because i know what i am going to do there because i am not at all prepared  even i am not prepared actually we hardly get any time to study no when we work uhm  you know it's very difficult for us you being in college it was something different and for school we have to be there right from ten to four ten  and then our headmistress is very particular about our correction and all that  to add with it our system is very exam oriented  every second day we have some examination and some correction  even we have exams  in that way actually every four months or three months we have  because we have pre- test and test and annual and half yearly and all this things naturally it uh just has to be done  and our college is more like a school you know  that uh  this principal she is very particular about it  all that discipline has to be maintained you know  but in orissa you know lecturers have a very nice time there  uhm like there is nobody to actually check on them  they may or may not take classes  and children bank on the tuitions rather than on the lectures  so if you are very wealthy you do very well   that's how it goes  see over here we are bothered about linguistics and grammar and all we don't know what's happening in india no the whole   this way it's in such a turmoil stage and we are not we are more or less  not bothered about  we are more or less more we are more or less in a linguistic island you say   lingui laughter  cut off from the world   cut off from the world and daily now we le read linguistic talk linguistic walk linguistic and we have to be conscious of our actions and all these things no all the time can't we live free  actually when we return we'll have to get into our old habit for sometime and then comeback to linguistics again laughs  that's all  nothing to  but i don't know what i am going to do for the exams no ?  it's such a i have never been so unprepared for the exams as i am now  because uh i just couldn't study and now all the things are coming in at once yeah  you can get you are getting to understand the whole thing at once you know  so naturally it's very difficult for us to take uh  things inside and capture it and then produce it   and repeat in the examination paper actually it's very tough   but then   but  it is one way it's good that atleast we are getting to know something atleast better than because all of us can't take leave all of can't be accomodated in hyderabad in c i f l  so it's one way we are getting a touch of it not the whole thing but a touch of it  whatever it is you know i am not the results  i was interested to get some of my concept clear  and i feel i was able to clear some of it i was bothered about my pronunciation i was bothered about some of my grammatical mistakes and all that and there was nobody there whom i could approached to you see so i thought this course would be a great help to me i am not bothered about the result part of it   even i  actually because we teach in a our circumstances and surroundings are so no that we get we are separated from the english speaking people as it is because in my place no one speaks english only i speak  and whom i to speak in that way   that's why we are confined in our area especially i living in this rural area these people they don't even know english nothing so it becomes very difficult for me  and i was getting to forget my pronunciations also now you see you see dr jairaman you want in my group today no  dr jairaman check me so many time  but i i don't know how it come to because i i in pronunciations i was never checked  that was one thing spelling and pronunciation i was always right you know  but just because i am not habituated with i am not  getting   practice  one thing right from school days i should say uhm some of the pronunciation that we were taught was wrong  and whatever i had picked up it is from the media whatever it is because i had interest in it i tried to rectify myself  but whatever we were taught during our school days was something  completely different  and almost i should say it was something wrong that was taught to us so i feel these things should be taught to the primary teachers  they should go through these  all the english medium school the so called english medium schools  the teacher should go through this sort of training where they can rectify the pronunciation before they give it to little one  definitely   it should be  yeah because it is there where the base is formed  and once things get destructed there means whole life is  they can't change you can't change  if you rec it's mean very it's  uh difficult to rectify the wrong and then come in to correction you know we learnt in our method haan this thing  haan  but actually i was taught in a very i told you last night no that i had a very surrounding and very good uh people  who taught me so it came in to me as my first language  i even forgot my mother tongue when i first went into  there learning not learning it was a language acquisition rather than language learning for me  because i was placed in that position so i am very lucky in that way you know which i got now how but  now how   but  just because i am placed my setting now the atmosphere i live in is totally bengali  so naturally i am getting to forget it i i said i'll another few days if i stay over there i'll  also forget the name of sha the spelling of shakespeare   yeah  actually you have to give  haan that's very natural  sneeze  one thing in our place that is in that is in bhubaneshwar  first and foremost if you speak english means they will alienate you  haan  they will say that means we are of  showing off and all these things they'll say  relationship there becomes very formal you have to speak in oriya in order to be like them otherwise they will just throw you out of their group no but here they think that they'll you are showing off  haan  if you speak english you are showing off  haan  that is another part of it  and one more thing another thing how i rectified myself because all almost all all of us all my brother and sisters we have read in english medium school  and naturally we used to fight and quarrel a lot a lot yeah and we used to do that in english   so that is how we use to rectify each other and  somehow we could that is how i could i can speak little bit of correct yes english   yes it was   yes  but you are actually the means thing that they should  uh i think uh they should e extend the say you know of this course  it should be one and half months or two months you no uhm or they can organised the contact programme and then take the examination that are later date because we have to we can't just read the books  and we can't form the ideas see you see the ways  dr this mr v he was totally changed actually because he was uh the concepts are clear not clear to us   of course  we have got the book language the language of the book and we just learn it like that and we put it out  but we have to clear the concept we have to get the actual technical lang languages the term we have to get  like i answered the right thing today i had that concept but i didn't know the actual technicality i have to express it  because in the book they are just given no one explained it to us no  that's why  yeah how to express it  for that we need one more month one more month yes this is too short actually  that's what i'm suggesting  they should have the programme programme programme and then afterwards   and then  the exams afterwards they should they should they should do that it should have that way yeah the organisation and now uh uhm what is that heads are so crammed crammed isn't it any way it is difficult and i think in lingistic paper i am going to write my literature in my literature paper i'll do my politics  laughter  i don't know what i am going to do  oh yours your head is not reeling any more no ? no in the morning i had a tough time i thought i was going to fall down even i thought i was fal you wouldn't feel to go also i was getting quite scared you know  but i was definite it was because of the food yesterday not should have i think it was my pressure  pressure went up  may be the pressure has gone up high again  and i was scared  but you  you got medicine for it  no i didn't bring my medicine why ? because i am very bad at taking medicine  no but should you know these are life saving drugs you know you should keep them so that is the that was the problem and today if i wouldn't have taken little rest i don't know what i would have done throughout the day  yeah you should have no but uh i think you must be because your stomach was upset that's why the pressure up it must be upset no upset in the sense that you didn't take food it was empty all the gas formation and all that it can i know suddenly this reeling sensation  it was something from that as soon as i got up from the bed i needed support  i thought i was going to fall down somewhere  so i hurriedly had everything i had my bath and everything and finally i came down to thejust  you can feast for the night today no  haan laughter  i missed it i really missed it awful  i didn't know actually and i this lady this rekha she came and told me then she had sent it i should say we have got uh  so i  she said she had sent it so i said she had sent i thought they had arranged the boys and all and i haven't given my name  so i said i won't take it i said take it back please i won't take it  she should have told me miss ranjana sent it then i could have because it was also not good to sent the refuse the thing back no it was but i told her i explained that i didn't know it actually  and now what class do we have ?  it's another class of grammar and linguistics again  
 st's college from madras university and yet  still deciding on what topic we would like to talk on  i am padma doing my ph d here in literature teaching i am srilata doing my ph d here  i am subalakshmi doing pgm here  i am swarnalatha doing by ma in english literature  i am ramkumar doing my m phil in english literature  i am louis doing my ma here  well we have decided to talk uh on women's  liberation to begin with and we may move on to other topics later  what do you think of women's liberation louis   women's liberation is basically uh a noble concept but but the whole question is the ball is actually in the  women's court i would say  if i think woman should be a lot more assertive then what they are now  and i think they are allowing themselves to be more conditioned than it is more that they condition themselves then men conditioning them  i object to what louis said  no doubt question of the woman being conditioned the society which plays a major role in fact the society doesn't give a woman a chance to prove her abilities  she sort of repress and any attempt of a woman to liberate herself is met is met with strong disapproval  so i think the ball is in the men's court because  no but somehow i think you are contradicting yourself in some ways  uh as you said it's not actually men or women  that's not the question at all you yourself said that it is the society that controls society made both men and women  so uhn i think we when we talk of women's liberation we immediately the association is that it is anti-men  uh i would like to question that definition first  no but india is mostly a patriarchal society so it's men who play a more important role right in all your decision making and what about this however modern we may get to but still the same  we haven't broken up from our ancient roots   that's what we call  i would like to object to the first statement that she made  that society conditions a woman  i don't belive in society as such i think the individual is superior to society  i don't understand why uh individual should allow society to dominate over his his or her individuality  so the question of women's liberation is not that  society suppresses a woman  it is just that the woman refuses to do anything that could alleviate her suffering  i think the speaker is talking about about an utopian society which can never exists  because the individual is very much a part of the society he can't alleviate himself from the society  what i feel is only the education and the economical status makes a woman to feel very liberated  so every woman must be educated and must be employed  then only they can be free taking decisions economically they will feel so  what do you feel about it  well i feel uh now uh we have been given equal chances with men and uh almost in all uh position even women are have been working  i mean only thing we have to utilise the chances properly and  get into proper positions and make woman come up somewhere educate them basically and then make them also come up and  be one with men  i totally disagree that the women they are not taking up any initiatives  see for the last two or three decades as or so we find that women they've reached a real good status to over the men  in each and every field that they have participated  say now we find that that women they are given a voice  they are given a platform rather to voice their own opinions  in each and every field be in press be in writing fiction  writing poetry they have come up in a great way but don't you think that that is more an exception than a rule how many women assert themselves  if you take an average indian woman you take an average indian woman i think the indian woman does not think more than marriage and settling down in life  an indian women's ultimate objective in life is to marry and settle down  you take you take an educated indian woman in a indian society she might have done her ma or ph d but what is ultimate objective she wants to get married  this marriage is the ultimate ideal of society or an individual it cannot be this no but marriage is just a part of uh life you know but when we're getting ourselves educated there is no point sitting at home as such doing ph d's and all that hey you can just sit with your ba or   no that is not the opinion of   that's what i'm saying it's  more an exception than a rule  it is more an exception than a rule  perhaps a few of you who are doing a ph d think that way  how many come to the ma classes by the way  no no this is the situation i mean it's bad  but the situation seems to have taken a change over the past  i challege that   they've but far to far to gradual to have any any impact on society but i still feel that there is a percent of change  as she said our's is a patriarchal society and to move away from the patriarchal society it takes some time  it's not so easy  exuse me you are talking about marriage it's necessary you do because there is no sec security for a single woman  she is not respected that's a fact no but i think his point was   i i'm not i'm not advocating  uh i'm not advocating a woman being a spinster okay   you've got me wrong  i am not trying to say that  but what i'm i am only taking the exception to a  woman's ultimate objective being marriage  that is wicked of the society that's what  i've been trying to tell you no but i have one question to ask what is you   why should it be why should it be  you you have been educated you should learn to be independent now one second  but who gives that kind of notion that that's going to be your objective   it's a mother it's a father it's a brother at home yeah or you know you you are taught even when a child is born  look at all that the advertising that we listen to  the bank says you save save money for your son's  education and save for your daughter's marriage   marriage  you are talking  so its there you you are talking you're talking of conditioning of a person okay  a person an ess essential an individual an individual should assert himself no that as you say is a very utopian concept no no i i strongly disagree   because an individual can not exist  please do not dismiss it as a utopian i strongly disgree with that view  it is not utopian  it's very much practical only we refuse to be practical that is all what you say a woman should does not talk about it don't look at her objective point of her i am not i'm not being objective  good going i think we'll have a change in the topic now uh we will talk of the examination system uh to which all of us are agreed to  yes why don't you begin  exam system what do you feel that uh you are getting your rights the exam present kind of exams no ma'am i feel examination should be abolished i mean at specially at your graduate under graduate level  post graduate level  i mean they don't help the students in any way  infact they sort of hamper the pleasure one receives from learning  you don't learn for pleasure you learn for marks  so it should be done away does everyone subscribe to this view what would you like to say ramkumar no what i still feel is there should be some way in which the lecturer should be in a position to gauge the performance of the students and one good way is examination  but what i still feel is the continuous assessment system  will work out in a better way rather than having a three hour examination yeah  say at the fag end of the session to evaluate the students no don't you think uh that the question of a teacher  gauging a students performance is utilatarian  that is a high utilitarian concept you are prostituting knowledge no not at all  how do you claim why why do you want to gauge a students performence  students knowledge you learn a few words   a few words   you've to place a student where  where he stands   that's equally important because at the higher studies   as i feel  as i feel that is what i am saying it is a highly utilatarian concept you want to test the students so that you know whether you sit for this whether you sit for this whether you sit for this   that's it  whether he is qualified for any promotion or not will have to be determined by the lecturer  listen examinations don't don't examinations really do not uh speak of their real ability as such  your abilities are quite different from what you something that you take for harassment   well i am   that's about the evaluation system  yes one shade of the ability is that the lecturers  they test when they evaluate the students   what you know is from the nature   whether from a guide simply use it he may not really get the spirit of   that's not i mean to say  the continuous assessment system is far better of than having an examination at the end of the year or at the end of couple of years no no there so many problems in continuous assessment that have come out now  even if the  i don't think students really feel confident   it's again putting them into a kind of uh modern slavery to the department concerned  and that has also been uh pointed out by many and not every teacher can be really made objective   no what i really wanted is to make the  objective elements of the teacher comes into play then  but what i still feel is you've different means and methods by which you can evaluate the students to continue the assessment  you can say introduce a seminar pattern the panel discussion group discussion ask the students speak out in class  regularly and then assess the student instead of asking him to sit for a three hours examination  and then assess him on that basis   yeah in comparision yes in comparision yes  no but uh when you are taking a seminar or something like that no one or two students from the class only uh read the others you cannot say all of them are listening in the class no he should have been given a topic to the before the class   i mean but when you are asked i mean when you are asked to write an exam all of us have to write no each one of the student is asked to present a paper   should be given then yeah obviously  but then we have other uh difficulties as well  say the class strength is massive you can't uh expect each and every student to present in a seminar  or ask each and every student to participate in a group discussion especially in general english classes where the strength is over seventy  so the case is whether examination should be conducted at all  or they shouldn't be conducted at all  now i suppose we've boiled down to that level no that's a basic question but ultimately in practice i think it is used more as a screening  for employer to select you know they give prescribe qualifications and that provide the kind of uh screening for them  know some kind of uh proof that they have selected somebody with certain certain qualification yeah its very whether that qualification really uh matters and whether it really gives them the skills that are necessary for the job is not all yeah only for government coughs employment  but when you go to the pr private sector it so happens that they have their own means and methods of testing the students  see normally they take for example if it's going to be a salesman's job what they do is they have a group discussion they have an interview no even then there is a basic qualification basic qualification is always there  some where somehow somewhere you'll have to  scren screen test   screen  but do we always feel that uh you know uh we are a mixed ability group normally in the classroom  uh with different backgrounds and all all that  i've always felt that uh the differentiation between a mediocre student and a good student never really emerges from the system that we have at present  you now the ma it is very marginal  the difference is very marginal  i don't know how uh you react to it   it's a maybe we're more interested in having a national syllabus and merging each and every type of institution into one  like the cd cis tamil nadu state no that is structuralising knowledge you can't we can't accept that  that is that is something very  rigid  yeah  you can't structuralise something and say you compartmentalise  you can't compartmenatalise knowledge it's unethical because you don't give license no you don't give  give a student access to other branches of knowledge when you compartmentalise knowledge  give license  this is not compartmentalising knowledge what you mean to say is that see we've different systems as the central board of secondary education icse then we've the state board each and every state having its own uh curricular like you know or syllabi  now once you merge have one syllabus for each and  for every student who studies in india then may be we were in better position to evaluate students performence  no but ramkumar what what you find in the syllabus is not a guarantee to what is done in the classroom 
shall i speak rajee start   how's tandon   he he i don't know i didn't see him  after coming back  uh how's bansal may i know how's bansal and how is he doing very nice yeah they came to meet me yesterday uh meet you  uh it so happened i i saw him and what about your cousin brother there  oh yeah he is fine fine with his family  you know how did you celebrate your birthday  oh i had lot of fun yaar  started off like my sister-in-law has made a lovely ice-cream cake and all know laughter  my mouth is watering yeah yeah it should and then laughter then i did i tell you that they gave me a blue nice lovely blue salvar - set and she realises now and a nice make-up kit also  oh really and in the afternoon we went to poona poona city because he's staying twenty-five kilometres away from poona  uh uhn  then they had many so how many days did you stay there  i stayed there for ten days  how much did you study there   you'd been for study there yeah but then i didn't study much  as i kept falling sick didn't sit i didn't she has got to the trip for falling sick only so you had good health for eight days or so  ah uhm  so what did you do  kept waiting for you  ah  you must have done something useful you no i mean i've been to shirdi ah shirdi uhm so  i came back with the   at shirdi na it's uh uh shi saibaba's shrine   right  is there any other god other than saibaba no in shirdi no  this is shir di saibaba saibaba i've i've  heard that  you have heard about it very powerful no  actually he is a i think he's a m his religion is unknown uhm uhm  his uh  uhm uhm   what's his actual story  which story behind him he was just some saint moving around having uh alms and all uhm  and he used to help people poor people around once a he used to celebrate diwali at his place  too much uh with too much of lighting lighting of the lamps and all  uhm  uhm uhm  o once one year british government refused to give oil  uhm uhm  and he asked these cough people you  put water instead of oil  so people said ki water how will it burn  he put uhm they put water and then he he said okay now burn like that  so they light the lighting of the lamps with water uh  on diwali made him very much famous  uhm   uh  uhm i see that's how he's one word  and from them the lata mangeshkar is the person who has uh personally seen him uhm uhm one of my aunty who's personally seen him she is no more now she died last year i see   she's personally seen that fellow uhm uhm  they used to go to that saint  i see   uhm uhm  when did he first arrive  no in the nineteenth century only uhm i think  uhm  and uh uh this he had predicted about uh lata mangeshkar being too famous you know uh  in fact uh she is the prasad that uh god has given to you told his mother her mother actually  uhm got it  uh   uhm  this is the basic story about him and i think even my father experienced he never believes in many god but he believes in the saibaba  uhm  well he had to collect too much of funds in the office only he has put office only  the party that didn't seem to be giving money and all  we were passing through shirdi and he just said that if uh fair work is no more uhm  we have to accomplish the back uhm i will come to you  uhm   uhm  i see  and those party that party which never gave money   uhm gave shelled out money like that   uhm  shelled out  he came back and then he said two words  but actually my father never believes in  what about you you are a firm believ believer  firm believer i told you no after coming like  we've seen about this saibaba from one word  uhm  as you like do you know tamilians give more importance to this saibaba of their south indian gives importance to the bangalore saibaba uhm   you've heard about him na   uhm  yes i've heard of him uhm that but then we don't believe in ah  we believe in direct contact with god   ah  no does it seem  it's just like that so there are lot of followers in trivandrum specially saibaba's this but bangalore saibaba and that i've heard  i've heard many stories about his far and this thing you know  oh like  from his main devotees of course they have very good stories about him but from other people i have heard bad stories also about the saibaba  so anyway we uhm we prefer to remain neutral on this subject as such you know  no but uh even i have heard but i have heard only good events  uhm got it just like about rajneesh  ah rajneesh i know him   devout neg negative right right see even about him quite it is quite negative like  he is also using like something about his political powers and all that chandraswami then again  ah ha chandraswami  but then like we don't go to that sai you know please if you want to follow that's fair like yeah present   yeah   it's only that we don't interfere  but those people who've actually established themselves this uh at this saibaba uhm uhm  he said he is a one word because he never had money he never had power right that's the thing that's the thing we need then the moment he died uhm uhm  and when he died they were saying was hindus fought  that he was a hindu  mohammedans fought that he was a mohammedan and now what to do with that i see  when they came back to his grave   uhm uhm  they removed that cloth that cloth garment garment and uh saw  there was uh no body there was only flowers  so half flowers were taken in bunch uhm uhm  and half flowers were put in mazar that mazar  is made in like uh shirdi   uhm uhm  oh that's it  and now they have uh literally shown that uh uhm direct telecast uh everywhere in every corner of the temples you know   ah they are having uh t v   ah  oh yes  they've shown the whole pooja going on uhm in the temple  uhm they have arrangement about it carrying of the palanquin  uhm uhm nine fifteen to ten pm  i stayed uh by nine i had finished uhm so i thought  i will wait then i just couldn't wait because because i'll  miss the bus  uhm   uhm uhm   uhm  how many hours does it take to go there  twelve hours  twelve hours  near near if you have a vehicle you can uh reach within eight hours uhm uhm   eig not eight nine hours nine nine  over night journey  over night you'll manage  eight thirty you start from here uhm you'll  reach poona at four no yeah  then from poona you go to ahmednagar three hours journey   uhm uhm it's about four and a half hours  uhm   yeah   uhm uhm  ah do we get straight uh buses from here direct buses direct bus is eight thirty bus is here  evening evening bus morning morning eight thirty yeah night ten o'clock a bus is there but it is  inter- state bus  so very difficult to get that  but you can go by this uh bus also at nine uh eight eight thirty  go at eight thirty and uh reach by about eight  o'clock uhm and it's better you know and you get a chance to come back on very same day   uhm  yeah that's right because ten at ten o'clock there is a bus coming from uh kopargaon to hubli  right inter-state uhm and it's for five minutes stay there stand there so how long did you spend there  just one hour or two hours or so  ah one hour uhm uhm we caught we caught the next bus came  you got the bus and came back   it's because i was alone and i've got some company in shirdi uhm  they i can mean of coming in the morning na  so alone means  uhm   right  how this place is shirdi  uh in the sense  uh either like uh business other than that  other than being no its saibaba's place or it is developed or   business   no its  before it is saibaba's place it was too different too much now a five star hotel was there  it become developed  really they are making more arrangements not bad beautiful buildings now uhm uhm  and quite a lot changing you know uhm uhm the all office buisness people are business people  they loot out uhm too much  office   uhm  and other people  so it's a well developed place no yes it is  now it's well developed place before it was not to like it you know about that place through the saibaba only  hey you know i don't watch movies and others  right other than that i've never heard of this place at all  it is famous place  and there's one more place it's called  shaneshwar math form here  uhm that uh village got a speciality uh  and that is being tested my my father was in one word  and said  he was going on tour some driver told ki  here there is a place uhm  no robbers and no one came do robbering robbery  over that place  uh   uhm  vow  and if somebody robs or something uhm uhm  from this village uhm and after seventeen kilometer  circumference of that village uh he'll go blind  and until he replaces the thing he can't get his eyes   uhm uhm   uhm   uh  that is that day and uh many examples have been cited but uh i don't know whether it's true or not  only thing true is that my father went to the village   uh  he saw uh the house that was having just a door to keep the cats and uh dogs away from the house  no lock no house was having a lock  he went inside the house  old man he saw the old man and he got up saw him because he didn't recognise my father so he went to sleep back again   uhm  ahn uhm he he knows that nobody can take out anything  yes that's also world for this place to be invited uhm that's true  this uh same story i've heard is in trivandrum there is a temple uhm uhm goddess goddess temple it's  called a archaga devi temple  and there also we've heard stories like uh two men trying to get in   uhm  uhm  and uh these two robbers you know suddenly they got in the temple trying to steal the goddesses you know deity as such  and then suddenly they were blind and  and the main priest of this temple in his dream you know  like it it's as if goddess came to him and said see there are robbers in the temple go fast  he went he saw these two men you know and they were lying down blinded  they were you know motionless as he didn't know what to do  then immediately he called the police and they were caught see no robbery can take place uhm in that temple as such   uhm  so which is that temple   archagadevi temple   archagadevi  yeah it's very very powerful also  nei and we feel there is nothing like something like god but there's something some superpower  but there is you know there is there is  even in ajmer you know uhn what you go and tie a thread uhm  and you say what you want   uhn   uhm  uh you mean uh the one uh the temple where you can tie a thread around a tree or something like that  mean there're  uhm  i've seen that only in movies i told you know how these things  it's there it's there in ajmer you know it is  uh it is actually uh moinuddin chisti and ak ak  akbar made that uh mazar and a temple there   uh uh <,. masjid you call that you know uh  and that's too famous  you go uh you want you want to tie  and when it is full you turn back and fulfilled you come back   uh uh   uh   uh   tie  oh it's like that and people believe that it is like it is true  and even in vaishnavadevi uhm  north you know they say we hear in that all this no they say until and unless you are not called you can't go i see  cannot go if any body wants to go also you'll meet with an accident something will happen   uhm   i see   it's like that uhm i mean you just can't go why can't we still going on uhn i doesn't mean a few words  there also people say like  you can go only when the goddess wants you and there's  one more uh area called garbyodh  and even a fat person double fat uh anybody even that sumati  you've seen no  if uh she's pure bhakt  she wants to cross she will cross  and even if a slim person like you any slim lady you can take also even if you take jayshree for sake she goes she cannot go   there's a big or you can go go inside and  you've to come out  if you come out uhm if you go and come out  uhm that means uh you are a very pure person in heart like  uhm   uhm  pure person at heart means uhm you really haven't done anything bad and you just you've got a free free from this life but after that there'll be no life for you like no more births they speak of the deeds yeah yeah after this there's going to be no re  reincarnation ah i see 
so when did you come ? i came today morning at seven o'clock  and i reached here i came by dakshin express from delhi first from amritsar i took a train and i came by ac fare  and from there i have to take another train which is this dakshin  express and uh i took second ac there  and i don't know how they're going to pay me now  laughs  there is more than the first class laughs   it's a pleasant experience  it was a pleasant experience but also very tiring this train is uh it takes thirty-six hours  and there is a faster train andhra express which takes just twenty-four hours  but the timing doesn't suit uhm how things are moving in punjab now-a-days ? punjab is much better now  and as you must have read in the papers as they say  eighty percent of the problem is solved  it is really solved because one can lead a normal life now  but twenty percent problem is there  twenty percent means that you don't feel it you see i mean crime is always there  so you can say some extortionist some terrorist whatever may be there  but for uh for practical purposes i mean when the life was disturbed that thing was not there what do you think about this ayodhya problem now ? i think it's a bad thing whatever has happened and uh i think the educated hindu people   they they also think the silent majority thinks that it's a wrong thing  i mean this is exactly what happened in punjab you know when  the akalis   do punjabi's think is it's  uh something wrong yeah will they be in favour of bjp ? no they think it's wrong  because a similar thing happened with the akalis  uh they started listening to people who were not within the party  like that bindrawala or uh modern things that worsened the terrorists or whatever so now bgp bjp has taken orders from uh  sadhus and sanyasis uhm yes so they don't face the same problem what i feel that it could turn out to be that way   sadhus and sanyasis  oh so it may turn out like a boomrang yes it i think it will be like that because you see  uh people majority as i said majority of the people they are aware of all this now  even the uneducated people many of them they want to live in peace  and all this disturbs peace  some people feel that there is a kind of new awareness  and because of that bjp is likely to be benefitted  there's no awareness  these are all political stunts i think  oh well are you happy here satyam ?  it's too early to say that but so far it's  fine  and uh i've to be careful of the mosquitoes here  laughter  and uh i think it should be fine and i had long desired to come here because uh it is the what you say mecca for uh english  english  you you don't have mosquitoes there in your home ? no we have mosquitoes there but mosquitoes of ciefl are famous laughter  i mean that what you told  uh you see the mosquitoes are there mosquito curtains are not there and uh  no you see we in amritsar there's it's  an extreme weather ah ha i mean it's very cold there now and it will be hotter than what is here now  so when it's severe cold mosquitoes will die out and  severe wint uh summers they'll again die  ah ha   mosquitoes are there  uhm so they are only some laughter  so you are free from mosquitoes  not throughout the year but of course and here you see the mosquitoes are well bred laughs uhm yes so there they die and then again they have to come up and then they attack  but i don't know why they can't control it  i mean in uh when i'm uh during the mosquito season in like amritsar and many cities especially in uh let's say some good colonies the municipalities they spray  so if the muncipality of hyderabad so what would be the reason then ? i think uh there should be a spray in the campus the mosquitoes we won't have them in the campus simple reason is if you want to control you can control if you don't laughter and so if ciefl is doing such good work in languages   ah it should do this little work of killing mosquitoes also  laughs   ah  so after uh hearing so much about uh ciefl  uhm and coming over here uhm uh what exactly you want to do ?  uhm   uhm  see actually i came here of course for refresher course that's all right to get refreshed laughter  and uh a friend of mine says uh the hyderabad is famous for pearls  he has given me some money to buy some  so i've up to look out for somebody who knows what pearls are because i don't know what they are haan  and there are a lot of uh artificial uh sellers uhm  so i will have to buy some pearls for a friend of mine and uh  i will visit uh there's a museum they say  haan   uhm  uh salarjung and uh a fort   that's why i wanted five days a week  and i also told dr prakasham to arrange something for atleast people from outside yes i mean you're you are an outsider yes yes  though of course you must have seen everything because you have been staying here  but still there are many could be many people who haven't  or a few of them so they have made the programme very tight   it's very correct  and they treat us as uh school children laughter   because they don't allow or they dont give any time to  they they can have the same number of sessions same number of speakers and uh with uh one lecture say if it's one and half hours make it one hour and with teacher there also he just keeps would you would you like to come out with uh your idea  when we find something is impo imposed from above uhm uhm then people accept it as it is  and  uh yes they don't want they say the ugc says so many working hours uhm sometimes the ugc says and we find uh what goes in political circle so i think what ever you think in academic also  i think what they should do is they should make it from  let's say five-thirty to six-thirty everyday  one hour is added there  cut off saturday and adding one hour means missing one hour  because laughter ) when the programme is too long you will naturally cut it short no in maharashtra what they say that there is  adeshraj uhm and as when something comes from above it could not be challenged whether it is rational or irrational  accept it and act upon it   uhm  uhm see that's on paper you see  no that laughter so   so little i requested them why not to turn some of the sessions into library sessions yeah and then all of us could have got benefitted what is this project that they are talking about ? you can have any project ah of your choice  ah  uhm if project means we can you have to say have particular topic you have to work on that topic and this is the way the thing could be done dealt  this is what you have to   achha so you just uh  you know synopsis of the project what is it ? no they don't give  haan  they don't give you have to have a data uhm for uh yes if you have a problem uhm uhm and then you work on that then you work on that either in the library or field or whatever it maybe so it's just like writing of the paper  that's all  that's all  suppose i want to work on two novels will it do ? oh yes  why two ? one one one yes that is nei but thay are also saying that you have to present a paper at the end that is the same work  when you work on a particular say a  nei nei they were talking about two different things that everybody has to speak for about ten minutes on something and then several others  nei once you have a project  uhn definitely you've to present a paper   nei but that's compulsory for all ? no that ten minutes business is compulsory  it's that is compulsory  so that again a paper and project is again a paper  no both in all you have faster than one or two words that will be for every body that is for everybody right  and the project the problem that you work on you have to present that also you have half an hour choice half an hour and then discussion discussion is also going to be about cross question and all what we have so i think the four speaker is going to be just this that is a just  uh first ten minutes talk and then half an hour talks  by the participants  see for pretty long time that practice teaching sessions are there  and still we find they are not ready to come out of that  so here also it's a kind of practice teaching  yeah  and as we find these things are not there we are there laughter  it is uh it is going to be you you are going to have b ed teaching no, not i but see paper reading comes to that  actually see in uh one months time is it possible for you to present a really something that can be called the research paper ? yeah on that project that's that's way research take here that's right  see when you get some grant from ugc or something like that then you have to present something  uhm uhm in one form or the other  no but i don't think uh this must be the case in other refresher courses might not be this is a kind of thing in other refresher courses what atmosphere you find  atleast you find here after noon sessions are there there are no afternoon sessions  i did my first at pune and what atmosphere no refresher  so no afternoon sessions nothing like that  achha you've done one only from nine to one and then completely free  now they were i think about five uh different refresher courses now this yes one is uh one is at jaipur uh pune uh at yes vishakapatnam no no trivandrum shimla  my catchment area was simla  uh but i didn't want to go there and from cold amritsar to colder simla say laughter  the freezing point  so i wanted to come to number number one of course hyderabad  uh and i wanted to come and also that it'll be nice here in my case what happened we were at the ulakh vidyanagar  shriraman and myself uhm uhm  and shriraman is the co-ordinator co-ordinator here  so why not uh why don't you come to hyderabad  uhm uhm   co-ordinator  okay it's alright  that's how i'm in hyderabad  laughter  and we've only six from out of hundred and five applicants yes that's what you were of course very fortunate very fortunate laughter but what what must be the criterion for this ? one criterion he has mentioned laughter  that is the one  that's right that is the one that's right so one he has mentioned no but what i must be find even for that the other things are there i brought my english from one word now i'm  on there correspondence department oh you think you are only not because uh he knows me and i know him  that's not the thing  that way i was lucky to know dr prakashan also laughter  you know how it is particularly what i like uh what you said  a few words in sanskrit   he's a very laughter  he is a very practical man  he's uh i did my m phil from patiala ah he was there in the department called anthropological linguistic  oh  that department was started by this professor called professor ranjit gill  he is in jnu in what is that department of uh uh department of english  ah   oh  technologist i think school of language school of language he is a professor there uhm  he had started all that department  and dr kasiwal was also there  and he taught us phoenetics that time and i know him since then  and very  uhn  but uh so what what is appli no what is applicable to me  the same thing is applicable to him also laughter  hey you prakash laughter 
i am malini bhattacharya  i am anita working as a language assistant in c i i l  how do you like mysore   it's okay i miss my friends in hyderabad  don't you miss your home  i stayed two years in hyderabad so i got adjusted to hostel life and didn't miss it but  here i miss my friends in hyderabad don't you have friends here  i do have but the close ones i miss i can't say i don't have friends what about you how do you like mysore  okay the climate is nice the place is nice but even the same case with me also i do miss home and do miss my friends  but otherwise how is it how is the place  quite good isn't it how do you feel okay fine did you go around mysore  not much uh you see we have such busy schedules  it's so many we get less time you have a little socialising to do and then on one word so  not much but okay  i have been to a few places and uh and the remaining few i plan to see later  how about you  uh i have been to the palace and spaces uh places like that  i went to chamundi hills  okay it was nice and i joined here much later than you so  i think it takes some time to get used to my work also yeah how do you like the work  okay isn't it quite challenging well  i do find it interesting i hope you'll also find it interesting  what about this weekend what are you planning to do  nothing as such  maybe i will go to city see how it is how life is here  how about going to ooty some day  how far is it from here  uh its as far as my knowledge goes its around one fifty kilometres  so how many hours it will take  by bus not more than six hours  it should be actually around four but since you have the mountain routes and the one word it will come around say not more than  six hours am i wrong  i have no idea actually but uh is the journey comfortable by bus  or i suppose the project people all of us could hire a vehicle and go would that uh yeah one word  would that be very nice i mean it depends on what uh all of us agree upon isn't it  yeah then you have to talk to everybody and decide about yeah and uh but before that uh for the weekend we can plan something and go somewhere no  spend some time outside atleast away from your work  uh not this week actually uh this week i am going down to the friend's  place in uh bangalore  i am planning to leave saturday morning and be and i'll  be coming back around uh say sunday evening  what about you what are you planning to do since i'll not be around  then i'll have to look for somebody else because  laugh i still don't know many people around  okay somebody else's some somebody else is there i can go to city atleast and have some good food have you ever been to ooty  i went when i was very young like a child almost so i don't remember anything clearly  i went just uh this year around june  it's a one word place  yeah i heard so  yeah and i  it's a nice place for honeymoon couples   one word  uh laughs  that is the main you're one word to go there  laughs  so how do you find the difference from hyderabad do you find any different  and you have been in calcutta also  yeah i loved calcutta better than say mysore or hyderabad that's because uh attachment to the family  not with the city  uh it's both laughs   it's attachment with the place   how do you find it there  i found calcutta very lively city yeah like which do you prefer  it's calcutta or siligudi  no i am basically from calcutta so i would like to uh stay in calcutta no but you spent most of your uh  actually when i was   you were in siligudi isn't it yeah but we were forced to stay in siligudi because my parents were working there but nobody actually liked the place much because we used to miss our home our friends uh relatives everybody because everybody was in calcutta but how many years uh you were in siligudi  i was there after my birth i spend some four five years in calcutta when i was in uh siligudi that means the entire span school life i spent there  but still you have no liking for the place i don't have really i found it a bit boring  is it  i like the place and the activities in calcutta and calcutta somehow like wherever you go in india  it's different   yeah i mean it's it's city of joy  yeah it is different  you can do something or the other and keep yourself busy busy   that's how it is  compare to that even hyderabad i don't like so much but okay in hyderabad i had the friend circle yeah so we slowly develop  so   a few words  we could make the place enjoyable well did you watch the match on t v today uh yesterday no i couldn't because i was still in the office and this is what i miss  i think i should get one pocket radio or something  laughs  but it's so disgusting everytime the team keeps losing i mean something should be done isn't it  there is something wrong over yeah   something is going wrong somewhere something is wrong with the yeah indian team i think they don't have that uh team spirit or something  yeah  team spirit that's lacking  because uh i mean and that's why they keep losing yeah initially we had problem with uh they had problem with all the captains like when kapil was the captain they had problems  very badly  they had then other who became the captain they had problems  now they can't possibly blame tendulkar because he is doing a very good job very good job  but still they're losing there must be something wrong with them like whole team  it's high time all of them got together and did something about it instead of losing each and every match and  we just look forward to those eleven to do something for that  yeah  yeah  so you are interested in cricket also yeah  what else  uh i haven't played cricket really in the formal sense in college we had a ground where sometimes we used to put on gloveses for the heck of saying we were playing cricket  in fact the right pose i mean the boy used to carry the bat also was never taught but okay we picked up on our own but i uh play tennis and uh badminton i love the game  so it just goes on  and what about uh books and music and how do you keep yourself busy in leisure time i read lots of books only english  you know both the languages you have uh edge like  uh you know telugu and bangla both yeah  so which books you prefer reading  telugu and bangla i am more comfortable in bangla frankly speaking i haven't read any book in telugu i see  so so even the telugu very famous poems are coming out now on i know never one word  you have a very famous uh feminist poet like jayprabha and all so you haven't gone through  no i haven't  i have gone through but i didn't understand  i see somehow i read some of the translated poems of jayprabha and i like them a lot yeah but its sequence are not understanding if you went through it in telugu true because my vocabulary is only the limited and the  coloquial sort of what you call how much of vocabulary can you get at home  i understand  outside it was entirely different  no i didn't really pick up the language as such but i can converse and like that   so when you write to your parents which language you write in  to my father english to my mother telugu to my grandparents telugu aunt telugu so you know the written variety of telugu also  the written varieties i write down what i speak that should not be one word  but don't you find any difference between the okay letter writing would be uh would have a different style like it won't be exactly spoken variety of a language that i have picked up to some extent with the replies i keep getting from whoever i had written   did you ever had paper on telugu  no actually two words have in m a  till your m a  so with my one word  okay i two words  so don't you find it very uhm different like you being a telugu uh using another language and more comfortable in another language which is not your mother tongue so how do you feel how do you take it uh actually uh some thing more like one word  laughs  uh i haven't thought about this actually from childhood only i was brought up in the same atmosphere like if papa still has shifted to another place i would have got the feeling of not having comfortable in a particular language but on the whole i think it doesn't matter exactly how we go about chosing or selecting a language  so you are really an indian  thank you laughs  what about today evening  okay we might go somewhere no  because if sitting here and uh i think yeah  doing nothing is very boring  yeah  you are really getting boring yeah and uh as far as when i haven't yet started my work   yeah  even i haven't because i just joined and i have to know like what exactly i am supposed to do i have got an idea but uh yeah  no but that is uh  even uh okay even after office hours like no what else  that's true and so we can go somewhere else  that's true  make the evening enjoyable  so we can go somewhere to eat how do you perhaps  like it  perhaps  uh  i am thinking about but only certain things i mean not all the time so okay i am one word to some extent we are usually blamed because people say the girl is  uh a few words   a few words  don't talk about like this laughs   it's just food and food and food  seventy-five percent of fair income is spent on food but don't you ever notice once like we had a teacher in  uh hyderabad university who used to say like uh for breakfast you should come to south and for uh lunch okay you can go anywhere but the snacks you should go to calcutta laughs  because i think she not only came there you can't get any where else no i remember novels and the chalks  see you don't get it anywhere no else beside say west bengal in general  no  yeah  and famous rasgulla of course  haan  you can't get it anywhere else  i don't think laughs there is any  person who would have not tasted it  are you crazy for sweet   i know one word  not exactly but uh calcutta sweets i think they do have a little flavour and that i haven't got anywhere in india yeah that's it  but i tend to be very crazy for sweets than chocolates so   i'm actually i actually go for good food  i don't like quantity but quality should be there yeah laughs  so whatever it is whichever country whatever preparations i don't mind but it should be tasting good yeah tasty  that's what matter   but here   do you have chinese food  yeah i enjoy it  uh a few words so lousy it was not chinese because the chinese they never put sugar in chao min  yes sugar in chao min they put tomato yeah i mean i could have made a better preparation  that's not a chinese preparation  half of the people don't know how to cook them no   don't know how to cook and you should go to a typical chinese restaurant  but why so that you have lots of these chinese restaurants in calcutta while its comparatively less less  in mysore or even in hyderabad why is it so   less   i do have a feeling that in south specially  the people uh do go for their food preparation mostly no one word  i haven't seen people uh going for other dishes no and i think another reason is the percentage of people who spent money on outside eating is comparatively less  on restaurant than in the north in general  even i suppose the punjabis and uh the gujratis also do go in for all this stuff  on restaurant   less  yeah they do 
uh you know the university  a few words as it is of course we speak on one or two words  uh so specially when i heard about this indian english today morning i felt uh that uh he did not specifically point out uh what exactly is indian english  because uh in our room there is a maharashtrian and uh there is a punjabi kannadian kannadiga and   we've some of telugu speaking people  but when all of us were speaking conversing in the conversation  i didn't find much difference one from the other  but uh in the class room situation sometimes uh we find  students they're trying to speak in english uh they bring in that uh telugu accent but uh they don't have much to refer  uh when i teach also whenever i teach use the correct accent  sometimes i've to come down to their level and uh speak otherwise they may not be able to learn from this yes yes  they make take up for example word like uh work uh  you know unless they spell it sometimes they may not be able to read it up even when i read  uh  so at that level uh sometimes uh a butler  speaking uh somebody who are influenced by people who are speaking english picked up words  such people when they are speaking there may be some difference in accent or uh their use in the words  but generally the educated uh people i don't find much variation but in uh accent there may be a variation  so what do you think about that variation ? of course i agree with you to so many time  but still i think the influence of the vernacular language  is there on indian english  for example the latters are not in the habits of  pronouncing the for example there is a a a  jocular statement also  if anyone is going there in the veranda  if a a bengali happens to see him he just says like this he's wandering in the verandah   he won't pronounce the v such a differences may be there of all all the accents accent that accent may be different accent may be different but as far as the language and other parts are concerned there may not be much difference  only accent and intonation may be different because  every individual is habituated to a particular accent and intonation  depending upon the vernacular language which he is say have just habituated to use from the time of birth till the end  these vocal chords should be adjusted in such a way that uh they always uh they're in favour of a such a kind of particular intonation and accent   that's why the difference if at all is the difference is there in indian english depending on the various states in this country  it is mainly as you said it is mainly which is not an intonation and accent as far as the language part is concerned  vocabulary is concerned one need not find uh naturally you won't find much difference  so what i wanted to impress upon you is uh the influence of english on vernacular languages definitely is there   yeah  in even in telugu sometimes when we use the word like uh master yes english word  yeah   yes  but it has come down to the level of uh becoming completely vernacular word master i know so that difference is there and i can understand that and the same way these languages uh might be influencing english  and the indian writers writing in english especially persons like r k narayan and uh raja rao then come down to one word  raja rao made an experiment he made an experiment  even uh r k narayan was writing he tried specifically to bring in indian humour flavour indian kind of words in indian english uh so that way deliberately or unintentionally these people might have brought some words of indianism or indian words into the  literature part  but indian english as it is because whole india is filled by speaking english english in india  so indian english as it is gramatically or uh  vocabulary wise or lexican uh what you call it  then i don't mind such difference  see because uh we were taught only what is the standardise english  and you know the newspapers magazines so magazines is just uh mostly trying to imitate uh american english  specially these uh film magazines or uh the one word  then american english because they are more uh stylish  stylish  so british english is easier than easier because they have brought such a changes which you which uh which adopt and make you easy but then uh another kind of uh people we come across these days uh the children special who are taken in uh uh christian schools or uh missionary uh urbanised schools say public schools that we all know means special group their accent pronunciation is something very artificial yes you see most note particular group and particular group they alone can understands what they speak  but in general if they rightly try to speak to other people uh those sentences mean their sometimes artifical pronunciation   they're trying to drag a new word in the conversation unnecessary accent and something attracting something  means that is another kind of trend which going on going on in all catholics so another thing is uh they isolate themeselves  feeling that they are uh quiet superior because they are able to speak so fluently that language and american american  language  so that trend is formed  but what i what really to grasp from uh from his lecture from this lecture  what exactly is the meaning of english ? mean how really it differs from this standardized british english or uh whatever you may call it   from his lecture   nei the language as people say there is nothing like real standard because uh people use it as uh i mean if you come to telugu telugu is spoken in different styles and  different ways and though we mannerise literature in telugu and cinemas in telugu is using a particular kind of standerdised english telugu   yes there's different styles  that way some people are influenced  but if you come to a place like uh hyderabad and it's  mostly more uh your accent is completely urdu kind  when you go to orissa in uh berrakpur uh in orissa oriya oriya is there completely  when you go to chittoor definitely you'll find the  southern influence is there  see the word completely one word uh one or two words in telugu in in telugu we use it   kannada influence  yes so that dialectical differences you find in every language and otherwise the language cannot survive  yeah  you heard some time ago as you made it into request but what exactly is indian english ?  i'm unable to ring with that  yes of course this is how from his speech we would gain  uh i think one word but to uh we can try and analyse  indian english i think it is more identifiable based on literature other than languages uh i know correct  uh i know  yeah that's my point as far as language is concerned uhm we cannot find much difference except this latest information that are going on there in in england or in american whose mother tongue is english basically the vocabulary grammar part and all those things   they they remain constant  yet even in those things there may be some slight changes because their mother tongue is uh english and they are authorised to bring changes depending upon the daily usage   uhm   english  whereas it is our cultivated language foreign language  we are not authorised to bring changes in grammar and all those things  that's why we remain as we were  where did you get those uh wood laws entry the grammar vocabulary and all those things were uh almost all standardised in a particular way  still we carry on those things without bringing any uh latest changes  as far as the language is concerned that's true  but in my opinion indian english differs completely in a way in all literature indo-anglican literature  that makes all the difference uh about this ind  indian english  because it cannnot survive without uh literature of course  what i think is spoken english if someone has uh gradual tone in his speech that spoken english as far as spoken english spoken english accent will be different some new words might have come some of the indianism might have come in there  but basically english language as it is i don't think we can go for transform very much to, branding of indian english as much as we brand american english american english  there is much difference in american because uh they specifically they took a lot of efforts  they changed it intentionally they did it  uhm i mean they created their own dictionary  means they don't like to call it an american english they want to call it american language american language  but uh i in america also they have various kinds of influence spanish language you know mean the negroes going they have their own kind of accent  so even there the difference is there but uh they are identified themselves with american language  that way if compared to that i don't find anything uh very much significant in indian english  uh i think indians pronounce or the accent of indians are much better than the french men speaking english or right yet  speaking english   yes  but in the african continent there is a specific uh influence of their own language and their own accent kind of english  if you read uh article in english novels you find that but in india i don't think it has gone to that extent to brand the indian english  may be i don't know anything eh no no you are correct totally correct  what i'm asking is there's no much uh difference as far as the language part is concerned grammar vocabulary and all those things are concerned  we can't find any difference between english english and the indian english  but indian english english can claim to be different can claim to be unique basically literature that is these brought out from here because the whole indo-anglican literature is based mainly of course mainly i have stressed on the indian tradition indian things indian culture over whatever a piece of creative creative literature that uh so called indo- anglican literature if you refer to it prose poetry novel whatever it may be  basically  of course  but there also you have to differentiate uh see if a person like naipaul uhm nobody call him like language might have very much lived in the west yes then take another manohar mazumdar very much lived in the  western west and his writing developing means you don't find much of the indianism  though he treats indian uh characters in indian english but his language and the flow of language i mean you don't find uh anything convertible like r k narayan ah means means they like you let a autobiography of nehru and autobiography of gandhi  there is a vast difference   nehru's style is something very naturally flowing 
okay i am umarani from central institute of indian languages  hi  i am manimekalai from central institute of indian languages okay now what happened to  you are one word in english  okay now when are

hello good evening david  thank you good evening ramchandran thank you prakash same to you thank you so you had been to your place  so you've the nice experience  so if any nice experience you had been with there in tumkur  yes to start with i left nipani hostel at three  o'clock uh and i was waiting for bus in nipani bus stand for for an hour  and it was uh different experience for me and afterwards i reached belgaum safely  and uh the tragedy started there uhn  and i took a belgaum and dharwad bus that is beautiful new bus infact  and it took two two hours thirty minutes to reach dharwad  uh   uhn  my god and i was the first man to go to driver and to scold him  because see whether you are a driver or not first of all i asked him  laughter  he was doing in driving like a lorry no ah ha in fact i was the first man to go and ask see what you are doing like that i think some fat people are there in the bus he thought  it's a big luggage is there in the bus so so instead of thinking that it's a bus he must have thought that it's a lorry yes yes now you said that no it was non-stop bus moreover   just just i went and asked him  i was first person to go and ask why you are driving like a lorry  no sir i am new just an unexperienced man i'd to come uh try on this  then just i asked him hey why did you come to uh this one  in the night and other things i asked  but he replied sir safety is required  safety is required that is for us and not for you  laughter   safety safety is first than everything else comes next yeah  you must be facing it but whether it is your place or not  yeah  yeah yeah did you meet basavaraj that in uh nandita building i mean  you're when we were in degree na we had one fun it was a nice thing about basavaraj  he was there  so he was very lean personality laughter as if you dissecting you'll get only some five to six kilo of  flesh   flesh  he was telling one day to my friends he had uh applied for this lic lic for two lakhs   lic  two lakhs  two lakhs  how can it be man laughter  he is not even thirty-eight thirty-five kilo only five kilo of flesh is there he's  given two lakhs   even if we sell it it will around two hundred rupees laughter   that's how happened and if dinesh was for two lakhs he was telling and that was a beautiful joke we had experienced and when you were in degree na did you read any of endumari's novels  of course not  not of course not fine i have read i have read you have read i have read  actually i have read almost all of his verses i liked it very much you know  so even some of your bright point of your first person as the techniques second person every point of your techniques he has brought  and uh i think recently in one magazines it's uh  on the doom innocent electrical he brought even that uh who your harshad mehta also there he has brought in there  really he has expressed very nicely here  and in fact when you take up this uh endamuri  veerendranath's novels it's very thoroughly when you are entering to degree or some pg courses  it's the real thing that we can enjoy in degree or pg courses actually i wanted them to be translated to english  definitely definitely good better and read them laughter actually i don't read kannada novels is it it is then what what novels do you read  then you better read  english english uh whose novel have you read so far  hardy  hardy you read it as a laughter   you've read hardly you've read it hardly hardly of hardy's novels  so and uh   and uh and that's the fine thing in fact uh we have to read those things initially  because that should have   first we should read enough uh  yes initially we can read our own it can suggest it can suggest many ways to read other novels english novels particularly that the best point of if you'll if we take up endamuri as our model definitely we can grasp enough  that was my point of view about endamuri of course i read others uh endamuri this one k t gatti and satarnas also but it's it lacked something  uh but even in english writers you know i read jacquelins  of course though though they are the best sellers  i read jacquelins susan and herald robins and some such other supposing your laurence sanxaz such novels  i've read  but not that much general matter is included in their novels  there is some plot the hero comes and he does something if heroine he goes somewhere and thus they run the villains come and it ends there  but uh one of her novels as jacquelins susan an american novelist  i like the novel uh which one that is uh valley of dogs  in which he said one line beautiful line comes   we all have different sides that we show to different people  uhm uhm ah quite natural idea present my madam before you anyway away and i show some regards to her in different way  and uh i've uh my teachers image in me that's  it uh they all play the different one  so these three will not come at a time yeah   that's why my david is different from the david i reference before prakash  uh that one should not come to know what the other said of is my said is enough  then the friendship breaks yeah  oh that's what i think what do you say  what do you say mr david david has uh many fine experiences in some or other way definitely definitely definitely from the fair point of sex  you tell something about uh david  yeah yes somewhat you are saying   you need you need that one you know means that i i should be comfortable with his endamuri narayana no problem laughter  no problem any narayan will do  any narayan will do for that matter our narayan will also do uhm he will give somewhat or narayan is there is no he gives different sort of that altogether yeah and some here in never no in fact i was adjusting with that since these but i loved it  to survive to survive to survive survival of the fittest he is testing  so this is philosophical touch yes it does we have we have told and uh mr david  is going to  tell something about his uh native place  should i ah yes in fact please please good it is a nice place malnad it is called no yeah  we have nice weather  i see  es especially in shimoga we have ah uh sand mud and all no yeah yeah  you know you you go out uh for walk you'll  have a nice uh what  ah nice it's got uh fragrance of this lands and the  yeah yeah you can speak well said  yeah yeah  and uh so in fact when we have when we have come to this pg you no we had altogether different type of experiences here  why that i'll be expecting so i think some said  some different kinds of things of pg no when they came she has got so nice campus and that day first time when i came here to nipani  again i lost first period we together lost first period of our uh first teacher  so actually i was even when i  yeah yeah   what's the teacher  a few words   a few words  i i heard a lot of things about him  actually first time we went to sangli  there one professor pardy is there  he called us he of course he would give seat afterwards uh  he told that now you go to uh sangli   arjunnagar there c t patil kulkarni  professor is there you tell him my name to him  so influence   arjunnagar   kulkarni   influence   it's not influence because he just he guided  they were of course classmate of course friends uh colleagues  so we came to tell his name here  but uh we did not meet him he was there was uh on the he was on leave for some three days so and we met professor s t naik and some other uh naiks we met  so laughter  some other naiks yeah naiks mean uh they have different meaning laughter  theek hai  teachers professors  so we met the one word participant first class we met first period he met  uh he lost that uh first half he was dealing with the statement first half seond half we met  so on the very day we can recognised definitely  this will be first lecture  definitely  because in after all the degree in our degree we had only one good teacher filomina philip from bangalore  oh yes she was a wonderful lecturer and was giving you know she was so wonderful uhm i mean  uhm  uh so wonderful means you cannot explain it her knowledge   ah ha yeah yeah yeah  such a such a nice lady with uh affectionate feelings towards the students uh she did all and moreover she's being a christian uhm  as we all get  uhm  her pronunciation you know how fast she was pronuncing just like your bbc news she was also uh telling everything in the class and in fact when i had been to bangalore the other day  i couldn't meet her uhm uhm moreover she was not there and uh i didn't have any time to meet her and i came back to my pavilion you know it's natural if people go to bangalore and they don't meet laughter  she was in bangalore except except those few those the only thing you can't get in banglore is time time  and and of course you can have money also  of course you may not get university buses also  laughter  yes yes we have plenty of university buses but you won't get  it is there it is there  you don't go to city bus only for uh reaching your place you know laughter  you will have to go and search for some seats to sit on it  yes coming back to arjuna nagar this thing what what  what we were discussing  yesterday no  about the college  about the college right city college you heard of it oh you was were telling uh yesterday you told that he met uh you ah ah i i met him on the way ah yes where where did you meet him i see while going to belgaum he was in the bus surprise visit  that's quite surprising yeah there was lot of discussion about this uh waiting for godoth and even macbeth i see that is the thing whenever you meet at whatever the time may be you'll listen to his and this is this is the relevance of this yes suppose uh this should be there you know  yeah if you are dealing with history you should always be kinds of  the stretch   know about history  you should have given them situation with your day to day life and you should refer to the students  day by day so that the relevance will be there  there lies the greatness  in fact when he is uh dealing with the english literature he covers sanskrit literature kannada literature greek literature greek literature everything british history everything he covers  it has nothing in fact and that's why as though so it was i was unfortunate because i couldn't hear any lecture from him ah ah yeah definitely correct  that's why we decided uhm to him  of course he said that he would come here when he comes here he will inform us and have a yes yes  live discussion on   and then you went to tumkur did you read any this uh did you go to our uh library private library this time infact i had programme to go in fact i it was not in my programme to go tumkur as such uhm it was to go only hubli and to madras ha you wanted to visit many places  yes in fact it naturally once uh oh once uh laughter a few words  yeah yeah it has become such that the visiting places is the only business definitely definitely 
it is heard that uh telephone exchange at khadaklat has been commissioned  and the trunk dial facility or the s t d facility has been extended to all extended uhm that uh exchange  in fact in how many years this programme will continue  uh actually sir now government is trying to trying very fast to automize all these exchanges  now there are no manually operated exchanges left  only a few exchanges say i can uh say athani and in chikodi they are having manual exchange  rest all exchanges are converted into auto  now this khadaklat exchange is recently connected i mean it is uh it was made auto before a few years  but now this is connected with s t d facility so that people of khadaklat need not depend upon nipani telephone exchange telephone exchange you mean and uh nipani telephone operators for getting their calls number of times uh what they find as nipani do not answer  operators do not answer and their calls are heavely delayed and all that and since now it is linked with s t ds subscriber's  dialing facility  uh they are much pleased that uh they will themselves dial  all the numbers of nipani as well as uh numbers of any state   of of or of any city they like  question is about uh the system  previously it was the manual exchange so to say  which one khadaklat khadaklat nipani are these uh the small exchanges  were uh automatic exchanges yes sir but the big exchanges just like nipani chikkodi sankeshwar  sometimes say even uh kolhapur was also once upon a time  manually di  operated exchange   operated exchange  but at this stage means i want to say that automization will not  uhn uh uhm what i mean to say is harm the society but at the same time what about the staff staff and excess staff and other uh facilities that are uh needed  uhm   staff  especially there are some persons who require s t d facility uhm  and there are some who do not want the s t d facility  so even though they are uh automization still the staff is needed   uhm  yes uhn and here again there is possibility of uh getting late connections  sometimes uh no answer no answer like that   one word in what in this connection what your are saying   no answer  no sir see when these exchanges were manually operated  for all these years there the supposing the exch there are about three four hundred numbers in a small exchange  manual operation is just possible by one or two operators  but when the numbers increased say to to one thousand two thousand so a to b b to c these no no i accept i accept your difficulties no  or what i mean to say is   no  ahn ha ha now automization is nice thing i accept uhm  but there are certain loop holes connect uhm complaints   uhm regarding the telephone bills for example day before yesterday i had been in kolhapur telephone bhavan   ah  and there one person came and he complained that his bill has been uh   uhm   loop holes   uhm   ah  over excess bill  not excess uhm it was too much  too much it was about uh fifty thousand rupees  and he complained that even though suppose i started the subscriber trunk dialing continuously uhm the bill will not  uh uh uh will not be of uh such uh great extent  uhm   come so much  so it is a mechanic fault i mean  haan  so this connection   ha yes sir there is every possibility of  of having a mechanical fault with a telephone meter as such uhm exactly  haan you see there are clear instructions in our directory uh when the automachine is made that uh when the subscriber establishes his call and speaks for a minute or two minutes  he has to disconnect and see that he does get a dial tone back  so that he comes to know that his telephone is disconnected from s t d s t d facility  accepted sir even though the same thing has been  followed properly uhn still your bills are so high that we feel that it is better to disconnect the telephone connection  yes   done done by   uhn  uh ha no doubt uhn  this is a very rare case sir in that case subsriber got has got every right to approach the higher authority higher authority department even the court and he does get uh the reembursement of all that  uhn   higher authority  but on what ground do you uh settle this case  the grounds you see we will test that subscribers meter and if he will at your end  at our end but at the same time uhn what i mean to say  you may test it but in this case or say in a particular case you must call that particular gentleman who has complained  uhn  yes yes yes and in in his presence you must check it and you must convince him uhm that uh the meter it was faulty or meter is correct like that do you have such facility and do you such have these actions or  his presence only   uhm  no we don't sir  in this case we don't call the subscriber but the department tests the meter of the subscriber who has got a complaint as such  and we will in this case supposing now there are automization   is is uh recently started  supposing this had started a year before  in that case we send bills every two min uh every two months  we will see their history of the uh subscriber no he says na he says that we have brought the bills for the last two years ha two years and it was not more it was not more than for three hundred  rupees a month say uh for two for a period  and it this time it was more than fifty thousand ha if if if that is the case subscriber i told you subscriber has got every right to to complain no no question of right over here and now the now the redressal office complaint is like this we will test then meter his number meter will be tested  and uh  see question is sir whether do you test that meter in front of the consumer or the customer that is what happens because we he must be you may say that our uh our read no you may say that our reading is correct  we  uhn sir no doubt uhn because you do not want to take the responsibility of your fault  see we have got to take the responsibility of the fault  and that is  do you take it see when the metre does the department take it i don't think that see the department has to take sir   it it will take just see has to take it different and takes   see there is there is one rule  in the department sir uhn there is one rule  whatever bill is recei received by the subscriber he has to pay first the bill exactly what i mean to i want to come to that uh since uh since this this  is an absurd bill uhm say of fifty thousand as you say uhm which he was getting for three hundred four hundred rupees or say a maximum thousand rupees  uhm  when he receives the bill of five fifty thousand definitely  there is wrong something wrong with the meter  he has got to uh he has definitely complained  his complained will be one word to  uh   uhm   uhm   uhm   wrong  uhn without uh asking for the deposition uh of that uh amount uhm no in this case here as per the rules he has to   pay fine  pay  but uh i don't think the subscriber  subscriber will pay fifty thousand  he has no one or two words   he will not be in a position to pay he will be not in a position to pay  perhaps he has not paid the bill uhm and his complaint will be dealt with uhm in in due course  uhm   uhm  now we were talking about auto automization isn't it uhm  cough  no doubt this automization has resulted in reduction of staff  there is a difficulty with us  we were about say thirty thirty-five operators in at nipani since the automization before a year the staff is reduced by ten people  so ten people are reduced we are now twenty people working  now this are is called uh  sma small auto key uh auto key centre  auto key  where each switch are connected  they are also automized and linked with s s t d uhm  and now the problem with us is there will be no booking of of calls at all by akol benkihal and uh khadaklat  which are slowing slowly being automized  and they will have to deal i mean oh depend on the nipani   exchange manual operators  exchange  and it's manual operater like ha that difficulty is there for us  no doubt people are people uh no just see what happens no yeah they say people see people want their facility always  supposing if we get a telephone connection here i mean the connection and if we can dial a numeric number in america england  or delhi japan some any any you definitely you want all these facilities isn't it  some any any  but uh you don't worry whether there is there'll be  autom i mean reduction of staff or something of like that you need not bother about it  the department has to bother about it  the department is now thinking the operators to absorb in some other departments and uh they'll be posted to some   to some booths or uhm they'll be taken as clerks in the in the various departments  that is going on  no no i am not to concern about uh your difficult   of course not i am talking of the difficulties of the consumer or the customer  of course not   no no i tell you uhm  for example  now since the automization is made people are really very happy  they need not book the call to nipani exchange and wait for the call and uh depend upon the operators   wait now supposing now the difficulty is that  everybody supposing subscriber's at khadaklat they dial each other they'll be getting engage to each other  they will they will keep mum for a certain while so the only facility is they will dial once again  they will dial try twice thrice four times then they will get each other  they will you see get the connection they feel very happy they are really very happy no doubt  now uh definitely as i say that subscribers are what i mean to say ha so those who have got there are two ch uhm i have two categories in my mind yeah yeah one those who are subscribers of that is one  uhm with s t d facility  uhm  uhm those who have who have got the connections without subscribers uh uh s t d s t d  s t d  without s t d's there're some pople are   uh see s t d is a subscriber dialing uh facility  uh  ha you have got a telephone at home uhm when you are out somebody your children or wife or somebody  yeah yeah they'll dial the number they go on speaking ladies if this start speaking no  yeah yeah  yeah they don't know uhm the technique of using the s t d i see i see because it is to be used by second to second  cough  s t d is a facility generally useful for the subscribers  who can uh minimise their conversation for a minute or so say thirty seconds even forty seconds or a minute also and stop it so that previously they were taking the paying say twenty-five  rupees for a bombay call  if they finish up you say when twenty-five thirty seconds  it is just possible even to speak during thirty seconds forty seconds  they get it within two thousand   no i i know this i know this ha ha  uh procedure  ha ha  question is those who do not want that s t d facility uh they have to come and book the call  isn't that isn't that and here again the manual labour uhn comes into uhm focus  picture in the picture uhm  ha uh uh   uhn   focus  and uh same difficulty will be faced by that subscriber 
when will you reach uh your home  tomorrow probably afternoon twelve-thirty or one  twelve-thirty afternoon yeah  these these are this is jammu tavi okay jammu tavi  what time does it come seven o'clock no no nine ten accha  provided it's on time   i'm told uh sometime it is late  ha it's late or very often  no not very often very often  because that day i came uhm uhm it was on dock  uhm uhm

we don't have to sign etcetra  no so it's not necessary that we should be there exactly on the time no need in my case i've to go yeah because otherwise even the non-teaching will start coming late  yeah  ah i mean it doesn't ha others will start uhn that's these are the problems and it  so how are you  we missed you last evening  yeah in any case i am leaving at two twenty in the afternoon telephone ringing  so yeah we are also checking out but you stay back since you are going today do you have any friends or i used to stay with uh someone nearby  when is two words  i went and i packed  unfortunately this boy was not very well oh  so i had to carry back and when i came back it was early morning   oh  it was high time you had left and i didn't know you no i was late very late i would have joined you i think but paul told me you went on  went on upto ten forty ten forty-five we had really began eating part of it began only after nine  yeah uh al almost yeah  yeah so after i came here in the  one or two words  oh ho wha what time did you come back  back i think by eight  oh i would have take him i didn't know because i you see my brother uh came to take i mean he is in faridabad  so he came all the way from faridabad and he had his car so he took me around  and then it was around eight-thirty there eight-forty  exactly we came back  and uh i saw sahu talking to a three wheeler wala so i told him are you going there he said yes  so i said you wait we'll take you  but i didn't know you were here otherwise uh he didn't have information you were here no i was also not sure i thought i straight away because i remember you told me in the british council  that uh you may not be joining us so but i didn't know it will go on upto  but it went on for quite it was such a informal nice free gathering and uh there was little tension because we knew nothing was going to happen today  yeah  how many of you were there at one i mean at a time  first eighteen   accha  second plus twelve  so thirty all together thirty plus again another twenty-five not forty fifty-five fifty-five  ah that lady from padma sheshadri school madras rajalaxmi is it  i met her last year yeah i know rajeshwari i met her in gandhinagar last year   she's good she's really good  uhm uhm but uh some of the rps that they have trained does not  uh of of your calibre they does not  not all of them are one of them   such conditions have happened by and large but most of them are good  any thing is there produced uh materials which uh do not require much uh resource personnel  uhm uhm no actually they had also to cover the whole of the country  so those differences are bound to be there  now i wonder how many people from the north east also were trained uhm there are there are many from west side  there are many from west side dominantly south and north why was it may be people didn't apply or uh no they applied uhm mainly they didn't qualify  uhm  mainly they didn't qualify oh accha this was through an interview  ha  but i was told i think nee nee neelam told me that  there was no interview when she met ha first time we didn't had oh i see accha otherwise they chose again   they conducted because of conducted  ha ha that they didn't have time and the number of applications were of course i  accha so you mean to say eh they didn't short list people for interviews  they short listed uhm on the basis of uh biodata  uhm  biodata then they consulted various organisation uhm uhm and then they close  on the second and first time commission was set up but then who who were on the selection committee uh the obvious british council  was one word himself there or the whole thing uhm uhm that c b s e who was from c b s e  c b s e i think director pramod sharma who is  a few

one or two words  c i e f l there was a seminar and later in our own kolhapur he had come to guwahati  we've four centres  i was working in the e l t i english language teaching  and now you are teaching in a college  i'm a lecturer in college i came on  one or two words   and before that one or two words 
hello  hello lokesh how do you do well i'm fine how do you do  fine okay thank you  hello hello  hello you   i'm from tamil nad  i see and i am a post graduate teacher  trained teacher though i'm still uh unemployed  uh uhm what is the actual situation pg situation pg unemployed graduates are are really a lot of person pg graduates in the karnataka unemployed you mean uh unemployed yeah  ah yes of course that's a uh national problem in india you know growing unemployment  there are uh so many unemployed graduates  that is true of uh karnataka also  what do you say mr mohan yes i agree with him  uh but with a some difference you know  uh those who have done their ma in english uhm in india find jobs easily  haan  though the government uhm there is trying to uhm  sneeze they give less importance to teaching of english in  schools and colleges  yes  yes  so another major problem had you had we studied uh in my case i opted for science subjects  you'd have got easily the job  but uh any major self-employment project is uh launched here in your state  oh yes there are many self-employments schemes right like uh district industries corporation industries  there is uh one corporation called uh karnataka state financial corporation  industries  in the district industrial corporation which we call d i c  uh you can get a loan to a tune of thirty-five thousand and start any small scale industries home industries also yes that's right we too have the same organisation  we also have that thing but when we approach since uh it seems they they uh put lot of conditions yes that you fed up with those people and uh  yes   haan haan that is one of the  puts a lot of strain that's one of the reasons why these uh you know schemes have failed  puts a lot of strain  uh they there are so many legalities uh to perform and all kinds of official disturbances well that's true yes i i should say that the government should take steps to liberalise those things   there're so many things which you cannot say bring  all at a time  uhm uhm advancing loan uhm but you keep a track of how it is utilizing it you know  but lot of uh in fact on the government part also  sometimes it seems right because in our state more than thirty uh three hundred crore rupees have been uh given as loan and not a single money has been recovered from the uh  people who got it as loan loanees uhm they're not willing to when  when they get the money as loans they have the feeling   it's it's donation for them right with the result they do not allowance any further  uh programmes  you you mean to say that they do not utilize uh uh the funds yes the funds properly  properly uhm because it does not reach the man there're lot of brokers ha right there in interim period it uh the half of the amount goes supposing if they give loans for cattles doctors will get some amount or the man who recommends and above all there is a fixed limit for uh every village so two or three members will be getting right  those who have the influence uh and they'll have to  approach back-door way to the local uh ruling party uh members  uhm   ha right   right  right  hey even in our state people say it is same  but what i feel is as you said the funds are misused  yeah you know yeah you cannot put all the blame on one party  no i that is the receiver yeah yeah you know of course but uh i don't blame one party then the banks the institutions which have advanced loan  have to keep a proper track  right of for instance and see whether the loan is being utilised properly  for instance  properly uhm and there are considerations also uhm suppose as you said in the case of the cattle most of the indian cattle this they die uhm uhm as soon as they are bought laughter  you know uhm something should be done means the  the basic thing is that we should educate our people   uhm uhm  we should tell them why the government  we yes  not only that awareness is created among the people yes that's right awareness is an   as important and as you can see uh unemployed graduates have become or becoming rather are becoming terrorists anti-social elements etcetra etcetra why because of frustrations you know  they are frustrated disappointed  and proper awareness is not created among them naturally they go astray  right yeah my feeling is but to some extent the unemployed unemployment problem could be solved by this kind of uh projects though if uh it has proved to be a failure  right  a few words  what we have got to do is a kind of introspections  we should see uhm how how many people uhm have really been benefitted uhm why uhm the scheme has been a failure so after that say you can revamp your programmes  and there is every scope you know uh for say improvement in the  yeah scope  right   yeah  but the government does not but as far as i think the government should take  some hard steps towards those who misuse the funds  but you know there are too many uh people interfering in it yeah uhm and uh even our few politicians they simply  they announce uhn and they never keep up their words subsidies uh right yes you don't have to pay ten thousand rupees  loan you don't have to pay five thousand rupees  loan   and uh   just for the political game yeah yeah we become allured ha right that is the unemployed's plight yeah yeah and  and the government does not and once given that should become a tri  tradition that's what we think yes yes  and that has been happening yeah uh alright uh now what's your plan since you are an unemployed  every city two words but the thing is for the past years i i did not uh uh concentrate on uh making the best use of the modern techniques of agriculture uhm uhm the same traditional methods followed  and it proved proved to be futile attempt  every year some natural calamities and this and that it happens and uh you just you are surviving and we don't seem to  have gained any  well uh fortunately for you here is mr mohan he is an agriculturist a bsc agriculturist graduate you can take suggestions from him yes you are welcome i no no you can adopt i see the modern ways of agriculture uhm uhm  and if you want say financial help without any say  uh mediators and all uhn mr lokesh is here to guide you how you could get loan uhm he only will tell you uh the proper way to approach the bank  uhm  i i think we have uh degressed from our uh uh subject infact our subject was unemployment and i think this could be one of the solutions you know  if uh these graduate people who own lands can go back to their lands and right uh adopt new techniques  right  right and try to contribute uh to our country in terms of you know food food grains  well i think it'll help a lot and uh in fact it is a social service also right and uh so far people are under impression that white collar jobs are the only aims and ambitions in life   that's true  so shall we have a cup of tea  i think it's better  oh yes yes fine  one or two words  no not yet it's very hot that i see in fact when i was uh from my native i could notice the difference in climate when we are on the way  haan  more than uh two hundred miles across the salem  uhm i know i i was able to notice salem the difference  salem  is salem an industrial city i think i'm told yeah it's an industrial city  yeah  yeah  it's an industrial city  salem salem   industrial city  today i received a letter from my wife  she has written it's cloudy there in my place dharwar  but no rains at all  no rains in dharwar  yeah   dharwar   it's in karnataka you know karnataka yes is it on the border of uh tamil nad no no no oh exactly it is in the north of karnataka north of karnataka north karnataka uhm what is the adjacent it is known for its university its karnataka university dharwar ah perhaps you might have heard the name right  yeah i had   it's a place where there are two universities as lokesh mentioned karnataka university there is another university called  uh agricultural university agricultural university so if you uh want uh any information well you can just uhm come to dharwad and uh go with mohan to agricultural university and see oh yeah you are welcome since you are an agriculturist and since you are uh willing to or wishing to implement new techniques and all those things all right  okay okay okay  ha by the by we were talking of sight-seeing in mysore okay ha yes yes  well i have seen uh from all important places in mysore  because i'm not a stranger to this place you ask this uh gentleman from tamil nadu perhaps him  he has not seen any of the important places have you not seen yeah i visited this palace  i see that is in chamundi hills uhm but uh that uh ksr dam and uh  krs dam you should visit it you should

 one or two words  by the by i wanted to know about uh this politics in your state because uh your chief minister is very much in news  uhm she was a film actress formerly yeah yeah  isn't she so what do you feel about her administration in your state   yeah yeah  her administration one or two words she still enjoys the public uh support support but as as an administra administrator  i don't find she is really  she's losing her popularities no not yet still she enjoys it  haan  but in the course of time once uh i i i that could be  told only i see  during the course of time  uh as we read because there is no uh yeah equal an opponent to  oppose her  right there is no good opposition she has almost become a dictator  right no opponents  in fact she enjoys the popularity just because there is no opposition leader right who merits attention of the public exactly  oh exactly and what about karunanidhi the former chief minister  that is  yes yes he is not is he completely silenced now yeah at present but ah now he has gained slightly upper hand even though one word  and totally uh among the number of the voters concerned  he's still enjoying the sizeable uh support  support  ah   support

i hope so  it is only a tentative uh what can we say  decision tentative decision  decision  we have not yet decided what to do next  but of course it is a little bit tough for me to go travel hundred miles every every hundred kilometres everyday and do my work  are you going to teach english after this course ? uh sometimes they my school utilises me oh in the absence of english teachers  sometimes they give a kind of uh what can you say the training to the teachers who are not good in grammar  at that time they'll call me to give to deal with one chapter  any chapter or any topic on grammar   anyhow it'll be helpful to you yes yes they will do it  had you been to any other state other than near andhra pradesh and tamil nadu and even now mysore i think uh only to madras only to madras only to madras not to any other state  uh no  do you stay in andhra for sometimes  sometimes when i was a child i was taken to that place  after that my grandma was old my mother passed away so we had no connection with those people  more than that almost all the people became very old at that time laughter so we had no connection after that  now you are the resident of  vellore tamil nadu tamil nadu that is vellore  tamil nadu  yes  how do you do in the vacation ? like summer vacation or winter vacation ? uh you may be getting more than three months i think  not three months  but used to coach the children  use to improve them  oh you know what the coaching facility is like yeah  in summer before i before i came i was teaching the students  sundays i took intensive classes for the entrance to twelfth standard  intensive  for those who are going to write that twelfth standard yeah we've to  twelfth standard  uhm i don't feel so we are left free  everytime we have some work to do   what do you do in pooja  vacation ?  pooja vacation also we used to conduct some classes practical classes  so they question us when these children fail  so many things are there oh all this schools are utilising the vacation to sometimes  even when they are teaching to the students or except  teaching to the students   yes yes  in pooja day some important days we stay back  some other days we have our own work  so we will we want to finish our syllabus so we run to school  or do the work now how do you find your life as a teacher ? yes i like i like it very much formally i was not liking it  but uh i i developed to a liking over it  now i like it very much  i like this  i like to be with the children  yeah really then so whenever i come to school there one or two words even to provide fun to us  laughter  yes when i am once when i am in the school i'll  not think about anything any type of uh  you forget all your worries all your laughs  yes yes  everything no worry there  when you look at the children yes  once we come out we'll come out with satisfaction  otherwise if we don't if i don't teach means i will be feeling very sad today i have not taught this others have done this well  uh so many things will be there anyhow you have to seen see your own yes definitely definitely performence in the class  yes yes  that's good  so i like this teaching also uh it's an i as i told in the class in the it is an a very good experience what we had in teaching practice how do manage your home and your service at the same time ? ha it was bit it was difficult only   it's even though how do you find it ? so i took it as a challenge yeah  uh i know very well that life is uh not smooth life is made up of a uh troubles  so if you want to accept do adjustment   adjustments and uh  you have to do adjustment ah yes i i remember one quoting quote  from nehru if you want to accept uh a full blown rose  we you have to accept the thorns behind it  oh laughter 
oh uh i am very happy to have met you rather  yeah  uh uh i uh can't spell it a kind of pleasant occasion yeah surely it's a equally a pleasure for me  that i met you oh thank you very much sir  uh so it's uh i can say a few words about an institute where i have been  yeah please let me know something about the institute  where you worked   uh yeah yeah uh that's what i understand that people i was under the impression that uh almost for the educated people are aware of birla institute of technology  i'm one word as it's quite reputed one  yeah  you are right  but i understand some of our participants who have been here are not uh as much aware of the institution as i expected  rather well for myself atleast i i'm  ah accha thank you yeah uh it's in fact a kind of unique institute  in the sense i say that uh it in fact uh motivates the students  in such a way that they become quite uh uh what what  should i say is acquiring a sort of managerial quality  with which they are able to sell themselves that are in the market   field uh uh  yeah  now-a-days the sad story about other universities and uh higher education institutes is that the products uh do not come out very well equipped  and they flood the market there are no job opportunities for them yeah yeah but uh products who come out of your institute  yeah are really absorbed  yeah  yeah sure  and uh for yeah quality goods there is always a demand yeah one should say   yeah   yeah  yeah sure  and more over they take a kind of uh national cream i must say  and uh half of the credit goes to rather saying that the institute is able to provide something to such an extent that each brings that there i must say uh they've become quite fit to the society but basically they are brilliant students when they come to the institute because uh they input i would say that are really brilliant uh they score above ninety-three percent  based on their merit they get into the institute yeah  uh  yeah  uh it's not only that uh the best students come to this institute yeah they are also given the best kind of training yeah that's there  yeah uh but the best kind of uh  i wish i wish there were more institutions of this type yeah  uh in the country yeah unfortunately there are only just one or two here   yeah to be counted on finger's end like an island  yeah  yeah laughter  you know sea of mediocrity  you know it's good that though the institute has been in rajasthan uh i would say that it it's in fact a kind of oasis  yeah oasis  uh i was quite surprised to see how in that uh desert atmosphere uh uh g d birla was able to establish such a great institute  uh which in fact has become popular at the international level rather yeah  and moreover i understand when our students uh come to the third level which we say third year rather when they come to the third year their attention is mainly towards preparing for gre  and get out of this country  uhm that's rather unfortunate yeah because we spend so much on them and the best mind  the best talent the best energies of the country flow out of it   yeah   it's a pity that india doesn't get the benefit out of these uh the best minds the  yeah  one way we have to accept this also this india is not able to provide better opportunity uh to their expectations rather  so and i am very happy still the students uh foreign united states of america uh they are quite uh grateful to the institute  uh the what to say is to their almamater  and they come forward voluntarily to see that the institute  still further developes  and uh i understand a few students have given a sort of a statement to the authorities that uh they are collecting some amount  which would in fact uh update the computer centre  uh its quite uh remarkable approach on their part i feel  uhm i wish not only would such an institute be updated  but more such institutes were uh started in other parts of the country  so that uh all the regions stand to benefit  yeah and the country as a whole yeah uh progresses  yeah  yeah  but in that sense i say that i see in pilani  i must say all the states a country a country in pilani i could see uh uh national integration rather yeah yeah uh i could experience yeah  and moreover the students are highly disciplined i must say  i was told by then i wasn't there  but even at the time of the mandal commissions i i could understand that all over the country the students were on strike  but uh that was the only institute which was functioning where there was no disturbances no not at all very kind ah not at all  very kind  and uh the students you know because they are much  uh motivated uh towards getting trained with which they will be able to get into better industries  and one more good thing i would like to say about our institute is  we have a practice school system uhm uh with which in fact they're able to give the better training to the students and they are able to expose their better products to the country rather i would say i see  uh  haan  see we have a practice school system in such a sense  uh a practice school training running of about four months at the end of the second year uhn  and uh they got to go to they have to go to different industries where the students are expected to go and do some industrial training but this does not mean that they can go alone and do away with some work and get and report that they have done the report that they have done some industrial training or something it's  not  when they send the students they are sending the faculty members also to look after   uhn  uhm  uh this programme is going on for about in eighty centres all over the country  eighty centres eighty centres are there  eighty centres  and we have practice school too running of about six months  and i understand there are for about thirty faculty members  are staying outside to look after the students i see  all the care for the students in a way and looked to their  academic upbringing in all possible ways so that uh they turn up to their best uh lot the best products of the educational system that uh exist in the country  no i would say that uh in fact the system of education uh that's there in this pilani i would say that it is quite application oriented oh i see uh how it would be quiet useful to give a kind of life skill for a student but elsewhere we don't have this application approach at all yeah  it's only a theoritical approach and most of the students who come out of these institutes have only a theoritical background and in the practical world yeah they are not much of a success  yeah   yeah  yeah you take for example uh i belong to the department of english we have ma honours in english  but when i say that we have ma honours in english it doesn't mean that the subjects taught are purely confined to only the literature field  oh see for about first two years the respective of any disciplines they are exposed to common these common subjects  uh a student who is admitted in ma honours in english he will be exposed to thermodynamics i see will be exposed to computer science   he'll be exposed to physics uh and chemistry  i see   uh  uh so irrespective of any discipline a student who is admitted in uh computer science will be doing the same course of the student who has who has who has been admitted into  ma honours in english oh i see  so they are exposed to compulsory disciplinary course we call it cdc only when they come to the third year  ah right again it is a sort of interdiscipline  again  interdisciplinary that's why they call it first integrated degree ah  one cannot uh i should say one should be  should be happy to see such an institution having been developed in some part of the country if not in our own part near our home  and uh i should compliment you on oh being on the staff of such an institute  laughter  thank you sir uh it is not everybody's lot to be  yeah in that sense a part of such an institution yeah i'm really happy though i'm quite away from my home town  i am very happy that i am working in an institute which is known for an academic excellence yeah and the students are very bright so we have got a kind of job satisfaction that's there,, uh uh though there are a kind of advantages and disadvantages  as far as my personal point of view is concerned  but as an academician i am really happy yeah we have such an ethos yeah uh ethos and academic excellence exist one really feels one is previleged to get in there apart from uh job satisfaction  there  yeah  though i was not uh as happy as i am now now i consider it as a kind of blessings in disguise yeah really yeah one should  yeah  yeah when i left madurai where i had been working uh i in fact was not at all uh willing to go to such a place which is quite a far off from my place yeah but now i don't have that uh feeling what should i call sense a hallucination uh i'm not i'm  not at all suffering from that   uh  uhm you are all saint of the country so to say laughter and uh one more thing i would say that uh students have been in bits pilani are uh quite more in number from south rather i see oh that's uh yeah rather strange  yeah  yeah that i would say is truely beecause uh the admission takes place is done merit  i am very happy to say that there is not even a single seat  for the chairman of the institute oh  it's really remarkable  yeah  uh uh they don't interfere in the admission process  and even if the vice-chancellor's son gets  point point point one percent less than the percentage that is fixed that is the set marks for the admission as for as that particular year is concenred he also has to be out  oh that's really remarkable  we don't see this kind of a thing elsewhere  see everywhere else in the country people in position's  of power and authority try to manoeuvre yeah the the admissions uh even the academic grades that are given  sometimes the professor's son or daughter himself or herself get the gold medal though they might have not even  ordinarily got a second class let alone a first class  so we have heard many such stories from elsewhere  but in at pilani such a thing a really exists one should be happy as well as proud uhm also of such an ideally ideal institution  uhm also  also it's quite a known for cultural festivals they celebrate a festival called oasis  which is once in a year  and the students are given enormous freedom and they collect the funds from different sources i mean many firms are sponsoring  and they are able to uh going out the function called  oasis in such a manner that it is uh uh what to say uh known and famous at the national level  what one or two words uh i mean the management of the institute is allowed to keep for the best available in the country to their students to their alumni  they do not spare any kind of effort  of course the these cultural festivals are organised by students themselves by students themselves  yes it's they who collect the fund  it's they who collect fund organise  it's they who collect fund  no doubt about that all should give a kind of better training for the students this is what i should say and uh moreover sir uh though the students are prepare to soil their hands anywhere it's not the case with supposing somebody gives the training in the name of mba graduates or whatever we also have got a degree programme called mms  and the students who come out with a degree mms i understand that there is a report that has been received uh from different firms  that the students of bits pilani specially mms candidates they are prepared to soil their hands  they are prepared to do any kind of work it is not that they demand ac room they will be sitting only in the ac room they will be able to only manage the sub-staff it is not the quality  if the situation warrants they are prepared to do any sort of work or they are prepared to go the field  yes it is that kind of uh service motivation yeah and uh committment to work that we should instill in our students  instead what we are producing these days is uh  brown sahibs  those who want to be uh in offices which are air conditioned those who do not want to soil their hands  those who want to think themselves the upper crust of society  born they heavenly born one word so to say yeah to rule the country  to rule over others  and this is unfortunate

yes i am from kerala   i'm kuriachan  i am working as a teacher in a school  yes sir i'm anthony  i am joy joseph from uh kottayam kerala a central part of kerala and uh i am here on a special uh session  and uh you one word last week when uh you came from your own place from the yes yes i came from uh nelambur nelambur uh oh then nelambur comes somewhere in the northern part ah northern part of kerala northern  but it is a border district i believe  it's border district between karnataka and uh   between karnataka and tamil nadu oh i see  so i'm teaching there uh in one of the uh private college uh ha you teach in some uh higher secondary school yes i teach in in some higher secondary  but basically i am a mathematics teacher but uh in my school i teach uh english oh ho ho it's fantastic job you are doing no   it's it's a rainy season in our place and we have plenty of rain this year so our crops uh agricultural crops are very good  then what about you sir uh in your village is it a village or town ? yes it's a village   it's village not uh big town a small town   what's the main cultivation there ?  it's paddy and then uh rubber  rubber and uh maize that's all  and   rubber  uh in our place no uh the main cultivation is rubber  usually in ke kottayam is supposed to be the i mean uh  a place where you have we have maintained that uh uh so you get uh more income but you know the pro uh recent uh trends because now-a-days more over though the labour charges have gone up now the good prices are not coming  oh that's everywhere in kerala we can't uh  that's it but the only advantage we can't help it because the population only advantage is that uh rubber is now enjoying a basic price or something like that in a fixed price which is uh almost good not that bad so but actually we still remember the day one word  years till a few years back kottayam was one of the most affluent the uh places even in the whole of india  yeah that's right and you know educationally culturally by all means and you know uh or uh our area i mean the who the whole place  it's almost cultivable cultivated and uh we have access by roads  trains and one word  so we cannot say that it is in a one word  we have a stationary ways etcetra etcetra uh ours is a remote area and our people uh yes hilly area our people they are mostly depend on this agricultural products  uh like uh pepper paddy uh then coffee coffee seeds uh tea plantations  these are the main crops we we   hilly region  you have yeah we have  and uh educationally our area is very backward ah uh  because most of the people uh migrate to from southern part of kerala  but they must be uh be belonging to some i mean uh good i mean families no  they a few words we don't have enough uh facilities  for education and or plant rotation   facilities that should be arranged   one word is there  and uh a very good percentage of our population is uh  uh tribe  so they are backwardly you know they are educationally and socially they are backward  actually they don't want to live with us  they want uh their own lives as it is ah i still remember i was told by some social workers  that whenever the people uh responsible people go to the uhm tribal people they are show their uh uhm what to say uh unwillingness to come forward to mingle with the main stream etcetra is there yes yes now there are various projects i think to give them for  a main stream even then you know i personally don't uh uh agree with many of the policy because you know one way we are destroying their natural habitat  yes uh there are uh yes  uh where they are used to yeah yes that's true that's true and you know the days are gone when we could see we could think of uh people bringing honey etcetra from the forest and forest and uh they had a very good life ah yeah they have their own cultural i mean we destroyed everything anyway whatever it is so one way it's a good i mean when we think about uh this one of government policies are concerned government have to bring all the people to the main stream or whatever it is and uh uh what time you have come ? uh today what about your job and uh family in nelambur sir ? yes uh as i told you everyting you belong to that particular district no no i belong actually to uh yernala district oh ho from yernala you see i'm settled in nelambur uh then how do you a few words work  yeah my field of work is uh i teach i told you know i was i am teaching in one of the private colleges  you see we don't have uh it's run by you   it's run by me  it's run by you  ah ha ha we don't have uh many regular colleges or any high schools run by the government or recognised by the government and nominated   it's a migrated area yes so this a boon your step it's a boon to your uh progress and your people in a way you can say you provide certain education facilities for them  yeah uh see i am actually running a parallel college  a parallel college yes ah a parallel college and uh who else is there to assist you some other teachers or employees ah to assist there some teachers are there and uh together we conduct the classes  and there are many people uhm many people  because since there are no recognised uh aided uh colleges and schools uh many in our area  you see this parallel colleges they run a group  uhm  yes of course but still i have a doubt uh  actually these parallel colleges uh are the main reasons for the uh melting of so many graduates in india  and uh actually they create a lot of problems uh in unemployment uh and uh after getting education they don't want actually to do other work other work uh like uh what uhm you call  aga agriculture  other work  yes especially the indians have the uh uh tendency to keep away from parrallel work and uh  tendency  ah parallel work yeah  everybody wants a white collar job white collar job yes this uh  it's a big problem  so we have uh what you call this uh unemployment problem  uh in our uh place in plenty so people wanted to go abroad in search of jobs  not only in your place everywhere in india these these unemployment problem  ah yes uh  the tendency to so they seek job in other countries  but uh to go abroad uh it is very difficult one or two words because uh the problem of language the financial background everything comes in the way  uh uh when we talk about these things uh what do you feel about the standard of english  is it necessary these english education is necess is it necessary in our country ? so that's a one word i'm a strong uhm arguer for the main maintenance of good standard of english throughout uh across this life yes yes  because because the reason is that it's a world language you know and and uh and uh language see in india in particular if a country like ours we need uh what you call a link language because uh our country has a multi uh  lingual background lingual background  lingual background  every state has uh their own languages so in order to communicate with them uh i think we must have uh a link languages and we usually depend on this english or in other words uh if you don't know english if you want to communicate with people from other cities you need to know around uh ten fifteen languages  whereas if you know english you could serve i mean it could serve your purpose throughout india and even outside the world but actually the politicians spoil the one or two words  i think so  yes they actually spread the regionalism communalism and all because they have uh their own uh motives you know  they have their own personal motives uhm they have to  stand for i mean their survival uh their survival  and uh once such issues are out of the scene uh they cannot  have any thing to to go to the people uhm i mean again for something else or so  so i think there are two sets of people i think  one is favouring uh this uh english language and there are other people who are those who're against them against them yes that's true  but when we consider the facts uh we are supposed to follow  this english language as long as uh we have another link language link language yes   that's very important important  but not only that for our higher studies uh purposes   one word  if you want to go through any material this is the only uh language by which we can communicate uh i mean uh we'll get the only material in english in especially higher upper higher school higher level   upper higher school  what about the cultural uh uh background in your place do your people still uh maintain that uh traditional cultural programmes  like kathakali turgal etcetra in your place ? yes they do  but even they are on the decline no it is very you know in our place you know many of the items are not uh there  but it is because of the influence of this uh city culture you know  they are always after these uh so called modernism  yeah that is the inevitable reality for example in our childhood you know even uh my own i mean the school where i studied our i mean usual uh uniform was the very much traditional kerala  mundu and uh shirt  now most of the schools in have changed to uh uh one word  but i i feel it has become an inevitable uh  that truth uh and we blindly follow the tradition of uh european people uh  but does this mean that you know my sir i mean my guess is that you know people must have uh  chosen a convenient way rather than uh  no i don't think how can it be a convenient way because  uh wearing these uh boots shoes ties  it's a one word you mean uh that  it's not at all suited for kerala's climate uh  one way it's true  it's not hygenic especially during the month of june july but you know still more than that uh cough sorry there is an element of uh imitation or uh going after the uh foreign traditions in every country  yes of course we can follow the language european languages i mean this english but the practice being   but the practice if we follow their culture uh tradition  but you know see anyway english study is that has brought a number of good things to india and whatever it is yes then i see what about the cultural no see the cultural uh  programmes and other items uh mr joy you said that uh the there's  a decline in your part yeah sure and uh what is the reason behind it actually there the thing is that you know for example kathakali art i mean this uh uhm cultural items like kathakali turgal  it needs a life time i mean uh mean practice  for example six or seven years to master ha true and you know nobody is nobody is  that patient enough to practice it  even from our area know it's entirely different know that people they like they wanted to study all these uh old uh things older things you know uh not only that uh usually these days the people have a tendency to look down upon such a traditional yeah yeah uh programme you know traditional uh cultural programmes of  yeah yeah  i see that is the one of the main reason  uh people always go after pop music uh dance cabarait dance uh and all those those things  of course this is well and good but should we  yeah that's not uh our own   yeah  but in our area it is totally different i think uh now people have uh more liking or you can say  they love to learn uh kathakali bharatnatyam and uh see people do 
let me introduce myself dr joseph   i'm g b sajjan from the depot of karnataka  how long have you been teaching ? no i am not a teacher i'm  i see   i'm an officers steno working in a bank as a junior secretary  uhm i'm myself a teacher  i have uh worked as a teacher for more than uh three decades i see at college level  uh i retired in nineteen eighty-nine  then took over as principal of a new one word college near bijapur  i see  oh  well are you married ? yes i am married   can i ask the question ? sure sure  i am married i've got a child  she is seven years old studying studying studying in uh second standard ah  and my wife is a teacher teaching in a high school in kerala i see  she is also a school teacher yeah  i have three children myself  the eldest is a daughter  she has completed her mbbs course and uh only recently she is uh appointed as a tutor in the college where she studied  that's fine  my son is doing his diploma course he is in the second year  and the younger daughter uh completed her puc only last march well my elder daughter is not married yet  ah you said your uh your child is a son or a daughter ? daughter daughter so in what standard is she studying ? second standard  second standard  uh well tell something about uh your your field office  that's i mean your hobbies or something like that  well my hobby is reading reading  and nothing else nowadays  i have given up seeing even movies i don't see uhm i sort of create have created my own world yes and it is reading and writing writing and reading yeah of course most of it is uh writing letters or letter uh letter writing uh ha  uh i have published a book or two is it ? yeah i have written a book for uh b a english major students ah ha that is something one word  it is entitled literary criticism an introduction ah ha  and another book is a collection of my radio talks  oh you participated in radio talks also yeah  that's good  i kept uh about twenty talks  oh that is fine and some fourteen or fifteen them fifteen of them are collected uh brought together uh in a book form oh  and the book is entitled a board block ah ha  and that was published by an association called  busset   a few words  college english teacher uh bijapur branch bijapur  and uh it is uh constituted mostly by my own students for my retirement in nineteen eighty-nine they got together  uh a function to felicitate me uh and as part of that uh felicitation function they brought out this collection of my radio talks  it is really great  one more that is uh of course i could have done some more work but being an administrator uhm i have been an administrator for more than twenty years  for nearly twenty-five years i had been a principal of one college and another uh ha  i have headed three colleges  uh in the thirty-seven years career as teacher and administrator both  uh ha  ah ha  but because of uh administrative work i have not been able to do much  much of reading uhm  and uh writing of course uh follows as a consequence  and uh   but you didn't get enough time  ah i much of my time is wasted in uh attending to the t v r i should say   accha  though i though i have worked as both teacher and an administrator i had more satisfaction as a administrator than as a teacher because i did enjoy my teaching at the at the graduate level uh especially teaching made in english  uh i taught one word for a number of years  and uh i was the only so to say specialised in that branch of uh english studies around there in your place uh yeah  and uh my specialities one or two words again were middle english and uh literary teaching  so after teaching uh literary criticism for a year or two uh i thought my notes which i got up as a preparation for my class teaching could be published in book form ah ha  so uh after resigning one word here and there i could uh bring them all in book form you are thinking of a second edition  no it has uh gone through a second edition also one or two words now it is due for uh reprint again  of course this uh while it was printing the second time i made some addition uh i had a chapter on uh this practical criticism and i called it tentative notes for practical a new observation anyway one word  and one chapter i added on the new critics  at the insistance of a friend who is now head of the  english department at karnataka university yeah she happens to be an old student of mine  and then again i had a post script to do one of the chapter  so this way it was uh the second edition of the book  so rather than reprinting as it is i use to add something more to the book sure  uh when it goes for third printing  and what about you ? have you done anywhere since you are  you are experienced in printing and outsetting  ha yeah  it reminds me one thing  once only in my life as i am not a teacher i tried to publish a small book on grammar grammar actually that's functional grammar for uh in general for the students at the s s l c level and this for final level but it is one word because of so many problems that kind of progress uh has been in my mind too oh yes i thought uh one or two word   specially in our state it's in kerala we brought uh  of course so many books borrowed from andhra they one-word  like it  one-or-two-words  but uh we don't have a book which is really meant for  or useful to children one or two word  so i i uh like to publish a small book especially with regard to the uh examples  examples one-word but then it didn't work anyway i brought out a small one-word a book and  it's uh printing material and it's most uh efforts yeah it's true printing some thing and i once i thought of leaving everything uh but uh anyway i uh finished it but then it was not satisfactory then my aim i mean it was my wish always uh i was uh i wanted to be a teacher uh but uh that's the only thing i couldn't and when i did get the chance and uh if i got i missed it anyhow and now atleast oh so you didn't get a chance yeah a chance and  that's why you had to  uh go for some other job and now i am working as an officer steno  and uh i am still rethinking of teaching uh uh i mean coming again to teaching  and i took my pg degree in three subjects in  english malyalam and politics   i see   i see  ahn and now i am doing my research in one of the topic in english  good and very good  and   i'm doing this course   that's only for inter  i have no other i mean prospectus nor tried for because it was late now i am age forty oh i have been late so i expect in that things   oh   now you want to change the line and go back to teaching after all of course i tried in many ways uh after my s s c uhm which i was doing was trying many fields  uh   uhm  ahn i tried some banks and i knew kuchipudi and  one-word bharatnatyam oh and i studied for seven years  and i studied carnatic music also  i studied uh some western music also and i can play very well  some southern musical instruments and i participated in  dynamora one- word forum  oh  ah and uh i was the one-word the church choir being a christian  well i tried many way but uh luck as if my star was not bright i think  oh you did  i see yeah so i couldn't succeed anyway i joined here as per my interest  anyway i am hopeful i fought for the best to come  you seem to be versatile man with varied interests thank you laughter  i couldn't have guessed as much from  i did try it  tried it tried it of course  you see uh cough man's abilities are not written on his face anyway  oh yes yes but then uh it is uh call call it versatile because my experience is when ever we go deep investing we know how little we actually know  accepted i can feel that that from from   my own experience after simply taking a degree i mean ba that was in economics  i simply uh showed courage to take the programme of teach for a wrestler without any reference or preparation i mean ahn  but uh after taking my ma i will now try without preparation because that's  no doubt means that uh when we go deep into a thing then only we know how less we do  then we have to prepare uh well one has to recollect one stops on uh that's uh how we teach literature  before one uh has to do any talking on that is literature  no doubt for uh on every reading once possibly see the new meaning in it one see something new  sure sure  oh  it's always better to read the poem or prose piece once again carefully before we give a talk on it  yes  sure  you know i used to have uh some other interest too i used to be a sportsman at school  and then college of course i my interests uh were  tape recorded ultimately it's only books uh that have remained my first and last interest uh you may even call it my first and last love i'm  the complete bookworm so to say yeah  but then to deserve that affiliation that name either kam dand one word  uhm uhm which i've not  then one's administration cuts into one's   time which i would like to devote to books well your major parts of your life was connected with a lot of administration and all yeah that has to be yeah uh into most of my time  moreover even uh managing the household  yeah  yes yes that familiar thing  yeah that takes a lot out of us   yes  yes uh my mrs is not a highly educated oh  and uh so i have to take on most uh most of the burden of the uh seeing to the childrens education sure their requirements  sure  universal their upbringing yeah  you know one-or-two-words   one-or-two-words  my mrs can't be of much help to me in my profession  rather i have to be of some help to her oh in fact in the household work yes  so it's like that so even that have claims over my time oh  which i wish could have been spent to my which i might have devoted to reading and writing reading and writing yes   it's always the problem with we people   i've admired and been suffered with uh mine has been a chequered career uhm i for studied in three colleges i have taught in four colleges  uhm  uhm that's something great you have the experience of teaching in different colleges  and uh  again one or two words i had to to be without any employment for six months uh i suffered uh break of service and that told upon my one-word also  i suffered a great loss in terms of one- word  but uh none of that has been able to uh darken the horizon of my mind  you really you have the presence of mind to fetch the boundary  yeah yeah that's uh one uh has to do  say then i just only remember for telling these night and day dispute but never be defeated that these are the credit to our  one-word  one of these setbacks ah sure uh i have been able to tell upon my one-word  tell upon my outlook on life  i have always sought healthy thoughts  and uh never looked back  to especially in anger  never look back in anger  ah not in anger  oh sure you not you should not regret uh regreting the steps i have taken yes the buses that that i had missed ah ha  the wrong turnings i have taken in life ah right   that's why i never looked back ah i see  and uh had any regrets for whatever i myself done or decided upon with my eyes open oh  so life has it's ups and downs oh sure 
yes i am sri ramchandran very well nice of meeting you nice of meeting you  i am m periyar swamy from tirayur  well sir nice of meeting you  i'm selvaraj working in uh selam  mr ramchandran ah how do you find the climate in mysore ?  it's very pleasant here  very pleasant uh how do you find sir ? uh it is very pleasant sir really  you see when compared to our place ah where we have only two seasons the hot season the hottest season  but here we have  ah  yes yes of course  we have here lot of breeze you know ah here we've lot of breeze and uh actually may be due to uh this this place around uh mysore is full of forests forest dense forest not only that it is at high altitude from the sea yes so it is uh very cool yes people also call it as city of garden   such a climate city of garden  such a climate we can not uh enjoy in our place  by the by you went on your trip yes yesterday we had been to uh srirangapatnam and then uh somnathpuram temple yes somnathapuram also we went we just wanted to visit all the places in and around uh mysore  and because we are not familiar here you know we just went to the karnataka tourism and development corporation and we booked uh  for the bus and it was a very pleasant journey indeed  have you accustomed with the mysore weather ? no half way because we are not we we came here  off handed off handed in the sense uh we didn't forsee this climate  we didn't bring any warm clothes with us  these are the clothes we have to manage  so especially during night time we feel so chill oh  after spending some two weeks uh alright we are  okay okay  and uh mr ramchandran uh i came to know that you  was were the principal of uh vaishva college in selam yes sir and uh when you uh wh wh when you when you were promoted to that  uh last year sir last year ninety-two i see  is it a co-education ? yes sir co-education institution sir ahn  strength of around seven hundred students  ahn  seven hundred students and out of two hundred are girls ah girls uh  what are the subjects that you are having there in bsc computer science bcom b b m b b a b s one word  science i see it belongs to arya vaishya community  oh very well so it uh it is a self financed unaided college  institution  institution but affiliated to university of madras  and how about the trend of the students  the trend of the students is mixed sir   of the  ha i see ha ha we can't say we can't justify ourselves that there are of  high class or of low class  higher  the situation in all the colleges uh do you face this uh have strike of students no sir in your institution ?  no sir  no it is highly impossible we can't do it because we are not allowing them to form  form an association uh but   they can represent  each and every individual has got right to represent oh i see but you you don't allow this union chairman no  secretary  no  no sir but uh in government colleges uh they have their own freedom to be even in uh our have you seen sir many students you know dancing sometimes  at the time of elections yeah and uh almost i think uh political influence is there yes uh politicians are uh encouraging their students to get their leaders elected   what's going on   students are the instruments for the po  politicians ha yes politicians  uh this is a great problem nowadays in the colleges that is  every year when the new boy student comes to the college uhm they uh old students they were are ragging ragging and the uh uh with the help of welcoming them ha they involve in ragging uhm  and they are about to tease uhm  in such a case women students are more affected more affected by this especially in the professional colleges you mean eve teasing yes eve teasing no especially in the professional colleges  even sometimes they committing commit   suicide  no  oh yes yes i came across one such case  oh  it happened uh in my place  and another case is uh he mentally he became imbalanced  and he was affected  he discontinued the course and came i see  but he was a meritorius student  student  got a thousand one word  uh thousand out of out of two one thousand two hundred got two hundred  such a good boy he was fine within say four months usually these things will take place only in the professional colleges  question arises but it has been but  now it is followed by arts and science colleges even in arts colleges even arts and science colleges all in arts place it is going on  because uh those who are born rich uhm they are coming to chit-chat  uhm  yes yes  they are enjoying by the uhm they are enjoying this uh statistic pressure  uhm  uhm  they come to college to only just to spend their time yeah to spend their time  uh they study is not their primary motive no  but when they when they study in schools you know they are alright  they are obedient no even in higher secondary that uh junior college ha they are supposed to be like that  but uh we do not uh come across such uh problems oh you are uh working in the girls school yes we because i am working in the girls school i do not have any such problems over there in co-education we find problems my myself too because i am working in an aided uh higher secondary school oh uh my management is uh someone who cares more discipline and law  for him the result is secondary one discipline is foremost thing  we don't have strike and uh these and that  but even then boys attitude is some changing  they are able to sense it uhm  and what is your vocational group sir there in your  addition group   we have three vocational groups sir one is uh a general mel mel malaciest   malaciest  and the other one is uh radio tv mechanism  that's a very good course  uh a very good course sir uh bright future is also and that is also useful to them in future in future  and the third one is office secretaryship i see oh  that course there they will be having typewriting and uh shorthand ha uh type writing uh accountancy commerce and office management  uh yes yes we here sir in our school we have uh dress designing  oh and making  oh yes since it's a girls high school oh yes yes and this year we have planned to introduce  nursing also nursing  nursing also sir and we are having uh building maintenance also also  they can join polytechnic ahn okay for practical and other things of course we do not have uh  all the facilities that are expected  but still we send our girls to the nearby polytechnic polytechnic to undergo the practical work  are you looking after any business other than profession sir ? no sir no business no no business my sole profession is teaching   teaching   no nothing sir   yourself sir ? i do not have any business now sir  once i had but after becoming a teacher you know i wanted to dedicate my life ah yes yes to the teaching profession i see  formally i was a businessman  uh then i didn't have peace of mind  of course i could earn a lot lot but after becoming a teacher you know i have the  happiness rather i have the pleasure   you have moreover  if we have some other business means we cannot do  full justice to this profession   to profession yes certainly  the every teacher should be like that uh but uh most probably nowadays all the teachers i can say sir are engaged in some or the other in any business even college uh professors you know college professors most of the college professors  are engaged in business and uh especially in government colleges  yeah yeah one or two words  yes in government colleges earn a lot uhm and i know one professor uh in selam who was our professor also  he is the owner of a mosaic factory oh mosaic factory and he is uh earning a lot   one or two words  yes certainly and uh frequently he goes to rajasthan  to buy the marbles ahn  and then he comes back to selam ahn but actually i doubt uh whether he will be rather  concentrating on his profession profession true certainly he can't  laughter   true  because  as a businessman ten days or fifteen days he takes to go and come back  and uh where will be the time for him to prepare for the students students very difficult   students  and uh do you have any of your staff like that sir ? yes sir in your college yes uh they are uh looking after that business uhn but uh in our college they can't uh have their involvement in business only business uh we are having a strict vigilance oh whether they are uh teaching properly oh  when they are completing the syllabus ah  are they going according to the syllabus uhn  and uh really the we are testing the feedback of the students  oh   oh   ah   uhn  oh  if the students give uh gives any complaint   uhm or if they place a letter in the suggestion box about the  performance of the professors in the one or two words   uhn   oh you are having a separate suggestion box  we are taking severe action   action against the we are having separate suggestion box which is operated by the correspondent of our college ah ha  not even principal ha  and he will take action on this letters   that means all these letters uh dropped in the box goes to the corresponding yes correspondence secretary ha ha she will look into the matter  he  ah he uhm he will be looking into the matter i see  and uh he will take uh stern and uh sturdious action   action uh for the  action  so job security may not be expected there no uh no it's not like that they were they will be having proper enquiry  enquiry ha both the side  i see ha ha  initially they will give warning uhm such and such comments are coming uhm you have to be careful  right  warning is there  uhm   uhm   right  there  thank god for us uh i think sir laughter in uh  higher secondary school we do not have such uh such a problem  such uh  problem  because it's a private college  and it's a developing institution they want to earn a status in that district  so they are trying for that  and in tamil nadu sir why should not we introduce uh junior college system sir   what's your opinion about that ? yes well but uh what higher secondary it means it itself means junior college yes of course but uh our uh education minister is not for that it seems uh not means that he wants to call pg teachers as pg teachers only teachers only uhm uh he doesn't like to give the designation designation atleast lecturer  uhm   designation  lecturer or uh like that laughter  do you find any difference between pg one word and lecturer ? no no we don't find them uh  supposing if it is a junior college you know uh we can have that designation  but uh  working in  if it is a school  working in a school we can't get that uh   a few words  we can't get that uh yeah attractive you mean status  abstract designation  that's all what can we say but our work is the same yea 
anything which is spoken in india will be indian english or  a particular type of english will be called indian english  no i think english spoken here in the indian context   in on the indian soil that's what we   saying say india english  and there will be different types of indian english  indian english one two three and so on there must be different types of indian englishes because we have different varieties of languages spoken here in india varieties means different families of languages spoken here in india or how many of this is the most indian of all these indian englishes again becomes a question  yeah that's true  i think that is one of his task to find out   we can ask him also  so when was  when was this when was this started this subject of indian english  i think it started around sixtees so i feel i remember in the college uh mr uh i forgot the name of this english teacher but it is on my tongue yes  he brought the book uh common errors in in indian literature he mentioned certain things like  a big size a big big size  what is that that's like  nahi big size   achha what's that one an arab stays in the big size what you say i see  but he said it's a wrong english  it's a wrong english and it should be like he he  he recommended some other books for the use so what are what is the what books did you have i forgot i was giving an example okay  so that kind of thing with indian english or what is indian english that wrong wrong one so called wrong one in indian english or right one in indian english  no no you cannot say wrong one or right one not i think there are some influences and interferences from the mother tongues  oh the newspeak english it's a  one word   so the concept is changing those days  certain things spoken in indian english were considered wrong wrong that's it and now even a wrong ones are indian english i think so whatever english which is spoken here in india i think these are all rule governed because there is no language which is not rule governed  so in that way you cannot say that indian english is spoken here in india is wrong but uh many people in india speak english with the  yeah even we will make one of no no i what i mean to say is uh many people in india speak english in the wrong tense uh wrong wrong construction   yeah that kind of thing  yeah  so how do you  and the one word is where past participle to be used yeah present is used that kind of a yeah  that kind of thing  yeah   yeah  that kind of thing  so how many speak english  so that is that is is it is it to be categorised as wrong english or indian english  it can't be categorised as wrong english it is to be categorised as indian english but you must remember is  yes  you remember your collegues  yes  and uh his english laughter  so uh i want to say i want to tell something i want to say something or the other to you means no i can teach english uh i don't know what kind of english is this but that's sometimes there are englishes which are spoken by local people which are quite intolerable like  that means   haan if you can consider it as a very very extreme form of indian english or  i think no you have to you will define a range yeah that's yes that's what  you've to define your range or to which you can consider something as indian english yes so i think that  yes  so even even indian english no there must be established indian english i think that uh should be brought out  no   uh  something as indian english so that will be taken as a variety of indian english  so you say like an example i remember uh a song  which was uh uh written in kannada when i was in bangalore  several years back this song was very popular uh this this  english song uh this song is sung by a gardener or a helper  to a rich maiden uh rich lady  so the song goes in kannada mixed with english  kannada kannada interspersed with english english uh english words broken english words so the language goes madam giving giving money without any word without any one word   haan madam madam give me money i bring in clouds  so suppose and this is not a concocted example  many people  yeah specially helpers who know something this is they are going to speak yes so this is cooked up in your mind some certains  certain words it is simple i think that that why so we we consider indian kannada english or will we consider is something which can be considered english  so that we have to decide up upto what level you can considered it an english proper i mean uh proper english or even proper language  yes  because unless you define a range anything which is cooked up even a a monkey or a even a computer which stores certain things jumbled up yeah  you mix words jumble it up and what whatever comes out you'll say is indian english or african english  depending on where it is spoken  yeah the interference is from mother tongue that they have all this interference is like people used to consider is uh as a mistake but those mistakes uh they they used to sort of reject the mistakes  now these mistakes are normal considered as unwanted element  they in fact on the basis of error which are made by the speakers  of different communities are tak taken as a strategy  so that uh after chronicling this strategy they can  uh what to say they can make uh plan yeah i remember uh another form of very interesting indian english which was spoken in j n u where i studied  uh j n u in the evening uh you have to see the j n u uh you can visit until seven people thronging the bus and they talk marxism art cultural dance debating so all those uh smart  girls and boys in j n u used to sit together and they used to talk as not all not all of them  but certain classes among them yeah  who had rich fathers or you know with uh uhn higher incomes or you know where a certain kind of life style  yes yeah  yes this this one includes there   yeah this one like  pardon uh  you cannot have to bring the tea here no  yes  no you tell him to bring it you bring it here ah here here one ah here it is there what form of two words  oh sorry  that's too much one word know you should  one or two words  when i think of two this thank you haan   so i think it's already two min  it's already ten minutes more than ten minutes no  let's hope another another few lines and this okay it will be over so i remember  uh i was just pacing out wherin yeah  so there names speak some changes like uh you know  uh uh one word yesterday you know uh in hindi  you know he's wear the jean he brought was impressing you know  that's i think that's uh that kind of thing you see  then uh i saw with my friend uh you know what what michael says in hindi but but you know i can write it one word that kind of so mixed english yeah got one you know we you know what happened when you say something   uhn in hindi then you continue with english  uhn   that's what you call code mixing  so what is it is it indian hindi english or indian hindi english ? so that's what makes a construction and there is something called  one or two words  i wanted to ask professor shastri here something is called hinglish  hinglish uhn i know hinjali  not hinjali hinglish hinglish hinglish means  h i n yeah i know hinglish  yeah hindi english yeah  combined  english spoken by you know  hindi speakers  hindi speaking but of course they won't be speaking these people   accha  where you know hinglish is modified according to their convenience   haan uh so where did you come across this english  this comes in newspapers in printed news  hinglish once i came across like hinjali  isn't it  hinjali i don't know  hindi you remember i think uh  so in english i have come across but hinjali i don't know  hinjali it's uh i think their argument influences in punjabi from i think nil the other way round there are some influences of punjabi songs in hindi  uhm that way it could be  but it's  that  but there is something different na  yeah that is also something different   that  their way i just remember that uh that one and we i remember the words  yeah another form of variants of english yeah but what is it   indian english will be considered as a variant of english or variety of english  it is a variety spoken here in india and variant and va variety say i think they are  quite different yeah they are just  variant  variant uh so that it's uh  variant variant is uh variant is  is a little different from i think variant  uhn  varieties of these very necessarily main influences  i think it differs on which perspective you are trying to say that no  no that  variant means uh hinglish  no i variant in fact it contains i can yes some sudden it can uhn it can have some substance of you know that makes yeah yeah that's true  substance or you know away from the north  haan yeah that's one  but i think it is a very vast topic so unless you define some range  yeah  unless you bring certain  but you uh certain certain acceptable you know criteria a rough  uh this indian english will be too hard and uh you note a  useless for an indian english i think regarding this we have to take other exam with faculty no you know sushil kumar one word will it go straight uh  no  so we pick up a case indian english in manipur or what is called indian english in manipur or manipuri indian english  you take up that case  even though manipur is a small state uh most indians don't know about manipur very less it speaks more  but even though it is a small state tiny state so called tiny state you have to take up a project like indian english spoken in manipur you will see how many varieties how many different forms  i do remember hindi spoken by these people like kukis once  already there are friends and colleagues and the primoga  even that those two americans  i know as far as that two words  error is displayed  that then uh   then uh  see in the in the case of uh doctor uh you know that uh or economics professor muslim professor they will speak in a different there use and way you know it's been the way they speak english is different  so it's a english academy which is no the way they speak is manipur is a in uttar pradesh they speak manipur uh english is not so different as no  this  there is a   no  i think i think there is some differnce  then uh i don't see there is much  dr n loken the elder brother of dr. loken  uh he'll speak in a typical so called intellectual student like intellectual way  all this is higher  what is it? what is your opinion ah they are smaller in one na it will uh  they are tribals for example uh uh yeah that's true or professor ha literateurs are there  henry ah  they speak in english in a different way and again  even now this kukis speak english in a different way from tamkuls or other nagas  i think yeah you may think that i am a kuki upper  yeah  ahn i was just i was just  that's not a one word difference are   so bound to come   so  then   that's what there is the the debate of indian english  uh you take up even in a tiny state there are so many varieties yeah  so how many we work at it  you have to you have to define a range  yeah here  upto which you can consider certain things  there is english for part of what i can which is considered as certain range  upto which you can consider certain things i mean it's sort of fresh or   something a language something a language  for a suitable language  then after area you have to decide define certain things  acceptable english see acceptable norms  ahn whether it is indian english call english hindi  just forget that but what you have to define uhn  then only you can take up as as you have american started earlier english na  i think we should although we i think we already have a  indian style we have it you know  we have to have considered a limit na extreme limit  yeah  yes  and then whatever falls arrange  whatever falls  within that range within within range in that range then on then only you speak up in indian english  otherwise you continue with that english i think if we get an influence   haan  rush  with english spoken like  one word  manipuri special dialect all that you have to include yeah  if you want to represent a model of india ah that's   that's true  it will become an impossible to yeah do that kind of  yeah  english that that's spoken here in indian no  so it is a it is a vast topic  i think we can somehow please stop here ahn

how do you like the place prabha  i like it fine the only thing it doesn't agree with my constitution with weather  yes i too find it uh little bit chill  what about you uma  no i think when i came here initially i wasn't well  now i think i got accustomed to this climate and other thing  how about you  no initially it didn't affect me but i think uh now my resistance is much less uhm and i have got sore throat cold  uhm  uhm i think it must be also because that you are away from your son yeah ah  by the way how old is your son  he is twelve and he is in ninth standard  twelve and in ninth standard yes but it is very early i think in school i i too think so  he is very young for the class  how many kids do you have  i have uh just one  what about you uma i have got two  got a son in fifth standard ah and a daughter  she is admitted in kg in one word   ah  won't they miss you definitely  i have written to my son and my husband also has written to me saying that he miss me a lot what about you prabha haven't you received any letter from home i have written to them  i'm expecting a reply from how many kids you have two kids both girls i have never left them alone till now which class are they fifth and sixth girls in yes the problem of platting the hair washing the hair i don't know what they are doing at home  yes  my husband must be just keeping the cooker and they must be eating just daal and rice when you go your husband is a good cook i think no he not i don't say he is a good cook but he will manage somehow i think yeah yeah know when we go back no i think we'll get a rosy welcome home welcome there   yes laughter  everybody would have missed us a lot no  perhaps they will understand our value better then  all the work which we did then yeah  sometime this parting is necessary no yeah  temporary parting  especially one or two words   yeah  yeah we'll also realise their importance and  they'll also one word  ah yes especially my son's case no he is very much attached  i feel uh that this separation will help him to uh get  uh become a little bit independent  but the only thing i'm bothered is regarding his studies no  because i help him a lot with his studies  now of course he's got to get the help of his father or grand parents or someone else   uhm   ayyo my daughters were saying you know   yeah before i left they were saying how will we study  yeah  because i'm the one who coaches them  my husband comes at very late from work  and he doesn't have much time to attain to their studies  so all their studying the home work part and all that they feel as if no like it's like even though i would they would have felt uh mummy is not letting us play and all so long  now that uh strictness is removed from them they i think  they'll feel a bit insecure  so they were asking me my son too needs me  otherwise he won't touch the book  i don't know what he he is doing in my absence  may be he's cutting his tution classes and uh just whiling away the time  but he is with your parents no yes a few words pamper pamper him a lot   it's okay just for a month  for a change let him get pampered then he will change back to his normal routine  how about your hobbies and all  what do you do during your i i i play with my son yeah  he doesn't like chess because he has to use his brain  yeah   brain well he like shuttle cock better than that   so i play   no even for shuttle cock you have to use your brain you have to one or two words   no one or two words maybe that  kind of   kind of but it would be better than an indoor game no  no it's an indoor game only  uhm oh shuttle cock  but i play it as an outdoor game  of course when it's very windy we can't do that  and he expects me to run about just like uh  uhm young girl uhm

well dr nihalani we got a number of uh articles uh  made of wood just half an hour back what do you think about these  ?  ashok is it ? i think they are quite good  good and cheap  uh i think one of the reasons why we liked them was that uh they were brought to one word and the other thing was that they were very nice and uh we could use them as a presents to our relatives and friends  don't you think so ? yes a very reasonably priced  and uh items were all very compact  oh yes   that's what uh i i like them immensely   uh  what do you think about our visit to dhanyalok the other day that is last sunday ? it was quite uplifting i should say uh to be there  uh it was a lovely evening we spent with dr c d n  yes  uh the warm hospitality yeah  and uh that pleasant environment yeah uh  was real good that i should say   yes   yeah   yeah  wasn't it a very memorable and treasurable experience ? yes of course yes  uh especially when you are from we were made to sit uh  in the in vichar yeah in the in the  sanjay vichara mantapum when then we had  tea in the garden and then dr c d n uh talked to us about several things yeah including poetry thesis poetry   yeah  and uh well his first encounter with t s eliot   yeah  now well this was really absorbing very interesting  uhm  in vichar   yeah   yeah   yeah  well everytime we even see c d n everytime we talk to him  yeah we find that well we are energised and we feel inspired and at same time we feel that we have to do quite a lot   yeah  as compared to what he does  then he also uhm you know gave us a copy of brindavanam   yeah the new periodical started and then the recent issue of  literary criterion  uh number one is tour of nineteen ninety-three   uhm which uh has a i mean which has special number on  the drama in post graduate they conducted uh sometime back   yeah   uhm  and he was quite encouraging you know to one word  uh and at work yes uh dhanyalok to be just one man show   yes  yes he said he's seventy-three now oh yes doing an extremely useful work  certainly he in the field of english studies and indigenous arts yes  and i felt terribly inspired yes and uh  that even at that age after retirement yes one can do lots of good things  yes   yes  yes  so to me it was extremely uplifting and educative  yes i must say   yes  uh another thing yeah, so please continue   a another thing is that he uh he enc   uh encourages the scholars to come out there and uh read uh on their own  maybe uh concerning with their research topics or  maybe the literature of their interest yeah because he has a number of books on commonwealth literature   yeah   yeah  certainly he has a   and a  he has a very good library in fact and at the same time i suppose uh there is a good place to sit also yes especially in the library hall library hall the sitting arrangement the round table the sitting arrangement is quite good   quite good  and then there are number of photographs also you must have seen  and he has the photograph of his teacher uh dr f r levis yes yes  hey you know these scholars are very well looked after yes uhm as members of uh his family yes i have uh an occasion dr inamdar's in aurangabad  oh yes his wife  he was uh there for about a week uh wanted to consult books on commonwealth literature  oh yes  right yes uh they were all admiration for the man and for his family certainly yes you see and besides uh the the guidence that he got  here in the subject uhm i very much remember you know the warm hospitality and affection that they oh yes oh yes we remember uhm yeah  one or two words  everyone who stays with them has very fond memories of their stay and uh there you know happy moments of talk and discussions  that's true  i think there is also his assistant by his uh son and his sister-in-law yeah one of his and few others daughters-in-law yeah daughter-in-law sorry and uh some of his uh grand children yeah some of the grand children also yes so uhm yes it it was memorable uhn experience through uh so one really feels like visiting mysore  uhm especially for this purpose of uh visiting brindavan and uh   uhm  another advantage is it's quite close to manas gangotri one word  uhm the university campus university campus of mysore  so it's really situated at an ideal place so that was one of my it is uh far away from the noise and bustle and one word  tumble of the town  and uh well it's an ideal place for meditation and study room i very much wanted to visit the place and i'm glad i've been able to yeah  uhm also that one word central institute of indian languages  yes uhm i enjoyed my visit to that place too yes ah that way yeah some usual work  yeah  certainly  another thing is that we were very fortunate in having uh two visits to brindavan yeah especially when i uh well i had stayed over here for a month yeah and uh i think we could consider ourselves fortunate in having these two visits so that we have uh have very close that a few words  and especially he gave us lot of information about that yeah uhm he gave us that one word also yeah  two words and he mentioned uh i think you saw him  didn't you ?  yeah  well yes i was chanced to walk there p g teacher on the evening alone  that was quite sometime ago yeah a couple of years ago i suppose  yeah so quite well done that was also  collected yeah we mentioned of that and uh  yeah  when you mentioned it to dr cyrian he was also there i think yeah  and uh yeah this is one of the institute in india uh run by one person yes and not an official institute  yes  no but uh really a an ideal istitute which caters to needs of very serene uh devoted scholars of english shall we say something like mini shantiniketan yeah mini shantiniketan but you know dr cyrian does not want to be name shantiniketan to be given uhn because he says that uh the the terms that that there are no one word university and the campus of shantiniketan  as far as the one word  ah ha so that's the reason why he perhaps doesn't like the name of shantiniketan to be given  but that's that's another matter no no see anyway we we we always like to associate you know our own perception of shantiniketan our own uh you know memory of shantiniketan with what we saw at uh   one word  true the campus is simply beautiful   beautiful  true  uh we had trip to ooty some shall we say about ten days ten fifteen days back almost fifteen days back fifteen days back now uhm there is a certain problems for arranging this but after having arranged it and after having visited ooty what do you think about your our visit ? was it uh hurrying trip to ooty or do you think that well it was very succesful trip to ooty ? oh i think it went off very well  uh the weather was fine extremely good that day  fine  and it was cloudy but it didn't rain yeah and it uh i think we very much enjoyed the scenery yeah  there was sunshine for sometime at one word  ah and uh uh we were able to go round and see the important stops uh yes and important spots yes  incidently you know later on from the photograph i discovered that we have missed out on two very important point oh really oh oh yeah what are they ?  yeah  you see we they didn't take us around the childrens park oh i see it seems ooty has uh many nice childrens park you know so   one or two words  and the other one we missed out on that  and there is uh one telescope house it seems oh i see  so we weren't taken to that spot yeah i think  these two spots were missed out missed out on those two  but don't you think that we visited a very wonderful and very important one word the botanical garden that was wonderful  that was really marvellous marvellous   marvellous  breath takingly beautiful i should say  and uh i mean we didn't feel like coming out of it even we spent an hour an quarter perhaps oh yes  that was beautiful garden uh that lake also that lake ooty lake   lake  ooty lake also  but this was much better yeah yeah  but i didn't like the lake as much i like uhm  botanical garden especially the way it was maintained along  and uh  yeah  in fact uh  yes the bowers and uh that it did better than uh sky growing trees  better than the brindavan garden i should say   yeah yeah and uh brindavan garden and nurseries yes hardly thing anything in brindavan garden that brings to my mind  yeah that's right  uh except for those you know side one word   it's all giddish talking of life and you know that  mu musical fountain  yeah  but for that there is hardly anything in the  brindavan garden you know and you know sprawling that way  brindavan  yeah but you know the variety of variety of flowers   brindavan garden doesn't offer you much  no but this botanic garden at at ooty is simply marvellous marvellous  regarding variety of colours of and and  kind of flowers kind of trees  and and   i'm glad we were able to make it that day yeah yeah and fortunately the weather co-operated with us yeah  that wasn't it wasn't much crowded either  because otherwise we wouldn't have been able to enjoy it   ah ha much  ah ha  it all went up very well  and uh later on we came to know that the chief minister of tamil nadu uh visited uh at same day i see and perhaps the things were well say in order then  uh these streets were clean and uh there were boards and banners welcoming the chief minister of tamil nadu  i see  i see dr jaylalitha uh  yes and perhaps it was an advantage because uh i don't know whether we were prevented from entering one word  area   one word  i think good shape  yes they think they will have a good shape   one or two words  yeah  no but you know uh normally i think yeah  they must be maintaining it very well  yeah   that's right i think that's it uh  either way we had we had a very nice time there  in the park  indeed  indeed  yeah indeed  and uh we also return in time big thing yeah  uh well we left this place around seven yeah  and we were back home by seven  yeah  yeah and  you remember that uh it started raining when we were nearly  outskirt of mysore  mysore yes  yes and uh well uh we really succeeded in  organising and enjoying our our sunday in ooty dated to  ah that ooty  dated to the  yes of course 
when did you go to the u uk  so uh what are you to say about your marxism and things like that  marxism is supposed to one word  uhm  when did you first start reading on marxism actually  well i didn't read at all  i think it was from my locality that i i got the idea uhm because you happened to be with marxist you thought it is a very good ideology  well i didn't know anything about ideology aspects  in the beginning uhm  in my place i mean in our locality there were people who were not who called some some marxists uhm and they had a peculiar way uhm which attracted me  uhm   uhm   uhm   what are that what are that  peculiar way  well you know the so called co-operation uhm  the way they see with the way they treat people uhm  the way they talk the way they behave   uhm   uhm  so this this attracted you  you struct your something yeah uh which which the other ideologists didn't had   yeah  yes  uhm is that   that's what i think  which means that uh if you were brought up in a different  en environment say for example among the christians or among  among the muslims or among among the jains and buddhists say you would have accepted that ideology no no no because you know uh i was among the christians i was among the hindus uhm but neither christianity nor hinduism affected me uhm  only this particular way of living as we call  it is the marxist way way of living it only attracted me  because it had something speciality uhm uhm  something this something that uhm that  that makes it uh distinct from hinduism or christianity i do not like hinduism and i do not like christianity  but i like marxism because it makes a man think about people it makes a man think about his own fellow men and also about his place in the world   uhm   uhm   uhm uhm  well what has marx to say about the things which happened  before eighteen what is it seventeen eighty wh when was marx born seventeen eighty eighty-three eighty-five no no marx was born in the  well i think nineteenth century but marxism marxism began with marxism began with property  marxism lived through uh no no plight okay  uhm  it was a democrator and then that this was followed by  a generation of thinkers and finally uh it came to hegel  hegel had his views  and then marx marx had his own views and he developed into  an ideology  the form that we have now  uh no no   uhm   uhm   one word uh that's fine  well how does a marxism help you in your class uh in your teaching whether it it help you  will it help you to teach shakespeare or uh language   does it help you   well we can look at shakespeare from uh a marxist angle for example in hamlet we can we can  uh take the case of hamlet   hamlet sees the fall of his mother  uhm not of the fault of that particular individual   uhm but as the defect of the world in general  this is the bourgeois approach to human experience  an individual experience cannot be the experience of  everybody in this world uhm  so in that way one cannot according to marxist thinkers  one cannot universalise a on a particular experience  uhm   uhm   uhm  uhm uhm uhm so once you explain a text like this uh  so  when we explain a text like shakespeare uh a shakespearean play the interpretation will be in that way  uhn  one or two words  okay how does it help you in your teaching of language  well there is no answer uhm how does it help you in your family life  talking to your wife and children   family life in family life it helps a lot  uhm  because in indian society uhm which follows one a particular system uhm  i mean a male dominated indian society uhm uh it's rigid uhm  and marxism makes it flexible we uh we are told to look at women in a way we should look at a humanity  uhm   uhm   uhm   uhm   uhm   that's what even feminism says  feminism didn't say anything very different oh feminism may be imitating the marxist  uhm uhm uhm  so why did it fail in russia  why  why did it fail in russia  why did it fail in russia  see it was the fault was not with marxism  it wasn't with it was not with marx it was with the people who were in power   there they were corrupt   if it is applicable to marxism is not applicable to any other ism then  well i'm not aware of any other ism at present why marxism failed in russia is an open question  people have been discussing for a long time  and people once you say that there is something wrong with the people  and nothing wrong with an ideology   know  there wasn't anything wrong with the russian the ideology that russians had  well the people in power were wrong they went wrong  and they and their system two word  and the foreign intervention intervention from the part of  american and all other capitalist nations were also there  they were trying for a long time to destroy the soviet union since its inception in uh in nineteen seventeen  they have been trying for a long time to destroy the set- up well stalin with his iron hands could uh prevent the soviet set-up from destruction  but the later rulers couldn't   if any other ideology one or two words  uhm one word it's okay uhm can a thing be prevented with iron hands  yes many things could be prevented with iron hands means they are prevented for example that was what that was what stalin stalin did in russia uhn  but if they are prevented with iron hands what  or if something is prevented with iron hands  uhn it means uhn the person who prevents  uhn is likely to be again uhn destroyed by iron hands  uhn   uhn   uhn   uhn  suppose someone is going to destroy your society and suppose there is strong person with a very strong force to protect the society well he is doing a good job  he is saving the society  so that was exactly what stalin did in russia   but those who oppose you know the but those who oppose if you destroy them uhn  then it means that you are doing a something good for the society   uhn  yes if the society has a cancer of hand it has to be cut who is going to decide  it is the people  if it is the people then other people had any voice well if is a person goes on destroying everyone communism cannot succeed without the support of the people that was what happened in kerala for example marxsism failed in kerala and west bengal  why did it fail in kerala and west bengal  because it wasn't a popular movement  so communism failed not communism marxism fail in kerala in west bengal also the movement failed  it was because the those people who who were the  opponents of that particular movement uh could not influence people  okay fine means uh if if it failed in russia uhm it means people are not with communism   uhm  people are still with communism in russia  you know the way they uh the way they executed communism  i mean the how they practised communism that was wrong  in what sense it is one word  what sense it is what what those who are in power uhn  then they have something like politbureau yeah and the members of the politbureau ahn infact again become previleged people  uhn   yeah   ahn  ah yeah that was there   and if they become previleged people   corruption you'll find ball is in their hand  corruption  yeah that is that is corruption  it means any ism for that matter ultimately leads to hurt see there is nothing called ultimate  because you know these people went wrong  who went wrong   e e this people those people who were at the helm of affairs   those who were the as you pointed out   ah supporters of communism   ah  not supporters of communism the people who were in power for example in russia  there was gorbochov   but who comes in power  now actually these people  he he accepted the prize who got the nobel prize  no no  uhm why did he accept the nobel prize  what was bernard shaw's reaction when he was awarded the nobel prize  bernard shaw was not a pure communist but this man gorbochov  secretary of the c p s u accepted the noble prize  and who are noble uhm the inventor of uh weapon intended to destroy humanity  marxism stands for humanity  it is for the preservation of humanity  and this man gorbochov accepted a medal meant for the  capitalist profit motivated people  so in that way he was going   uhm   any person who comes into power he comes because of popular support  but once he comes into power he becomes power crazy power greedy he is after more and more power and ultimately what happens he finds everything is centred in him and because of that uh again  he goes at basic principles of one word  see this was not what happened in the soviet union  you may know about uh that perestroika and glasnot  see see and there but there also again what happens we find that members of the politbureau they were previleged people there ah  but with if marx was under   ah   that was not so in the past and the society in which there are one word he wants to have a classless society  and that dream he had  well uh i do not agree  okay fine i think we talk about something else uhm uhm how did you enjoy your stay here  i enjoyed your company very much  why  because you know it is a very different sort of experience because in our state it is uh raining uhm  and it is very unpleasant uhm  we can not sit like this and chat because of the uh tanned  atmosphere and uh chill uhm  so you know in that way and uh again it's a change uhn uhn from the what we have been doing there  now i'm in a different atmosphere uh both physically and mentally  and so uh uh i feel that i can enjoy it   uhm   uhm   uhm  yeah how did you enjoy your stay here  very fine to be here in company of  fine ka matlab  well how fine  because all the while i was in the company of very nice people uhm educated again refined those who have very nice ideas to propogate hm hm hm and  uhm   hm hm hm  well in that way you too have an idea to propogate  you propogate hinduism and he propogates uh islam  islam   islam  uh yes uh you have recently been to your  yeah family yeah what about your children wife  how are they  yeah   yeah  in fact uh my son and daughter they had asked me to buy buy them uhm this thing the sunglasses have they missed you a lot  yeah they did miss me in fact they were waiting for their sunglasses as soon as i went home my son asked me uh asked me for the sunglasses  luckily i bought bought two bought two  for the one the one i bought for my son was very loose  so he always wearing it and slipped on his nose and he was  uh he asked me one or two words putting in back  then when my daughter it fitted very well  so luckily i i could i could bring i can buy them if not i would have had a tough time  then then my daughter wanted some jewels something like that she she cried she wanted jewel somethings like that  then i promised to buy some silk sarees for for my wife from mysore then she she wasn't very keen she said okay fine i think i get good one to buy  then my wife's sister also wanted a saree then two of her sisters also wanted sarees so i  now i have to buy about four six sarees from here  these are going to come about four thousand rupees  i think i'll have to spent  so yes i one or two words you don't worry yes i can get get the whole thing for about three thousand five hundred even that  i'll find  so i'm just thinking what i should do what  but then of course i have a hell of time travelling uh i mean from here to erode and erode to trinavelli and trinavelli to uh once again to ooty  no this is in mysore stays and here and back rather bit too much  for for first time i've been experiencing so much of trouble travelling now after month of travelling sitting in a bus and for two nights continously a bit too much  but then i really think whether whether i should have been taking so much of trouble  this one month uh i mean my i mean my od od not not i mean not being sanctioned till now 
 one word sushila   so shushilaji when are we leaving to your place  i'm leaving on the twenty ninth of one word   what is your impression of mysore last year  and whether you like   mysore is a beautiful city  i liked it very much  i never imagined that it's a beautiful city  perhaps because i stayed in lucknow hostel and even  yeah lucknow used to be very very hot  and when i came to mysore i came here with the intention of visiting a new city  i didn't have any idea about the weather in mysore  when i reached bangalore uh i asked my sister how mysore would be like and she said that uh well it would be as good as bengal  now i come to know that my sister was uh right in a way but you know  now i don't know about sushila she is she one or two words  all that and asok is also  now i see you can we one word uh it proved to be a bit cough troublesome for me sushila of course you are there and i'm surrounded by friends like you and patil and asok and all that  i don't miss my home as much  but even then one word made quite long one or two words   now   one month is a long time to be away from home  and especially food and when you come back to my to your room uh you don't exactly like a warm that's   yeah especially in the evening when you returned from from the institute you feel rather home sick  yeah yeah  to enter the empty room when nobody is there to   yeah yeah  of course with sushila with with neighbour you  there is a kind of compensation kind of uh sisterly daughterly  yeah persons that the cheerful charming sweet and all that  but then we know that this is a kind of a medicine   yeah the family insists on but it is illusion  i know   yeah   yeah  suddenly you begin to feel early in evening she is always there  but you know up to the twenty first of june i think you got  whole long sushila yeah and now when i'm as if i'm out of job because the part of job it is yeah   part of job it is yeah  before she a few words   a few words  there is no worry formerly i used to think about my lesson moreover what shall i talk exactly exactly to keep you busy yeah it kept me mentally busy and now i'm  attending this classes  unless i must say i have got nothing else nothing to do  so in first the first thing that seem one word  i would i will say participate like that  it clearly give it a hope   hope hope you know i just i just missed it all hope now this is no  eat for getting to missed it so the only thing is that  i don't know but i think uh it was a very good experience uh  yeah   a few words  we had a nice time together all of us  and this evening we spent about half an hour uh uh with sushila uh talking about the sarees that she one word  the blanket on a blanket  blanket with the shawl that she has done  and my one word we started talking about uh colours patterns and one or two words   we're just allowed because one or two words   which colour will go with that person  and uh by the by the way it is interesting that that's  we've got this thing about the indian beauty  especial reference to women and uh sushila was one of the main person but she didn't feel embarrassed laughter  a statement about her and uh short nose tall uh reminding of uh classical  upbringing and all that she's from madras that was a very compliment comp comprehending with uh historical persons  complimenting compliment uh compliment they are true  otherwise she would feel uh furious  there is no embarrassing thinking but uhm these are the features and especially the sharp long nose and i think of that who is this lady ? uh i don't have uh rajasthani painting uh kishangarh school and all that  you will find that uh most uh women who are usually dressed as they were queens uh people of royal family they acted like a you know each and one or two words cough  unless you think of it you you relaxed when it loses us  it occurred to me there is something there  and i wouldn't fall on it  but today we started talking about it and then you know uh  you get uh uh uh a few words  so uh now that i'm leaving on the twenty seventh  a few words  and you are all alone  how long uh will be your journey uh perhaps actually if i leave this place and go straight to burdwan then it won't take uh uh very long time compare to other such thing like longest longest longest way   longest   it's about uh sixty-five hours but i'm  going via hyderabad because i'm leaving on the twenty-fifth evening  are you going to stay there or ?

my name is k m john   i'm very glad to meet you   i'm thomas  i come from the southern part of kerala oh you're also from kerala yeah that is yes i'm i'm also from kerala uh i come from trivandrum accha  uhm even though i'm settled in trivandrum i i was born in the central travancore  accha  yes i also belong to central travancore sir that is true uh i belong to kottayam district uh ah it is nice to meet you mr thomas  especially in this circumstances ah uh uhm i thought and i'll tell you something about my experience as a teacher very glad to hear sir uh  where were you working ?  for after my m a m a in english in nineteen sixty-eight i started teaching in a prestigious college in trivandrum  marvine co   sir you have a very long experience sir  as a teacher   that is that is true  about more than twenty-five years now uh  i've been teaching for the last fifteen years  fifteen years yeah  uh you you have taught only in one college only in one college  but my experience is varied  i taught for uh nine plus c s in trivandrum in marvines college trivandrum  then uh so naturally you are familiar with the trivandrum politics and such a things  yes yes uh lot you know because it was at the prime of my youth you know i was in trivandrum so ? so i was very much interested in the uh student politics in watching how students take part in politics very good sir  and also the various developments you know the  communist government in kerala  in sixty-eight you mean  that is true uh in sixties-seven second communist ministry came into power power in kerala  then uh the emergency period you know all this uh happened when i was during that emergency period you are were  in trivandrum ? i was in trivandrum  infact i appreciated one aspect of emergency know our people were all disciplined  haan disciplined  but of course freedom was curtailed you know  some could arrest you and take you to the prison without questioning  but there was one thing i saw see one aspect is that in our state there was not not such a misuse of emergency  yeah yeah  ah ha ha that is true  uhm i saw people you know in offices all going on time coming back on for we we didn't find it ve too much uh that troublesome yes yes yes  i would like to tell you something about my experience as a teacher   yes sir continue sir  uhm then perhaps you may you will tell me uh your experience about a teacher  uh i told you that i taught for nine years in trivandrum yes sir  then uhm i registered my name in the ministry of external affairs uh foreign assingnment section and uh when there was a chance for teachers in nigeria the ministry supplied the names of teachers who have registered their names with the ministry  and i was called for an interview  uhm they submitted the name in the nigerian high commission in delhi and people from the high commisssion came to trivandrum to interview  and uh i was interviewed and i was selected for  yes  oh you were in ni nigeria yes that is true uh for a teaching post hey that is very nice experience yeah  it was a very nice experience you know you are true  how many years did you spend there ? uh i spent uh ten years ten years ten long years a decade  it was a pleasant experience because that uh there have been an opportunity to get exposed to people from different parts of the country uhm in the past many teachers from our state went to nigeria ah ah some perhaps some of your relatives are there yes them  haan haan   they've spent five years or at the maximum ten years there ah ha ha  then one one thing i enjoyed about my uh work in nigeria was we had annual leave you know  after ten years we got two months leave and we could come home during those two months  and that nigerian government paid for our travel and the other leave allowances yes yes and other leave allowances so every year you had three or two months stay   every year i used to come yes yes  and it is not only for me for my whole family ah yeah my wife and two children uh to and fro tickets  and uh that gave me an opportunity to travel through different countries visit uh oh you visited other countries also yes yes  if i number the countries i visited i think it is about twenty-three how laughs surprising yeah that was one uh privilege i enjoyed uh uh by my service overseas  i could travel i could go to u s a to canada to england  european many countries in europe many countries in  middle east and some countries in africa  apart from nigeria i could travel through some other countries in africa that there have been opportunity to visit many uh countries  so that gave me an opportunity to get exposed to  people   very good   then after that ten years service you returned to trivandrum ? yes yes  i went in the year nineteen seventy-seven and uh i returned in nineteen eighty-seven  and uh i was planning to settle down in trivandrum i started constructing my house  there  then yes that is true then what happened ? uh then something very providential happened  i'll call it providential because i never expected that such a thing will happen you are a believer  yes i believe in uh god's plan in my life  and uh i saw an advertisement in one of the indian kerala newspaper about a post in karnataka  and uhm naturally when i found that it was a post in ke  in a college in a degree college and i was eligible to apply i applied for it  and i waited for two months you know there was no reply but all of a sudden i got an invitation for interview  that happened then the karnataka college from karnataka college  i had never travelled to karnataka  it was the first time i travelled to karnataka  though you have visited twenty-seven foreign nations yes yes i i visited many countries in uh all over the world but i i had yet to discover india you know  so i got an opportunity to travel to karnataka for my interview  that was in the month of may ninety seventy-seven uh nineteen eighty eighty-eight eighty-eight yes  then after the interview they asked me to join in the month of july  so i joined the college  as principal ? uh not exactly i was appointed as a reader in english  there was another principal when i joined they had another principal means two principals laughs that is no i was not appointed as a principal then  and it also happened providentially i will say because the  then principal he wanted to go for higher studies in england  he took one mon one years leave and uh went to england  then uh i was the senior most person in the college and so  they asked me to so you were promoted  uh yes i i was asked to be the acting principal for one year until he returned  then uh when he returned he didn't want to take charge as a principal  he did not receive his responsibility  did he continued as a teacher ? uh uh beg your pardon the that that fellow no no no uhm he he returned and the management was running a school  uh infact the school is a prestigious school uh with more than two thousand students  and he took over as the principal of the school and the mantle fell on me and i became the principal  in charge   principal yes so that was in nineteen eighty-nine  and from eighty-nine onwards i'm the principal in that college  then you tell me something about your experience as  teacher as a teacher ?  yeah yeah sir  my experience is not that of a principal laughs or anything like that you know the background yes  and the situation in kerala  there are many teachers there  accha  i got this appointment in nineteen eighty-one  as a lecturer there yes  after taking my degree from indore  ah ha you told me once you told me that  i took my m a from indore university ah ha ha  then naturally i had to seek for a job for a four years ah ha  so i got this appointment in eighty-one  ah ha  then joined as a lecturer ju junior lecturer that practice was there yeah  and for last fifteen years i've been working there ah ha so now i'm posted as a that senior grade lecturer ah ha  after the implementation of u g c that you know it happened in nineteen ninety ah ha  and you know uh everything about uh  this kerala and our raichin our that particular aspects   yeah though you were away from kerala for a long time  uh   yeah  yes every year i was coming and i uh sliding down  and we are very happy or we are actually proud of our state uhm because people are there all over the world from our state uhm uhm  then if you go to every part of india to any part of india you can notice that there are malyalis  uhm   uhm uhm  uh not only india every part of the world you know   ahn  some people commented that if you go to the moon you know there will be a malyali there  so now with a cofee shop and   ahn   malyali   this this shows our adventurous natures sometimes as sometimes our that test for you can work such a thing  uhn anyhow then we have also we have that political adventures also ah uhm  have you heard of the political that recent election results  uhn   ah uhm  ah yes i that yes i heard  that  for every fifty years what happens that there is a turn in  political alliance there ah ha  this time the left front have came in power once again our nayanar he is the chief minister there   yes the one this is his third uh that term yeah  as chief minister actually this people expected that some other would be the chief minister ah ha but in politics you can not expect anything  ah ha   yeah yeah   yes the one   yeah   ah ha  yeah that is real politics laughs  so but this the samething is happening there you just see  do you know the dilemma of the kerala politicians now or that the congress is in opposition there ah ha  the marxist are ruling yeah but at the same time  they are both these parties are supporting the  yeah i know deve gowda ministry yeah in the centre  so  and we now have enough rain sir  ah ha   yeah   yeah i know   yeah  ah ha in abundant in kerala start raining uh  abundant  in first week of june uh when you left kerala it was raining ah it is it is sir even now it is raining ah it is raining i i've letters from my family  members sir and it is described that rains are heavy there yeah going on  ah ha uhm   yeah  my family is staying in karnataka  ah your family is in karnataka yeah they call me every night and they say the rains have not yet started ah the people complain that   it's just like maharashtra it is just like here  it has not yet started  and see i have noticed some other things that is that many parts of karnataka are exactly like our kerala yeah  the trees the or those flowers and everything  yeah  ah ha the coconut plants are actually it was our property that coconut ah ha now it has become on all india  ah ha  yeah you can see coconut trees all over the coastal areas  from bombay our kerala is actually known as the land of coconuts then i have you have noticed all those coconuts plants sir yeah in karnataka also coconuts are plenty   every kind of tree i noticed  uh in goa and in karnataka  uh it is there  somebody told me that this there is a region known as konkan area here in maharashtra and there you can have every kind of agricultural products that that we have  yeah it is that yeah  ah ha coconuts you know in in our place karnataka when i say our place it is karnataka now since i'm settled there tender coconuts are more popular than ripe   coconuts   than   ripe one  but in kerala we do not use that much tender one sir ah yes yes and even a doctors say when you go the hospital uhn they'll prescribe tender coconut even as a medicine ah yes and it is supposed to be  panacea for all diseases you know  so people  uhn   ah yes  now we've already actually we've turned it to rubber ahn rubber plantation  ahn  yeah yes yes  coconuts are not that plantation is not a profitable one now ah ha  rubber is some what profitable now yeah  i think now we get above fifty rupees per kilogram per kilo ah   it's reasonable  uhm you too have you too have rubber plantation in your  though  yes yes yes man then you know very well that we all the keralites even though we have only ten cents of land there   everybody plants rubber there rubber plant 
so uhm i am mr shinde  i am mrs heema patil patil uhm  so we uhm in fact we are concerned about so many things now a days that we have to be talk about environment and  uh the onset of western civilisation uh western gadgets  what do you think about uh what will happen in this india   what do what do you feel about that  about environment yes  uh sir the position of today environment is not so good uhm so i feel that the future is very dark according to me it is dark  so you think that uh unless people become aware   haan of the future problem uhn  it will be very dark  haan   uhn   haan  so what has made you think uh like this  uhn sir whenever i see uhn some paper and other information uhm  then i feel that uh the air pollution is going on increasing uhm  uhm it's due to our bomb blast uhn  blast uhn and other things uhn these are going uh to add uhn the crisis   uhn   uhn   uhn   uhn  yeah   that's i feel that the future is dark it is there is noise pollution because of these uh refregerator heating uhm like industrial development uhm  perhaps even the management of natural resources  uhm   uhm  uhm  uh these are uhn making adverse effect on the environment on the environment so i feel that the future is very dark future is very dark  so i think you mean uh to put in very few words you mean that you are we are depriving our children from yes  pure nature uhm  yes  yes uh we are not uh  so in fact  we are criminals ah handing over uh  we are not handing over as it has come to us  no the  uhn as it has come to us   as it has come to us  so you you think of the past  yes  and your childhood uhn  uhn comparing with the childhood uh uh we were enjoying the fresh and pure air uh uhn  but uh at present uh the children are deprived of those happy days uhn uhn those fresh and pure air and many other things uhn  because of this changing culture uhm because of this noise pollution  uhm  yes  uh they are deprived of the pleasures which are derived from the nature yes  so it has to do with culture also culture also  so uhm what do you say about uh this strange thing that our religion our culture our past if we go to our past we have gods and goddesses haan  whom we worshipped haan you know  they are uh they represent nature  haan   haan  nature uhn then why this uh why people worship on the one on the one hand but they behave very  in a contradictory manner then take   according to me sir they have not the exact idea of religion uhn  uh if i suppose that religion is uh just like uh  buddhism jainism uhm hinduism uhm but actually the religion according to me it is based on uh it should be based on science  uhm   uhm  uhn  uhm according to me religion means uh the property   uhm of the thing uhm which it possesses it  uhm   uhm  yes  for example this wood possesses the molecules uh  that it will burn uhn it will burn it is soft it can be uhn it can moulded  yes  it is bended uhn it is soft  moulded  it is the religion of this uh wood yeah this wood uhn  if there is a metal then it is malleable it is ductile so what is the religion of man now then   this is the property of  then  at present uhn the religion of soul is uh the knowledge   uhn highest knowledge uhn and inspiration  uhn   uhn  uhn  and uh means soul possesses this qualities yes  the body if the body is separated from it  uhm then body possess the uh colour uhm then  fame uhm uh what are these in marathi as you say the  uhm   uhm   uhm   gandha   rakta gandha varha these are the rakta uh dharma  or the qualities of this soul   that's why people must know uhm that uh  what is the real religion of the man  uh   rakta   uh uh uh   uhm  uhn and they should not collect this shouldn't run after this  uh material progress uh hoarding haan they should not hoard  haan   haan hoard uhn uh that is the basic cause of even adding into pollution  this is uhn  pollution  haan  if they do not start uh possessing all these things then hoarding all this things uhn uh perhaps they will  understand the real nature of this religion  and they will try to gain that pure uh enjoyment  uh ha from the religion  uhn uh   uh ha   uhn uh  that is true uh that is true  if we can feel you see so that means if more and more people uhn understand understand the real nature of religion based on science science and not on superstitious superstitious uhn and that does not also mean that they should carried away by some crazy western ideas  uh   uhn   understand   science   superstitious  yes  they should go to our past our past  and uh to think on these things and try to change change  so what a real sir uh according to me uh this religion uh  do not tell us uhm does not tell us uhm  that uh we should uh kill anybody  uhm   uhm  uhm so ahimsa is the most important principle  uh  means uh of uh in case of this plant if we hurt it uhm means if we destroy it uhm  then the important uh uh element of the nature is destroyed  uhm   uhm  destroyed and the this uh what are they called advantage of uh that plant as uh are also destroyed  are  they are extinct uh like animals are  extinct plants are also getting yeah that is true  that's the haan   you should not hurt it  all this life uh like that   the other day we were we were discussing about haan somebody told us that   haan the hybridisation of rice is not possible now  haan   haan  yeah some thirty thousand uh species were there and now there are only only  eight hundred uhn eight hundred  about eight hundred natural species   ah ha ha  that means we are really depriving our own future  every individual has uh important role   yes to play in this environment  yes  and we are killing that ahn we are killing that  that is uh that is the reality   not knowing the real reason  yes that way also yes sir means uh we should remain uh free from all passion uhn  means hatred killing uhm e  extreme jealous yeah all these things  uhm   yeah  going going to the extreme of any passion any passion  we should try to uhn uh have equiliberium  uhn  equiliberium  and only to have as much as is uhn necessary  essential  uhn  essential essential that if we try to reduce our uh needs uhm then  we'll have to get this supreme satisfaction joy  uhm   joy  joy so  if people understand this religion then there will be no pollution there will be no noise pollution or sound pollution uhm  uh because of this uh more and more needs uhm uhm  and people are becoming becoming more and more greedy yes  they are facing all these material pleasure and uh  that's that's why they these are the factories  coming up and that's why these prices are also zooming up  yes yes  yes  so if we try to understand our needs uh reduce our  cough minimise our needs uhm  then we will not uh produce all these things yes that is true so then there will be no problem of pollution and all these  yes people will happily yes  so this type of an education should be given then  from the primary stage   should be given right from the primary stage yeah primary stage ah so i think maharashtra government has uhm  they have started this uh this subject   uhm   ahn they have added one topic uh one topic uh  on envi  in pollution in science book i saw ah ha ha  in science book so they had they are taking it seriously now ah seriously atleast on the subjects  in uh you see that they are  uh mean they they are when they uh came to know  uhm about it's uh adverse effect  uhm  yes  so  impending danger  uhn impending now they are uh  that's why now they are becoming aware of that  but it is all in the hands of uh our representatives  who do not know much about  ahn  much about the the dangers if the teachers and  intellectuals if they organise ahn  and uh go to the society uhn like that trying to impart  uhn  yes ahn  they went to the masses  uhm  do you think that the intellectuals go to the masses at present  uhm i do not think so  no they are worried about their own   think so ah they ahn uhn  own quest or own uh they are running after their job  running for  identity  ah they don't have their own identity  id ahn  but on the other hand i think it is they have the wrong notion of their intellect   haan i feel  haan  yes so they are not real intellectual you mean intellectual intellectuals do not feel any proud of their knowledge yes  because knowledge is so vast yes that uh uh  yes  you cannot grasp we possess only ahn  we we only possess the tip of the iceberg tip ahn yes like that like that  so don't you think it is very uh significant thing to  uh notice uhn that if we when we think of religion ahn or the ideas about religion that you talked about ahn which takes us back to uh looking at our own body ahn and nature and balance in that  ahn and then we can have a peaceful and uh pleasurable life  uhn   ahn   ahn   ahn   ahn  ahn uhm so these are the ideas which have come from indian side uhn religions from this side  but uh at present what we see is people who geographically are here ahn are not aware of these ideas  ahn  no but those who live in other countries ahn  like western countries  ahn  ahn uh who are very affluent countries affluent but they are borrowing ideas from indian religions and yes i have heard that uh some people they are also  uhn accepting this uh non violence uhm they are building up these uhm uh temples there  uhm  yes yes  and some of them have started following this path also uhm uhm so in that case they are means uh  they are  ah uhn now in fact they are following it following it  and very sincerly  i have read in the paper uhm uhm so that is the happy thing many peo many people have come to some times and they were asking about uh this religion uhn and what is the philosophy of this uh indian culture and all this  uhn  uhn i know they do ask about these things  that time we uh felt ashamed of our people uhm  and i remember here once we met uh miss martin  so many here uh  uhm from england and sheril hiper from america uhm  came to this uh backsinger memorial library uhm uhm  and like means uh means at that time i used to go  for conversational classes uhm uhm that means you you were going  you used to go for to teach  i met  no  learn  ahn learn learn english ah ha  english  ah before uh com means uh  before you join your m a  ah m a 
see yesterday i ran into smita  so uhm her friend laxshmi she was suffering from her father was suffering from asthama  so here he has been admitted in the hospital somewhere in rajarampuri  so who is the doctor  some irani irani  so i checked the reports of his blood you know all were normal  but the doctor is saying there's a pu puss formation in the lungs yeah  so i asked him i asked him what treatment does  is he going to give  so his thinking is that it can be removed only by surgery  but we can do even homeopathy for that yeah i know   homeopathy is the best treatment you know   i've even i was telling her the same thing  but then she said ki i said see the puss formation is going to take place again after the surgery uhm and asthama is such a disease that it can be completely cured by homeopathy only  uhm   disease   homeopathy  you just ad advise her then if if she wants but her father you know he he is against restrictions of eating and drinking like he wants to drink coffee all the time  he drinks at least ten cups of coffee   yeah  but that is an antidote again  yeah coffee coffee and onion raw onion   onion  that is an anitidote na  you can try again because if the performance is  it can be cured   asthama can be cured in a sense asthama and but he is not ready to listen na  uhm uhm that's why  he doesn't listen only but you can try again very stubborn person laughter  we can try again   what's wrong in trying again  i don't know they had referred to some doctor  but then he doesn't pay attention to all this na  all these things you don't drink coffee or eat raw onion etcetra only these two things and what else he has to follow  do you think you know what he thinks actually he doesn't believe in homeopathy cough there lies his problem people don't know about homeopathy yeah that's why   that's it na so i told him  ki shireen's dad was also suffering from asthama  even shireen was even saying ki  her dad was suffering from asthama and cough uh one of her uncles is a homeopath  he was a allopath before but then afterwards he studied homeopath and now he is a pure homeopath   even  there are many people that way yeah even dr shinde etcetra  so then uh like shireen's father was cured by  his uncle na   yeah  her uncle her uncle even my mummy now he is not at all suffering from asthama you know not at all yeah why don't you try to convince him  i i didn't try to convince him i tried to convince laxshmi first of all you will have to convince laxshmi yeah yeah we can even one or two words family there are  pe people you should have said ki what's the harm of trying just trying it   there's no side effects of homeopathy  anyway he's not going to get ano another disease he doesn't believe in that that small one word   one or two words  those are going to create a effect and that his asthama  which is almost i mean it's very chronic that is going to disappear   we can take him to some doctor like   who who are the renowned homeopath in kolhapur  shinde and all na   yeah  maybe they will uh convince him because that because finally what are in his we don't have any uh i mean we don't want to earn and all that we just want to cure like that yeah that's what the thing is  we can take him to a homeopath  we can ask the homeopath to make that interest in that person  because at this age if he if it is one word than a surgery   uhm  i don't suppose he will uh get again the uh health and all the things back  uhm  and now he is quite old no yeah that's what yeah at this age if is he going to have any surgery   he's almost seventy over  seven no sixty-five  sixty-five still but won't be able to reg regain all his health yeah that is also true  even my mummy is suffering was suffering from rheumatism  na she has taken rheumatism is other horrible disease yeah rheumatism and we cured by allopathy no there are some diseases you know like which can be cured by homeopathy only  she had taken the treatment  yeah only homoeopathy and the one is the is the uh rheumatism   rheumatism  rheumatism then skin diseases stones kidney stones you know i am telling you yeah only homeopathy can cure it   yeah  the stones can be passed to the urine only by homeopathic medicine but that is one problem the people don't believe in homeopathy still  but now-a-days many people are diverting to homeopathy   but the even the allopth is preferred but that is only in the urban uh cities  yeah precisely they are mbs actually mbbs no yeah  then  but giving a homeopathic treatment in the rural areas yeah these propoganda should be made na about homeopathy   let's see when we become doctors   we'll try  we'll try our level best actually right from now we should start the start i mean uh to yeah creating i mean we should as soon as we learn one word we should start giving the medicine know  we should let other people know importance of homeopathy and how it cure up the disease  even mental symptoms can be cured by homeopathy yeah yeah psycho psycho yeah   one word  because each each persons constitution is different  allopathy allopathy what they do what they do you know  like know we all are suffering from a common disease say fever  they will give the same disease uh same medicine to everyone   like  but homeopathy doesn't see that first he will know her constitution is weak your constitution is tough  so it depends na like for her i'll  give some else medicine the doctor will give you something else   no you one word   yeah  i know that is a one word  when they give preference to physical over individual constitution as well as mental constitution  we can find even uh each and every constitution we see  the crowd also we can get many yeah definitely   yeah  and we can distinguish between them  i hope but the homeopath has to have that knowledge over the material material and uh  yeah if he is wrong somewhere whole practice is going to but actually homeopathy has no side effects na  so but still so when that one is going to ha happen and we have one or two word   one or two words  but by reputation you can do it but he has to have his reputation  if the one word if he gets no yaar now even i a normal doctor  like even a mbbs doctor he takes five years yaar to settle himself in any town or a city  but he has to increase the power in that patient like today today one word sir was not saying or what if you treat one patient he will go on telling all the all the people yeah yeah and he will create a broad board of you that this is the doctor he will refer all the patient go to this doctor and all that   that's there and then you become famous   that's there  you may have the tact yaar  really tact is two words  i think mane sir has that tact you know yeah see he has got the  and pratap kulkarni  pratap kulkarni he is also very  he's an homeopath then what  i didn't know that  a few words  of course he was a student from no he was not no no  he was from our college   he's a good homeopath  yeah i didn't know yaar really  even i one or two words  but how come he used to come i knew about pratap kulkarni but i didn't know that  he's a homeopath no i didn't knew  and he used to come na during the  time of our strike and all that   yeah  that was a very bad phase of our life  horrible  horrible  strike laughter  i just want don't want to think about it i wish i would write a autobiography of myself about my medical education you know laughter uh ten year plan with two years of uh having a strike yeah and the remaining six years because i i was in the strike and a few words  really it was a horrible scene  yeah  and remaining because i didn't study laughter  i hope our colleague student don't come with us that class missed i swear   one or two words  how could we face one word my god horrible what do you think he'll come or not  one or two words  i don't think  i think he'll come he personally is not interested or uh his parents are not interested he personally is not interested his parents are interested more probably his mother is interested in sending him then what is the one or two words  because she is not instead of doing d a yeah d s m is more  better i think  yeah  no actually he just wants a degree yaar   he always one word hospital yeah   that too a few words he is already a settled doctor he needs just needs a degree he knows all the practical appliances everything  even yeah how to give an injection to give i v this that yeah he sits in in his father's hospital not a clinic  it's a hospital only yeah i think even she must be well let him not come of course let him do d s m and he's going to waste all his certificates  yeah he's not going to get back his certificates and money na  thats right that is okay instead of wasting thirty thousand and again fifty thousand in one word  yeah now he'll have to give donation in d h m s college also  he's not going to get it just plainly like that  you know they are asking fifty thousand   he's getting in free seat no no somebody told me what about archana  she's taken her archana she's  taken some short course computer and  archana  one year course she can complete her this thing graduation no but uh about her l c and certificate   that will also take take a long time  and i think she will take out duplicate  duplicate from where bombay bombay we get then how they got their mark list and leaving certificate in duplicate that is the main thing when you get a mark list you get a leaving certificate that's what i enquired you know  but again that caste certificate problem has arrived na she will do when she have when she will have to take a passport for this thing backward one word certificate  certificates na  but if you need a for the passport you need one word  duplicate do  no i don't suppose but you need always orignals if she has a passport it's well and good otherwise great problem yaar   yeah  that she has i think therfore she has to she will have to take help from her father-in-law  yeah that way her father-in-law is quite  but it's better ki have an original i know now it's impossible

uh let's see if i could talk to her about it yeah that would be better you know 
yes  so  just two of you you tell me what you want to talk about  laughter    i  can we talk something about the situation in these days    yeah  actually you say something what do you think like uhm actually why the real fighting is going on between naga and kuki i don't know the reason yet  you don't know ? uhm  they are different uh people different people they have different reas uh versions about it uhm  the way i know it is that uh now these kukis are nomads uhm  and they don't have a particular territorial area uhm and what's happened is in in the manipur area of  uh these naga people the tamkuls the kuki people have come and settled  and now they they are in encroaching in the into the naga areas  uhm and so the nagas are defend defending their place    so we'll deal  no we've started   started    you started uh  yeah  so anyway you can just sit and uh laughter    you can do this  so like i've just i don't know what happened between uh i mean in our place the situation right now so i am asking her to ex one word explain i was trying to explain atleast my idea of what i feel is going on   that's one reason okay like uh this kukis are encroaching on the tamkul land so the tamkuls are retaliating  that that is defending themselves  then another one is that uhm this anasian people were taking taxes from the kukis  oh  and now the kukis they refused to uh pay any more  and so they are moving against them  uhm  like that    for that only  yeah mainly and that is how it all started because they said that we won't pay anymore   but this tamkul no they are naga  they are nagas     that's what  now what's happened is that the the nagas before  there was no nagaland  they said it's only in the last uh nineteen sixty-two or three that the nagaland was formed  so each naga group just lived in in their within each naga group has got the particular territorial area and we live like that so like the aungs we have our place the  angami's have their place like that tamkuls they have their place uhm  and when statehood was given to us then uh they did not uh put all the places together but uh like much of the naga tribes are now in manipur there are some tribes in arunachal pradesh  some in assam like that  and so now one of the demands of this uh the nationalists groups that are coming up is that the greater nagaland  greater nagaland means all this should be integrated uhm  and when it happens then large a large chunk of uh  manipur also will come to nagaland oh  and this was passed in the assembly uh two months back  that nagaland government also will try to do this and manipur government has started noise so uh tamkuls uh the mar mar  marams announce like that    two words  yeah they are nagas in manipur  this was like the fighting is going on in for a month ha  they used to means people used to think that it's  happening in nagaland because always naga and kuki naga and kuki yeah that's true  uh then actually the fighting is going on in imphal over yeah    it's not in in nagaland  nagaland it is   it means between this kuki and nagas  yeah so far the clashes are going on means this killing and all are going on only in that place not  yeah  in the hill areas of manipur     in that respect nagaland  it doesn't affect nagaland much yeah    ah ah so it affects only manipur   right for example  when they say naga means we think that some angami   aau or some people of eastern parts or uh one word   so far no one is in the one word only tamkul   like two words   that's why i was wondering why uhm but  the after effect of course in nagaland is where many of the kukis in nagaland are being uh quite a number have been actually killed oh  so one tamkul one shot one director uhm  and then uh one kuki i a s officer was also shot uhm  and uh just before i came and after i came also two kukis were shot like that  but it's a spill over from manipur    kukis they stay in nagaland itself  they are spread all over the place     all over it  so they are recognised as one of the tribes in uh nagaland but they don't have a specific area in nagaland means they don't have a motherland  they don't have a particualr area like we do  so they are there in manipur they are there in uh mizoram  and uh in nagaland and also in assam half long area  laughter  any more questions  so   one word what do you want to talk about now  laughs  how is your further politics ? laughter    i know nothing about politics i never bother to  recording broken  tibya now uh in the final year isn't this ?   yeah  so what are you doing ? what are your subjects that you are doing ?   i am doing my civil  uhm ha   engineering  most like it's mostly concerned about structures   structures what structures ?   like dams and all  uhm    dams and canals and all those things  uhm  so  so when you go back to uh shillong do you think you'll  be able to apply your these ideas ?   yeah actually my plan is to work in public health engineering department  uhm uhm    mostly concerned for dams and all  uhm    so and there is one branch in uh mafna that's  about one hour from shillong  uhm uhm    and that's a very good one  uhm    maybe if possible i will try to work there now they are constructing a new dam out there  where in mafna ?   yeah mafna  uh ha     it's a beautiful place  uh    so that's my uh let's see that will work or no laughter  you think you will easily get a job there in that department ?   not that difficult to get a job there  uhm   p w d is very difficult uhm but not p h e ?  uhm  why ?   because uh p w d most of the students no they  usually go for traffic engineering  uhm so   but these days but that's not my aim i don't like traffic engineering i think i mean highway engineering  uhm why is that many they just go for traffic ?    it's quite easy you know laughter  because of that laughter  yeah     that's it maybe i don't know why  uhm    but in p w d now it's fully packed  uhm    so it's very difficult to get a job  uhm    but p h e there is a chance  so thats what you are plannigg to do or any other things you are planning to do ? now you are doing project no ? so what under what topic you are doing that project ?   environmental impact on uh all the water resources project no how it affects the structures and all  how do environment affects structure  you have started working on laughter    no yeah laughter  no yeah     two words laughter  you told me this one a few words it's  about your one word studies laughter  i think she will have exhaust  keri can tell us what she has been doing ? laughter    ha yes keri can tell us laughter  okay then after getting your job like what is what is your next plan ?   after getting my job ?  yeah laughter  she will enjoy   no  she will enjoy   how do you know that ?  make out laughter  so you are so sure of getting job    i am not so sure yaar  but you can try laughs    but i don't mind if i don't get a job   laughter   you'll two words more like that   yeah  okay then what about keri ? i really don't have any idea about my job laughs  but as far as my subject is concerned i think i prefer working outside outside our place and ah ha   yeah but that's  outside uh so what one word   now in our place there is no electronics department now uhm so like i will try to pick up all those uh competitive exams no and all i will keep on trying laughter  till you get one laughter  till i have one job from outside laughter  so what are the different uh things that you are trying for right now ? right now like i am not trying for any exam like uhm uhm after finishing my this b e only i will prepare for those exams uhm  so you have any idea what you are going to uh apply for ? see like i may write gates also  uhm uhm and i don't know whether g r e is there in guwahati or not  perhaps not sure  if it is there i will try the one word  or    i think it is there  so you will try from guwahati mainly ? yeah means i don't want to come back here to just like uh  i will just get those materials and i'll prepare for more and i like guwahati laughs  yeah guwahati atleast is quite close enough  but i am not sure whether it's guwahati is the centre or not uhm  i don't think yaar    calcutta  but gates is there uh  gates is there    yeah gates gates is there  both    uhm  but you better try g r e also  means ? uh like if i prepare for gates it's only same g r e both are uh like the syllabus and all   in fact gates is tougher than g r e  yeah    so  oh gates is tougher   uhm  then what about uh plans to go abroad toefl and all these  laughs  hey which two words was doing yeah it was not so    but if you are writing gre of course   yeah gre also is same but uhm  mainly i think i'll prefer gates only  uhm  uhm so you are not interested in going abroad ?  laughter  of course it's intrested but it's a bit  difficult for me laughter    for me going abroad uh i think   it's your dream   going for enjoyment only not for studies laughter  not for studies or a job uhn   yes i think rose and all   it's rose why why actually rose laughter   i must be a fan of one word  but of course if uh if i get a job in our place i prefer that one what i feel is that i don't think uhm because there is no department also    but of course   one word i will try in my place in naga in nagaland yeah so will you take uh which one would you prefer uh  lower job in nagaland or a higer paid job outside of nagaland  uhm it depends but suppose like uhn if the salary is at at around uh three thousand in nagaland uhm uhm and may be there is ten thousand in outside uhm i will prefer the three thousand in nagaland    yeah laughter  yeah because  yeah that's laughter  uhm but as far as this status is concerned  uhm uhm of course high one also even though it's outside doesn't matter much laughter   uhm uhm  but first preference is on nagaland uhn laughter    yeah that's right  uhm    as if you have laughter  i think economic so that i can always try laughter   you must always have hope na  yeah they did it's not that we are going to be  one word just hoping and dreaming know laughter  yeah nothing nothing wrong with that  what about the empty zones say the upsc exams neither of you are interested   no  not very much also but    i am not interested in any exam laughter  who knows who might get again we might change change our mind also to laughter    yeah may be after going home  after going home yeah you might get inspired   but right now i don't have any plans  uhm i knew you seem to be quite sure what you want to do both of you laughter  no this is just laughter recording broken  laughter okay uhm did you have a very unique kind of system isn't that among the khasis where marriage is concerned   uhm  so can you uh tell us something about uh how  what kind of uh what rituals or formalities that you observe and all this    you mean after marriage ?  no before uh uh how they get married laughter  that way you can just tell us how they get married  laughter     oh how to get married   ho how you get married ? after marriage i don't think you need to do laughter excellent one laughter    uh actually we don't believe in uh arranged marriage and all those things  uhm uhm   so it's always always love marriage in our place  and then uh  you have the matriarchal system na like where do your the woman is the more dominant in the family 
hi tina hi jenny how was your journey tina from harihar oh god i can't tell you it was terrible you know what happened  the students from the ranebennur college you know  they're having problem for

came to pick you up at the but stop no i came home in the rickshaw  and in hubli my god so many guys got into the bus and you should have seen that they were almost falling on you all over the place and then there was one fellow who was uh and there was this one fellow who was sitting next to me and then you know he was pushing the bag so that he could get closer to me laughter and then i pushed

sea level  slightly yeah slightly above sea level  i lost a friend of mine in this river  see this river when you're going to panhala you cross the  pool yes there just right   yes  now these people it's a big you know a big thing like you jump off the bridge there yeah  and swim all the way across here uh ha  and they get off here  all all the people  yes all the people and you know what the you know the movement is towards this side na so you just have to float across yeah  when you come towards this corner just going to get off the river like you know  now this guy very good body builder

top you can not one word  but you get into the water na it really pulls you across   in hindi   in hindi  see the water how deep it has gone that's one or two words this is the regular scene when there are good rains  na water reaches right upto that corner 
she also what is it i think both of you laughter  pankaj in the north uh what kind of a system of study do you have  do you have state level of studies  yeah  like in maharashtra we've got uh yeah yeah  more important we all have three levels  yeah yeah  yes state cbse and ipsc level  ipsc  yes and which you find the best  i think uh easy board is state level one word  why  why  yeah uh because the board uhn  you you've been a cbse and ipsc ah uh which is much competency you gain i think you mean it's very tough students can't follow it  it's very tough  no no students can follow   it's very tough  yeah it's tough very tough for their age   it's tough one or two words   but don't you think that uh the students are uh trained in a better way by these two cbse and ipsc systems  you have studied through speak one by one you have studied through  state level  state level state yes level studies   yes  but uh i mean prefer the state level of studies yeah  but now that have you taught in any ipsc school or a cbse school  you said you were teaching right somewhere yeah  which school was that  no no it's not computer  no but you have taught na   taught in some school right oh yeah  it is uh mariam convent school   mariam convent school  yeah where is it  uh it's near by my house  no i mean with lucknow yeah in lucknow   it's an english medium school  yeah  english medium yeah and you taught   yeah  yeah i taught uh what did you teach there  what subject  mostly if uh that science physical and mathematics  physical  uh that means you taught one subject yeah in which level   yeah  uh right start from uh eighth standard eighth to the tenth yeah did you taught these two subjects yes and what uh state or ipsc or cbse what level was it  school  no that school belonged to cbse ipsc or state level school  i did cbse  cbse  yeah and what subject were you teaching out of the science subjects  not nothing  ah you said this out of science uh out of science and mathematics i teach nothing  but you said just now cbse level under which which level did you like cbse level or uh the state level  state level you like the state level yeah why not the cbse  yeah  uh  why not the cbse level see whatever i want i can get in state level but in cbse level there is limited course  limited course limited yeah only a limit is there  no but in the cbse or the ipsc uh the  curriculam of studies is higher than the state level always  no   and the course also is uh wide enough  not limited just think about it whole thing  okay now uh daisy what level have you studied in  state level state level that is the maharashtra board then now you are teaching in a ipsc level but which do you prefer i prefer ipsc  ipsc level yeah why  yeah  because like whichever subject you study you get enough  study about that subject  suppose after your you leave your tenth standard and you go outside somebody  you select some uh different side like science history uh  arts commerce  but in uh when you are in ipsc school you get enough knowledge about history enough knowledge about geography  so even though you don't study after you leave the tenth standard leave these subject you know something about this yeah you can when you study in ssc you get a very limited knowledge about that while in the ipsc history you can get more about the monuments  or more about whatever the caves or see you see  whatever history is about  you see  uh i don't uh i don't agree with it we do you not know about your state level book our state level books are like see  no because because  yeah i saw that uh every state level every state has their own sort of uh   yeah i saw that uh that uh in maharashtra uhn  whatever be the admission level i don't know uhm  but i find that education level is low   uhm  where  here   in maharashtra   in maharashtra  in maharashtra then that is what we are saying   that's what we both are saying trying to say so we prefer the ipsc more than the see  state level  see  you must one word  here you can say that ipsc is uh better ipsc is better  yeah you can say  but uh there u p for state level in u p   uhm compe   yeah   u p   uhm  state level is higher yeah state level is higher yeah and we see these competitive examinations also that like the they have the students from the up level are most shine out shine out one word  may be it is because that uh syllabus is much better oriented as but uh when we maharashtra students when we go outside we have a great difficulty in uh i mean scoring through these competitive exams  we always have to study little extra whereas you all you can get through straigh uh straight away  but uh what we have both of us i and priya but still i found out that after studying the state level i can teach much better in the ipsc level because i find it is a much better system  it's a very uh well explained system for the students level yeah now in the maharashtra system maharashtra state board  so what is happened is most of the maharashtrians are rural background  uh students and the education board has tried to uh bring it down to the level of rural level   a few words yeah and that way to put it in extremely simple language but i find that there is a total confusion in the way the subjects are explained out  there is no indepth knowledge given about any particular subject and like if the person is from a higher background like  we find that that knowledge is not too less to less for him for him to proceed for higher higher studies  so both of us daisy and me have found out that this system is a much better systen as compared to our maharashtra board level yeah maharashtra but pankaj you yeah maharashtra board pankaj you have uh some different views  can you tell like any taking  okay daisy uh like uh about your subject chemistry   uhm  can you compare it with your uh i mean the state level what  you've studied and now you are teaching in the ipsc level  what way you found it different   uhm  now let's see if it is chemistry and ssc level see like the state level you will have now say if you want to study some industrial procedure you'll not have the detail study  uhm see it'll just be an outline study uhm  uh while in chemis uh in the ipsc type of you'll have the whole process  how much time it causes you  what are the reactions you what are the precautions to be taken you have more point ipsc in the ipsc type than in the ssc type   uhm   uhm   ipsc   yeah  isn't than whatever you study say uh you're in the ninth standard yeah say you know more you have more knowledge in ipsc school than in the  yeah  ssc school ssc school like they are one more uh behind the state level one step behind uh one step behind than the ipsc school yes  do you find that uh i mean uh they say the maharashtra government says that the books have purposely been brought down to this level because the student then understand english  now if you make the system so much easy for the students that they will in in a way that they are hampering their own uh knowledge as well as not getting down to the english knowledge  don't you think it is so yeah it is  that we don't even get enough knowledge yeah of course that's what i've said no see if it is a student who is more brilliant he will find the study more boring and the   how do you find the level of students  who come to the ipsc school ipsc schools are not that good you see  i mean uh they are also like all the other normal schools  but when they study that course they will prove more brilliant than those state level that is how  that is because they get more knowledge  yeah right  though they don't understand they'll make an effort because they have to study they have to study while those at uh state level students they are satisfied with whatever they get  and what they do is they only do the work of mostly by hearting  right uhn they don't uh like they don't want  to understand the topic   understand  like if they are now the exams if you consider they have only the questions which are from behind the book yeah right well our ipsc schools have all through out the topic yes they cover up the whole topic   cover up the whole topic  and understanding is expected in the school   yeah understanding is expected also the practical is very nicely like we start right from the eighth yes standard for the practical knowledge and all so that helps the students  yeah yeah   yes  yeah  and also it is seen that uh our students of the ipsc level when you go out to state board junior college level yeah they always shine out better  shine out  yeah and they get better percentage and uh they have uh a better application   whatever i saw that uh whatever i saw the education level here in english medilum no yeah  the same education level is in uh up board in hindi medium in hindi so you're talking about yeah in the state level  and there ipsc and cbse is there for there  no you see this ipsc is equivalent to  your state level in study  you see   your state level  not more state level but it is less it is less  but i find that children here that uh students  ha   ha  these are like them like state level   accha are you saying your state level students are as equivalent to the ipsc ip  students here  your state level students   ip  no that uh yeah  do you say that uh because you all are studying in the hindi medium it is the better way the student can understand   can understand because if it is in your home language no they can grasp it more better  the eng after all english is some  and even grasp  no why not in uh maharashtra maharashtra why not in the state level maharashtra   some foreign language  no we don't study in marathi in marathi marathi medium we don't study we won't be able to give you a better idea no no no  why not some person have uh studied in uh marathi also  yes  uhn yes they also can teach in marathi also  yes   yes   yes  uhm yes  no what i'm saying is  see the matter that is given out to the students uhm  whether you are studying it in marathi whether you are studying it in english is extremely less as compared to the ipsc level students  you know the course is more wider it's not limited in ipsc and cbse and it is also observed that ipsc students or cbse student shine much better in competitive exams  i and it is also observed that up board students  do shine in that exams  do shine

laughter and how is your aunty who got married uh in the summer uh okay where is she staying  mangalore  mangalore only yeah  is she doing something there  no just a house-wife   house-wife so that's it  aunty you do craft  no not craft as such i do stitching work all these you did it no these things have been done my father-in-law oh  he is a great artist  you don't know anything about craft aunty  craft i don't know much  because i wanted to learn something uh which you know  i know stitching i do uhm stitching of clothes  so if you are interested in that i can teach you basic what's the basic in stitching aunty first what should we learn like anything  you should start from the smaller clothes  uhm that's the easiest way  and the clothes in which uh there is not much of cutting  because cutting the things is uh very important  if you cut them nicely naturally the stitching will be nice the dress will come out nicely  so you should choose the clothes which are uh easy to cut so first you should choose the smaller one like dress of a baby which is easier  and then only you can graduate to uh complicated dresses  and i think that uh saree blouse is  most complicated thing  oh laughter  and uh how do you pass time like only stitching aunty you don't have any other uh no passtime like  no  household work is there stitching is there   hobby what's your hobby  stitching and teaching laughter  i have heard that you have that stitching with the like  like electric current you use current for stitching yeah  how how is it   yeah   there's a small motor  uh it is attatched to the machine itself  and with the help of a belt that uh wheel of the machine the balance wheel of the machine that rotates with the help of that motor so whenever the current is there we can use this  but in bangalore it's just   you can take it out when there is no current and you can use it like that yeah yeah yeah   it's easy to take out  just that belt has to be removed  and when that belt is removed you can just put on that uh other belt which is used for the paddle style running  like for ordinary machine only you have attatched the mo  motor  yes oh it's ordinary machine earlier it i was using it on pedestal only  but uh after three four years i attached the motor to it so i can use it both way  there is no difficulty in using it  and whenever current is there it becomes very easy  oh  yeah because  using it on the pedestal puts a lot of pressure on uh feet  do you want to learn stitching  yes but i am very interested but uh how yeah at present you won't be able at present i won't be able but next year after my exams i think i want to learn stitching laughter so i was  and then craft uh  yeah craft i was taught many things in school  but now we don't have yeah sapna my younger sister she is interested and she does all things  but uh in t v i can't adjust with them and i can learn things from because i wanted uhm  no i want to do it with them like they are too fast   oh i can't keep it everything in my   oh   yeah they keep everything half ready  yeah and then only they start showing it  yeah   and then  i want it uh actions like yeah face to face  yeah  but then if atleast you can take down the things on paper and uhm then try doing them yeah i can but i am used to teach like like i was taught in the school  yeah doing the things of handcraft is really a nice thing you know you can pass time time  you're doing something creative  creativity is also important  then what other things you want to do   that's all not not much  but craft was my main and i liked it so much because in the school one word  are you intersted in drawing also no laughter  then who has put on this mehndi  this my younger sister yesterday oh for the festival no simply we had  i was uh arranging my cupboard things and all and i found a packet of mehndi over there and so   uhm uhm  its nice  did she learn it somewhere or no just  on her own she's doing yeah on her on own  yesterday only the first time she  yeah its a nice i was very scared to give it like to tell her to do because if it won't look nice if it if she does wrong  and then uh did you put it on in the evening  yeah about at i seven-thirty eight  uhm  and i removed it in the morning   haan that's why the colour has come out so nicely yeah or else that was an old stock one can it was usually the old stock doesn't give the proper colour yeah  if you are interested in mehndi my   yeah one of my friends mehndi class  yeah one of my friends is expert in putting on mehndi   yeah   mehndi class  yeah i want to learn to put it to others  yeah she is expert and she stays nearby only  so you can go and learn it from her yeah i am interested to put but i don't like it putting myself sister wanted to try it on my hand and so she  did she try it on her own hand also no  that friend of mine she can put on her own hand she can put by left hand also on her right hand oh like uh no she can't do like that  and for putting on other people's hand she is expert  she is rajasthani only uhm yeah in jaipur also she has got many prizes for that  so here we can call her uh master or something like that

gujrati also most of them they wear like uh yeah 
now we have to pull each others' leg  yeah you pull my right leg then i will pull your left leg   okay or you will do the other way   okay  no problem  just let it go okay hey man let it go laughter  hey not bad what is it  where it will go  let it go where it goes anywhere uh anywhere because we are now in whose who so that  tell me something more about that how you happened to go inside  well it was a shock for me  haan haan  uhm actually i was not expecting anything  one fine day one letter came  you know joshi this our uh this man yaar   diwakar's husband  diwakar  he was in b e l no  oh our joshi okay i i got got him okay you got him  haan   one word joshi  he was that uh there at my house that day  i suddenly got that letter from one editor  haan haan  and he told we have selected you for publishing uh  who's who in asia and some so called   but how how come he got your address then  then i started looking at it it looked as if it had come through the alumini association of i a s c uhm uhm  because it was uh styled in the same way that is he passed  b e in so and so year from this college and m e also in this college and uhm uhm working in so and so company  so his name also got included into that no he is not from i a s c  then i checked up with two or three my friends who were in i a s c  haan  their names also had appeared  so this was actually whatever uh thought you you were proud of yourself that your name is in who's who but you don't feel all those bugger's names also laughter not included in that not so but it the initially pressure was very high but now it is not so whether it's it's not that uh something is of great achievement many people who have done who had excelled in education also there who had not excelled in education but some other field also are there i see  like that it is  it is some achievement who has done  man of achievement in asia or something like that they are probably no that's what i was surprised because laughter  i don't know what actually you had done  well really you have to enlighten me on that  that uh okay you have spoken for me also laughter  uh well uhm how have you told this thing to your boss then he don't know it's not worth because the bosses and other people in the factory uhm they really are hell bent upon pulling you down   accha  in the sense now well i have been for one word  because to avoid those fellas but uh they are saying that we will not complete uhm myself and two words simply getting troubled  uhm  why why why they are not allowing you to give enough you are not allowed to do no studies or things like that or collect some data  no the thing is atleast upto this january i need free time to study and uh prepare for my comprehensive exam uhm uhm  and these buggers wants their own personal jobs to be done  which are most silliest in nature  and after getting some twenty years of experience uhm  you really feel that technical knowledge is instead of increasing getting reducing  uhm  uhm uhm  you cannot go on enlightening them on technical things simply because you will be getting in trouble  i see  now if you enlighten them they will come to know and tomorrow they will pull your leg okay  but i didn't get personal jobs means which kind of jobs  uh well some small things something to be done like  uh one small simple problem will be given to my immediate work uhm uhm   it's supposed to be done by that fellow uhm uhm  he simply doesn't want to do it but want to show that he has done it  uhm uhm so he will transfer it to me uhm  whereas there is some other related job to my phd work my research work like some vibrations and other things if i want to go and attend it he says why you have to go  let the requisition come from the department let the people call you with a uh kumkum tilaka and haldi kunku  and akshata then only you go how can i go   okay like that you have got now enough uh marathi words for saying this yes laughter  okay uhm no but uh   uhm  no it's happening recently very late uhm  within this in one month he only has suggested your name name for this no chance uhm no chance that fellow he won't do cannot suggest anything  uhn  okay  now he himself feel that he should have got the chance to go for phd or something like that something no no nothing like that  no no  he cannot go   you know that  you know pucca sure that he cannot uh  yeah he cannot go yes okay so now tell me something about yourself your achievement and  so on and so forth  look it is the same thing as you  uh only difference is that uh i've i've not also achieved anything  but uh lack of achievement uh uh doesn't mean that now  i'll who's who i'm still not there maybe i'm trying to underachieve something may be  laughter hoping that some day my day also will come in a way sure right now the it's something uh doing lot of hard work and like that some project missions are there and uh   with international company then see what what has happened  working hard  i don't know  specially today this software companies are having lot of  work actually yeah  recently i you see they are growing growing too fast that is that is idea so uh basically you are always under staff yeah  when you are working  and uh responsibilities are more and the things are going too fast so i think one of the major problem in software world over is that uh we one word basically we always underestimate the work  that is the problem known all over the world always we underestimate our work by some three hundred percent  laughter okay so that is that is our true problem  yeah   okay  and what about this uh what is called as uh sending programmers to usa as a cheap labourer body surfing yeah body surfing i've read that in computer magazine  haan haan  september issue they have send it  that uh simply one fellow with a phone will hire some guys   exactly and send there for one year  exactly  yeah  he will earn lot of money  that's true there are some three hundred four hundred person margins in that uhn they tell you which uh this thing but the person who is going there that is also happy because normally once he goes he just quits that company and joins another company there but that uh h h one visa or something has change no b one visa is change to h one visa something  what has happen  yeah but still still uh what has happened actually it is not exactly the cheap labour i will say that is also one portion like  uh cheap labour but the one another uh major aspect is that like think about a situation like uh would you like to go today as a well qualified person and go and work in shimoga or some place called shirshi would you like to work like that they will not serve you won't like  you like to work in indutrial base like bombay pune  bangalore delhi no no not definitely with the bombay calcutta okay prefer anywhere uh place in let's say   bangalore pune think like that place you won't like to go a small place  bangalore or pune  that is what exactly happens most of the jobs some of the jobs are in villages in us and people there don't want to go there  okay but a person going from us uh going from india to usa he feels that okay america  america  so he is ready to live anywhere and and another thing one dollar equal to thirty-five  rupees  yeah that is one of the thing so that is basically things which keeps you it's so and there also when you are in the small place there of saving potential is more and something but one one thing i everybody is happy that that is the idea basically  the person who goes there will be happy  the person who sent him will be happy the company who has hired him happy  so everybody is so far so far it has been very well situatiion so it is a goody goody happy happy situation yeah may be it may not be there after two three years when he was there then he feels that there are no chances of growth he cannot go to big companies maybe when he realise when he has enough money then he will realise that that there are no much chance of growth later on  then then he'll try to no but the thing is they want they they they try to move to better but they never come back to india  no some people are there some people have come back i know lot of people in our country uh in my company actually have come back   because that is  uh ha which company  so total eight minutes are over we need to continue  na  uhm we need to continue na  yeah we must continue other ten minutes laughter  this exercise we have to be pulled on cough  today what happened no uhm actually in the morning uh we didn't get our paper  uhm  uhm so you bought it uh no no we ourself enquired why i couldn't get the paper so i went to that paperwalah uh  and that i ask i asked him what has happened what has happened since today next three days that paper-boy who drops the paper na he's on vacation  on leave uh and his manager or his uh that boss or whoever is the owner he doesn't know my house  so he knew that uh he can drop the paper but he don't know where to contact me or anything so i went there and now then he said okay do you want todays paper so he gave me  uh   uh  so that means you got up in the morning and went there as you said  no laughter yeah yeah yeah  so just now it's ten o'clock at nine and we just now got up i see  we came came to you for breakfast  breakfast okay  but unfortunately we have finished our dinner  so there is a jet leg between two of us laughter  by the way that i talked told you about mahen satkarsh you remember yeah what has happened to him  uh he one of his friend it seems had some vacancy for temporarily in the sense he said he can manage for few days and stay with him haan till he gets the place there  what has one word happened is  haan  he has talked to one of uh persons from my company or no uh i don't know i passed on the message okay what happened was his company used to start at eight thirty in the morning uhm uhm  he was under the impression it starts at nine  haan  so one day he was going through the one word  casually and he saw the office time is at eight thirty to six or so uhm  so he has to start approximately two hours early  oh from here to majestic majestic to that golden enclove he has to start at six six thirty uhn and that was not possible then what he decided was to stay with some friends there uhm  and again that the body shopping is there  he has been told not to go in for a big house not to go in for a yeah i know lot people are going any way vehicle and passport and all those  ha so he has to be on a temporary basis for sometime  then go there work for one year uhm find out some job but i i doubt whether the visa will be given properly or not   uhm  what happens if the man going there and some working in some tata tisl or something uhm 
hi chitra  fine thank you  when did you come from amrawati on sixth of november  how are you liking kolhapur  now i am adjusting to it  why you didn't like it initially no  no  why you don't like the uhm climate here  climate is okay the people are not uh  people are very nice  yeah  climate is not nice because we are accustomed to the coastal climate  so we don't like this dry climate  i don't feel familiar at all  i like straight and perspiration then only i feel at home otherwise no laughter  but uh i like uh the climate here   it's nice and cool  and uh though the people are slightly uh from the  bhosle family or the shahu family and they are royal people all are royal people   one or two words  they talk and uh behave that way uhn  yeah courteous behaviour having the arrogance of the aristocrat aren't they soft spoken like the nagpur people  no full of courtesy  no  in nagpur uh nagpur uh population is very much affected by  the non-marathi i think yeah  that is why uhm their behaviour has slightly undergone some change uh changed means that nazakat of hindi language that's in your that way of speaking  and uh specially the business community is affected by punjabis and sindhis  accha  so they are naturally more polite  but here the business community is dominated by either brahmins or perhaps marathas local kolhapuris local kolhapuri  so they are very arrogront in their uh one word  only tone sort of arrogance but inwardly they are  very uhm no we have had bad uh is it so experience  haan very bad experience  they are very i mean uh to make friends they take a lot of time i don't know why yeah are they so choosy  haan laughter  no even an ordinary uh rickshawallah or a shopkeeper  accha  will uh won't talk to you in a very polite manner like he is not bothered whether his product is sold or not  he is more bothered that if he like you want to bargain he says just keep it down and get lost laughter   tells you  and bargaining on our side is very normal sort of a thing yeah yeah these days  yeah yeah  every where in the cities bargaining will go on  so also our hostel uh staff who are working including the warden the bai  she breaks over very sweeper everybody are horribly arrogant  they just want to do what is their alloted job   according to the rule alloted work that's all  might be for years together they have been doing the same job fed up with this steoro type of that job earning from  but uh in our area people are ready to earn a extra buck   accha  here even if you are ready to pay them they will not uh maybe they have a lot of self-respecting personality yeah and ego is   egoism is there at a very high rate   and there is too much awareness yeah  too much awareness about their working hours  haan  their right time is over okay no work  in uh nagpur and one fine thing we found in kolhapur is that people are i think so not too much addicted you see drinks or paan  or something of that sort yeah these two things are common in my town  because that is very less  in our side you see vidarbha region  paan do you say about paan  ah yeah vidarbha side we see less paan  shops here anywhere addicted and all drunkards and all  yeah the spots of uh  that means many paan shops are there in  one word  you see in amrawati you will find people lying you know   drunk heavily drunked drunk lot and lots of people know specially those rickshaw puller i mean lower strata public  is it so i had totally different ideas about amravati  yeah  i mean from the lower strata  ekka we call that sort of rickshaw  haan no cycle rickshaw   cycle rickshaw  cycle rickshaw and all  so all of them are heavily drunk   cycle rickshaws are there  that population is the largest in working even the auto people  one word cycle rickshaw even the auto pe  don't you think it's inhuman rather no no it's the cheapest form of transports still and the buses are very few even these auto rickshaw wallah people are all drunk mostly  and they it's very terrifying here that way it's quite safe till you get down you don't have any guarantee   ah here it's very secure they are arrogant they are all you see  no safe driving you know no good mannered also or rather we can say character wise also having a very clean spotless character maybe that may be the influence of tarabai and most of the rickshaw persons they are graduate  haan  just now i came know he was b com person  haan  so now-a-days they don't get job and instead of  hunting the job they prefer that  maybe  that may be the reason one of the reasons these two things are really good in them alcoholism is less paan eating is less and honesty is there   still there   compartively in our area paan  eating is uh  still less  yeah still less  ha ha here i think that uh paan eating is more no no so that compared to your region  no no  no there are few paan and all they don't very less very less i feel see otherwise kolhapur and paan  closely associated there even our college students you know they take that  tambaku  is it so oh  that's it so they are your gurus laughter  and here and smoking is also very great among the students there in vidarbha region  and here we don't find the students smoking this smoking and all   now americans and westerners they know the evils of smoking as here they pick it up as a style you know ha only statuatory warning is there but it's  a sign of manhood for them actually smoking   but i think that that also gone for picking up on style nothing else reduced now because it is this tv influence in every thing yeah yeah yeah but here it is becoming lesser  that's what i feel and we know actually this no ha but some people you know they read the statutory warning laugh and they start smoking uhm start smoking and that's true once you get into a habit nothing can stop you not even alcohol as your blood turns alcoholic and then you will get addict to cigarette smoking  maybe to keep the company these students force na  the friends yeah and in order to you can't oppose when you are in minority and they are in majority you can't oppose otherwise they'll laugh at me that is why uhn it happens sometimes that fear of public opinion compulsory to take otherwise you feel rather afraid to stay down and shout of  one word in their company they will laugh at you it happens you know someone is uh rather behaving decently then other people they laugh at them and he feels very guilty about them yeah   it's the style of one word if you see a gentleman like that way to smoke  and i'm really impressed with this university and its uh maintenance   maintenace  yeah and especially   especially these you know library is very good   these department people i like so much you know no our director is a very nice person i have never come across yeah yeah yeah such a nice person occupying such a high post  very friendly and we are not afraid also to   soft spoken gentle and  he is a scholarly person but he  ha ha have a an informal talk with him  he's not a barrier between ha no we are one word  very great person and grand person and uh  then he will he will be remaining in our memory for ever yeah yeah it is true in nagpur university   one or two words in his place but still  he has nothing he is a very unassuming type of  unassuming yeah really i wanted to use the same word and uh  very few persons are like that  but in our university we can almost feel the  levels of corruption which you can't feel here  feel that  very high level everywhere it is no here here you see there is less corrupt you can't bribe them you see it is there or it's not there we are not going to judge but actually we don't see these no no we saw them bribing those ladies you know to sweep and all  they were not ready to sweep there is no it doesn't come in our duty  so it's not easy to bribe them  they have that self-decency or self-honesty as shubha said  they have maintained it  or may be that royal blood still frozen their vein in our university no one bothers to do anything yeah you just give them anything  now it more dominates on the class one  ours is also worst it is  they won't accept and they won't move no but if there if you give any extra money anything can be done anything can be done but here it is the other way round even take marklist one word laughter at twelfth standarad level board amarawati board is hazard of thinking yeah  so we should thank  dr shastri and professor karande and now we should conclude for what he has  when when is you paper reading  when is your paper reading i don't know it was actually on twenty-sixth but uh jahagirdar said put anywhere now  you got chances no  any where yeah so you have to be prepared anyday yeah yeah i'am already prepared with my casette on  i am going to show it through the cassette   well how did you  how did you shoot the cassette like with who was the cameraman  yeah ganesh one word he is a professional and  he's my cameraman and he is a student of shrikant madhushri from j j school of arts and he has got his own studio in ratnagiri  and he is our friend so straightway we can say  ganesh company and we can just drop it but how did you get this idea that uh you should make a video and actually in the class you know i make free use of  cassettes for my kids  so we show them one  but this was for the first time otherwise that shooting job my husband used to do for me or ganesh but uh sometimes i felt i should learn atleast samething of it i cannot handle the camera so video camera so confidently  but i am comparatively good at outdoors  indoors and closeups i had to take help of my husband and ganesh but then editing commentary writing dubbing then introducing the third scene of santoor everything i have done only ganesh was there he used to give me occasional instructions like that  and camera handling actually outdoor landscaping that landscape shot i have taken and actually the close ups and some parts of your architectural shots of that building ganesh took my husband took and close ups of the faces my husband and ganesh took but uh uhm like how did you uhm how do you use your video for uh teaching every day teaching everyday teaching means not in the class  not in the class in the class uh there is questions and answers session after the lecture group discussion class uh your which classes do you teach  uh right from f y b a to m a two what is f y b a   f y is the first year  first year  uhn b a to m a part one and m a part two  so after my working hours you know i am having about free periods even my kids they have got free periods they come to me sometimes  i'll take them to we have got such sound proof ac room   it's actually computer room we have got ten computers  but is just like a hall remaining part is unoccupied you know and there are chairs semicircular monitor is there so straight away we can take facility of that room and our principal cabin it has got one set t v set monitor uh video is there  and even that is sound proof and ac  so only five or six students are there sometime they come in group for explanation and asking their doubts and difficulties so i can take them to the principal's cabin that way he's very generous 
 i'm mrs chapala nayak from orissa and  what's your name please  i am mr mishra from arunachal pradesh  i have come here for a refresher course uh means in kolhapur how do you enjoy it ? i enjoy it very well but uh i thought there could be more uh uhm programmes like guest lecturers many more guest lecturers coming from outside  that could have been a better programme  look suppose uh we are forgetting about this refresher course how do you enjoy this place ? this place is also is very nice very nice so i think that's uh here the weather conditions are fine and yeah  very pleasant   yeah  in arunachal pradesh the conditions are totally different  i work in bondila  and yesterday there was in the means t v means that uh  there is heavy snowfall  the temperature is always uh minus uh seven uh seven to  seven degrees  i take also this place for enjoyable but uh i get a little bit of cold because i have some sort of problem here that typical cold here uh over above all its  okay  that is why climate is so nice i think and the beautiful sceneries are here  you're right  and when will we go back ? actually on fourth uh this refresher course is coming to  an end  and after that i plan to go back via orissa to  arunachal pradesh tickets it's uh have you reserved ? i have got my reservations   no not got  then we may go both of us now that is how your husband also by that time we meet he has requested me  i have uh told him that i will acompany have you visited any other place ? in ? in kolhapur ? yeah i went to mahalaxmi temple  i went to also rankala lake i also shalini palace    that kolhapur city  why not we are making a programme that uh for panhala i think it's a nice place   panhala we'll go uh we've  planned it uh on next sunday  if you like you can join us  i think it's a historical place  yes since i heard that there are forts and uh some other things let us see yeah   shivaji  it it is mostly in the pattern of our barwati study one word barwati durg  yeah  and that day in panhala we will be able to find our own uh past culture  culture of orissa tradition of orissa  how do you find is it better than orissa ? actually means uh every place is a good place  we cannot say which place is better but uh to each one like his own name sounds the sweetest the place uh where he is born that must be the best  then how is it that  how is it that that from ap the natural scenery ? natural scenery also see in ap that is quite good  because that uh the government is taking much interest in developing that into a tourist  is it hilly hilly area ? yes hilly resort  they are going to develop it in the sima simla and kashmir type of then how do you feel that uh remaining far away from you home ? obviously if you remain far away from your home uh you will feel nostalgic for your home  next time you'll   then also family  and very often even if i like this place but uh i feel very homesick here   one or two words was got to feel that but anyway  the the call of the business is there and you have to there be there for  you are remembering your children family  certainly laughter  and i also feel very often when i feel that to go and that to visit some places here i always remember my children  that it means they will be with us how nice it could it be  that could be better  i also feel and here actually i feel that uh they are not giving us any holidays  and just like makarsankranti which was uh shiv ceremony idea like in   one word we are going to forget it  in orissa  yeah  because there is no holiday  i also thought that day we'll be getting some  makar chawal and some other things means this all cultural and traditional things   but they're observing here in a different way   yeah means uh uh also i am looking food in a mess  that some sweet they're giving  yeah  and saying that   in the class also they gave certain sweets that gudgudate like this ha right  that is quite good also   this is almost seem the simla pattern of orissan  this that's why i seem  only the variation of culture actually   that's what different culture  ha it is there the way we observe it's different here  and again that uh saraswati pooja we observe there with uh so much pomp and ceremony   haan  but here they are one word they don't know what which sarswati pooja  but ganesh pooja is different here and in maharashtra ganesha is a very uhm a good uh big god  a uhm you may be finding on the street you may be watching on the t v   it may be but they're not observing that saraswati pooja and i feel that's  it   ha but uh every region has got it's own gods and goddesses yeah and that is   yeah  no not that uh it's your own god or goddesses  laughter gods and goddesses are there everywhere   natural  but uh they by culture generally you have got your own specific ident tified god  they  yeah  that happens and uh vinayak is a very important god here in maharashtra uh you come orissa when in your vacations every year  ? almost every year because uh every year we are having two vacations  two one actually vacation of two months summer vacation summer  and in winter we get about twenty-two days break we call it the winter break do you come in both the vacations ? almost  you enjoy that  certainly summer summer  summer actually in orissa these days it is becoming very hot for us after staying there in arunachal for about  uh say seven eighty uh seven years uh years i am finding it uh very hot to manage in orissa particularly during summer   summer   what's your idea about that konark temple ? konark temple do you find any other substitute or something equal  in any other state ? i think so far as konark temple is concerned konark is konark  uh it has got a world status uh you know it is there in  uh the great surprises of the world  it has been enlist enlisted that way and so in some of the states you may be finding very good temples like here in maharashtra jejuri is there on our way  from poona to kolhapur from the train i had a glimpse of jejuri is it so artistic ? jejuri ? it may be i have not uh seen it i have seen it only from the train i think it could be because uh like jayanta mahapatra has written on konark uh here arun kolatkar has written on  that temple jejuri  but the difference between jayant mahapatra and arun uhm you can find as the people say the critics say that jejuri is uh on the pattern of t s eliot's waste land  it might have been but might have been actually we've we've not read it so you cannot say but konark after all it is on a different pattern yeah i think so that uh it's completely different   haan  mainly because of uh not of that uh background on the one side that the background or the story behind it  we take it as that of the patriotism that about the  it is the case of patriotism it is a case of sacrifice it is a case of uh a fa father's love for his child a son's dedication for his father all that   no not only  also you say if you go back to that  dharamputli jheel   and it's artistic  ha that artistic talk i think  artistic talk is there certainly and uh if we go back to that dharamputli jheel yeah you find  it's all a count in search of his father  and the father and the son then they don't get an opportunity mean to exchange the mutual courtesies   yeah  the very eve evening the boy reaches  the same night he constructs that uh dome completes that dome yeah yeah completes and again for the sake of his own uh uh community he sacrificies jumps from the river but it shows as jumps from the top of the temple and uh gets uh buried in the  it shows his patriotism put itself i think   put itself  its patriotism but the boy is that what to be expected more than a boy like uh dharma of twelve years or ten to twelve years old  right of course it's a it it can be different uh a differently interpreted it can be also a sign of patriotism i think  it  have you seen that chandipur ? yes chandipur i have gone chandipur where we have got this uh ordnance factory   chandipur  yeah and that gopalpur ? gopalpur in barampur ? uhm  that sea beach nice sea beach in the a few words   haan one word central uh of course the light house is a is a bit away from that  gopalpuri is also no not i connected to our orissa's rich past  from there only we sailed in the long past to japan borneo  some other places we hear then what's your idea about chandvali ?  one word the government is taking a lot of interest and uh it has developed into uhm missile and  missile the present site uh yeah  but let's see it also there was a huge approach previously  that there was a port  there was a port but uh again they are trying that uh that to have built   but if it will be possible   but  it may not be possible now it may not be in in this present condition of the  they are trying that yes they may be able to do may not be able to do  but in the left of one word and this uh ordnance factory there  do you enjoy your service there ? in arunachal pradesh yeah  enjoying it how how many are there from orissa ? means actually in our college there are three  from orissa ? yeah   i'm one then another is mr nayak he's  a lecturer in history and there is another dr mahonty  he's from one word but he is from orissa  orissa  he is in political science   orissa  why they are so much interested and also you ? no it's not a case of interest then ?  it's uh you got the chance how ? you get a chance and you go because in these days of uh  unemployment and all that you cannot just stay back at home  and take risk   that's what  no to me i i always think that uh the first chance is the best chance  whenever we get no no first the chance  no no  and also   we've to abide after that we may consider that is the prescription  because if you leave a chance those same chance may not come to you again and so far as coming to orissa is concerned   and which is your in one word  we've to do grasp it  once the matter if coming with orissa is concerned you can come back yeah anytime you like because the ugc has uh as per the ugc scheme uh you can come to the university in a way that way i'm looking up for a better future   yeah  that you are thinking that to come back orissa ? yeah in if anytime it is possible i'll come back  and here in orissa the correspondence are quiet good also as far east organisation has come under uh actually after ugc  recommendations have been implemented with new year we are finding the pay scales are almost the same  i was previously working in kandapur college  i started my career as a lecturer in kandapur college itself  in orissa  but in uh new the conditions in those uh days but in the private colleges  that's obvious problem is everywhere  actually i joined that uh in nineteen eighty when the college started  and now still now i'm there  uh i heard that day also actually i i matriculated in seventy-nine  seventy-nine seventy-nine and you joined in eighty eighty  that is quite nice and interesting also  and we have four there no  we have lot respect uh better command  and others  in other departments  yeah no they have  off day that is a uh two to three members are there  one wo working that the result  means the government has got yeah different categories   yeah  not that according to plus two and plus three system  in class two they have minimised just like the clerk and something like  actually in other states the pattern is different they are not having the junior colleges  they are having the plus two plus plus system of indian school  we call it as one word   in orissa they have not done till date but in orissa even the a few words  but they have done the bifur bifurcation in one college plus two plus three all these systems are different but the pay structure is quite good for them for junior college lecturers because you find they hire secondary teacher a senior teacher who gets uh sixteen uh sixteen forty to twenty-nine  scale  whereas in orissa you get uh means a junior college lecturer gets uh two thousand to three thousand five hundred  i think uh that is the second pay  no that is not the second that is higher than the second stage  no now in orissa  so they are getting two thousand uh they are getting it at par with the o s officers  that means class two  yeah class two  whereas we are also class one officers  not actually class one yes class one  there  no we are  no no  there a p  uhn 
 haan  hi  so what are we talking about   we're talking about uh alma how do you pronounce your name   elma  yeah my name is not pronounced alma it is elma  alma  elma  what is it the malyali malyalam

so what do you think about the disaster happened   dakshin maharashtra about earthquake  actually umesh as we have seen there are a lot of people died  ahn  so uh according to scientists they are expecting one more but this is very very serious disaster happened last month uhm but do you think that what has happened is for good or bad  no no it is extremely bad  in the last around ten fifteen years this is the worst uh disaster happened  in india or on earth  uhm in india or in the world  uh i can't tell in the world because i don't know more about other sides happened but in india this is the very very serious hit to the people and also to the country  uhm  as as this is a very serious happened mr p v narasimha rao should have take taken a very  serious step on this oh yeah  and that affected a lot of people and also many houses every thing has been crushed  do you think anything that will be going to happen in  india  yeah umesh just for the day have changed in india earthquake my friend  yeah  yes umesh  actually what happened is scientists have predicted that  there will be a serious earthquake in one uh again  in uh most probably in december as they have predicted  because uh before that time they have to take more precautions as there is a lot of life lost in the  earthquake till now a serious step has to be taken  so we have to think about it a lot  what do you think about those people whose lives have gone whose lives have gone in earthquake  yeah there are uhm there are lot of relief funds coming from outside the country and people are also donating on this  break in recording  there are a lot of uh relief funds coming from other countries  like uh donations of amount and aid and also the food  one word like uh food uh from other countries and also from  the people are also donating break in recording  but don't you think that it will be better that if uh the people take up general opinion of say uhm helping us  yeah we like to have it so taking to uh what is called uh box or something and uh going on just asking for relief this one uh for earthquake relief fund for earthquake do you think it is better mr mahesh  yeah  uhm yeah i think people are donating and also the  a lot of participants are coming to take part in the relief fund so as far as my thinking people are donating as much as possible for the relief fund as they think that their own pople are dying from whole everything  so we also should have to take part in that  as far as my but mr mahesh see what i think is uh that people being suffered by this uh being wounded in all this cases  it'll be better if those people uh would would  have lost their lives because see all the things what has happened it all most more uh it's been happened slum areas you can say always you get yeah  so and you can have and one more thing is uh not only in india but also as uh and most of the countries are concerned  all this uh what is called uh the unwanted scenes happen only in slums like uh you know this uh raped and uh they all this multi- millionaires trying to become more and more millionaire  yeah by destroying all the slums  yeah  yeah  so what i think is it'll be better if all those people would have lost their lives in uh the earthquake yeah so what do you think which is more beneficial  to participate in the earthquake  because as far as participation is concerned uh it would be better first uh those people who are uh half the way uhm in their life that is uh half the thing they are  living and the other half side they are dying in that case it'll  be better people gener donate generously uhm   that's what i think  and more one more thing is if people would have lost their lives the population also would have gone down uhm  so from that point of view the other people also  would have been uh benefitted because the earthquake doesn't bring  the problem of uh uhm  eatables uhm  then uh any other miscellening uh purpose uhm  that wouldn't be much of problems  and what do you think of the pm's participation in this relief fund uh relief umesh  as far as pm's is concerned the prime minister uhm  he's working quite hard  of course uh i think even he is generating i mean he is donating generously  but to some extent  we can't say that he isn't uh uh helping them   it's his duty to those because he is the prime minister of the country no  so now what do you think about the earthquake in maharashtra  there a around thirty thousand people have died and what do you  feel which is better no as i told you before that uh it'll be   the thing was better if all the people would have lost their lives in that as i told you before uhm uhm because one more thing is now this medical expenses  and going for that thing as far as living uh even the medical expenses have been given free the all items uhm  but as far as uh other thing is concerned uhm they being lost their property and other thing  uhm they naturally feel uh bad about they feel that the life is miserable  uhm  uhm  it's better if they would have lost their lives now what do you think about the people maximum many of the people have died in maharashtra oh yeah so what do think about them  about them sa sad  what would be better if what would be the better steps to be taken  i think it was good what have what happened was good  and what about what do you think about the uh earthquake happened in gulbarga that is in karnataka  yeah in karnataka that same opinion no many people they uh very few died and also no the same thing that has been applicable to maharashtra uhm  so okay uh now we'll shift on to some other this one uh recording broken  okay umesh what do you think about the dussera  festival that is uh from next week they uh the college has declared holiday  so what do you think about it  enjoyable one word  okay umesh uh actually what i am thinking is i am thinking to of going to mysore and uh spending there a week seeing the dussera festival that is uh in front of mysore palace  there will be a big crowd and also the mysore  maharaja the uh maharaja will be seated on an elephant and uh all uh i a few words some maharaja at present  no actually his grandsons are there so they are going to uh get him seated uh on an elephant in the place of their fore-fathers  so there will be all ministers and also the prime minister will be attending the uh function  so i think there is a grand festival and people from all over the country will be coming  okay umesh what do you think about the compt competitive exams conducted by the all india level   it's good for students to come up in life uhm  so they got plenty of comp competitive exams uhm  so it helps uh students come up in life uhm  in just not in monopolying uhm they have got plenty of other way  uhm  uhm  so it really helps   it's something like an entrance something you say yeah like uh many most of the intelligent persons will be filterd and will be placed in a top most position  and uh so it helps a lot of students who want to be in a good position  and so what do you think about their this one future or uh like will it be good or uh will there be any politics or what do you think about it  no as far as their will power and their mind is concerned if they are well strong enough  uhm   they'll be well placed  no what i am thinking if there is some  political background like uh from some minister any influence comes and uh will they change their mind or will the correct person will be placed on position  they'll have good or uh  hey that's what i'm telling no  as far as the will power and the mind is strong uhm  they need not have to uh keep uh say they need not have to keep themselves down   uhm  yeah okay  now what do you think about the state competitive exams  state competitive exams right people are uh  taking much of interest in union state competitive exams uhm  know what i think is in the national level many of them who have done well will not be qualified fine  sometimes in the state level they may be qualified  their intelligence may be understood or their intelligence can be seen by the examiners or some higher persons who are going to conduct the exams  so i think uh this this is more uh it's good competitive exams all india and state level it is quite good  it helps people in many ways and also influences many of the  people to come up and also be placed in a good position  well what do you think about the university exams conducted  so university exams are conducted uh see at present india is considerable you know plenty of universities union level uhm uhm  and some of the some of the universities uhm  their great wisdom uhm  so what i think is doing in that particular university uhm  the persons career to some extent might be spoilt uhm  because moreover now-a-days when we go away  for job opportunities uhm  what they ask is  uhm preferably from a good recognised university uhm  and if the university has got a black spot uhm  naturally all the persons who has studied in that  particular university uhm  also the same thing will be a waste yeah  to the student who has studied over there exactly  and what do you think about the college itself  if the college is not good how can a university be uh means  uh be pointed out  the college is not good in the sense what do you mean  like uh lecturers are not good or students may not be good or sometimes the placement may not be good  as far as lecturers are concerned uhm  the teaching you know might be quite low  uhm quite high the level standard  uhm  uhm, as far as students are concerned  uhm  the main thing all depends on students uhm  they they have got a good friendship uhm alright  uhm  they can uh deal with any other thing also that's  with studies uhm  with lecturers they can have good relation also   but suppose if the students uhm don't have to build up their good friendship  uhm   uhm  uhm good friend circle  uhm  naturally the college also gets a bad name uhm  so in which the achievers also will also be included uhm  okay then  okay mah okay umesh uh we have talked a good  we had a good conversation yeah and uh i think the flood relief might take a good turn and in the earthquake may take a good turn and  it may be of some help to the people  and so i'm thinking of finishing this discussion by this topic itself so okay umesh say you good bye   good bye mahesh  good bye

books and i don't know whether my mummy will allow or not because books and all means uh now you have not taken already  i have taken but uh say some one word  refer back that kind all they have been changed libraries are there 
okay ganga  okay ganga today i tell you uhn about the  uh terrorism in kashmir  you know uhm when we left kashmir no uhm  somewhere around in ninety ninety yeah ninety march  uh we have to face such a difficult time i can't tell you we left that uh place in the night time two o'clock  because the terrorism was so much means like it was so so much uhm widespread you couldn't yeah we couldn't stay there  like uhm those terrorists uh they wanted us to uhm uhm to accompany them in the revolt against india they want freedom so they told us that you also accompany us  and we'll fight against india we want freedom we'll have a separate state  but as it is hindus are in minority there in kashmir uhm   uhn   uhm   you couldn't  muslim is more  yeah muslims are more in number  hindus are in minority so hindus said no we will not uh  fight because india is our country we don't want freedom  so we won't accompany you in the job   that's why those uhm muslims they got very angry  they said no you have to accompany us accompany us if if you if you want to live in this place you have to accompany us  we said okay fine uh some people uh accompanied them and some people didn't  and those who didn't we were one among them  we just left the place in the night time because of people were trying to poison the water and then they were trying to put off the electricity in the whole one word in the whole city  and then again they were uhm trying to trouble us by invading our houses and trying to misbehave with our women and all  so it the turn took like that we left the city in the middle of the night and we got scared we didn't even take things along with us just the clothes we were wearing  we went in those clothes only uhn  so later on when we came uhn to uh to jammu we migrated from kashmir to jammu  then uh then there we couldn't adjust with climate and all  in jammu  it was very difficult because kashmir is basically a very cold place and uh jammu is a very hot place  the temperature is uh ranges from uh thirty to say forty or so  forty-five  many kashmiris died also in jammu because of hot weather  jammu  yeah uhm then uhm  then what happened  yeah something about kashmir i'll tell you because kashmiri in kashmir muslims are also suffering a lot  they are not earning that much they are supposed to earn  uhn  uhm i tell you like uhm uh in our kashmir no in  summer months we used to have some uh somewhere around uhm  i don't know it was the income was too much it used to be somewhere around in crores when it comes on state level  now it is nothing because the tourism is nil  those people are suffering   nobody can go  nobody can go to kashmir now because they don't want any tourists also   they're kidnapping tourists   that's why the tourists what they will do this this kidnappers to tourist  they might kill them or they might uh try to ask them uh like to do something or they might tell government to leave their terrorist in uh return  like we leave this tourist only if you return that uh  terrorist which you've uh arrested  means any terrorist the government would be arresting no the police will be arresting  those terrorists they have to leave  if uh  but there some tourist is there or no in kashmir  there are no tourists now the tourism is at nil  there are so many hill stations and uh beautiful lakes and forest and everything but all in vain now  only the export will be there because the fruits there are lot of apples and peaches and plums and pears  those all they'll export now means sent out of the kashmir  they won't keep it there because that is the only they have income for them  those people are also suffering a lot so many people have died  they were supposed to be a big big very big field there uhn you think it'll improve now  i don't think it will improve because those people already many have died no  so they want that let some more also die but we'll take the freedom once for all  but i think india also won't let it go because uhm if india  let's it go means it has to let go also punjab also then  it has to let go uhm then this naxalite uh problem also there they also then then also they have to give uhm this another state for them people for those people also  uhm i mean so so i think uh this problem will never end and uh sufferers are we people  we have left all our property there worth lakhs  of rupees  and all it is very difficult and especially for business people  they have just scrambled businesses all flop there nobody can uh rely upon business there  anytime it the shop may be burnt down or any time in cross fire your life is also not secured there  you may you go out of the house in the morning you do  you never know that you will come back in the evening because the condition is like that  in the evening time you are not allowed to keep the electricity on they think that uhm those uh security people think that you are doing any conspiracy inside  so for that also you have to take care you you don't have any freedom literally there because even now security forces are trying to  get the situation in normal  but that requires a lot of strictness and that strictness seems to be adopted to the people there  even they are getting against security people now  life is nothing  life is nothing that is not the question life is something but you have to struggle to achieve something  life is a dream   that's all  nothing  i think  missing my mummy  missing my papa missing my everyone what to do  it really yaar feeling so bored i mean in the hostel   one word you will feel bored yaar   because this not house yaar come on  you don't feel like to do anything na  i don't feel like to  i wish we had a long long holiday and we would go somewhere relax at a beach and there  yeah no then like uh just freak out and like uh relax for sometimes so that you get fresh up yeah what an exam exam exam exam exam exam exam exam  really bored  may be may be we can uh get some free time after this examination   we'll uh relax for some time like we'll  go have a holiday everyday is relax for us  of course we never study  did you see aaina movie  aaina  uhn  its nice  very nice  really very nice  what is the story like  sorry aiyyo please you go and see why i heard it is something like two uh girls and one boy yeah both of them are sisters  both both the girls are

okay   what else  uhm what else i mean it seems our hostel is very popular here  like uh it seems our hostel is very nice and college campus is also very nice  and uhm i heard people saying that like uhm uhm  people are very nice   especially everthing is  people are very nice  a few words uhn yeah of course we we are being charged also that much only for it no  we are having more uh hostel fees uhm as compared to others colleges  but the facilities is also there na  yeah  but since morning we are not having hot water today  aiyyo you know that  what happened  it seems madam told one word that heater one word use heater really  yeah  you know how mm electricity bill this time no  for us girls it has come some somewhere around one thirty no and for boys just uhm thirty-five rupees  imagine yes how much electricity we girls are consuming  all because of this heaters and all   no   yes  yeah then you didn't complaint   so what you are doing  and i one word told madam i'm  not using it   i'm using uh one word  she is telling whatever it is cooking is not allowed   one word   cooker  really  and and one word i will have always one word really  uhn  now what to do about it   it's not yaar everybody is using heaters in the hostel  we should be allowed i don't know why electricity is one word look nei yaar it's more well our heater is there no that heater will one word too much money not for this heater you know  this heater will also take but that is more every rooms have a heater and  i think because girls are having more uh casette players also more uh  casette

her so much  you think padma won't love  she one word there but it was something like uh  regarding this okay now let it go  but i think we require friends more in a hostel no  we are not close to

first phase  this is the first phase then in the second phase we have some clinical subjects in which we come in direct contact with the patients ah but it's on two basis like when we see the patients

 i'm sumati narvekar and i've taken my b sc  which uh faculty  hello a few words  science is not a faculty it's a vast area   it's one of the major  uhn   it's one of the major  that's true and a few words as minor  haan that's right how about  you i have done my arts  what arts  arts arts is b a you know like  yeah b a  yeah  which area  we don't have majors actually like uh  which subjects have you you know in all we have five optionals english basic is always common yeah  and uh psychology history and sociology  ah do you know something about uh use of statistics in psychology  no way  what are these no in p g they use this  no i haven't done my p g i have done my graduation  i'll introduce myself two words  my name is girish hullur and i have done my b sc forestry  so how many two words your studies  families  uhm you should have learnt about uh forty fifty families   one word exclusively uh  one word  forty fifty  yeah  in one year means no it usually our one word tries to see you study entirely botony  yeah entire botony even this ecology and all  ecology then uh physiology entomology all  entomology so two words  hey come on yar i am getting you are getting out of the track okay i'm  okay okay okay  okay so which topic so why why not talk something about the social and all   problems or something like that   you should have listed some something socially relevant and most in thing  eh do you think uh the funds that they are collecting for the earthquake is real worth of  when we have a feeling that nobody is using i mean like  the population is not as much you know it's one word  only there and we are colleting more than uh double funds only no they are creating a sort of reserve fund  it's not fund and in one month two words   one word  it is said that the politicians are only eating it up  no it directly goes to charity associations you nee nee need not be afraid of uh the funds being used appropriatly   not afraid i mean as a citzen i think i should know about it  uhn you've to di directly send it to government okay government will supply the funds to non-government organisation when the people are not existing only what you are doing with the money what kind of people are not existing there are people there are a few words   there are so many people uh the poor people  but the funds that we are collecting not for the there are many villages but the funds that we are collecting i don't think so not for the people that they are existing now uhm  but it's for people who have been crippled and who have been disabled and who are suffering   uhm  uhm uhm   it's not for those who are uh fit and they are uh then  then what  then what  so how do you feel of this programme  what programme  m b a  programme m b a i think uh m b a should be strictly made for uh commerce students and engineering students  no way no way you cannot offer management in every field so  why  there are  no management only i don't think so it's easy for the arts students  atleast they should have some programmes for the   nei you have some programmes arts  nei you have some programmes  arts  of course one word problems nothing like that  it's not problems i mean like we are not used to  we are not taught about uh accountancy statistics  many higher students have this problem i mean you people are hard working and usually we have seen that arts students are very lazy i mean like merry go round type  and the one word students yeah   uhn very lazy  lazy sort of people they are not used to obstacles  that's one word   they are lazy people and in the school time  one word know that sort of  i think they should have some training for the m b a beginners  especially to the arts students oh you mean to have foundation course for   they should conduct separate classes  atleast somehing no the basic foundation should be little bit strong  they'll find that they need a foundation course   to arts and the science students   what do you need it  i think you'll have one word  no means regularly i mean you know even my doctor says  i'm regularly irregular  you better enroll for m b a this thing evening programmes that would be better for you  now i am not this problem are like one word   one word actually i'm  definitely not interested in business i have something more interested in psychology  psychology doing b a psychiatrist and work for the people especially the mentally retarded the abnormal   psychology  and why did you opt for m b a  means it was just for the heck of it i appeared for it  and i got caught  yeah just for one word you need to mould your  career and you know why   i don't think so  i think it is pure luck obviously you don't want to enter into any kind of programme that you no it was actually after my graduation it was of course m b a was the first entrance exam that was out so you know   a few words  so because of success just squeeze in it  i don't know i think just tried your luck  pure luck   it's two words  i know that it's pure luck laughs  so  and i regret entering it maybe i'll be very happy doing it later on  i mean you are planning to do  many people give an excuse of a sort   continue   it's not excuse it's a reason but  i'm not giving it up you know i'm standing by  just offering it  no i'm going to do it you know the first time was we are one word   one word sort of i didn't know how to prepare first semester and all now i know how to yeah now you know you have missed so many one word  in past  i know that's one thing i'll never be  able to compensate  so how do you feel uh aids is research going on now how do you   i'm out of it i've no idea about it  come on you should be aware of it  i mean everybody should be aware of it  of course aware of it but i'm i mean i don't know much about it  hey what would you be after te ten years from now  ten years from now i visualise myself as a more of a practical man rather than in terms of success and failure which is part of one word   hey in which field you are going to be in see any sort of thing i'll have no  boundaries to having suitable say any kind of   suitable  what a plan  what do you mean plan you don't have to plan you know  everybody dreams yar  i don't dream  if you don't dream you can never   hey it'll be lot of question   it's not that only when you dream you think of doing something  you can use  but that is impractical  not practical you every man has to dream it it's  practically proved  dream is something different than  dream in the sense not sit and day dream just you have a feeling in you  someone one word  so how do you visualise yourself  myself somewhere in the public field  maybe helping out with my dad   then you're political figure yes somewhere with my dad   like your dad  particularly politics or writing novels and uh full fledged poet  painter that's it  you are interested in politics  yeah i have two words my dad he is sitting  sticking to this post  so how do feel the corruption towards what kind of a  i think you can do no mean yeah politician you can be a perfect politician only if you are crooked  no way no there're so many people who are not crooked and all  you just can't know you have to be crooked   your dad know much you have  because politics is itself is a crooked field you know  you have to be very crooked in it but you have certain  you you know if you are straight you are pulled down man  you are just pulled down  but you've have some leaders where whereas  you'll have a certain affiliation towards sometime you feel that uh you do it you know means always they are not corrupted  some people will be i don't uh mean like i don't like politicians i like politics   that's running in your blood you know  after sometime you will become one politician  i don't mind i mean only i'll be an actress in one word i'm not a good a politician  i can't be because i'm not crooked yet maybe one fine day when i'm put in the post   one usual kind of  maybe you'll  i will as well solve lots of things have makes a good politician  it's not like accept things which is uh which you have one word  look that is what i dream and i don't that is what  i'm telling it out  so you need a challenge always not guarding your   perspective   something i mean like i have my own set of principle my own way of thinking oh  everyone is now  because i don't compromise with it yes i listen to you yes yes but i do whatever i want to do  compromise means we should compromise at times  look if it is affecting somebody else fine i'll  compromise  no you should compromise with yourself no that's my life yeah one word  it's my life why one word force in my business live and let live that's my policy   no way  so others may be a few words then what  you'll do  well they are elders yeah i i i can't do anything if it's my mother or my father  so you but i'll try to convince them no i do it  behind them no problem   so you  so how do you react to your friends  friends when they suggest something to your own way it might means compromise  look yeah  when it's my friends we share a very different kind of relationship like  we are very frank everybody knows who how and what she is going to do  like they can literally predict your every move  frankness doesn't always mean   i'm telling you listen i'm   telling you know i'm not telling you frankness means frankness means although they're telling what sort of friendship  i'll share with my friends  and everybody knows and most of my friends are my childhood friends they know what i am  i mean they know i won't listen to anybody  but still as a good friend they always give me the advice and if i find it worth and if i can feel that i can take it i do it  accept whatever  you always tend to make certain adjustments in friendship  always like if it if if never imposed no okay if it is together you are doing something yes i'll co-operate whereas i alone have to do it no i don't take anybody's  advice  of course i ask people but the more you ask people the more advice that people giving it's more complicating for you to decide it   if it is  so let's switch on to new topics it's  already boring deciding a single particularly one word  i think sumati should be speaking yeah   she should speak on educational standards now  what yeah  what man  sumati is more like a one word  very good listener and usually you know good listeners they won't like they don't know anything of themselves   two words   keep quiet   laughs   it's true  that's specially true about capricorns so you  one word   oh so you are capricorn he must one word  definitely definitely i'm a capricorn  oh come on don't play tricks on  but you know what they say on leos because of that  leos two words the world the world is stable because of the leo  one word  no why  i'm not bosting okay because i'm a leo  i'm not bosting 
i am s nambirajan native kalyanam district in tamil nadu tamil nadu state  my name is p swamy i am from coimbatore coastal district in tamil nadu  well sir good morning how are you  i am fine okay how are you sir  i am also very fine  uh did you go to the university  ah yes i went on uh twelfth uh june ninety-four uhm why a speech to make what was the speech did you enjoy  ah i did enjoy uhm actually sir  are you getting any letters from home  ah yes i got what are these i got three letters from home uh one from the family and one and other two from friends ah yes from friend mr arun  ah yes he described me in his letter uhm  why he couldn't come to this uh refresher programme  uhm  yes he seem you don't call single that isn't it ah yes you see he is a good company yes he is good  then uh what about our local political scene there do you know anything  i fear uh i don't know  we are here for more than uh three weeks uhm  so i'm not in a good position uhn to  speak about the local politics of tamil nadu  uhn  but i received a letter from my friend yesterday ahn  he has told that there is ahn a hue and cry over the reservation issue  ahn  ahn about what for the entrance examination uh for uh admission in the professional group in tamil nadu ah ha  now we have reduced the reservation from  sixty-nine percent to fifty percent  ahn  above  so all the political parties are opposing it and uh  uhm  uh agitating with uh in a vigorous way   oh ho  so each and every party is uh having a bandh   everyday   oh ho  and you know the petition of student is  ahn taking a serious turn half or so  ahn  are schools and colleges running there just now  actually they are running ahn  uh but now and then they closed because every political party try to have a bandh on a particular day ahn  and the leader of the main opposition party dr karunanidhi has also been arrested  ahn ahn  and i don't know what about what happened to him afterward whether they released him or not  but something is wrong with the state of affairs in our state  what do you think sir about this election reservation in karnataka  i think they should not have introduced it all of a sudden they should have introduced it gradually  ahn  say sometimes it may affect the people  ahn  who who are aiming at something  so they should have announced it earlier or  they should have uh introduced the scheme in a gradual manner  so that nobody will be affected   ahn  ah uhm  so you say that there should be a psychological preparation for the people to accept this election yes yes certainly  people are not prepared to accept it all of a sudden  because this people never expected that they would announce it at this junction even when they call for investigation they did not mention it clearly mention about anything  after receiving all applications and fixing the date for examination and all ahn  and they come out with this announcement people will certainly get scrabbled that is uh i think they wonder ahn  would be criticised for it   ahn  moreover the political parties are uh aiming at ahn  uh utilising response into in their favour  yes  for  for their coming up role  so there is no wonder there will be some concessions  will it be useful for common persons  if so uh upto what extent  i don't think uh it will not benefit much but anyhow   uhm some uh bright people have uh some chance to come up but at the cost cost at the cost of uh the downtrodden people   uhm  will it be harmful if uh shall we say uh from different uh as you say it is downtrodden people yes certainly it will affect some genuine cases  if it is genuine cases we may accept it as common one yes  but uh will it effect the nation as a whole  no i don't think it will affect the nation but uh ahn on the whole the people   ah uh to some extent ahn may be affected  i think so   ahn   ah   ahn  well uh in my opinion i think that this reservation  uh quota  uhn  uhm should have uhm should be applied  uhm  uhm  only for this non skilled job  no  then ahn once again the criteria of casteism will come into scene you see   ahn  uhm the people who are employed in uh very luc  lucarious job ahn they will become another upper class and these people who are employed in skill work they will become the lower class because ah uh the casteism the origin of casteism was on that basis in the beginning so once again we are going to that line  so what i say is the people a particular community people who were uh who were supressed ahn for generations together and there is no harm in giving them some chances to come up and uh this must be the main issue   ahn   ah   ahn  uh i do accept it uhn  uh whereas skill is the only factor uhm  uh which can make a nation uhm progress   uhm   uhm  but we have we have to do some sacrifice  i accept all those things because the efficiency uh intelligence everything is uhn a plus point  but even then  uhn  uhn  we have to do something for the ahn  upliftment of these people  and more important the people from upper caste should come forward for that   ahn  uhm  then only there will be  but you see  if we do that there will be social harmony there will be a good understanding among the people  but now a days it seems that it's working in the opposite direction that percentage people when they have to get some important post they don't think that it is for the benefit of the society and they they think that its for their own benefit and all  their personal gains  you see sir some people say you know that is in railways ahn and the post office sir  ahn  yes  uh that additions of uh the personnel in those department yes have considerably gone down   yes only because of this uh reservation  yes   yes  yeah true  unskilled people uhm they say it is baseless  the unskilled people uh come to the top uh they ar not in a position to cope uhm uh with the  necessity uhm uhm uh towards high post or high rank  uhm   uhm uhm  uhm  uh so they say they say uh that standard of service  uhm has gone down  uhm  instead of say uh that is the only resaon for the  uh down coming of the services there are so many factors but to think  to some extent it may be true true  because those people have not yet been given a chance to  act in that capacity  there are so many factors like that  but outright we cannot say that all those people who come under the uhm reservations are not being or inefficient there are so many people they can they could uh shine like anything  here in our case there are two such persons that belonging to schedule caste  uhm  uhn but both people were very efficient and they were uh  upright they were honest they were intelligent and they were up to the mark  they their services were highly useful to the department concerned yeah yeah and those people when they left their post they left with a good name good integrity everything  so we cannot say that it is the main factor some people may say like that because you see railways and uh postals were once upon a time dominated by a particular community  nobody will have entered that job l i c railways  post office and banks  because i have got my own experience even though i came  with a very good uh marks in the ten plus i was subject in  english  though in both one word and three or four banks l i c in the oil field ahn i requested them even though i belong to a forward community i still didn't got get   even though i belonged to a forward community i was oppressed there because i do not belong i was not belonging to a particular community that's the  so i find that these people should be given some time now but there should be a time limit  and there should be some other issue  creamy layer should be avoided  they should break brought to the they should be brought to the  for a period like that  this scheme was well i think  and actually downtrodden people must be given some importance that that's where we come uh we must also  ahn  ah yeah  uh i accept uh your point it helps us  that means uhm as a poor nation  uhm should strive forward and should thrust for the skill   uhm   uhm  skill is very very important i don't i don't deny it  uh only by using that skill that bring sense uh we can make our nation strong also  yes i accept it see as one thinker say india is a rich country but with poor people  but was it uh our natural resources must be exploited for which  uh both uh intellectual skill and uh manual skill are required   you see  yes yes it is true but our uh constitution makers  they introduce all these things in the hope of some good deed but you see our people are misusing it to some extent  because take this minority issue also minority  like minority issue  what what   haan  they were given protection in order to have a good chance to come up here uhm i mean in all aspect but most of the people are looking for this originality moreover there is uh many people are misusing from here self benefit  and the people from those minority community are affected much only by that route constitution is affected  for example educational institution are started by minority community people but the teachers working there are not success like anything they are remained as it is they are not given uh their salaries they are not able to protest it that uh any treatment or anything like that  so the intention is good but the implementation is something wrong  so we must find some way of otherwise we cannot say that the system is itself is fully wrong  thats my opinion   it's a nice opinion indeed  needs of the best one word but direction is one thats what is important i accept it  because when uh when we go through this uh experiences  first hand informations we feel that our people are wherever they go wherever they belong to which state they belong to which religion they belong  most of the people think that everything should be placed for their own purpose as to a draw that line  because it is the guidence of the politician yes certainly they are men yes they are now  now politics has become a profession once upon a time it was a service to the people  but now people think that it is also a kind of profession  so all the people will say please others and make this  their way   right it's become a no capital one word  yes certainly  the capital which only the rowdys and goonda have  that's all what else  okay sir it's a pleasure uh thank you to chat with me  what  thank you thank you  thank you

uh uh well anjali you have been uh teaching french here  uh what courses are you taking right now ? uh i am taking uh c o p course uhm  that's in the morning and i'm also taking the advanced diploma courses in the evening  uhm  uhm uhm what about m a do you teach m a also ? yeah i teach uh literature at uh the m a level literature you teach yeah  what literature do you teach ? uh well mainly classical literature and uh it starts from the sixteen century to the the middle ages uhm to the nine ninteenth century   uhm  uhm uh i mean we do that over a span of two years the second year and the third year uhm so your basic specialisation is actually literature literature yeah  french literature yeah french literature that is i did literature for the m a but uh i for my m phil actually i changed i changed my topic a little i i did uh teaching of french uhm uhm then i have come back to i've gone back to literature  uhm uhm  uhm uhm  uh what authors do you normally read ? are you working on some particular author or ? oh not at the moment  i am not working on my ph d at the moment though i have hoped to  uhm very soon   uhm  uhm but uh  who are the authors you are reading ? well uh uh ma reading or uh teaching ? teaching also teaching well we start from the middle ages  so we start with harbeley and uh uhm we go on to uh the eighteenth century voltaire rousseau uhm uhm uhm then ninteenth century we have all the romantic poets   uhm   uhm uhm  uhm uhm  and uh the realist flau bert uhm uhm  madame bowary oh this this uh well known author  oh  uhm uh alright coming to your evening courses in the certificate of proficiency course uh what is the text book you are following ? uh we have this book called uh  alizee-acutes de francais   alizee-acutes de francais   yeah it's a it's a it's a a very recent uh book  uhm uhm they stated all the new methods   taken in all the new methods and did well  but uh uhm it is a good book  uhm  good book good book yeah  is it one book for the entire certificate  no it's the three   it's no it's uh yeah entire certificate is one book  i mean we have three uh three volumes  the first one second one third one  so those we use for the certificate uh the diploma and the advanced  diploma   oh you have   advanced diploma so we don't always uh finish the entire book itself  it's a little too much uhm so we say about the three fourth of the the book we do with the c o p uhm then we continue with the diploma  uhm  uhm  three fourth of the second book and then we continue with the third book uh the second and the third book uh for the advanced diploma uhm of course we supplement it with our own materials  uhm uhm  what is the book uh you follow for uh russian ? uh you see we have several text books available but uh i normally use uh a book called russki yuzik dlya vsekh  that means you know russian for everybody    it's called russian for everybody   it's a whole set of books actually it has one text book uhm  and there is one latest stock so a lot of conversation  jokes anecdotes they are all there  then a book of exercises  these excercises they normally do at home uhm  then we also have a book called you know  reader  uhm  uh kniga dlya chtee- acuteniya  this is a book there are some stories etcetera there uhm  they read it like non-detailed text yeah  plus there is a small dictionary which gives all the words which are used in the text book and all these books  plus there is one small reference grammar  now this grammar uh explains all the grammar used in you know lesson-wise again yeah  so that way it's a nice compact one  yeah actually our courses has a casette which goes with it uhm  it it has uh uh book meant for the teacher guide for the teacher uhm  and uh it has a book of exercises uhm like as you said we do these excercises we give them these exercises to do at home  uhm  uhm  and uh there is a casette which goes with all the lessons in those uh in the books are recorded on the casettes plus there are some oral exercises on the casette which we do in class uh uhm uhm  then which is not always very convenient because when we have a very big class of about hundred students to get them to hear the whole casette is uh it's quite difficult so our set also goes with a casette but it is optional sometimes casettes are available sometimes they are not available  but when they are available they are very useful yeah  so that way if there is a casette then you don't even need a teacher you can really learn the whole thing from the text book from the whole set you see it is a set which is very useful it is good  i like that very much but in fact i started this thing only to ask you about this  the problem we face is there are good text books like this uh  russian for everybody but they are simply not available now because of the soviet union one word and all   yeah nor did our books uh our books are not available either because uh i mean they are available but uh they cost about three hundred fifty to four hundred rupees each uhm  which is uh  very high too high students can't expect students to buy them at all uhm  so what we do is we get them xeroxed  uhm uhm means we don't get the book of exercises xeroxed those we pick out exercise which can be done by the students we get them uh typed photo copies uhm uhm just a few of them  uhm uhm  uhm uhm  and uh the others we do in class uhm  but the book as such we get it xeroxed the main book  uhm uhm  and uh that it works out much cheaper than buying the book uhm uhm  means cost about eighty rupees to get   the them xeroxed uhm  i think okay only thing you miss out of the colours and uh means there is a lot of play on colours etc., in the in the book  pictures full of pictures you lose out on all that you know without uh with the xeroxed copy uhm always this is the greatest problem we are facing we just can't buy books they are simply not available  library of course has several copies but then these are all part time students yeah so we cannot give the books to them from the library if they take and if they don't return  it's a terrible problem  yeah   in fact they are not even among uh  yeah they can sit and read it  right they can sit but at home you required  require a text book when you are learning so text book has a   so what have you been doing uh have you been xeroxing them or uh  with some great difficulty last year we could get uh a couple of books for some students  so they were even sharing books like uh one book for two students whatever was available  i don't know what will happen next year next year can't you get xeroxed copies i mean uh now xeroxing the whole set or whatever you know there are lots of pictures photos etcetera  and you cannot avoid it because uh you know photos are are going with the text  yeah so every thing is uh text is there photographs are there  pictures are there diagrams are there all these things are there and if you want to take photocopies of the whole thing it become very expensive extremely expensive  or may be you could uh may be get out some copies from the library and keep them with you and give them to the students in class  not let them take them home  but if they don't return if they don't return means it will  but uh  ha no you don't allow them to take it home you allow them to read them in class but at home atleast in class they will have a book  but they badly require a text book at home  yeah how will you do the exercise how will you study  you have to kind of after going home you have to revise your lessons you must read what has been taught in the class  yeah  yes exactly  so you have to have the text books so it's a great problem we are now facing  i don't know what will be done in future maybe they'll    but couldn't you have chosen uh some other book which is uh or readily available  now the other  the reason uh problem now is that in fact no book is available not a single book is available even those which are popular not even wagner is it   wa even wagner which is published in delhi  and which is not available now  i thought wagner was available in uh in uh yeah right now in advanced diploma i am using wagner and even that is not available now  oh so you've you've still uh  still i couldn't. we are producing a possibility of it.  nobody has got  so you are still continuing with wagner you haven't thought no wagner i use for the advanced diploma course third year course first year second year i follow this russian for everybody that's what i did do   with my students now same batch which i now and then uh i have switched over to wagner now now they are doing on wagner in higher diploma but that is it the other two uh volumes to wagner or is it just one book ? one book   it's just one book wagner is a one book of the huge sixty-two lessons  it's huge  i did my c o p to advanced diploma with wagner  yeah russian  yeah  uhm  but for the c o p we found it was uh too too  authentic  uhm it is it is like an encyclopaedia  it's like an encyclopaedia it's uh  it's like a dictionary how exactly with a list of words which are very difficult to learn by heart and specially long russian words which are impossible to remember  it's full of words words words words it's  like one word in telugu and then actually when we were planning this there was one problem i was thinking about i thought i will discuss this with you because you know you teach french and i teach russian  i also read some french  i did two years of french here uh tutkar taught me shastri taught me sometime nelu also taught me for sometime  anyway and you read some russian  yeah  see one observation i made always was while doing this french and while teaching russian  you know my observations are based on uh not only just my first hand experience but also looking at the syllabi various universities i know the syllabi of uh nagpur university uh poona university i've seen uh even j n u's  syllabus our own syllabus of osmania university i know very well  what i somehow you know see is that in the french courses  there is some what uh of you know uh a little more uh emphasis on the oral skills speaking skills where as the written part  somehow gets slightly diluted it's not uh taught in such a nice fashion as the oral skills are taught  in the russian it is the other way round  yeah there is emphasis on the wri on  the written uh yes   in russian   on the written skill  yeah in the russian classes uh you see we  given give them so many exercises they go on doing them like mathematics so they are very good at reading and writing  they write well they answer questions they do exercises but when it comes to free conversation like this oral conversation you know just speaking like this in uh among people they are so shy of doing it  they can't do it russian students somehow just can't speak russian whereas french students i feel when they write they uh commit quite a number of mistakes you know lots of mistakes but when they speak they are so fluent you know they just very fluently speak  even among themselves even when nobody is watching even when there is absolutely no need for it i feel french students you know uh they love to speak french 
archana akka how are you ? i am fine how about you ? i am also fine  so how did you perform in your exams ? quiet well  this time let's see what happens okay i am expecting that you will be getting good result  so how are you enjoying your hostel life ?  ahn  its good very good in hostel everybody uh every student belong to different part of this country uhm and i think its a miniature india there  and uh we we we get together and uh we we enjoy the life there anyway   uhm  i know hostel is a very freaky kind of place you can enjoy your life like anything  yeah thats there   so  so how many room mates do you have wi with you ?

climate  climate is really boring kind of climate no it's good in the outskirt side only because  whe where our hos hostel is situated in the outskirts  and so always windy windy windy kind of place uhm cool it's  it's okay  and you have a temple also i believe inside that your  a temple called hanuman gudi  okay do you go to the temple daily yeah  daily not daily tuesday thursday and saturday definitely and if i find time i go  okay it means that you are a staunch believer in gods  not a staunch believer i i just like hanuman and saibaba  okay laughs  those the uh those who are still alive and you have a chaipatti also i think near that tracks chaibandi   chaipatti bandi   bandi  okay  it's a good time-pass we have  do you have  do you have tea from there ?

l d theatre yeah laser disc   l d theatre is designed by the h o d of our department mr muley do you know   this is two words   mr muley  yeah i know that but people say that it is a very not a good theatre i don't know i haven't seen it once laughter  and i think i before i left gulbarga you had already got the admission in gulbarga uhm and i had taken you to some different shops also for which i was a regular customer the computer uh typing shop  uh  typing shop the book shop the juice wallah  juice juice wallah  and simla juice centre simla juice centre okay  and the imampuri chowk the main attraction of the city laughter there guys keep coming  haan  just moving around during the evening time   kamat khamat  kamat hotel it's really a world our mechanical h o d our mechanical h o d says  uh kamat means khamat don't uh  crowded area   khamat don't eat don't eat  accha laughter  yeah you have to study and concentrate on studies he says  uhm that's that's the every we enjoy life there i don't i don't think i am having any difficulty there  and how is the principal of the college mr. patil ? he is a nice person very strict  and uh cool going  okay and he looks after the college very well i think  and ho how and i think who is the uhn h o d of the chemistry department mr.  varadh  uh he is a very strict teacher i think  yeah  yeah  he used to scold even the architecture guys and girls also because chemistry department it's on the first  floor of uh of the architecture department so we people were always scared about laughs because he used to come and scold everyone who used to sp speak loudly   haan they did   haan haan   yeah arti arti students they loiter about in the corridor  accha  they always they miss varadh sir always find them loitering about in the corridor and says hey what are you doing here just go and sit in the class laughs he says like that always 
archana are you there ? yes i am there how are you sonali ? i am fine how are you ? how are your studies going on ? they are going on pretty well but i am now reading for the examinations that are going to come up in april or may  why ? i don't know i have not been studying too much that is why  what has happened sonali you were a too studious girl i think yeah may be because now-a-days i just keep thinking of one of the ideas i am getting thinking of what exactly about getting married ? no not marriage marriage is another two to three years  uh before that   uh too long i think sonali no because before that i have to sit for my civil services  i have to do i a s oh it's really fabulous thing  okay now i won't talk about that much of future right now i want to talk about may be say november december  about november december i did not get it sonali  okay i   can you explain it ? okay here we go  i have this idea of conducting one fun-fair at the university of conducting a pardon i beg your pardon  a fun-fair  oh i think it's really a fabulous job  thank god you appreciate it and you like it  i think it will create a history in our department uh not only in the department but in the university itself  why ? why because i think no one has uh conducted this fun-fair before ? yeah so that means we'll be the pioneers  yeah laughs probably so  in fact you are the one who started the mister english and miss english competition also in the department  yeah  isn't it so ? isn't it  okay so now i'll start up with the fun- fair  the first thing is what you say should it be done on a humanities department or a humanities level as a whole or in  eng english department level  if you ask my idea i think my opinion is that it should be on the humanities level so that we can know each other  yeah thats nice atleast everybody will be coming together so all the departments can come together we can just enjoy have fun  yeah that will be gutsy imagine eleven department one hand  oh on one ground   oh  i am dreaming about that day laughs  yeah but the thing is the first problem what i think we may face is the money  yeah because for any good thing and any bit thing you need cash on your hands so i think you have to plan it all  yeah in fact i i just let me know because i am new around here so i don't know  is it possible for the department to dish out some money or something  ah yeah it's possible we can talk with maya  ma'am  yeah we can otherwise we also have a i think  department of social welfare which can give us money yeah yeah yeah otherwise we can go for any sponsorship  archies hallmark they sponsor so they can sponsor but what will be the conditions and what are we supposed to offer them   nothing conditions i think uh  okay like we can always talk about them we can talk to them if they are not charging going to charge or something very okay let's see i will talk with them and let you know okay and as for the stalls  you know one of the stall ideas i have is a request stall  request stall i did not get it  i will tell you what a request stall is  you are supposed to have a music system on your stall that will be only system and or that is the only stall where you are supposed to play play music for the whole of the fun-fair   ok   you can have a may be forty songs on the list  i think request songs is it ? yeah request song it is and anybody paying you the amount you play their song for them  for them or for their people around or something like  that   okay so we can get money also i think  laughs  yes you can earn see the basic thing of fun-fair will be one of this that we will be coming together   okay   secondly any fun-fair has to end in profit or in  pour income  yeah i think it is yeah   it is very difficult for a fun-fair to end up in a loss  yeah yeah we have to consider the monetary part also yeah monitory part is there but then again some other stalls  can you think of some other stall ? can you think of some other stall archana ? i think you better think laughs  may be okay what do you say about an eats you should have something to eat upon also  eats  yeah eatables i think samosas will do  samosas yeah that's not a bad idea then the chips   because they are chi uh cheap also  yeah chips can be there  yeah  and you can charge the double amount for them  i am getting hungry  same here laughter but yaar we have to talk about it you know you have to talk about this and tell to the other classmates also  you have to take their yeses and  noes also i think sonali you are the right person to take the initiative  okay let's see that but uh and the next stall at but of course about double your money  i know it's a sort of gamble in the university campus   but   i think you should explain this thing  yeah but diwali is there come on  diwali is supposed to be a bit of gamble a bit of paisa  money here and money there you know  so we can have a chakli stall also  laughs  you may   like diwali stall  yeah we can have it but in fact for double your money it is always like uhn you can have a car race stall  okay that you through the dices and the person who reaches at next end the earliest the person earns double the money so if at one time you are getting ten people on your stall you pay one person twenty bucks and still you have i think ninety bucks on your hand or okay eighty bucks on your hand  okay   okay   okay   it's really a good idea i think  anything new ? the new thing may be we may have a dance floor or something  yeah i think rain dance  yeah rain dance laughter but from where the water is going to come  we can go outside it's raining laughter   that's not a bad idea at all but then we can always have something of uh you know what they call that lucky draw  you know   okay yeah yeah  again we can have miss personality mister personality  yeah and we have a miss rose too  yeah how come there is no mister rose around why is always there is a miss rose you know  i think we this time we will conduct a mister rose competition also laughs  uh mister rose competition yeah  not a bad idea at all  the most handsome boy will get the award  yeah and the most beautiful girl will get the award  oh that is the person who gets the maximum number of roses from the people around   i wish i could get the award  ahn that has to be seen there can be many competitors at that time you know but the thing is we have to let all the department in the university know about it   in infact the people outside the department also  may be the colleges or something  yeah we can popularise it to the newspaper t v media like the cable news   that is going to be an expensive  the thing can be you can have some what you call the notices and then just go and just put them up in the colleges  the different departments of the university physics department is there  you don't have any interaction with the people from that department  yeah yeah yeah  chemistry department the geography department is also there i think we can make it on the university level also like  all other departments excluding uh including the humanities and also the science computer this thing we can include all of them  but then that will consume lots of time and after december  please no more active activities only   i know studies are there studies are there  this is m a part two with final year  and after this i will be thanking god like anything if i just complete this m a with good marks  sonali don't worry you'll complete it  i hope i really hope i scored pretty good marks in my first year but i don't know what is going to happen in second year  you will score yaar believe in god work hard  hey speaking of this uh m a and what do you plan to do after m a ? now let's see i'll just finish my m a  and then god knows  god knows are you planning to get married or something  i don't know probably may be laughs  may be of course fifty percent of the class girls will be  married by the time m a completes up  anyway i i have in fact planned about doing i a s now my parents wanted it and in fact first i was thinking of becoming a lecturer only but then something happened and now  i am going to sit for i a s  married yeah   vow  i think you can be a lecturer better   yeah that is it is a job and it is the profession i love  i love to teach but let's see what happen in the future mean net and set are to big hurdles that are standing in the way  in i a s also similar one word   oh   but they are channel uh  challenged i think you can accept the challenge  i can let's hope god is on my side and we compete in a proper way  and what about you like you are doing a computer course now-a-days yeah right now i am doing my computer course so so after the m a i think i better do my computers continue my computers  continue your computers and what about the job or something job let's see  i have my own school like my aunty has my school so i can work over there  you worked before somewhere  no sorry  i worked for two months with a private firm and it was one good experience you know so you have to give a party i think pending laughs  god why do all these people just go for party yaar  you never asked before   because you have got your own money i had it i spent it i have blown it up laughs  this is not fair sonali it is it is in fact it was a good experience the confidence i have in me now to handle different kind of people  i mean people can be rude if they want to be and they can be very sweet if again they want to be  yeah yeah  i think now-a-days everyone needs exposure  everyone needs   isn't it ? yes  that is why i am sometimes surprise to see the girls out here  like when we have a welcome function i was the only girl who danced  two words you know and rest of the girls okay there were another two of them who were going to sing or something but you you ask them to do a group activity maybe a group dance or song none of them come forward i don't know why do they have this inhibitions about themselves you know sonali i always dream that i i could dance like you thanks a lot for the compliment   it's a god given gift i think  thank you so much but this is which is i can only do i think ganpati dance  laughter  that is also true art there you know to dance like a god but in fact i feel i feel sometimes very bad when i see my own  friends gi girl friends oh oh oh i don't have any boy friends don't look at me like that oh oh wondering are you telling the truth laughter  yes a proper truth  in fact it is very sometimes it is very hurting to see them just sitting there like somebody should go to them and then they should be told to do something no initiative   i think they need exposure thats the  lack they are lacking it yeah that is why i wish all of them should work atleast for two months on hand and they should come to see the world properly the feel of your money on your hand is very different  yeah yeah  it is i am dreaming about it  yeah we can just dream  so what are your different uh what are your other hobbies ? what all you do at home ? hobbies okay   like to cook  cooking leave aside cooking is too far from me laughs  kitchen i think i like to roam about  yeah i have seen you do that laughter   then  oh so you were also roaming laughs  no i was purchasing some vegetables for home laughs  then i was also purchasing something no no you were not laughs you were not again chatting with my friends enjoying life  watching t v yeah that is one pass time everybody loves   television  and another thing is just watching cricket cricket i love cricket  that is one game i cannot stand i mean i don't  know there it's come on yaar   why   it's really a interesting game  yaar  they are twenty-two people just after one ball you know somebody trying to hit it and somebody trying to catch it oh  and sitting for three hours and i think you are too boring laughter  no no i am not see see just imagine you sit for nearly two and half hours in front of t v trying just tensing yourself so badly that your fears are standing on your nerves end and everything is in such a halobalo at home of course i have seen my dad
hello sir please sit down here  here   haan  i am m g hegde from kunta karnataka   it's in north canara district  kunta is in north canara district  you might have heard of gokarna  gokarna  yeah my place is very near to gokarna   accha  and you  i am from malkhed karnataka  it is in the gulbarga district and uh you might have heard about the rastrakutas and all  oh ah ha malkhed happens to be ah yeah  happen to be the kingdom  ah yeah  capital uhm capital city of this rastrakutas  uhm  uhm  and uh it is at one time uhm it is said that it is uh it was bigger than uhm it is a big city  uhm of india what we see now uhm uhm uhm  so bigger than that one   uhm   uhm   uhm   uhm uhm uhm  uhm  it was said like that and uh some more historical places are also there  uhm  and uh another thing is that there is uh  math anandi math  of which community  of brahmin's community  and uh you might have heard that there are two sects in  uh among the brahmins only  uhm  uhm uh usually there are many but primarily vaishnavites   shaivas and vaishnavites uhm so acharya whose samadhi  is there so he belonged to the vaishnava sect uhm  and just like how we see in one word  sanjeevan samadhi uhm our raghvendra  swamiji had taken  uhm   uhm  uhm like that the one word say it is   uhm and uh he is called as the tikacharya also  uhm because he had written commentaries uhm on uh  the works of madhavacharya you might have heard about  madhavacharya   uhm   uhm   uhm   uhm uhm  so in this way that malkhed has got its own importance uhm as being historic historical uh see spot as well as uh religious sort of so  uhm   one word uhm  well malkhed is mentioned in in many of the history texts yeah  but uh my place is not so the history of north canara   haan is not known at all  though uh probably uh from the religious point of view gokarna is rather known but for the bu but for that history of the place is not really uhm uhm yet yet to be explored you know  haan  uhn there is lot of scope for uh research  for research  researchers because there were many kingdoms small chieftains  chieftains  uh belonging to the vijayanagara empire uhn  uhm chintanani you must know that one time it was chedas stronghold two words was chedas stronghold   stronghold yeah  and later uhm when swadhi kings acquired the area uhm mm they they were brahmins mainly  they convereted all these jaina temples into uh  into jaina uh viharas structures  vihars into temples  temples   vihars  in fact it is said even gokarna mahableshwar temple is one such jaina architecture   one word   o one is one is not very sure of it but   lot of research is uhn uhm is going on now-a-days   ah ha but uh and also pre-historical monuments are found in the area  that way it has acquired lot of significance ah  from that point of view histo point of view of historical research   uhn   uhn   ah ha   ah  by the way where do you work  i am working at malkhed only  malkhed there is uh one factory rajashree cement you might have heard of it oh rajashree cement at at rajashree cement uhn  and bharti vidya bhavan has two words   one school there uhm and i'm i'm  working in that school   hey arun please sit down   uhm  uhm  and uh that malkhed is very nearby uhm  it's seven kilometers away from malkhed   uhm  ah ha  so even at malkhed also one basti is there jain basti uhm at malkhed  and uh in that jain basti there are some models of uh ancient bastis   uhm  uhm  it is uh totally neglected by the department of archeology uhm  once uh i had gone to archeological department and uh  i requested them to take care of all these valuable things  uhm what all have remained there  and the key the key of that basati is given to  one of the persons who is not belonging to that sect   uhm i mean jain  uhm   uhm  uhm  so there is possibility of happening anything at any time uhm  but they assured me that they will they would take care of that one and then many times i took children also uhm  to that basti to show them   uhm  now one uh ruined fort is there fort is there uhm  and it's uh illegally occupied by some of the people uhm there and they have made homes  there they have constructed homes there and one person is living as if he is the king ah and his car you know it goes upto the top of the fort  uhm   ah   laughs  ahn and he has used the the place where the palace once palace might be there and that portion and the remaining part he built uhm an antenna he has fixed it there at the top   uhm laughs  so his car goes upto that top of that uh  mound  mound  what all what all mound is there inside the fort uhm  and uhm apart from this uhm recently one historian visited that uh place uhm  and uh he is conducting lot of research in this regard  he told that that fort it was actually not build by the rastrakutas the fort existing fort  it was build by these kutubshahis  ah ha   kutubshahis so the remains what all are there uhn the partial portion uhm of the fort outside and that is the ancient one you know what i mean by that  it's such one word   uhn   uhm  uhn  the remaining what all we find now that is all that was all uhn constructed by the kutubshahis  but uh inside there is there are some gates within that fort  but there we find that the image of mahavira at the entrance  and all  so it means that some of the remains are there which  are belongs to the rastrakutas  well how many teachers are there in the staff in your school uh we are uhm forty  oh quite a big school it is yes   it's affiliated to c b s e uhm c b s e  its plus two uhm pattern school it is   uhm   uhm  but you have the classes upto tenth  upto twelfth standard  eleventh and twelfth that's called higher secondary school  ha ha it it includes uh plus two plus two classes   plus two classes yeah  junior colleges  not it is yeah it is   junior college and and high shcool   combine   high school combined uh uh composite composite junior college composite junior college  uh uhm something like this yeah something like this  we have very few of them that composite schools uhm  uh partly uhm in one word nearby well here villages are all so near to the uh taluka place you know  they are not that far off  maybe because of that we don't have many junior colleges but colleges rather over populated  we have more than more two thousand five hundred students  more than two thousand  five hundred students   five hundred students  and all sorts of courses are also available   very considerable strength ahn  arts science commerce polytechnic and uh so many vocational courses so these are offered  and staff consists of sixty-five plus fifteen plus fifteen plus eight uhm  such a big staff and english department in the english department we have seven plus two plus one plus one  we don't have any separate departments but the thing is that our school it is uh run by rajashree cement  it's financed by rajarshree cement uhm  and administered by bharati vidya bhavan  you might have heard about bharati vidya bhavan  now this cement factory people have no business over your administration no   that's sort of but local committee is there  uh ha  they have formed our local committee but the thing is that they they are financing  but in the day to day administration administration it is all done by bharati vidya bhavan  so they don't interfere they don't interfere but they have right to interfere uhm laugh  that is there because they are financing uh that's what i am uh asking about  uh  another thing is that it is uh only uh it is far away from uh our locality because it's our kendra  our school belongs to our kurkunda kurkunda also one more school is there  uhm and so one word the transferrable things then you can be transferred no no it is not our jobs are not transferable uh  once we get appointments means over uh  we have to serve there only whenever we get the appointment order if you want to transfer again you have to appear  the interview uhm that would be a fresh appointment fresh appointment  and your service will be not counted uhm  if you seek any  in the private colleges well this transfer business   uhn is possible but one one has to forgo uhm seniority  uhn  seniority  you will be the junior most on the on the college that you joins  and uh but in salary he is protected and but for that  both the management should agree agree  uh this management should be ready to relieve you and that management should be uhm ready to uh take you in then only such transfers are possible  uhm normally uhm well people are not transferred  they don't want transfer now because they can live a settled life   now   only only when the management has more than one college probably transfers are possible uhn or private colleges  uhn  in fact we requested our management to transfer us to  to some of the shcools of hyderabad and let the people of hyderabad come here and serve  what what  what advantage do you have  no because at least there will be a change  there will be a change because uh one way you get uh fed up of the environment  hey uhn because it is uh factory area especially uh factory area and uh mostly polluted area it is uhm so one does not like the area   due to the storm of dust and all so one doesn't like to stay in the area one doesn't one doesn't like to stay there and hyderabadi people are very happy they are very happy or just because kurkund in kurkunda also there is one cement factory c c i has opened uh means set up one uh factory there cement factory there  and our school okay it is also near to rajashree cement uhm  so in this way the totally the environment is  polluted uhm uhm by these uh by these cement factories  how many schools were there in hydera one school in hyderabad i know in karnataka i think all over karnataka only  two schools are there and in andhra pradesh   whereas in andhra pradesh many schools are there  so there there also this factories must be in andhra pradesh  no no what i tell you i am talking about bharati vidya bhavan  uh  bhavan's schools  uh uh  in uh karnataka it is financed by these uhn and else where may be some other  uhn  else where some other factories industries uh ha uh ah  so they finance i understand i understand  so bharati vidya bhavan people have such type of persons only  uhn  who can run the school laughs who can finance finance the school and uh ah yeah run the school so that is the thing  in this way because and what about the salary and other things  salary and all as per the grade  government government central government as the teachers get   kendriya  uh yeah in kendriya vidyalaya  grades are fixed as soon as you get appointment uh uh when the document will be given to you and in that clearly it is mentioned in which grade you are  ah you you are placed you are placed that's there  uhm uhm  and our canara bank is there  uhm  in that canara bank we draw all our salaray so  that system is good uhm well furnished quarters are allotted   uhm  uhm uhm  to all the teachers  you have cinema halls and all  uhn  cinema theaters  no cinema theatres  uh the thing is that they have given this star plus uh cable  it is urban area  or a rural area  it is urbanisation is taking place ah yeah  the thing is that it is rural area only but uh the people are from all over india uhm they are staying here  uhm  uh getting cosmopolitan cosmopolitan it is it is bit like that  so in this way our colony uh aditya nagar is  aditya nagar is just like a mini-india laughs i can say  uh  uhm okay fine 
hello i am usha  and i am rukmini  say tell whatever you want  you studied   studied have you studied for tomorrow's  paper  oh no i have to  and don't talk anything about the teachers because professor patil will be reading about it laughs  i am scared about grammar what about you  i am scared about linguistics because we have to be very specific while writing the answers we have to study the definitions and all that  and i think grammar is worst  but grammar we can apply what we have studied to something yeah but suppose we mistake in the class i will oppose we will make mistakes we will make mistakes however we try good shot  that's what i am scared of  what are you planning to do after you go to hyderabad  after going there actually i didn't want to go  they will force me to go and after going there i have to go to the two words school and attend that uh youth parliament  how many days is the two days parliament  two days   two days   two days july first and second  and you booked your uh ticket from uh hyderabad to  two words  bangalore  bangalore  so when will you be joining school  on uh fifth  fifth of july  fifth of july  and your girl daughter  my girl is there in bangalore  my husband is there mother is there   she is in bangalore  so other day all of us will leave from bangalore on fourth  uhm  fourth evening  and uh then you can't take leave na  once you join there yeah i cannot  i must say in one way i am quite happy to go back to school but then everything will start all at once  and uh we cannot   house activities and teaching tests you can't even take leave exact and once we start we cannot uh no question of stopping in  between also   no question of stop  i thought actually that i would take some days off and take a holiday but it's just not possible you know with  and uh what about your uh that official order regarding the consideration of this no i don't have any such letter as yet for the time being i am only given a letter saying these three days you know twenty-seven twenty-eight twenty-nine i'll be considered on duty  but it seems neeta has nivedita has uh letter   yeah she has got a copy yeah of her letter please pass it on because i have got one copy uh this uma wanted it  yeah  yeah i know even i'll send it is the same letter we got at hyderabad yeah hyderabad  oh then i have given a copy of that this geeta had given it to me yeah yeah got it i had given a copy of that to school  but uh they have to get clarification about that  who who has to get the school authorities  yeah actually what happened was that in my case   because that letter to me it's true  copy yeah in my case what happened know they send this to the assistant commissioner  and then a letter come from that assistant commissioner saying that  uh so many days can be treated as on duty   on duty  so you will be given earned leave accordingly   earned leave yeah   that's what uh even our principal wants to find out but i think they won't find out we'll have to go back and set out start the whole thing  so he is not uh he will not  no no i mean she is not refusing uhm  but uh she won't write to the assistant commissioner   you know i mean unless i remind her   why why   i think she's will do  she will do it unless only if i remind her  how is she  she is okay i mean laughs  no i tell you she rang me i mean know she has sent a letter  uhm  to my house and i was supposed to go on the sixteenth and it was for eleventh standard admission  oh god i tell you   uh ha  now what about the twelfth standard results  god knows i don't have any idea about school result i haven't been to school  i heard that in our shool the highest was eighty-four percent the highest rank  but uh how did you get the news  oh letter  two words  not letter before i came here no i went to our  prinicpal's place and we had got the information from somewhere else uhm  like that i came to know  because i haven't botherd to ring up school and uh  secondly there is nobody staying near my house  still i had asked savita na her son is in our school eleventh satandard  now in twelfth he he could find out from the neighbours and all  but our one word must have forgotten also  everybody so worried about the exams and studies  now today grace madam has aksed us to write that uh   go back  oh yeah oh god that in about uh the  we had suggested actually about practice teaching to  our teachers only we had suggested that that they should have you know first of all some sort of a syllabus even for that  and the two teachers who teach should preferably teach as a pair  that is you know you start off a topic i continue and complete it or something yes  instead of like one doing composition and other doing poetry and thing like that  certainly you can write that again in hour  uh what day uh told was we talked about this to julka madam   study  uhm  and then uh she was telling that uh this kind of a thing would actually limit the scope of a teacher  like if we prescribe a syllabus we will have to adhere to the syllabus and so we cannot uh  true but see they are not very happy when we do poetry  or prose yes isn't it  so why not nea completely eliminate that all together  because one side you also have to see the learners  they have come for some particular course  yeah one word  and you are sort of just throwing anything at them which you  find conveninent and then plus the tutors are going to turn around and say that of what use was this to the learner and at the same no that's what she told when uh  a question was raised like this last time  i think others uh proficiency classes by the faculty members  uhm it was started just uh two years back   it's because of this some other participant they complained about this and uh then they started one word they started this particular  method uhm  because such a one word  so they'll benefit out of the faculty teaching uhm  and notes but even that is not fair no it's like we use them for one hour as guinea pigs yeah  only for one hour they are taught by the other professors  no this way what will happen is we could try out new techniques  otherwise poetry or prose we follow the old method  say we would uh get other variety you know like  writing skills there are so many you can teach them  and you may take up speaking skills listening skills i think that area is big enough yeah no  areas which have not been touched upon till now   it's not really as for two words   yeah you could easily do it and that one month would really help them   it's not only one month it's a three week course which they have  and it will also give us the chance to try out new methods uh i am not very sure how many will go back  even means like i try out some methods but with the time problem always over there you can't always have all kinds of new methods to do cough  so may be then secondly again like we had talked abot having only one practice teaching instead of two  it seems before they had three yeah i know that and julka ma'am was telling that they were lucky because they could take the best two  best two  now here bu but when we told that here we have to take only one they should take but they are not doing that they they are not doing that they want to combine both and keep on the average and people like me who got the first chance do you know it is really difficult for us  uhn that's true  no no no then i think they could you know either start the course a little earlier and give us say three four days to get used to the idea or because though they send you material saying you must get ready for your lesson when you don't know the learners  i know how will they prepare   and not only that they have told that they will help us with the materials if we don't have any materials with us  but here after having come here i don't think uh there was  nothing was available  the library was not available   uhn library uhn library facility was not there  it's a big draw back and specially jaikar is quite a good library  so i think we should have had the chance  though how much reading we would have done is anybody   anybody's guess yeah that's what uh  again classes bit too long i feel five o'clock  is tiring  and what happens when special classes are taken in between uhm some two to three three and all one word very sad thing  you have to go quite a long way from here  yeah quite a way  uhn  uhm it's an hours journey no almost   you have one bus or you have to change the bus  two words  no i have to change because there is no direct bus and specially two words  but at what time you start from home in the morning  today i started at about eight eight quarter past eight because the exam is at ten  the exam the classes were at nine then i left home by about quarter to eight eight  okay because it will be now in the school they haven't started  and marathi medium school timings are different so it's  okay  otherwise it's a problem  like for my own shcool i leave my house at half past seven  what about your school is it near your house no not at all  the same distance my house to the university the same distance from my house to the school  another direction  completely  did you go to main street  no no i have never gone anywhere   you didn't go shopping anywhere  no  i will be going on twenty-ninth twenty-ninth evening  when when is your train  thirtieth  thirtieth evening  thirtieth evening  oh ho so you have to stay one day more  i will be staying in my cousins place uhm  so her mother is here she told she'll take me for shopping uhm and then after that next day we are going for sight seeing what about this c i e f l rama matthew's  evaluation  uhm i think they are starting that uh workshop from  july fifth  something like two words this uma's got a letter my letter stuck in i met rama matthew from here uh she had come here actually  when  uhm during the first week of her  course  uh course  uhm uhm no i didn't meet her when rajni badlani had also come  i don't know who visited that time uh she had gone to one of the classes  uhm uhm  uh  you mean  one word lady with bobbed hair yeah yeah fair very fair   that women no  and uh she drapes her saree like that yeah  she doesn't one word  exactly she's rama mathews she is rama mathew  she is not very fair  she is rama matthew i met her at hyderabad in december when we went for this uh the r p training she had come over  two words  it seems there is a letter which says that this workshop is some something one word you   no but its not compulsory only if you   want you can come   no it's not compulsory but i would like to go definitely but then   i told her i will be in hydrebad till second then she told you stay back for five more days  i told that's very difficult from seventh may i have been travelling yeah   it's really very difficult i am sorry  she told okay it's okay uh any way you have done this much  i didn't do much you know i only did two uh ob  uh observations you sent the second one  i sent both yeah both i sent  but i couldn't observe any uh old class change  uh even i one word  it isn't possible only the new nine  and our school is also not so near to any other school you know and with the main problem is that board exam is on my head  so what happens is i cannot take a half day off and go and observe in other schools  but like this year if i have to do it i will try to be a little bit more systematic  secondly more time that we came to know so this year there will be tenth standard observation also for the new tenth for the new and the new nineth she told the materials will be sent by the end of july uhm no that's okay because you get august september that time it came very late by the time i got that it was settled   i got that even got that two words  even i got in the third week because no pro point in doing that and by the time all the students had left for the study leave and all that all sorts of things yeah so i wrote a letter immediately saying that i will not be there and when i sent mine i also wrote a letter saying this problem is there and the two observation that also the first observation i did in rough thinking i wouldn't be able to manage but it was okay  so i sent it in rough with my report set up and uh second one of course i did  and you get the xerox uh done after sheet observation sheet no no no then 
my name is vina menezes i am from goa  hello vina i am charu from pilani rajasthan oh it's nice to meet you here in the  yeah it's really indeed very nice we all have come so far from our different places to this place to attend this programme  and it is really nice that all of us has come so close here together   yeah and we met each other and so friendly we became here  yeah so you tell me now something about pilani  like uh you know the climate and uh on the on the ways of dressing of   o okay about climate first of clears her throat   yeah   pilani's climate is uh very varying because you know it's a desert desert area oh so summers are too hot too hot   hot  and what about monsoon monsoon we rarely get any rains uh say say in september  when the monsoon is receding from india then we get rains for four or five days and that too very slightly   so nice you know like that hope it was the case in goa also you have heavy rains yeah goa it's raining very heavily and you can't go anywhere out also uhm yeah that is there in goa also even when you go to school or anywhere out you have to face a lot of problems yeah standing because of rain  here there and all   uhm   yeah   uhm  and all the water would get clogged here and there even traffic and all is getting jammed uh uh then you have to wait there till it get ah ha clear and all and what about the summers  ah   uh uh   ah ah  summers are well they are very hot  i don't suppose you have so hot summers in goa because yeah goa is not that very hot you know summer i think that is the right time you can enjoy in goa we have lot of social activities uh cultural activities that time you know  that is the right time i think if you come to goa you will enjoy  uh uh and not rainy season i don't will not advise any one to come laughs in rainy season  uhn   uh uh  yeah  in pilani it's just the reverse you know what is rainy season for others it is pleasant season for us  yeah  so you must be enjoying that season that season yeah september and october we enjoy a lot uhm but summers are june and may and june it's really horrible because the temperatures shoot up nearly to fifty  degrees  so it is just the opposite  one word   ah  just the opposite exactly even in winters it's so very much cold in pilani no and summers are so hot temperature goes to nearly fifty winters temperature go in minus again because it's desert no so so high variation of temperatures  in goa you won't have so no cool winters no  no  yeah we didn't have  cool winter  very nice yaar  so much one word  will you come to goa  yes of course i will come sometimes if god sends me and you too have to come god sends me means what you have you can come no like that yeah that depends when of course i intend to i want to come  uhm  you should try yeah let's see when it materialises  very soon  and when are you planning to come to my place ah let's see not so soon laughter  after another three or four years  so long yeah yeah why there are some plans behind that laughter  may i know those plans uh i'll i'll let you know afterwards  laughter   i'll write to you laughter  okay let's see how and when do you write letters to  and do you have social life there in pilani   pilani  yes social life is there but uh there are not so many parties  uh as i suppose you have in goa right yeah we have too many parties and uh beach shows you can really enjoy life in goa you know  uh  yeah yeah and you must come with only one thing that you know what it is  laughter  and you must have nice company yeah  yeah dancing and   yeah yeah yeah drinking it's very westernised you know ha  highly influence like  accha which is the major religion in goa uh hindu  hindus are more yeah than christians  yeah  hindu uh christians uhm and muslims they are few  uhm  few muslims very few are there uhm these two are uhm so uh do you do the hindus and muslims look uh  one word and christians one word live close by and like they have is there association  close by  yeah yeah yeah   there's no differance as such you know oh yeah and we have different festivals of christians festivals and hindus festival in which we take part you know yeah you take part   you don't feel that differenc here they take part in our functions uhm our festivals and we take in theirs what i know you no   uhm   what are the festivals  ours christmas easter new year  these are the three main uhm so they all come and celebrate yeah we have holidays for our fe festivals and for their festivals also we have holidays oh i see our government is not showing difference like that okay yeah that is one thing is nice  uh and then their festivals like ganesh   chaturthi and   chaturthi yeah and then  uh diwali diwali yeah holi do you have yeah holi also we have uh  so you like holi yeah of course why not   you play  not much but i enjoy laughs looking at them  and what about and diwali  and  diwali also  they invite us and all no and we go to their place even if we don't go to their places they make it a point to get the sweets in the school or wherever it is otherwise they'll pack it and they will give you yeah  do you one word   uhm  yeah that's two words  they used to yeah  distribute them  and uh all illuminations and all everything is there yeah yeah yeah light lamp everything yeah yeah yeah it looks beautiful beautiful yeah specially in the cities if you go no uhm you can really have fun  uhm  and what do you do on your festivals  yeah i know we are having uh uh different clubs like uh uh town-wise or village-wise and each club is organising dances beach shows and all you know  uhm  uhm so you can have your choice otherwise even on the accha yeah we are having different beaches and all no people go on the beaches and they enjoy  accha  uh like we have have cer  we don't remain in the houses yeah yeah and houses no yeah we have pooja  and all these kind of things  yeah  ah we do all that and then you go to church or any other yeah after prayer home yeah we go the church and all mass uhm and then after that we go for discos and enjoy   uhm   go and enjoy  religious part is first and then the other things laughs yes for us no what happens is first of all we have to do all the pooja and all yeah that is religious you have to do that first yeah haan and i think that is that occupies our most of the time  haan  ahm particularly in diwali days they have to do laxmi pooja and all that uhm there so so really if you started seven till nine pooja  and decoration and everything that you must do previous day na  no previous day we never do no because the decoration and all  same day you all do i think uh because no no in goa we play we do the preparations much in advance not on the same day   what happens that we have probably because people are now in service no so they can't do uh before hand so only the day of diwali and all we we don't get so many holidays in between no one or two days  we have major holidays in winters and summer because of extreme climates  uh  like for example we have uh holidays for christmas no   uhm  ten days we have  you know we divide the days  uhm  uhm cleaning of the house or decoration of the house   oh yes making sweets and then for the tailor day uhm everything we do like this systematically and see that you are very much free on that day uhm festival day  uhm like that yeah  oh yes   uhm   uhm   uhm  for us no we get two days on uh diwali one diwali day and the next day same must one or two words holi diwa  holiday and next day uh  otherwise we don't get any  so one day that very day you get holiday so whole day cleaning up and everything then preparing sweets  uhm  okay how you will prepare the sweets means only your family members prepare take part in your preparation uh or some neighbours come to no help  uh   no  we make ours neighbour makes theirs and now a days uh most of the people going in for buying sweets yes by readymade  yes  even that is the style now so do you think all a few words   a few words  yeah that's the problem life is now becoming too much very busy and  very  yeah that's right earlier too my mother used to make everything at home she never bought anything from out now it is not possible yeah because you know every one is working   yeah   accha  okay tell me something about your school where you go and uh okay my school no is very far from my uhm  place i have to get up early in the morning uhm and by six i have to be on the bus stand  and then three four buses i have to change  it's very you know oh tiresome journey  and by the time i reach to school uhm you know what  i'll be and then after when the school gets over also after coming from that also i reach very late uh uh by four  o'clock like that  you must not be facing that problem you must be staying somewhere close  uhm   uhm   yeah   oh   uhm   uh uh  yeah in pilani we have a campus  small campus and everthing is very much closely packed there  uhm like so everything is so organised no that everything comes within that area nearly in two kilometers area whole campus has been made  uhm   everything is there   haan so one word  and uhm everything is close by you just go to our institute we have to go either we go walking or we have bicycle so nice it is yeah very nice we can't do that because you know mine is government school no yeah so even if i have to ask transfer i have to ask transfer in uh government school uhm private schools are there many yeah but uh they are of no use for me because i can't take transfer in the government school in the private school yeah i have to take in the government school because  uhm it is government school  uhm  so it will take some time uhm transfer and all  uhm  yeah and government schools i think are better than private schools that's what atleast everyone says right they say but in goa they have different view  laughs  their opinion is different oh yes it means uh in north india atleast uh because for studying point of view i think private schools are better but uh it depends everything on the headmaster you know if the head is good everything is good yeah that is there because if the headmaster or the principal is very lenient then the teachers are also uh uhm very lenient they do what they want and then naturally it affects the students  uhm  yes so if he is good then i think everything goes smooth  so your headmaster's like ah he's very nice to me  uhm very nice  in our pilani no  it's a private institution  uh but uh uhm and nothing is so much controlled by our director director we have director yeah  even we have in goa two or three words  so teachers it depends lot on teacher how how he  handles his class and all  so we have particular hours allotted to us  manages  we have to go there  finally okay everything is regulated by the director and all the staff authorities but we have so much uh like consciousness   yeah means we have to do good we have to produce good results because finally it reflects by on us that's no how you were teaching  yeah   yeah yeah  yeah but sometimes i feel that in schools that kind of uh  mentality is not see i will tell you you are teaching in the school is better  i'm sorry uh teaching in the college is better than uhm the school because in school there's lot of responsibilites are there  uhm  yeah in the in the college i think there is not much responsibility as such responsibilities like in the sense see you have to do your duty well teach and go like uhm okay prepare or teach and go but in the school what happens you have to see that these students learn uhm otherwise the headmaster will pounce on you uhm however that the parents also come and complain  yeah you can't teach in your own ways you know like you know if they don't know you should tell everything in english they don't understand you have to use mother tongue uhm and if you use mother tongue uh they they understand but the thing is that your language english language is going down you get used to that language you know  uh  uh so because of that way lot of you know difference  i don't like to teach in school i prefer in the college only uhn 
good morning sir  i am mukta mahajan i have come from jalgaon  and uh my city is developing city and we are the natives of that city  my father is retired lecturer  i have three sisters and one brother  ours is the family of teachers  and i have got the inspiration particularly from my father  my father always tells me that the position of a teacher is of a person who guides the society who guides the complete generation  and that's why i have selected this particular profession   it's nice to meet a person who belongs to an academic  family i should say   it's really true sir  and what brings you here all the way from jalgaon to kolhapur i have come to attend the refresher course in english  have you  yes sir  is it your first or second it is the first refresher course i am attending  and i am feeling very nice that i am in the company of so brilliant brains and particulary the people i find here they are really  sunshine brain and moonshine heart   wah very nice  and how do you find the courses  do you think that they have colleges wherever to what you teach in the classes  i think one difficulty is or one uhm shall i suggest these courses is that they are only of an academic nature very little to do with grammarian work in the classes ahn do you agree with this charge   ahn  yes i do agree with this charge because the classroom situation is completely different and we are uh told here about  ideal conditions yes if we cannot really apply reality and while teaching a particular text or a particular portion we have to face lot of problems apart from the teaching itself  yet you agree that ideals are good enough  of course we need them to follow of course we need them   to follow  we may say that ideals will cease to be ideals if they are attainable won't they  yes it is really sir it is really true but unless we have ideals then we will go astray  they do show us a direction  sir  and give us where we have to go and where we stand  don't they  we may go wrong but we we have that particular say a kind of lighthouse yeah and we have to travel in that direction  yeah  so it it's a one word light you may say sir yes sir that guides you on your career yes sir  and how about this kolhapur   it's very fantastic city  for the first time i am enjoying the rain and cold and really thrilling one  and the beauty of nature and the greenery it's really fantastic  you don't have this in jalgaon no no no it's completely hot and so so hot  that it becomes impossible for outsiders to stay in jalgaon during the month of uh april and may particularly and perhaps you find it difficult to be here from your  a few words i believe  yes sir  i i am feeling completely migrated bird you know  do you  yes sir but how is the migration from bad to worse or good to bad well from bad to good  bad to good because man needs water to his to his   roots so that uh as bud will come out and man will flourish  and here i am really feeling that sense of flowering  nice you are paying a very rich tribute to kolhapur  it it deserves sir   and  and what about the historicity of this place  have you visited any historical place uhn ufortunately i could not sir  unfortunately i could not because uh rain is so heavy that i dare not to go outside  lack of opportunity not interest  no i i really interest i have really interest in seeing the sight which are you know well known for historical importance  but due to lack of opportunity   because of the vacation  yes sir but i am i am deciding to visit the places  on sunday some place   there are different forts here you kown   panhalgad  yes sir i know it  you must be knowing this all history don't you no sir  you don't know the importance of panhalgad you don't mean that you don't know it  pardon sir  you don't mean that you don't know panhalgad  and it's importance in maratha history   i i i have read  yes i have read a lot about and i have also asked my friends that we will we will go there but they said that due to rain it will be impossible to go there  and none of them is ready  that is one of the forts you know that immortalise that great partriot of course baji prabhu deshpande  who helped shivaji to escape from there from the seige of siddhi johar at one word   of course   of course  i have gone through the history i had been there  we had a taxi  it was a nice experience going there and unlike other forts it's not tiring business for  haan of environment  haan  yeah  you can take your taxi on the top  we can visit the places in the conveyer uhn and  it's very less tiring job  and there is another place also nearby   uhn  which one  it is one uh two words  i like that main building particularly that statue of shivaji maharaj one word still it seems going to sky from the earth going from uhm to mean place to some where highest place and i really like that statue  one word that  great men do have an elevating effect you know  sir when you look them from the bottom to the top you feel going higher and higher higher and higher  i really like that statue and i whenever i get a chance i go there and have a round and enjoy that greenery and structure and the   atmosphere   that means that means it must be quite an effort for a frail person like you laughter to do all these things it means both things i try to achieve just it's  a kind of exercise for me  and because i need it and i never get a chance in my city to go out and uh because it's so crowded and particulary there are no places in our city  when i come here in this uh area of university it's  really lovely place you are coming for the first time  yes sir  you have never been this side  no  how did you come  by train  by train by train  you must be finding the journey very tiresome very tiresome it's a long journey especially after poona  yes sir  if the train becomes passenger and uh unbearable journey it becomes but i have no other way  uhn which is convenient way to come to kolhapur when are you leaving  on twenty first  on twenty first  the course is i think one word we finished on the nineteenth but i have got the reservation of twenty first  so you are overstaying a little yes sir for one day thanks to one word reservations laughter so that i will be able to visit the places i couldn't ah you will have go shopping  right a day gap  uhm  shopping  no i am not interested in shopping whenever i go to market i buy books only that is all  so you are a bibliophile laughter aren't you  so i would better ask you to go to the mahalaxmi temple  have you been there yes i've been there how you find the temple   it's very lovely here one gets the you say  per perfect religious atmosphere and uh the faith in man grows when we go in the company of that structure only i i didn't i couldn't go inside the temple because i was in hurry but i have decided to go there on sunday do go inside  of course sir  because the one word and two words is very beautiful in name of the goddess outside observation won't do always it becomes necessary to go inside and experience it  and there are lights also there  unless you enter a temple laughter it is no visit to a temple you know yes sir   it's not a place of tourists interest but i have heard that fold your hands and your uh prayers reach to god  they do if you have faith  laughs  there is no need of going to temple just fold your hands  and close your eyes and your prayer will go to god they do  and it will come true  and many times i had experienced it that i couldn't get a chance to go to

money and it has become a white elephant for me now a days and it will take a lot of time  but do publish it  of course sir i will  because it is very necessary for people to know uhm everybodys research is uh his or her baby because it is yes it is one creation and everybody likes to see growing up and spreading   yes  and as the proverb go laughter like the mother like the baby  ah ha

monsoons they are of also very good but it is a hot place and uh like mine yeah  my place is also of the same climate  in the summer it is too hot too hot  while in the winter it is too cold  in summer we face water problem  uh there is no such acute problem at umerkhed but uh  in these days well we are facing that problem in my native place  yeah  because we all depend on tap water supply  from our grampanchayat and it's very irregular and many a time we get water once in a week  yeah yeah  yeah i one word  that way we have one word  very terrific yeah but there are some wells and uh my wife my daughters when they are at my home well they fetch water from a  kilometer distance   that's very hardsome  even many a time i employ my neighbours bullock cart is there and uh we fetch water from that well  sir you just told me that uh the name of your place is umerkhed yeah  it is a village  no it's town  town  uh not village it has got a population of some uh thirty-five to forty thousand yeah  but  in our place uh the names end in kheda  yeah  lonkheda that way lonkheda   kheda means kheda it is uh a village that way  no no its not so 
uh this morning i was talking to you about uh anxiety and  uh my doctor has diagnosed uh anxiety uh neurosis yeah anxiety neurosis yes uh i am prone to worrying and uh it can uh be really very difficult no when there is an event ahead of me like a journey or something  it builds up and any other certainty or any worry you know figures it out and uh one doctor friend said something about the autonomic system and uh my cardiologist says that uh when i have time he will conduct on me a thyroid test  yes so what is that  actually doctor gup anxiety nerosis is not very uncommon disease i would say it's very common but it is not uncommon uhm and this's particularly influences everybody easily is you will feel that you are vulnerable to the evil  uhm uhm whether they are physically weak whether they are uh travelling in a uhm  so to get certain amount of worry and what the term we use of that you set a uh of small small things uh um  so it's not uncommon  and the best way to succumb to it is not to succumb to it   uh um  i see and to avoid it the best reason i will give is that you should think yourself that after all what is going to happen to me  uhm  just as last night i said that i'll get down at parliament street at eleven o'clock what will happen to me uhm  and then immedietly i questioned myself what can happen to me uhm  nothing  uhm  i'll get a cab see and go uhm the best thing to avoid it that you reason it out like then after all what will be the result of this anxiety   one word   what'll be the worst comes then yeah yeah and this only increase your anxiety but if you will reason it out  yeah  that these are the possibilities that can happen  okay i am prepared for it uh uh you know that a woman she is a apprehensive about many things what one can take from me yes oh this my small attache e-acute  case it can go i won't worry about it yeah go and you want my watch no okay gold chain i won't wear no i won't wear i i will not wear anything because physical hurt okay if i've got the cash i'll give it to him uhm that is the best way so that's one way of avoiding one way of avoiding but if you have got this is functional anxiety ah ha but if you have really some uh medical problem that is to be checked for example that thyroid yeah say for example hyper thyroid people uhm they get particular anxiety and for that they do certain tests of mainly that t three t four uhm thyroid distribulating harmones in fractions uhm  and t f h  so those who have got the defiency of thyroid they will have more t f h  uhm  ah ha means that their pituary body is going to uh some extra factor by producing more thyroid stimulating harmones i see  t three and t four are less better indicator but t f h is  good indicator to diagnose early t f h see t three and t four they are directly related with hyper thyroid  so it can have a physiological correlater as well as a psychological one yeah and most of the time it is psychological  so uh you have told me the way to fight the psychological fear  that's my way and uh the physiological thing will require some kind of pathological test  yeah  so i should go in for that  well if you feel that you really may have thyroid problem you should go but for thyroid problem there are one two indications  one is that loss of weight  uhm number two is steep loss of weight yeah steep loss of i have maintained my weight from first   and uh rise in one word blood cell  one word means hundred twenty yeah upper limit of the blood cell so i have neither of these symptoms yeah  my i mean i have less weight but it has been constant for ten years uhm like this  uhm  yeah or around the sixty-three uhm for uh kgs or maybe it's less i don't remember but it is constant  uhm  and and dr shastri you have seen me i don't think uh you notice much difference     no no no difference   and then then there are other things that find  one word in the finger ah ha and then the one word falling here the pro   one word of one word they are late symptons i see but early is the indication of the thyroid rise in the  i see a few words   i see  uhm uhm  so actually uh i have been a diabetic and uh uhm  i had a cardiac kind of uh thing so they made me do the uh this one word test yeah  and they said it's positive which means you know there is some error somewhere twice i did it uhm uhm and uh my physicain wants to do it again an  and maybe i am mixing up several symptoms  maybe that's not serious because i don't get any  pain in my chest uhm uhm so this might be atypical but uh when i sort of run  for example yesterday i had to run a bit to catch a bus so i am a sort of that you know my breathing rate increases otherwise there is no problem and it comes down uh after sometime  so uh do you think i really have a problem there this is i cannot anwer uh yeah say for example after the age of forty or forty-five you are arrested to just uh this is sort of breath like rise rise uh  and get getting up by stairs uhm or running or strenous exercises common people heart is taking more strength that is  two words   uhm  i see and so we diagnose it as a cardiac problems you don't have to wait for angina but if you've two times your two words is tested  two words which means that you've a minor degree of  circulation problem ah ha only a minor degree of yeah and then you are regulating the life uh life in a better way yeah mild exercises if you really two words that vital  capacity you doesn't do as your doctor suggests i will never say that you don't do what your cardiologist said is  yeah you see  yeah he suggested these tests he said first thyroid test  uhm for this anxiety thing one word one word   yeah  uhm then he said another test we will take uhm uhm and if necesary we will do angiography yeah  angiography is the last thing i won't advice you to go through lightly  lightly means i know you will see the all process of that you are really a cardiac patient to go through the uh angiography so that will depend on the kind of uh yeah  results that the one word tests show  yeah  i hope so yeah i am not a cardiologist but i have a general knowledge of a medical doctor something a methodologist i know a little more than uh   but they do  yeah other discipline the set of uh intriguing think is that doctors don't look at the the the fregment test uh you know print out very one word you know  they just look at the summary given by so uh and that doesn't show where the narrowing is no that doesn't figure in the narrowing is and you know that regular test when a patient is really prominent one word of narrowing the process  uhm so that you can see can sometimes specifically in the angina when you know might have cardiac effect  a a and uh in faction uhm  and in fact  uhm   uhm  as a result of the effect as a result of effect but that occurs only in those who have got a serious two words   i think   they will not ordinarily occur in a person who has got minor problems and then there are indicators that the doctor will ask you immedietly to stop  yes of course no no further tests should be done on him or her  yeah  yeah he was uh an m d young and and he was present and he monitored  so i think we have several monitors like heart rate and blood pressure and definitely  but i overheard saying you know if change back to normal very quickly how is it like they accelerate the pace of the yeah  uh the mill  if it's twenty hours twenty uh twelve minutes thing so i think uh six seven minutes you know i was getting restless and then uh they slowed it down   yeah  you see on that question normally uh uh experts the cardiologist should decide but for me i'll not tell you straight way i see see we have not don't being a cardiologist i hope so that i am fully fit to answer this big question  yeah uh if i am faithful to myself but if i am getting this question and it should come back to normal i would say that a few words  yeah you have got mild yeah general common sense you can say right you see  see these days we are getting more and more tests than well it is good that it is diagnosed it  yeah because this should be done when and where the one word  expect    well you could perhaps you know get back to diabetes uh i am a little affected uhm if you can uh repeat i mean uh problem that justification of that one word uh one word for both of us yeah  actually my diabetes is under control in the beginning i had no concept of calories and so on  the usual notion given two words sweet  now uh you know for a year i i joined a diabetic clinic which is exclusive for diabetics  and the doctor you know uh say he didn't say this like i gathered from end to end so that i was not a serious case and also allows to uh go two words go and prepare because the gap between dinner and the breakfast is to be very long  so the whole thing is that uh you should control the quantity of calories that you take rather than uh actual items  so this is under control but i think over the years i have  developed all kinds of psychological hangups and fears  and this anxiety thing for adra adrenil or something you know yeah is discharge of its own  and once or twice i had to cancel my air journey  and uh once it so happened you know that kind of fun as you might have to go to this university to pick up the one or two words  and i said you know i am going to take an early morning flight to madras and then from madras i have to take a plane to tirichinapally and  i don't want to do all these and you know this builds up high  raised height of anxiety and the second that i start booming  and panting and all that  my son became nervous and around ten pm there came a phone call saying are you travelling to madras tomorrow  in those days the airlines people were a some kind of go slow or non-coperation thing  they said the flight is likely to be uh delayed indefinitely i see i said can i cancel it  he said yes  i said do i have to pay any charge  he said no  and immedietly immedietly this thing was over  this is all my anxiety was over     ah   laughs  uhn doctor i think that you should consult a psychiatrist   uhm but in my own way i will say that psychiatrists create more problems than solution  uhm  i know more solution so i said that you try to reason out within yourself that   yeah after all why should you have this   yeah  yeah  it's getting a little psychological also is it psychological uh and uh like uh  last month i was told that i had to go to japan  uh  uhm  it's a rare opportunity and uh i was an invitee of japan government i my passport has expired  i had to get a visa and all that  so in my you know uh waist on the right hand side i developed some pain laughter  and uh i thought it was my being kidney thing because diabetics are likely to get uh kidney and i had no time to go the hospital because i had to go to the passport office and i noticed that on fourteenth of this june when the passport was handed over to me at six pm that pain dis dis  disappeared immedietly  uh  uhm uh but you go went to japan then ah i went to you know because you know i got executive class ticket uh madras uh hyderabad madras madras singapore singapore uh tokyo and then back to singapore i made a stop over in singapore  in uh tokyo myself and nihalani presented they told me deputy chairperson so i presided most of the sessions uh  for two weeks and my contribution was valued and all that  so i really enjoyed it but this anxiety thing occur occasionaly there also  uh 
uhn yes  i see  i was working there in one project yeah for one year   yeah  with whom that uh  uh dr lal  much glad so do i lad  lal lal  lal lal  now you joined here some three years ago  four  four years ago  no three years ago three three and half years you are not going sir  uhn probably  no no not like that physical  no physical i'm alright  i thought you are i am yet differed because of the some problems knotty problem  as a head of any institution it has to be there  loudly laughs  as a head of any institution the problem  yeah you must face yeah  yeah i think that is the first requirement of that chair laughs  but anyway that way our department is quite cool and calm that is what we think yeah students i don't know what staff members feel   yeah  that way what you say is correct  haan yeah there is not much of a politics and uh people are quite cool  even non- teaching staff is good  cooperative faithful and cooperative  but that will become element   that's always prospectus element yes beside it's  very in their way in their own way   yes  yeah  and they erupt some time they try to show there it will solve they want to show that one word in the department  they make sometime   you've worked on synthelysis or electrons  synthelysis not analysis not analysis  what is this sythelysis when the anyway you are going to have your appendix but say for a common man like dr shastri   yeah for a common man yeah  so how do you say intellectual and what is a viva  in a very general term yeah in general term i can uh say there is uh a layer called as ionosphere in the in earth's upper atmosphere  you may be knowing about it yeah if you are uh  i may be if you are studying science yeah no no i have different side   i am in english  no you can so this uh this ionosphere is held by ionised electrons in sufficient numbers so as to affect the radio waves latitude  they effect on the radio valency they have the effect on radio valency  now this uh ionosphere though it has all the ionised species and all  now it's very nuclei ionised plasma because the  air density at that height where this ionosphere is present   but what i could understand is not some physics that's  something your your uh personal things you know like you were in bombay or you were in goa  goa that way we will   that is much indian understand laughs they are appreciated now rather than  but you see their is another side of her life   uh ha  which seems more more interesting  she is uh defending uh uhm rights of these uh one uh rights of women    oh rights of women  or legal no no on the legal side    that's very interesting  on the legal side not on so social side  no even on social side but uh when i was working yeah i was working with one organisation which had many activities of this type  and i have got even uh experience of working with family council and uh legal examiners   haan that's what it's legal examiner legal examiner  then how many cases you have handled so far  uh as a social worker i have handled around eighty to hundred cases hundred cases uhn  because that legalised centre which we had we  we used to have a thrice a week  and you won't believe sir the day we had the office it was  fully crowded on those days since morning till evening  and we were so many of them some fifteen twenty people  we used to sit in one one corner with one one lady and with her family and that boys side and uh husband's side and  her side her father mother and everyone  and that chou chou chou laughs  i see   it's really i mean when you go into that na  we realised that there are so many not only i'm not talking about women but there are so many things in our society which  have not yet come upto that superficial level or at the discussion level and so many supress things within the family they affect individual ways very much  so for example you can think of something which is dreadful event one case which you would call very much far uh uh there was uh there was one very peculiar case uh in the sense that it was from the very low income group  they they used to stay in bombay you know slum kind of area  not fully slum but you can call it uh semi- slum kind of thing and that man he was the only son of that man  and uh he had some three or four sisters all of them they were unmarried  unmarried in the sense they were uh of course they were  younger to him that is why they were unmarried he was the eldest and he was married  uh his first marriage was broken in the sense that uh because of the torture from these sister-in-laws sisters-in-law  and from mother-in-law and from father-in-law  she left him and in that category i mean like low income group they don't go for all these uh legal processes through court and all  the breaking that is the divorce is a very simple thing  they just leave the person and then they go  then he got married to a girl from his own relations that is uh his mama's daughter cousin sister and even then she was having a similar kind of torture  torture means i cannot explain you to what extent that torture was that girl she had to go in that uh common lavotory in bombay in the slum areas there are these common toilets and common bathroom  so she had to go there  she used to come back window she used to call someone  she used to tell them that please give me some chapati  or some bread to eat  i mean it was that kind of thing they were not giving her food  no water no food  and they used to and when we had some people setting it we really couldn't find out what identify what is the problem actually that her husband was a good man  the only thing is he used to drink he was a worker in some factory  he used to drink a little bit  he never used to hit her like nothing  but all this people they used to harass her  then after three four sittings we realised that the problem is  he is the only earning source of the family  and all of them they had this fear that if this person if he has a very good relationship with his wife and if there is a sound relationship fam sound family life there is a possibility of him going and staying separate  oh  so that was the sole reason for this torture to the  daughter-in-law  you know that's a fact  and then we had to complex issues  and then we had to uhm inform her father  her father was in some village  she didn't know the address properly she was illiterate  and then he was working with one sugar factory  so at the address of sugar factory so somehow we contacted some official to tell her husband that if this if this person working with you then we found out his address we used to go to him we informed him so then he came to bombay we talked to him but these people they didn't even allow her to meet him  and there were so many problems and finally we rescued that girl because she didn't want she had the total one word  uhm  so she was sent back to her parents  but one good thing in this case was the parents were ready to take her like  i see and yeah in certain cases they they refused they say that we don't  if she she is married she is to come out of the house and she has to die and she has to come out  that is she is not allowed to come out  atleast in this case they were ready to take her  fine  what we did anything and that man didn't comment anything  he didn't say anything  he had no voice  though he was the earning soul he was treated or or he was atleast he was brought up he started earning very early at early age so i think he was brought up in that manner that uh you know  in this entire world his parents and his sisters is  are everything for him nothing more other relationships are not important  you work so many and uh it was really a i mean it's  very difficult to work continously at this branch you yourself uh  and then you have so many problems of your own listening to all things no then you disturb you get disturb like emotionally  mentally  there is one case in our department right now is it  that that uh different case is it's not a bit uhm yet selfish to say uhm  but the problem is that girl's father came  and got her admission under the v j n t quota  which quota v j  uhn   vimukhta jati   haan haan yeah some nomadic tribe some nomadic tribe  and she went through the waiting list and all that  but according to medical level we have to categorise she got  now she completed part one then part two and she gave  her specialisation theoritical specialisation uhm uhm she is the only one in the batch is it this girl sat for this uhm uhm so i was surprised that uh record uh showing class student it gave uh subject of such a high a few words  then uhm after that she joined  the classes started her father came  then he talked to me one and half hours in marathi like that    uhm  so that lady's father came and told me that uh he he is responsible for her education and uh you know there must be coersive data  and uhm uh and she must marry to a person uhn who is some relative  but who is a uh rock breaker  uhm uhm  not educated  but uh the family relationship required the man uhn the father  to fix that she had to marry that fellow  now then uh but personally i don't know how to solve this problem and she stopped attending the classes now  now she will get marry  no we don't know because she refuse she refused to stay in the hostel though her father is paying the money she got the admission in the hostel  she is staying with somebody in the city  she is uh and uh i i don't think that she will agree for this  she will not agree but she will not study my problem is how do you solve her educational problem   i'm not worried about her  that is uh  as i said it will take uh sometime in the sense when she will uh get settled mentally no that's not the point  when you take a subject like theoritical physics the proper environment in the first week itself you've to study book if it is not so this is not something like you can wait to it's not history or geography  uhm  when the same classmate same group of students are studying one has to study uhm if they miss that bus it's very difficult for them to cope up and adjust  you may say that i'll settle the life after uh  some day has she has she talked to you or uh  no she is not opening her mouth at all  she is so obstinate she comes to the classroom she is dead silent no sign on the face  not even acknowledging presence of others  she is she is slight so stern and strong willed  so she was not like this in one word or uh have you have you found out any sudden changes in her behaviour  definitely much more than she was last year uhm last year she was quite social some not quite but little bit  little bit she has cut off  now she is not attending classes  and if she doesn't attend i've to cancel her uh  admission  but ususally what they say i have to do in the vacation  then the government of india has given thirty percent reservation in this category  yeah yeah that reservation is said only for the government services isn't it  like how it is for other uh  no it may be implemented na say for admissions  for admissions  oh is it uhm why not  not present why thirty percent in the nomination they're  put so and actually for every type of uh activity for group  that is educational political administrative any kind of uh national activity  and muncipality they are having certificates yeah they have held  people are contesting now elections in kolhapur was the first city to  yeah  have a both mayor and deputy mayor mayor yeah that is mayor came under that category  women woman uhm now thirty percent reservation   thirty percent reservation  certain seats were reserved so certain constituency they were reserved for women  so kolhapur is the first city in maharashtra after this rule came  uhm we had that uh election  so naturally kolhapur may be shivaji university may be the first university in implementing this thirty   not fashionable to talk about uh women lib and all that but uh laughter  women lib has nothing to do   i know obviously  women lib is a problem of the west  uhm  here the women programmes i think they are social   yeah they are social more then uh yeah  i exactly i don't know obligation    what are you going to do after completing your ph d  i will try to find out some job   it's always apex kolhapur bombay goa ah nai i don't think that uh i will be in goa  uhn i don't want to change the state but most probably  i'll concentrate in bombay and poona  have you uh taken up any place here in kolhapur uhm so after coming

well ranju we will talk about the procedure of the con   uh conduction conduct of b s r b exam  yes let it be we'll talk about that  what idea we have uh how we are called for the ex  exam  first of all the board will uh give an advertisement in the paper and full information will be given in that advertisement such as eligibility criteria time duration and the date of conduction  etcetera conduct  uh what are the different kinds of text that are to be test in the exam ? uh there are four kinds of tests in the exam mainly uh test of english language uh english comprehens comprahensive  clerical aptitude numerical ability and test of reasoning  uhm i will tell you about the uh test of english language firstly  in that we'll in that english language include  uh e du spotting the error uh completion of sentences rearrangement of sentences etcetera  spotting the error means uh in that we have to find out an error  uh which one is the mistake we have to find out and uh answer it whether it is right or wrong  and in completion of the sentences uh the appropriate word should be selected and filled up in the blank  and uh rearrangement of sentences should be done accordingly uh well next comes the test of reasoning in that uh   three topics are   in the english language  in the en english language you are having a passage also no ? yes we have passage also  uh amo from the passage questions will be asked and  uh   like  like uh the passage will be given and then from that passage we have to write the answers and uhm they will  one word   they will ask questions for you ? yes  uh questions also include the words like this synonyms and antonymns etcetera from the passage only they have to chose the synonymns and antonymns and uh write accordingly  uh secondly i want to tell you about the reasoning ability  it includes series uh analogies and classification  uh series is uh uh comparatively it is difficult from the other two that is analogies and classifications  in series uh two figures will be given such as problem figures and uh answer figures  uh in problem figures four or five figures will be given  and from that we have to chose the succeeding figure from the answer figures  we have to chose the correct one  the questions include such as they will ask that is they will ask uhm uh we have to compare them accordingly  we have to compare them uh according to the clockwise direction  ante-clockwise direction whether it is the figure is uh in the left direction or in the right direction etcetera  and in analogies uh it it is also same  it is also same as the series  in analogies problem figures and answer figures will be given we have to compare the first two figures of the problem figure  and the third unit should be found out from the answer figures   haan  and uh nextly next comes the classification in the in which we have we have to find the odd man out okay then what the what ideas are you having about the clerical aptitude ? uhn  as as far as my knowledge is concerned i know that uh four addresses will be given yes of course uhn you are right  uhn  four address addresses is it is correct na  yeah four addresses will be given  you have to chose uh the in a problems uh problem part  there will be given one address you have to chose exactly the same address out of those five options yes you have to chose  na  and you've you have to tick off it  yes  tick off the right one hey what is the procedure of uh answering the questions in uh in this exam  will you tell me about that that  which  well the answer figure also co means in the questions we have five optionals for each questions uhm totally we'll be having two hundred questions for four test you know  one test consist consists of fifty questions and totally you'll be having two hundred questions  in answer paper also for two hundred questions in front of each uh means each answer you will be given five oval  and in question paper you will be given optionals no in uh which one is the right opt uh which one is the right one no you have to uh darken the oval in the answer in the answer paper  uh so which one you find correct you should have you should darken the oval particular oval uhm and if you want to change the answer you should completely erase the oval  uhm  if you want to change otherwise no you have to completely erase the oval  you should not uh leave uh means there any sign yes uh because the answer papers you know they will be feeded under into the computers you know yeah so they will be fully erased they should be fully erased off and you should darken a new oval  and if you want to uh if you do not have to you do not have the time to erase also you should cross the oval  uh you should put a cross mark on the oval and you have to give the correct answer  our total time duration will be given uh ninety-five  ninety no  it should be divided eq eq yes in a certain manner  ninety-five   yes  yes it should be divided orderly of course first you have to solve english language and then you have to solve reasoning ability uhm then thirdly you have to solve this numerical ability   no i think you are wrong  secondly you shou you should solve the numerical ability ah means ma calculation should be finished off you know first only yeah because uh after after means reasoning after you try after reasoning uh you'll be you'll get some difficulty in solving the numerical ability uhm because the calculation sometimes will uh they will be difficult  uhm  the time allotted will be yes uh of uh ninety-five minutes in that you should divide yeah four four the test equally yeah  yes   yeah   haan  means one word   yeah  you have to complete all the four tests means it will not be nice you know only one test and you should you remain two tests first for first attempt no candidate will face some difficulty  but after they'll get some uh experience they will  it will be easy for them i think you have gone through two times for a few words   yes you are right  and what ideas are you having about the descriptive paper ? as far as my knowledge is concerned i know i'm and i think uh four this essays will be given yes after this  uh uh objective type test descriptive type test will be there  yes  uhm in that four questions will be given out of which you have to select three  three one and you have to express some of your ideas like that yeah yeah i think some and that also only the one page will be provided for each topic  you should uh the topic should not exceed more than uh should not exceed one page  only one page will be given and the languages will be three we have to select uh either we can write in english or hindi or any other regional language  if we are uh ka kannidagas we can write in kannada  that's all in b s r b bangalore you have to write in kannada  kannada that's all in b s r b western region you can write in marathi  also   in marathi also  in hindi also we can write  english hindi or in regional language  and uh the topics such as the you know they are very amazing  and interesting  the topics are such as uh uh what happens if the night is removed and uh  it's a nice topic na  yes of course it is a nice topic  when i when i was given the paper you know i i read the questions and i was totally astonished  i was really very much amazed that i was i was even happy to answer all those questions  i even completed them before five minutes only  and uh next topic is uh about uhm uhm noise pollution  and what happens if uh there is no earth  no no night  no no night and if night is removed what happens sorry  i'm extremely sorry  uh what happens if the night is removed noise pollution  and what happens if the lights are not there traffic lights  you know if the lights are not there uhm the  such an interesting topics will be gi given  uh such as uh could be if the people if people start talking by their ears uhm if people start talking by their nose what would happen  uhm  yes  such a very interesting topics   interesting and amazing  yeah have you seen some of the topics which are given by  our sir ? no i have not seen   it's such a interesting topics were one word  if uh if one word  if there is no water  haan  if there is no food to eat then uhm how can we live  if there is no food and water  no we can express our ideas no ? yes of course very nice  uh some rare topics they are  we can express our ideas on them they are the basic neccessities of our life and without them we cannot live at all without sunlight haan  without moon without star what would happen  haan  yeah well  what about clerical aptitude ? clerical aptitude is the one word  i told in the one word  yes you have told it about  uhn then numerical ability you tell me  numerical ability consist of calculations you know  in that addition easy calculations yes they will be very easy you do not find any kind of difficulty in answering them  but what you have to do is to you have to answer them in time you know  only twenty-five minutes will be provided to you and in that only you have to answer fifty questions  uhm uhm and the space will also be not provided uh the space will also be not sufficient you know in the uhm you have to do the rough work in the question paper only yes in the question paper itself you have to do the calculations  and uh additions will be there subtractions division  and uhm also we have multiplications three number figures  three digits and all  they will be very easy but what you have to do is then we have to do in time that's all  time allotted will be very less na  very less yeah  if you can do our intelligence lies there only you know  uh in ninety-five minutes we have to complete two hundred questions how is it possible  but we have to make it possible  we can we can make it possible yes if we have practice  yes  uhm first we have to practice a lot practice for  atleast three months  daily one word  yes daily we have to solve one or two question paper  means uh previous   one or two question papers is not sufficient uhm we have to solve more than five or six questions  we have to solve all the four tests yes not only one single single test you can try you can solve and leave it off  but you have to if if you attempt for it first you have to attempt all the four tests uh collectively  and uh you have to for af after after appe  after writing all that you have to check whether they are right how many questions you have got right  how many questions you have got right so that you can improve no for that some more test you have full knowledge about it yeah i'm having   how can you  i am having full knowledge about because i'm  uh i have appeared two times you know two times you have also appeared uh vow  then uh what uh what knowledge about uh are you having about the results which is uh the results will be declared just after three months of the exam  uh if the candidates are uhm means fill the application   if they if they know typing uh they will be if they have passed in the written test they will be called for the type test that is the skill test  and uh if we passes that also will be called for the interview  interview well will be very interesting you know  uh in interview first the  i know because i have faced an interview  yes of course i know it  in that interview no formalities will be observed  they will be as free as our parents and brothers and sisters you know  uh first of all they will call us inside and they'll ask us to take our seat  uhn they one word they will ask us with whom we have come and all  and some questions will be asked uh asked on our degree syllabus  and then they will ask some general questions  and then they will ask about uh national leaders and all  but it was a very interesting interview 
hello chandrakala how are you  fine  and how are you you seem to be quite lethargic  oh it is because uh one of our friends here invited me for this uh lunch you know  uh i had a puran poli and perhaps it has its effect laughs  and that's why  yeah  and i think uh that's a favourite dish or  if they invite any guests or anyone the these are few things that they serve   it's puran poli or jilabi  or gulab jamun that oh for eating they are a very tasty but uh sometimes no they will affects affert our health  yeah that's true  no don't you think that uh uh about this food and food habits and all that's these differs differ    now but we are saying you are not used to puran poli  maybe that's why you are feeling that is very heavy and lethargic  but these food habits they differ from country to country yeah generation to generation state to state family even the individual each individual   it depends it depends of on  one's likings and dislikings that is also there and it may be due to climate also yeah and you are not used to all this food yeah maybe that's why you are feeling lethargic  and what else do you think about the food habits over here  here usually what happens no in your area most of the people they will have that jowar uhm  for their food  and uh in bangalore or mysore they will have rice  as a plain food  uhm   yeah  yeah that's true  haan  in north and west all these northerners westerners  they prefer wheat  then from the north or people who will belong to east for example calcutta and all they prefer they like to have  rice yes   that's the staple diet there uhm  but now don't you feel that uh previously it so happened  that those who belong to east or south east they used to prefer rice  those who belong to north and west all mostly they prefer wheat but now people are coming from all walks of life from all states of life due to studies maybe or you can say for their business  or service  and now all are familiar with all types of food yeah they are  and gradually they will be accustomed to that kind of food  when one will begin to live in that particular area   automatically they will be accustomed to that   yeah  but one difference what i find is that in this generation maybe it is the influence of the t v as the mass media  this young generation the young persons they are so used to this or may be they don't have so much time at their disposal now  they want readymade food so they go for junk food  haan  oh readymade the fast food  haan  the canned food all that don't you think so  yes it is there but uh directly they will be affected by  haan that's there the other one as we indians feel that they are three types isn't it  haan   satvik rajsik and tamsik  uhm but uh and what we feel that satvik food that is the best ah see here no in uh karmungra there is one word  yeah  and uh that uh the one word has given the opinions about uh the persons uh above eighty years old uhm uhm  and uh really if we read it no uh i feel that vegetarian food and uh that satvik what you called  satvik food no that will be very good to health  that's  and this is the secret of their health uh in the  opinion of many persons like that  ah ha  yeah actually as a matter of fact we should say that  some people eat to live some live to eat laughs no even we go for that  then as a matter of fact uh what i feel is that sprouted  or fibrous nutrious salad and fresh food is a must for good health  what i feel is that food and food habit do affect our mind  thought yeah  actions  uh our physique everything  because just see when we eat uh this person have said  who eat very hot or spicy food uhn they will be short tempered very one word  uhn they depend one word in sense yeah  there is an assumption  and what i feel the food that we eat that affects our physique also  because uh one can get if you eat very hot this all this fried things and all one is you put on weight  haan  another thing the cholestrol level also goes up  so there is possibility of heart attack one word  then those who have blood pressures and gasterol uhm  eat less of uh sugar uh sorry salt those who are diabetes they are told to eat less sugar  so all these people they are so habituated it's very difficult but uh  but what i feel no uh we people will begin to think up all these effects only when uh we will be suffering from  some disease and all but uh  suffering yeah  but prevention is better than cure yeah that is there but uh most of the people no they will eat what they like even it is not good for health uhm uhm they will not care about the least bothered about but when doctor suggested something then will go on  taking some precaution precautions  actually as a matter of fact the best thing is to have a balanced diet laughs  and what i feel is again about food habit like this  talking food food habits enough yeah laughs still though  what you feel i'm used to all types of food  but still there is a difference one word food of diferent states  for example if you go to calcutta  now in calcutta what you find the accent the intonation the articulation the food the food habits it's something quite differnt from south  there what you find is instead of saying amar they'll  say amor  instead of saying wa they say ba for example for shivani they will shibani  ravindranath they will say rabindranath like that  about the eating habit also they prefer the cheese uhn cheese fish all that flavour  then for rajasthan again i would like to tell that  as i belong to bikaner i would like to say that there we don't have fresh vegetables and one word  so mostly we used to have that samari churmur daal batti gatta papad all these things ghee bhat  a few words  which food   one word i think i presume you are coming from karnatak yeah  let us know something  uh you know in karnataka no usually people will prefer that roti what we'll call roti  it's prepared of jowar and  chapati rarely once in a week they will do it  then rice curry uhm uhm and they prefer more buttermilk milk ghee  not so much butter but they like ghee  uhm in hot rice they like it  uh  in uh mysore no they will prefer idli dosa  then rice uhm  perhaps they can live months together without bread  but we people here no uhm in belgaum district one of two words we can't live without bread   uhm  i must confess though i don't belong to south but still i too am fond of idli dosa laughs  i must say it's very uh it is easy easy to digest these things  then what we have in one word and eat something else for food  but i feel that uh ro roti  prepared out of jowar no and rice it is better than  idli and dosa a day  it will be it will be affecting our health i feel irrespective of all these things some one word  is there  whatever we eat whatever the food or food habits are we should try to develop such habits uh for example what they are  the fresh  uhn ones a balanced diet and extra good one salad one word  it should be nutrious whatever it is  but don't you think that uh our ances our own people no our elders uh they used to use turmeric or spices uhn but uh even for using spices there must be some reason it it had na that it has did have two words besides having some taste it did add to the taste and colour of the food  but it had medicinal medicinal powers also  for example turmeric uhm a very good anticeptic or asofoetida that also helps to have stomach one word  then garlic   haan garlic is there these things too but the colours that we uh we use in uh preparations no it is very injurious to health but inspite of all that we use it  uhn permitted colours laughs  yeah one word so they are  and i think whatever the food that we eat it depends on the like the place where we're staying  the state also where it all these things grow  wherever paddy grows obviously people will have yeah  no   yeah  then about the timings also i would like to say  about these habits like in every family what you find is they have a different schedule   uhn  obviously  so it's better you know in evening one word  if you eat early  in the morning also you should try to eat earlier in the night also if you eat and whatever you eat at night that should be quite light uhn  not very heavy  now many people they are used to accustomed to eat very heavy food at night  that also affects the digestion   it's better to have light food at night and uh  everyday in the morning that's very important yes sound health is essential to have sound mind no uhm  then after all what are your food habits firstly by the way doing a lecture in a two words the college timing laughs  in the morning i go just with glass of milk  uhn or even a bit of bournvita and snacks or so  and what we have is tikla prepared of  wheat  as a matter of fact a sort of biscuit but it's  shallow fried  then i i come at eleven o'clock that depends on the classes laughs  when i return i have my lunch  now lunch comprises of what our habit is or you know say a personal one word in our family  we have rice daal chapati curry  little bit of one word one word all this a few words and all   uhn  oh god  pickles sometimes that one word laughs  though especially i shouldn't eat  uhm then again in the evening we have tea or coffee one word  then at night also we have a light uh dinner same as lunch  and another thing that people avoid is it's very  it's said that an apple a day keeps the doctor away laughter   but what we do many times instead of taking an apple we if we tell our children uhn they are ready to have cadbury  which spoils their teeth also uhn and not for food but  fruit should be one of the most important uh the important uh food instead of one word that is what i feel everyone everyday in any form may be juice or  cutted cut pieces or best thing is to take apple  as it is without cutting it that is what and fruits also you have in different place  different fruits that you have  but instead of that many people they try instead of milk they would like to have ice-cream laughter  but you see they don't feel what the effects after effects or adverse effects they they have  so what do you think what are the fruits that are grown two words   uhn   uhn  we have banana uhm and i i like it very much daily i use the   uhm  another thing what i found find is there are few things which are common whether you go to east west north south  and one word for you all use dal  of course pulses cereals everybody uses curry everybody uses  vegetable salad everybody uses  then in some form or the other milk is used and this food  curd either they put curd or buttermilk at the end  so i think that also helps in digestion   that's a good habit  what do you think  yes that is true  i too use milk in our area also people prefer buttermilk  more than milk uhm i mean the curd and as i told you ghee  but it should not be used too much but inspite of that uh it is one's  liking they will use it laughs  and as far as myself i will have cup of tea in the morning uhm then at nine thirty i will have some light tiffin at one  o'clock uhm i'll have my lunch  and usually i prefer green vegetables bread then buttermilk  then in the evening rice only   uhm   one word  uhn in the in the evening that is at uh in the evening so after eight thirty or nine  everyday i will have rice then curry then uh   one word when i go to sleep i will have a glass of milk  laughs  what i what i think is that these food habits should be developed from the time when the children are very young then one word all the people in the house should be  one word it  instead of getting them biscuits or chocolates or juice  we should try to give them fruits one word or uh  vegetable salad  so if we develop that taste from the very beginning obviously  they will continue through out their life and they can have good health physical health but but now a days what is happening no children  even children are found of parag two words and all these things one word really it will spoil their health  and inspite of that the child as soon as it gets up from the bed no it uh demands for tea only yeah and we can leave without food but uh first we must have a tea so i really feel it will kill our hunger  ahn that's true  and in the morning also one thing is that that's uh  children they have that habit of taking something  but before that without brushing and all then they go laughter  and if uh they eat anything that is sweet  ah as i told a few words anything  so after that atleast once they get up and before going to sleep one should brush the teeth atleast yeah 
so you are doing this work no the project   haan i'm what i'm  doing is he has collected some cassettes and uh how you how the english is spoken in different uh like how do you speak english in classrooms colleges uhm and how do you uh while conversation while conversing how do you talk and all  so he has recorded all those in that uhm all those in the cassettes  and i have to input them just   uhm   uhm   only just typing work you printed out over there  yeah one word  just typing work i have to do  not writing the program and all and execution execution  it's not like that laughs  but uh this these languages what i'm learning  na they are completely different completely different from what  i'm what the work he is doing like  why i asked you is because i wanted to know how you can use those languages  haan haan  like  no you can use them  uh like it is not be like our courses like if you do and all those  uhm like we work whatever theory we learnt uhm  that is actually totally not applicable  uhm  ahn ha  uh in practice practice yeah  you know like what are the metric system   one word on paper  one word   haan haan  ahn  actually it is uh in practice we use the uh foot and pound or those f p s system uhm uhm all those yeah yeah  so you have to convert all those in the metric system   yeah everything is done in one word  and one word and all those things  so what are you doing is very conversion it becomes difficult like  difficult  difficult in the sense you can't be uh if i say this room is three metre uh if any then i can't just immedietly convert it like yeah  or if anyone asks uh what is size of this say this big big column uhm  so i can i can be able to i would be able to  tell him uh metric system   metric system  that will become difficult and common people they  don't understand you have to take paper yeah and sit  yeah  so like that i thought in in practice it will be like theory and practice but it's completely different  now suppose if i go like i have completed my d c m yeah  if i go as a programmer and all what i have to do so that i'll i probably may not be knowing yeah i thought that way  yeah  you have to learn from someone what is to be done and then you have to do that according to it at least you are a one word   i thought like that no no   one word  then what are your what all subjects are you having  uh i'll tell you later uhn  uhm because i don't have have that syllabus right now   what do you mean  like uh what are your subjects you learnt in civil  in civil yeah  in civil uh construction management construction and uh that irrigation and hydro-electrician   one word in diploma one word  then that environmental engineering uhm uhm and applied electronics all those uh designing of sectors  theory of sector like that all those  now again now a days actually you know in america and all  everything is done on uh by machine uhm uhm only in india there is manual work yeah laughs  so now now a days most of job one see is it requires uh this like uh amp ample of plenty of  time   time yeah  it consumes and if you want to do some changes again you have to consume a lot of time over there yeah  so on computer it becomes easy uh like i have seen one paper two words you know this uh we had the programme of the design of uh taj mahal and so we got it making changes according to one word his point of view yeah  there is one knob and you just fix on uh moving it uhm uhm  and it goes on changing  uhm uhm so that give me the inspiration like  uhm uhm i could do all that uhm uhm like  you are doing it on the computer yeah graphics graphics yeah all graphics and uh  so how to like interior also you can do now this so that will be the next step yeah like because this knowledge now now a days what  i'm learn learn what we are learning it is twenty years old yeah  this is twenty years old out of india yeah  outside india  yeah  yeah  so now you want to yeah use it like  yeah  we should no some advance technique computers and some yeah so that and apply it accordingly yeah  that's why i'm uh i want to learn yeah   that's why i was telling these problems are one word admission over there one word  so now it's quite difficult  yeah it will it should be like and according to my point of view i don't know how far it will be applicable  but it should be  yeah  like once you are intro introduced to that system so it becomes easy for you to grasp yeah like you know you have to one word and all those things uhm  you know this was there is uh little bit of uh computers uhm  like just a basic knowledge and uh some small programmes and all like to design structures road traffic and all  you know i don't know any thing about these one word   two words  uhn that only manual just theoritically   one word i know but uh regarding deep knowledge i am not having about it  one word  so flat now whatever flat designing and all actually if you start uh calculating the designs structural design of the building uhm then it becomes like uh taking all the loads and all accurately  uhm   uhm  uhm uhm  it becomes very difficult  two words  and also it takes long time long time  so with on on computer it will be able to computerise   you're able to computerise  computerise everthing now  yeah what you all have done in diploma one word   it's good simultaneously doing b e in civil like it's useless just doing going on doing the same yeah yeah if you do something yeah  what all a few words  now when af after completing my b e i  shouldn't feel that i should have done computer  now everything has been computerised yeah  so i'm lagging i shouldn't feel that i'm lagging behind like   lagging behind yeah  i should immedietly get a job or i yeah should i should immedietly start my own because actually see now in uh say in civil actually girls are  very few like  yeah  yeah  hardly now this year i i think so i'll be the only girl in my class my god laughs  yeah like that  and uh usually there are no girls in this field so now again after completing my b e if i if i work as site engineer it will be difficult uhm so this year also i saw after my diploma also many of the guys like my classmates they got job uhm uhm but i it was difficult for me because la  they don't prefer ladies like site engineers and all those things yeah and designing then they want all those uh uh this uh technical students because they can uh use them for just uh few  like uh pay yeah ahn two hundred three hundred four hundred rupees uhn uhn  so that is for for diploma engineer you yeah  need something na   yeah  yeah  just can't work on atleast you for experience you can work without taking any  uhm uhm uhn salary or something uhm uhm  but uh you can't just go and yeah  and say i'll i'll work uh for a hundred rupees  yeah  uhm uhm or two hundred rupees that two words  no yeah  so that is two words actually  and even i've seen i have seen many of my friends my classmates only in my class there were eight girls uhm uhm  uh whole year for diploma  now they are working here for just some two fifty four hundred five hundred two words  you are working here  yeah in kolhapur  in kolhapur  now actually my uh some of my friends they have  their own firm  so whenever they need me they call me uhm uhm  and they ask me to come for designing and all even from for letter drafting like we have some mutual relations like uhm homely relation family relation like  so i i do their work but i don't take anything  if at all one word my some some uh min  minor expenses and all  uhm  uhm  like petrol and all sometimes they give like uhn  means like if they take my bike laughs  uhn uhn  they put the petrol and give one word and like that uh like uh   all the maintenance work and all they do uhm like for a bike or whatever it is uhm so i don't get a salary as such because and that too uh their job is like they are out of uh like out field  uh they don't they don't have a office or anything like that this is where you gain experience na  yeah well and good  i'll be whenever they need me they call me uhn   i'll go to their house uhm then they tell me whatever even from for  letter drafting yours is like  yeah ours is like   one word clearly discuss one word and we do  but i don't like a working like like a job and like a boss and uh this thing employee yeah  i don't like that relation like uhm  so it becomes difficult na  there should be a friendly relationship between  yeah  yeah friendly relation  so those uh they have their own firm like not a  one word not a full fledged firm  it is not a full fledged firm uhm  so but just if you say this it is just the beginning yeah  so we just helping them  so sometimes i go over there uhm uhm  so say for six months i have been assisting them uhm  so now atleast whenever they and their main job  one word they do many one word like they have many this one what you call distributorship and one word agencies  and all  so they have to go out  uhn ha  uhm uhm in the morning and in the afternoon and all if at all any  if uh even if they have to draft any a single letter for any company and all they ask me uhm  in english it has to be done and everything english  in english yeah  so my english writing is better uhm than what i talk  uhm  yeah  then that's why they call no you talk well laughter  and over here since we uh after my college uh school   uhm after uh tenth  uhm  uhm so ever since uh my since eighty-nine i have not spoken i have not spoken english or kannada to anyone why with anyone here  why why like in the class in my college like uh it is some what odd yeah  or people think uh talking in english is somewhat  yeah showing off yeah showing off laughs  so that accent is losing uhn here you lose  yeah   two words  when you have uh some when you learnt any language or something you should have a mastery if you are in contact with it  if you are in touch with it then you'll have the mastery or hold or you get an accent or like that  yeah   yeah yeah yeah  yeah  right from the one word school days itself now see   one word six years have passed uhm yeah i think yeah six years have passed  so over here everything you are an english medium student i think yeah english medium then you should be in touch with english language yeah but over here they literally no one speaks in english yeah  everyone speaks   one word pure marathi  generally every time even kannada i'm literally i am forgetting everything laughs  and i actually it's becoming difficult for me to read yeah  because i have i have never read anything since after my you learnt it kannada language   yeah  i had a subject no one word two words    two words  from eighth  from eighth yeah  some fifty marks uh something like that  third language  i scored thirty-three in it out of fifty 
i am mr b n patil teaching at the balasaheb desai college  patan  i am mr a y shinde uh i'm lecturer in english department of college patan satara district  well mr shinde uh nowadays we give importance to  marriage  what are your feelings about wedding  what do you say about  about marriages marriages can be of two types  one is uh arranged marriage and another is uh uh love marriage you can say  so modern one modern version  and the previous uh uh in uh bygone days it was the arranged marriage  okay you  uh these days people prefer the love marriage or the  uhm uh other types of marriage where the expenses will be minimum  but middle class that the people particularly in satara sangli or kolhapur district mostly they demand dowry  is this so uh is it uh a fact or it's only yes it is a fact  but uh it depends upon the girl  if uh the girl is not very beautiful uh then they expect more money they ask for the dowry  and so if the boy and girl are of uh equal status  if uh both of them are uh uhm uh they like each other then  there is no question of dowry as such  but if there is no question of dowry then why is that the people go on demanding more and more from all the people all of us will you uh in particularly ah if you are from a marathi community okay  will you tell me something about the community that too  on the dowry   ah   community  i know i am from maratha community  i am from uh sangli district  uh this here the people have got into the vicious circle   uhm in the sense that uh this uh they give them dowry to their daughters uh while marrying them  and later on when their boy becomes of a marriagable age that time they want the return  and so they demand uh the dowry  so that is the problem  uhm  is it because of the social conditions  no yes something else  yes  what is it then  uh  well why is that the dowry system has become important nowadays  uh one thing is that suppose that girl uh girl's  father or the parents are rich uhm uh and they want their daughter to be uh settled in uhm uh or sent to another uh rich family uhm  then they don't bother about the money  they are ready to they are ready to give the dowry  uhm   uhm   uhm   but  nowadays it has a become a problem the dowry has become a problem one word  yeah  why why because even the educated people uhm  go on demanding they need fridge they need scooter sometimes they demand uhm car or what they call the television set and all these things  uhm   yeah   uhm  yes okay what is the use of the education then  no that way the uh uh there is no self examination or introspection as such  uh most of the people are tradition bound uh and because of that they go on uh uh accepting the dowry  well is it the dowry are we going to be are we going to  get everything what you want  yes uhm they ask for money and they ask for the  no it is well it is said uhm  uhm that nature has everything for man's need   uhm  but there is nothing for man's greed  what do you say about it   uhm   uhm   yes there is i agree with you  because there is no limit to the greed of the man  and uh if another party can afford to give then the another party goes on asking for for more and more money and uh the and something in the form of articles and things well there are some people who act as mediator yeah they are called match-makers they are called the match-makers match-makers well what are what are your impressions about these match-maker how they work uhn what they do exactly   uhn   it is very uh interesting role they they function  uh uh they knows know both the parties uhm and uhm most of the time this match-makers they are relatives of the uh one of the parties uhm  or sometimes they know the both the families uhm and they take it to be a uh good work uhm it uh you can say it a social work uhm  or community work uhm  they want to help in one form or another form uhm  and uh this marriage uhm uh uhm uh it's  a tie the holy tie uhm and they want uh that both the parties should come together  uhn   uhm   uhm   uhm   uhm  uhm and if uh it becomes fruitful uhm they uhm  uh they themself themselves become very happy and that is why uh sometime sometimes   they spent the money on their own  uhm  ah and see to it that both the parties come together  uhm and uh they get married the boy and the girl uh get married   uhm  so in ancient times we have heard of some people or wo women chosing their husbands yes what is they call the swayamwara  uhm okay it differs from yeah this marriage that is a marriage system uhm means she had the right  to chose her husband  yeah   uhm   haan  that is according to her wish what do you say about it  as if swayamvaras nowadays or the people are simply making their daughters obey the orders   haan these days uh uhm the daughters don't depend mostly upon the uhm parents  they have also some some say in the matter  that if uh if the daughter doesn't like the boy uh her would- be husband then she uhm tells the parents that uh she doesn't approve of that boy  hence uh she tells or she is free enough to tell  the her parents  well is it going to be the marriage of uh two minds  or is it going to be the marriage of the economic status of the two families well in arranged marriages it is not the marriage of two minds yeah  wherever there is uh love marriage it is a marriage of two minds   yeah   uh  well it's plenty out there that  love doesn't cause the way or they can one word   yeah  yeah  well but now at least we find people changing their minds yeah taking divorces and uh marrying remarrying again  taking divorces  uhm  yeah  why is it so  what has happened  what has changed the whole society or a few words  uh previously uh they thought that the marriages are made in heaven uhm and uh uh they have to continue this sacred tie  they have to remain husband and uh wife till the end  but uh so far god has been uh uh driven away from this world  nobody uh uhm nobody is afraid of god or nobody believes in religion as such  and so they think that uh if that marriage uh doesn't make them happy then they uhm they take divorce or they behave  according to their own will  well is their life going to be happy in the end or   afterwards   what what what are your observations one word  the people those who have taken divorce you see them one word living uh isolated life or   nai see if a few words  unsuccessful marriage unsuccess marriage yes  uh in if the husband and wife they are not happy then  it's better to quit and look uh for another partner  uhm if they think that uh they will become happy  otherwise uh it will affect their children   uhm  so perhaps if they go away from each other  yeah and live uhm uhm independent lives so what's going to happen to their children   yeah  now that is the question  sometimes uh uhm the court if the if the matter goes to the court the court can uh uh come to the help of the children when the uhm children are below seven years then they are uh kept with the mother  and after that it's the duty of the uhm father he is free to uh take the responsibility of the  child   so what the tie means is the love  not the property  yes  up to what we have call the materialistic yeah  it's not the material uhm topic   uhm  what is to be done about that one  you see that is why the court insisted that uh upto the age of seven uhm the child is allowed to be kept with the mother and after that uh uhm the father can claim the the children  because it is uh his responsibility  uhm  yeah and he is also able to uh bring them up properly or help them in a materialistic uh one word   well it's so i i if they have the law of the land is that we can take divorce so we can live uh independently also that's  true  but is it not the duty of the husband to take proper care of the girl  yeah   uhm  yeah uhm because it is the faith of the father  that his daughter will be safe yeah in the hands of this particular person  but it is not observed nowadays  why so   yeah  sir the reason is that uh the father sometimes he is unemployed uh and uhm he has no time and uh he cannot take uh the proper care of the girl  and so he has to keep her in the hostel or some uh some other place or with some relatives  and the the daughter cannot become happy no no that's not my question you see  one word if one word his daughter marries a particular person  one word  ah ha i see he thinks that he is a right person uhm who will take care of my daughter  uhm  yeah  but his dreams are shattered yes shattered by what does he dream whether daughters or father dream  uh   haan  the father of the sir father think that uh he has made a wrong choice or his daughter has made a wrong choice  and sometimes say it it happens that the uh two family  uh backgrounds they don't match  or the the culture of uh both the families doesn't match  and because of that the clash uh takes place and uh both the parties get separated  for the they live uh unhappy sort of life  well what can be done about it   what's the solution  what do you think about it  well the only thing is that uh if uh the husband and wife wants to be in uhm happy then they should uh cooperate each other  they should not uh uhm be selfish and uh they should think that it is the duty to see to that the marriage becomes successful  and they can make conducive or happy atmosphere in the family so that the the children they will benefit by that atmosphere how can that be achieved first they must understand each other yeah  well that's what we we say but the religious man those who are there yeah that their lives are  uh bound by sanctity or by each to each uh by bounds of  nature or by yeah uh uhm religious views  yeah   yeah   yeah  uhm  but nowadays it seems that the people do not trust  uhm god god god god as well  or even they do not uh believe in themselves what they are doing exactly  means the life of the people has uh become uh sort of disorderly life in the sense now they themselves do not know what they are going to do uhm or what's going to  no but happen  yeah   uhm   no but   one word depend that her father mother  or the husband and wife uh need not depend upon god or religion all the time or tradition all the time  that uh they should uh uh continue their their affection  uh for each other  and so that if they love each other then there will be uh no trouble as such so it is a love that is a binding spirit   yeah binding force  binding force   or it is a tie  it is a ah ha both the parties can be united uh till the end  of their life  okay so now it's about the maratha families or what we say one word now they are married in uh in some gujrati family or the marwari family or some jain family or some  one word family yeah what do you say about it  hey what what are your observations   yeah   yeah  now as far as marriage from maratha community are concerned  most of the marriages are arranged marriages  arranged and uh they i it is uhm long process or long business you can say uhm  because uh first of all the match-maker  plays a very vital role very important role  uhm  well  and he sees to it that both the parties come together uhm  and uh there the the girl's father   uhm pays a visit to that uh boy's house  and uh he talks about the marriage  he gives the invitation you can say  uhn  okay  uh to come to his house uh and see the girl  one word and that ceremony of showing the girl uhm  takes place  and uhm that boy also comes uh and before that uhm everything is discussed  and if the boy and uh parents of the boy likes the girl  then they uh show the green signal  and uh later on then uh a a formal ceremony takes place it is called engagement uh that ceremony is called engagement   one word   uhm  well now you talked about this match-maker it's true then whether th match-maker particularly intents to uhm  uh contact two families which are   uhm   yeah he knows the fam uh both the parties okay

where do you finish your exam uh your education ? in kolhapur itself ?  i finish i finished my graduation in  nineteen eighty-seven and then uh i completed my post-graduation as well as m phil in this department department department of english  shivaji university kolhapur  i have done my m phil work uhm in nineteen ninety-four uhm recently   in the subject recently in the subject of social realism in mulkraj anand's major novel so you were planning to become a lecturer only ? yeah  yours is a planned uhm it's a planned  type  yeah  yeah planned like  you wanted to become a teacher or a lecturer ? lecturer  means lecturer and so you completed this course yeah  mine is a different case  why ? i never wanted to do any kind of job  but why ? no that was my thinking earlier before say ten to twelve years i was thinking in this way  not to do any kind of job to just to run a home to be a housewife only  uhm  to do all the things and have cook the food clean the house pots clothes etcetera  but later on somehow uhm my thinking changed and i continued my study until i passed my m a i was not thinking of becoming a lecturer   but how do you   uhm   it's not my case  after graduation i was thinking   it's only that to become a lecturer   accidently that i became a lecturer  no one was hoping about me  no one hoped actually it means my relatives our uh cases are totally different  totally different two poles apart   one word  so what happened to me is that upto m a this job is i'm doing this job accidently only  it was an accident i became to be a lecturer and i am continiung   where are you working ? i am working in willingdon college sangli  uhm  at present i am teaching the p g classes as well as the u g classes uhm i am only teaching the u g classes 
so it's a kind of marathi influence on me so you had uh how did you begin your education where oh mine i told you my village is very small and we had education only upto fourth standard  so then after fourth standard when i was nine years so i had to go to a nearby town taluka place uhm uhm  so three miles that is about five kilometres everyday we used to walk in the morning and return back in the evening like  that  and sometimes so we were nearly twenty persons uh uh  fifth standard sixth standard seventh standard eighth standard like that  so all of us together we we were going to take a room   uhm and uh on rental basis stay there and turn wise everday some persons were coming back to village and collecting our tiffin and bringing there  so that kind of living  uhm   uhm  so it was of course sort of cooperative oh yeah yeah laughter  living together  no it is very funny so it enlightened my life  in the primary and uh high school  so uh i i cannot forget it so   and after that  after finishing your secondary education  uhm uh after secondary education the college was uh available only in bagalkot uhm so that was about thirty miles away from my place uhm so naturally i had to go to bagalkot  and another place was dharwar  so dharwar was bit away so i had to go to i did my this uh  so you did it in bagalkot  and where did you stay in bagalkot bagalkot uh in the beginning uh you know i i had felt home sickness uhm  so only because of for the first time i left my family and all that  so in fact i didn't want to continue my college and i wanted to go back  and i went back to my village  and then my father was so much interested in education though he was uneducated  and he wanted me to educate  and uhm i was okay and i was considered to be somewhat intelligent and as well as and uh so my mother actually came with me  and for one year she stayed with me she stayed with you yeah and that's how then uh so after one year passed you know afterwards i became acquainted with with the  became  got accustomed to living in bagalkot  accustomed  then then i started staying in some hostel and some  pri private apartments like that  okay  and how many brothers and sisters you have uh i have that uh two brothers  so including me we are three  and uh two sisters  so i'm the youngest i am the youngest one  youngest  uhm and uh my eldest brother is uh taking care of this uh uh uh  agriculture  yeah  and basically we are agriculturists  and my middle brother he was a school master  and very recently he retired as a head master of a primary school uhm  and my two sisters they are married to some uh village people and they are alright after all  did you do your m sc also from bagalkot no there m sc cannot uh we in karnataka you know  the p g is only at the university centre uhm  so i had to go to dharwar for m sc  there also you stayed in the hostel  yeah i stayed uh in the hostel and immedietly after your m sc you took up teaching  yeah i uh in while doing m sc so there was uh uhm a special provision for some of the students they used to give uh uhm uhm a a piece of research work  uh that minor research we used to call  so in the second year of m sc i was given a piece of research work and i was assigned to one professor dr rajgopal uhm  and uh so i worked with him for minor research  and uh in that year i came in very close contact with dr rajgopal so i promised him to continue ph d with him only  so after completing my m sc i joined dr rajgopal sir for ph d  do you get any scholarship for doing the ph d   yeah i got uh c s r some two words  to start with  and after two years i got this u g c fellowship  and then after completing my ph d i stayed in nineteen sixty-seven i got my ph d degree  and i stayed there uh since i was married at the age of twenty-one only because my mother wanted to see me married uh because she was almost ailing uhm and uh so because of that i had to set up in dharwar   otherwise otherwise i would have gone to some other place outside the state poona like that  uhn so after uhm after getting my ph d in nineteen sixty-seven i got three fellowships one u g c senior fellowship c s r senior fellowship another i i t senior fellowship from kanpur  uhm  uhm i would have gone to kanpur and made a very good career  but uh because of marriage i couldn't go  so i had to stay back in dharwar   stay in dharwar yeah  and for two years i was there sixty-seven to sixty-nine as a  two words  and later on you know with great difficulty because i'm  coming from a agriculture background and no godfather so i entered the university as a demonstrator  and three years i was a demonstrator then with great difficulty i got a lecturer's  post  and i was sent to gulbarga  and after that i had no problem  i'm coming up from my own laughs   lecturer  yeah on your own yeah  and how many years you have been visiting kolhapur  uh this is my third visit to kolhapur and uh once i came here for examination work  and once uh to participate in a conference which was organised by the chemistry department of this university and now this is third time  do you understand marathi  a little bit  because uh i i it's uh i'm from  the bombay karnataka uhm so there are quite a number of people speaking marathi and uh as i know hindi uhm which i can speak  and so there are many common words in hindi and marathi so i can understand uh though i may not speak uh in marathi  uhm  no how did how did you learn hindi  so hindi it was compulsory for us in uh in the school yes yes in the school uhm  and i passed the rashtrabhasa  uhm  out of my own interest uhm  so since it's a national language i felt i should you can read hindi  oh yes sir means you can read marathi also   yes hindi i can read hindi also so marathi and hindi  oh yes script they are the same i can read marathi without any problem and i can understand also  as the one word same  uhm  but uh speaking is a problem and uhm  tell us something about gulbarga  uh gul  and how big is the city  gulbarga is quite big  and it is a divisional place and uh the population i think somewhere around three point five to four lakhs  and uh uhm because of this uh uhm there in that part of karnataka uhm there is no other big city uhm and uh there are several colleges and educationally uhm that is a very well developed this i can say and there is a medical college  and there are two engineering colleges  and there are so many colleges   private colleges or uh government colleges yeah both of them are private colleges and uh and the medical college also is a private college  medical college also a private college and uh engineering college one of the engineering college they started long back and it is  uh i think it has got grant uh this though it is a private college and there are several pharmacy colleges  and uh science colleges and women's college like that educationally i think uh uhm  when when was the university in gulbarga was established yeah it started as a post graduation centre in nineteen seventy-one of karnataka university   karnataka yeah yeah karnataka university  and initially they started uh two or three departments  kannada english uh that's all uhm  and later in this nineteen seventy-two they added uh some more departments chemistry department then uh this uh mathematics department were added  so i went in nineteen seventy-two  so we were uh so gulbarga has been a university for the last twenty-five years no no seventy to eighty upto eighty it was part of karnataka university as a post graduate centre   centre uhm  so only in nineteen eighty it became another university  along with mangalore university  so mangalore and uh gulbarga   yeah gulbarga are of the same age were established as university in the same year  yeah in the same  yeah same year  so it's a only a fifteen years old university yeah fifteen years old  now do uh does the university have departments like uh nuclear physics or computer science yeah  bio-technology  yeah  yeah  sir we have uhm uh almost all departments the the the master of computer uh uh i think m c a course uhm so that is there and our vice-chancellor since he is the uh person from mathematics and computer so he our present vice-chancellor  he's invested lot of one word computer science and m c a course is there and we have got bio-technology course also  and uh nuclear physics uh there is this department and there is a separate applied electronics department  so in physics department i don't think they have nuclear physics  so they have solid state physics and one word   how how big are your physics and chemistry departments  chemistry is very big uhm  so we have uh about twenty-one staff members uhm twenty-one staff members  and we are educating every years fifty students  we have got five branches organic inorganic physical  and medical and pharmaceutical uhm  and also for each branch we are admitting about ten students so in all we are admitting fifty students  so that's a very and first year fifty second fifty we have got quite a number of ph d m phil and p g students   it's a very big department and what is the procedure of admission in gulbarga university  sir the admission procedure is uh almost uh uhm government type of procedure  sir we strictly go by merit and uh following the one word  system  and uh we conduct the entrance examination  so uh university   so even even students from your own university have to appear for the entrance examination   oh yeah definitely   definitely and uh  one word  sir mostly you know the the seats for uhm post graduate seats are mainly allotted to this uh students of affiliated colleges uhm  outside the university students hardly one or two seats will be uh available for the year   yes  so most of the seats are for only affiliated college students  so uhm immedietly after their undergraduate examination b a or b sc or b com sir we conduct the entrance examination  and uh so we have evolved a formula uhm about seventy-five percent weightage is given to their uh first class degree performence  and twenty-five percent weightage is given to entrance examination  so both together we uh prepare a merit list   uhm   entrance examination   merit list and then according to the one word system we allot seats  is the medium of instruction at the graduate level  english or kannada uh as i know in the science uh there is no medium of kannada in uh in almost all colleges it will be only english in the science uhm and uh in arts i think  in one word and arts it is kannada   one word and arts  yeah they use kannada  and uh students are allowed to write uh uhm either in kannada or english uhm and even in science also that provision is there  but none of the students they write in kannada   they're since they are taught in english   uhm so they will answer in english  uhm   uhm  english  and how many students in all are there in your university  uh i thought there but it is not a constituent colleges i am talking about the post graduate uh department  oh yeah so yeah we don't have any uh college uh run by the university uhm so only the uhm the p g uhm uh courses are run by the university  and i think uh that must be somewhere around fifteen hundred  uh students i don't know the exact strength uhm but it is uh somewhere around fifteen to fifteen hundred to two thousand  so in that range yeah and uh government of uh karnataka  gives all the grants and the u g c also gives the grants yeah so but beside these two funding agencies are there other agencies which also fund the programmes in the university  yeah there is one uh this hyderabad karnatak uh uh development fund they have uhm the the karnataka state in order to develop that hyderabad karnataka area so 
ah like we were talking about the hostel  yeah  now what is the system of the hostel uh  system system is all corruption you see laughter  better we should you see we say in punjabi one word   laughs  better we should not talk about the corruption  no what i am telling is i am staying in the hostel  and it's the vacation time  yes yes  ah ha ha so there is no rule to for students who stay in the hostel there is no time study for one word  ah ha ha  since i don't have any study one word so this is all that uh yeah which we say in punjabi uhm uhm  somewhere then you might generally like uh we have heard about uh the electricity usage  uh we can use uh what uh this kind of uh apparatus  or uh we can use or not like heater  and some boys use it and uh some some are allowed and some are not allowed   appliances  depends laughs uh upon his relation with the warden yeah  yeah well like uh i think heater taking heater is not the useful now a days because uh in the bathroom they have geysers now a days  geysers are there uh one geyser for twenty boys for twenty boys   for twenty rooms  ah ha ha  and uh there are twenty boys and geyser you can initially get two three buckets  and after that water is cold   water is cold yeah so   that's the problem more than we get ready within time before nine and may be sometimes geyser is working right or sometime it's uh   nei it's no problem  ah ha  actually department is okay  ah ha  but uh you can have two three buckets after that  it's all cold water  right  that mean uh cough most of the students uh needing this kind of heater electric rod or something like that  they think their bathing is necessity not luxury  laughter what warden says ah yes  so what kind of uh uh fine they put  fine is according to the appliances  means i was using uh heater plus rod ah ha  plus two tubes plus two table lamps  ah ha and uh laughs uh one thing more stereo and t v ah and t v everything was on ah ha and i was sitting and reading magazine   ah ha  okay lucky you have social room  warden came laughter warden knocked at the door and i just opened the door uhm  he said what are you doing ? then he saw the  as a kind of fine they charged some amount of money  fined he  he fined me rupees five hundred but i paid nothing laughs  he must have a this is what i told you earlier depends upon the relation  yeah ah  uhm uhm uhm  so vehicle is not uh in the rule i mean you can have it not  scooter or motorcycle or car you can have anything   these things your personal matter it's  not a hostel matter right  i mean that like uh there is no such parking problem or some no there is a  garage problem or something no no there is  one word some boys have cars with them  one word  not uh common everybody some occasionally they get from home for month or two  some  for month or two enjoy laughs  right  and fifty percent may be having scooter or motorcycle  scooters fifty-five students have actually yeah  mostly hostel number one has cough most of the bikes two wheelers  right  since they are a goonda persons most of them laughs  students are there uh because uh when one person is living very near to his institution just fifty metres or hundred metres away from his college or department so he can go on by foot or he he has he has some other work to do yeah  not only study laughs so he faces problem yeah right  everytime you can't walk yeah  and you can't have a bus chandigarh ci city you know how it's working ah ha  you can't have bus even for one hour  yes yes  sometimes  ah sometime you have to go away to meet your teacher for some collecting notes  yeah  or to meet some friends  this is really laughs these things happen really since teacher teachers have efficient way provide everything in the department  oh yes laughter    want to try ? okay  what did you eat this in this uh noon ? noon yeah something you have rice chapati  and one sabji plus rice  rice chapati  uh what quality of kind they gave uh in uh your quality is not that much okay  yeah but for some old students that is okay since they  old students they get uh i mean uh what kind of preparation they prepare it they are well cooked and uh or not or half cooked or something in between ?  preparation  preparation is okay for it depends on see it is uh subjective  yeah depends uh if a person is older yeah  and he is bullish like that  ah ha  so he gets uh well food ah ha  but if uh  taste taste ? but it depends uh preparation is not okay for  in general  and uh i think you go sometime outside to have a  better taste and better food  food  generally  two three times a a week  two three times a week once the routine ah ha   change  just to have a different taste we go to sector eleven  lady market  eleven  or sector fifteen there is a prince restaurant ah ha  that is cheap and best for students  cheap  but might something   we can't afford that much uh expensive hotels like one word  ah ha  and so we go  right  and uh about uh dinner ? dinner is something better than the lunch  ah ha  yeah  so dinner we have a daal and sabji    daal is good  no daal always daal is okay  yeah  means you have desi ghee that you  laughs so that you know that like me that i   oh yes  and uh about the conditions are this year i am planning to be in the food committee i've talked to the warden  accha  right right  so he said okay uh he will appoint four five members uhm we are trying for cooperativeness  yes  ah so if he has the a a all of them like  chapati and daal or chawal  they are well cooked not overcooked sometime or not uh  no this is not the case case is the spices are not good qua of good  quality or the ghee is not of good quality   ah ha   so that way you can't say you can't tell it is really well cooked or it is cooked is okay sir cook he is one word   uh like chilli they use more chilli then you can't tell no this is not this is not the case  uhm uhm chilli they have they have a routine  like there is a joke you know uh when a person went to in a hostel  he was married uhm  and he was uh staying alone  so he said uh hello waiter bring me some burnt  chapatis ? bring me some burnt toast ? he said sir why ? because uh i'm you know feeling sickness of my home laughs  you know i want to have rice at laughter  so you know uh some sometimes uh a married person he want to feel free so he goes to hostel  when he want wants to uh remind his  feel uh bachelor days some kind of feel a new bachelor  i have my mamaji here  uhm uhm  not exactly my mamaji but a relation like mamaji  uhn uhn  so he used to talk to me that food bring some thing uhm uhm  sabji from your hostel laughter  two words so that i too i too want to feel that those old days even then that some kind of things that reminds you some  uh uh when you were young everything is related to laughter something else something else  no while not also not only of food but  something else   you think of something else exactly like that and all  so there in uh those enjoyments so fun   this phase is the best phase of  someone's life yeah yeah   that's what i think  ah  even i don't want to be out of this city laughter  that's why i'm staying here after my completion of post graduation   oh yes yes    you have some two or three meals uh breakfast and  lunch and dinner and  yeah three major meals    yeah what what all what do they serve ? in breakfast uh you get it's upon you  it's upon your taste  you can have parathas you can have bread  butter bread omelette  you can have bread jam  so many things like you feel they'll have in the hostel  or in home  so it's your taste  and you can have tea cold drink milk anything  what you can think of in the in a breakfast  what else ? and uh breakfast you know there that's the place where cooking is not okay  since in the morning there is a great rush  everyone has to go to their department before nine  great rush yeah  yes  so most of the students get ready by eight thirty  and everyone rushes in the mess and canteen eight thirty and they ask for quick supply   eight thirty   that's what has some times we noticed that a  a little more time can be can make it more better that uh  food but this is not possible means uh   right yeah   that's why i was talking how they cook i mean they  overcook see or less cooked  see  afternoon and uh uhm dinner and lunch is okay since they have plenty of time  they are back from their department but in the morning they have to go to the department  ah ha  yes yes  and if they get late they may they may miss  their class  and that  then they do not bother about the taste they have just eat it and rush like that   they don't bother about anything  laughter  this is uh punjab  they have to go those are points where the problem arises yeah  they ask for quality plus quick supply plus quick supply yes yes  uhm even the cook has to his matlab  it depends ke us ke pas uh that material is there  he has to make something raw material and then cook it  it takes sometimes   so  now you have uh completed your m a second year yeah  so what's your planning now ? what you have planned ? i am just two words was there four five old  laughs  i have four five years uh one word  ah ha  but i am unfortunately couldn't decide till now  ah ha  and i i am planning for a teaching profession  i have been offered a job as ad hoc professor of english  in my college where i've studied i have done my graduation ah ha it's very good i am also planning for m phil or ph d  since i have discussed the topic with my professors uhm i don't know anything about the what we have to do  what is there  so i have to is the teaching system i have  how that we should read why we have to read why what we have to study ah ha  what is the procedure  is there any exam is there research so i don't know anything i just know it's m phil it's ph d  it's ph d just like m a  so i don't know anything and uhm i am planning for  career in customs  i have applied uh filled the forms for there is a post  inspector customs and income tax  and for the one word   ah ha right right  that means you have no definite programme where wherever you get the better opportunity you'll go   not only not have a definite see which is if you uh stick to one thing cough  uh you take the case of i a s preparation uh  one word aspiration everything uh  so if we take a single option  uhm right  yeah  and we uh didn't succeed in future yeah   it's a problematic one word  yeah  since i have seen persons persons that's right who have been staying here for last six seven years in my hostel uhm  and they are trying only for i a s yes  and unfortunately many persons they are not that much of that much level or may be possible luck  doesn't favour them  they did not get through   yes yes  ah  so they are nowhere now a days right  and uh three or four of my best friends uhm uhm  two of them have left for their homes after wasting their seven years oh  so you can think if you stick to single option   i don't think we'll ever succeed  yes yes  uh now a days we have to   since there are three four options yes  so you go any try three four ways uh  and if you succeed in any one way it's alright  right  and uh same is the case for u g c  uhm if anyone everyone ask i have to be professor   it is difficult since population is increasing and jobs are that much  oh yeah  limited  yeah  in every fields jobs are limited this is all case of population  yes laughs  since people are doesn't bother even the uhm  family planning programme is not okay i don't think they advertise on t v on radio  if a person is poor how can he afford t v or radio  oh yes even if he uh watches uh television or hears radio he doesn't imply to his own you know  one word 
the teaching of english in the schools is extremely faulty true  so can you identify the areas where basically the problem lies with students of english in the schools ? in in the area of pronunciation sir i have  uh is okay laid down on many problems that uh one is that  they don't maintain the length of the vowels and they shift  there is a phonemic alternation  in place of one vowel they use uh the other vowel  like uh in uh while saying the word zero some of my students say jero  some will say zero but the others will say jero  so there is phonemic alternation  some will say amit but some will say omit some will say oomit  some will say for example obedience obedience some will say abedience obedience  so faulty pronunciation i feel it it travels into their uh uhm their whole career  and uh from the very beginning we have got a faulty pronunciation  ah now look at one thing my problem basically with teacher of english is not so much phonemic  i have a very serious doubt about the grammar  the lack of really grammar which the students have for instance even at the m phil level i've come across cases of students mixing up the tenses in the same sentence i mean the present tense past tense and in one case  i discovered all the three tenses used in a long sentence  and i said you have left out nothing absolutely  so that's one problem  and i think much greater attention needs to be paid towards  grounding  i am not talking of i mean the traditional grammar but atleast the modern approaches to grammar should atleast be given to the students  and what i find is probably this is a deficiency which later on becomes incurable  because what you are trying doing to do  is what you do at the the school level and what is going to be confirmed at the undergraduate level is what will survive eventually at the postgraduate level you see   really   they use present and past and   even   basics of basics of english language is  sir don't you think they   so that is the structure  don't you think this deficiency lies some to some extent  uh with the teachers  exactly they cannot impart uh the good in a pro   exactly exactly that of course is one part of it that i mean it's like the blind leading the blind in many cases i mean  the students themse the teachers themselves are not aware  of the rules of grammar they are themselves violating and  naturally that is the violation they are passing on to the students for instance i came across some books i mean written for students i mean grammar i mean general english for students of b a one and b a two by a group of professors of various colleges three four of them joining hands writing  and i discovered the essays which were written one is ungrammatical english  and i marked out certain portions in which there were howlers i mean and i said if this is the essay the student is going to read and in many cases commit to memory what sort of english is the student eventually going to learn from there cough   i'll give just one example  i forget which one are they but because some teachers gave and gave me those copies i mean complimentary copies and i said one word let me glance through it said  aap ki bacchi bhi padthi hai so but my daughter was in b a two or three at that time so she will be of in need of some of them  so we are leaving these copies alright but let me go through them and let me see are they in the right sort of english and i discovered and i infact told one of them sir you are an m phil and is this the sort of english you your  yourself writing  what better english will the students write if this is the sort of  ungrammatical english you are writing  so this is the basic fault i find two basic problems with students who come to my department for instance one is the grammar lack of grammar the second is lack of i mean what i would say vocabulary vocabulary is sometime so deficient that if i try to convey something i have to look through these basic english virtually at time  cough  is that your michael west i made use of yes at two different stages  one when i was editing a play of shakespeare for students  secondly when i was teaching at a place which is in a very  backward area of punjab bhatinda  so there people told me that here in english people are very very deficient and they use a hindi terms for it angrezi mei haath bada tang hai   yeah   yes   haan haan  so i mean i said typical punjabi   ah yes yes  and they said saxena saab you'll have to teach english for a change in hindi and punjabi  i said at the master's level you expect uh there is no help for it you will find it impossible to convey anything to them i said don't worry i will not come down to hindi or punjabi   i'll teach them in english of course i'll  have to be very careful in the choice of words that i am going to use   and that was the second time i made use of the service list of michael west  and what i did is gradually i would introduce everyday  of course it it involved lot of labour seven or eight new words  and that was also graded i mean these are the words  i'm introducing today these are words i am introducing tomorrow  and my effort was an every month it should be around two hundred words i should be able to increase in their vocabulary  and i discovered their vocabulary was almost doubled by the time they completed the first session i did it you see  and naturally they would understand english better  so what i find is that these are the two basic deficiencies  phonetics is yes it is deficiency  but phonetics does not pose such a major problem you know why ? cough  because perhaps you have read also that there is now a consensus i mean atleast that english can be pronounced slightly differently in different parts of the world i mean  i mean australians pronounced it differently  canadian pronounce it differently america pronounce it differently  english that is to say the queen's or the king's  english is differently pronounced  but then even in england there is variation in pronunciation  it is being   america  regional variation  regional variations that fairly wide regional variations i mean even in england  so that's what i find phonetics is important in it's own way but that's  not the be all and end all of teaching of english mind you  what is more significant for the students is teaching of elementary rules of grammar  and what i find is there is a very small book i came across published by times london at two words  the name of that book is in fact that's a series of books maybe pushpinder i sho sho showed you those books i mean   a grammar in sixty minutes that's the title of that book i mean grammar in sixty minutes  we have one or two such titles in our department i think they got them from there  now maybe not in sixty minutes but that book of grammar which gives the essential rules of grammar can be inculcated in the students in about a month's time  and even that would be in a series  so that's what i found out yes i don't know whether you came across that book  but i keep on hunting for it not at my i am basically not concerned with teaching of language  but i am concerned of course with correctness of language  so it's in that context i hunted out those books in delhi  maybe it could be some information for you also   laughs  so it's something about the vocabulary why don't you elaborate ? means as far as your student is concerned or your teachers are concerned ?  sir two words  vocabulary true it's it lacks people lack vocabulary  and uh sometimes even students they know the answer sometimes but they don't find words to express themselves  and uh of course teachers help them and we are  even even if  word in hindi  he he talks about dictionary  yeah   that's uh  the dictionary habit  one word  and that is what students seriously lack i tell you for vocabulary they have to be made to look up the dictionary and that should be the habit with i mean i one word that my student   every child should have if you are ten percent doubt consult the dictionary  don't presume this is the meaning because what you presume is  it's normally wrong  one word dictionary with him  normally wrong  go to a dictionary and what i normally tell the students is have a big dictionary on your desk a desk dictionary whether it is c o d or whether you've  chambers depends on whether you know phonetics or you don't know phonetics one of these two  but keep a small dictionary always in your pocket in the case of girls they can in their  yeah purse   i mean purses i mean a small one whether it is little oxford dictionary yeah or collin's gem dictionary because the problem with students many times is they are lazy they would not like to go from one place to the other to lift the dictionary  that is the hassel they won't like to do  if it is right in their pocket then perhaps they will bring it out   yeah   yeah   but if they have if they have  it in their bags they will just take it out and find   yes it will become easier for them to consult at time   that's what i have been telling my students again and again   i always encourage them to bring dictionaries cough everyday  another book and uh  which i would mention and i may be it's of some use to you that is elements of style by strung and white  have you seen it ? we have six copies in our departmental department  in the main library and i find it has hardly been issued for so many years you see that's of course an older edition i have a new edition revised edition because the original was written by professor strung it has been revised by e d white  you see that's not in paper back also  but paper back is also quite costly  but what i suggest is atleast the teachers who are interested can consult them elements of style    elements of style  you know why because fowler is formidable in  it's length  not everybody likes to consult or read it  but that element of style is just ninety-eight pages  i mean not very difficult to simplify it  and i find i gave it some of my m phil students who had problems with usage and all that and they said it has been useful  and interestingly i discovered pushpinder i was reading a column in this uh times of india sunday and it there was an article by nissim ezekiel who said he was using this very book for his m a students elements of style i mean that's what happened before this nissim retired last year from uh that bombay university so it is very good for his students   yeah   a by just a matter of chance i discovered in that article that i mean the same thing i have been using also  for my students  i think you tell the professor about your plans for further work or  yeah  about your teaching  teaching is more or less over you can talk of what are your plans for further work research if you are doing or publishing or anything else  sir i'll think of publishing it and revise it  and uh put in all your suggestions that quantitative analysis of the data i'll take up and i'll get it published you know the problem is many students in fact i would say majority of students once they have got their ph d i mean and they think well they go and sleep laughs  we have reached the destination laughs nothing more is i mean we have got our degree we can write doctor with our name and that's the end of it it happened with one of my scholar though  it was my first research one word he was a school teacher also  when he came i said what exactly is your provocation for registering for the ph d i said do you think you stand to get anything by getting a ph d in english  he gave a very curious reply to me  he said sir when my daughter gets married i want to issue the card which carries my name as doctor laughter  the reason for it haan 
uh right  i am rana nayar  and i am sudeep minhas  so sudeep what do you think we should talk about this morning ?  that's what i am thinking laughs  why don't you set the ball rolling   that's what i am thinking  let's talk about feminism  let's just continue the yesterday's  discussion  i think it's very interesting i i i  wasn't participating yesterday  right so i would like   but that was uh more personal in nature because  yes we won't talk i was just uh drawing upon my personal  experience and talking about it  uh and how of course i started off as the feminist  and uh became more of a male chauvinist later   experience   a few words  yes  so why don't you share a bit of your experience  so that we will be on   about feminism  about how man feel   even ground  how man feel how strongly you feel about this whole idea of  feminism ?  feminism right  uh now i'll we can't say how strongly i feel about it but i think it most of the personal experience is that you slowly begin to realise that being a working woman makes you more of a you know a target of male chauvinism  had i been a housewife i think i would have certainly  enjoyed more privileges than i do now laughs  do you regret being a career woman ?  is that what you are trying   no i think the satisfaction the satisfaction for my subject gives me uh i mean it's a kind of balances the whole thing  but sometimes i think uh i certainly wish i just could relax at home and you know the chores that i do now i mean if were to do just those chores and i would feel certainly much more happier  but that will not really make you uh feminist ? then then what you are asking for no  is some kind of a typical role that is assigned  to women  well i   no   no   exactly   no the   i'm saying i am saying this is what i had encountered  not that i want to be like that this is what i have encountered from me   given a choice you won't like exactly uhm exactly  i mean uh we have certain dreams i feel all young girls have certain dreams and uh then uh when i was about twenty-five twenty-six just before my marriage  uhm  uhm uhm  i i had this kind of a dream that okay i'm going to set certain rules if i'm working and he is working we are going to divide uh what we are going to do  but i think and i ended up with a lot of problems  uhm uhm got lot of problems uhm uhm  so i think uhm that's what when you were talking about yesterday one word better you know that yes one sets out thinking that yes one is feminist but when actually slowly you  when you when you actually uh face the realities when you come down to the ground realities i think one is so much more happier in the conventional truth   same's happened with me uhm uhm  when i think it would have been i think my mother is in a much better position and a situation than i am  she is much more respected  ah ha  i am the one who is supposed to be you know going out and having fun but still i am working the most of the one word you know  laughter  and my mother just because she is a mother you know she is lady of the house she has so much more respect  uhm uhm  and uh i think i lose out on that and i sometimes wish and i crave for that kind of an adoration and looking upto laughter looking upto  are you trying to say that as we get on in years we become more of uh man or more of woman uh is that the idea ?  now about the one word  yes i mean have we i mean i think had i been given enough uh wh what should i say had the situation been different and the convention been different then i would have certainly loved to be a liberated woman or the or as we say the working woman or a professional kind i would have certainly loved to be that would you like to say that all working women are liberated in that sense in your words ?  no they are not no no  then ? i mean i would have loved opting for a career only way of seeking liberation  yes it is of course to uh to ce to a great extent yes i i i agree with that to a great extent of course as sometimes doing one word   is it not   uh would you like to think of liberation purely in ecnomic terms  it's >/w> not just that rana it's not just that  it's so much more you can i mean sometimes i think you just tend to uh build a build up so much when you are at home and this is some kind of an outset i think it's not just economical it's  psychological also  and the the very fact of moving out of the house i think  man enjoys that don't they ? i mean you make them sit at home for uh say about uh uh not even a week say two days i mean right if they have a prolonged weekend they just begin to tend to get irritated they  they won't move one word they feel confined  i think the very fact you know this this breaking of the psychological barrier yes that even i am moving out   right  right this is physical moving out is sometime equated uh with the with the psychological uh opening up  right  right uhm i mean you can carry on   uhm i mean i don't know what to think about that laughter i hope  uhm   uhm  of course we can always agree to differ as far this is concerned because   oh yes   why not why not why not  of course he has got an absolutely different uh say no because i am a staunch believer in uh what i call  biological determinant you see   now what is biological determinant ?  please explain that you were saying yesterday also   uh i know uh uh i know i know laughter  i know i am going to raise lot of hackles when i say that  but this is exactly what uh what my life experience is that  things are what they are because of bio biology and biology is what conditions are  and we cannot really be any different or we cannot really go very far from where we start   i think don't we give meanings to biology i think let to itself it would have been much more simpler i mean it would have been much more uh on the equal ground had i mean we give a lot of meaning to what biology means as such i am not really trying to and this is i don't know anything about  biological determinism exactly laughter  i have no scholarly laughs background about this  so do impose and stuck upon  nor do i for that matter and two words justify thing and if not really meant be scholarly discussion but  i know no but still i don't what it is but i  somehow feel personally that we give a lot of meaning because  that's the way we want it to be   that's the way our society wants it to be  yeah that would be another way of looking at it but uh you mean biologically men are stronger than women ? i am not talk talking in terms of relative strength  that men are stronger and women are weaker  but what i am trying to suggest is that whether it is psychology or sociology or cultural pattern or behaviourial pattern all stem from a certain kind of biological makeup  everything else follows you see  everything else comes later  it begins there  no i think it begins no no no   and   and and perhaps you see   when when when women talk in terms of liberation uh ar are they talking in terms of being more of men than  women is that what they want ? equality with men does it mean that they want to be like men ? i i would not really be very happy with that kind of situation  if women were to be like men or where try to become men because  i feel   this is i can i   that's true i mean they as far as that goes reversal of roles can never take place  i i uh i am agree   for instance one of the extreme is one of the extreme position that i think of is that man can never give birth i was thinking of it i was thinking of it   so  so to say  you see that is something which women alone can do  one word  but that does not call it a previlege or whatever yes but  it's granted only to uh i think men are poorer for this reason that they are they cannot give birth  yes  no but that's i think that is a   very fine way of saying we are poor so we should be allowed to do this we should be allowed to do this  because   because   this is this is   this is  one way in which they can somehow satisfy a creative impulse  a man is always trying to laughs give expression to it in so many different ways and i think half the time he doesn't succeed  i don't know about that problem but i think you know uh  laughter what's more important is as i was saying the husband is one word i mean as you were saying about this reversal of role i believe in it yes and i think that should not be just by giving birth i think she should not be denied of other things i mean i think she feels proud of it yes that she is a mother and it so much more natural for a mother to have that kind of relationship with the child which of course the father can never have it of  right but it develops slowly  but again is that an excuse for her not being  i mean so that she should not be taking such and such role she should not be doing this and this thing is that some kind of a constraint just because she happens to be a mother  right  certainly not and i want i don't even want to  suggest that it should be a kind of a constraint  the idea is you first identify yourself with what you are you accept yourself for what you are yes right  you accept your limitations you accept your strength  and from there you proceed  very fine you see a woman may be or a man for that matter let me not talk only of women  if a man also wants to liberate himself then i think every man needs to liberate himself or all human beings need to liberate themselves because all of us have this basic impulse to move towards some kind of an autonomy growth may be this is something that we all think about and this is exactly what i mean by liberation   exactly  exactly moving towards some kind of a higher state yes  of growth  growth which you may measure in whatever terms you chose to  first one word maybe social psychological  spiritual material any term you chose to terms you can define for yourself but i am talking about the basic idea of growth and that alone means liberation to me  yes  exactly so for that kind of growth i think it's very important i mean that's the way i look at it  for a man and for that matter even a woman to accept  himself herself  and this kind of self- acceptance is exactly what doesn't really count most one word  exactly as it is which becomes a hindrance in a way and  this in itself is a kind of bondage   i  right   i'll give you i'll give you uh a personal example for that matter  when you were saying that when woman want to be uh woman want to be liberated are they trying to be like man  i will give you an example  my husband likes a very clean house he likes to remain at home  he likes to do all the things  and believe it he loves to do needle work also uhm uhm  i don't  i am the one who would rather sit and have a one word  newspaper  yes i love to that is one thing i like to  but he do does all the other things  whenever we are together on the weekend you know thinking is generally thought to be a man's  priority right i i not necessarily  no yes  not necessarily yes  i i i you know i will give you so many examples from  men are warriors not thinkers  no laughter 
uh i wonder this has been actually defined you know what what gossip consist of because one of the things that it consists of is uh uhm attitudes and emotions i mean it's a very emotive kind of use of languages this precisely gossip  precisely   precisely precisely this is  this is very highly coloured highly coloured now gossip i believe is like humour which is peculiar to every language uhm  and every culture and every you see and there is something which is which you can't pass on uhm  i mean just as you cannot see poetry is something basic  uhm the people and culture so has humour  uhm  uhm  and i think more than poetry and humour is gossip uhm  because it is there letting yourself go and  letting yourself go is letting your say orientation of thinking and feeling yeah really have a free place  yeah   yeah  yeah and that kind of thing you see i wonder if  they see that is some of us you've to do it in the language in which you see this is not that it will be that oriented  yeah  yeah  some of us would be playing to the oriented and say other languages that means other than our own and isn't it  might be possible but i do not know how far is  this possible   uhm   yeah   because there are certain words you know  which have that value  uh for instance words like faltu and uh  you know  you see this is i think  patao or some such things pushpinder this is letting yourself go yeah  now whether you can let yourself go yeah in a language which is not the language of your  yeah  yeah  i mean basic upbringing or basic say orientation of your yeah thinking and feeling structures  yeah  yeah  you see this is yeah that is this an  and mostly gossip is just than talking about nothing  yeah  yeah  and yet you see you find people extremely at home which is there yeah  and extremely interesting yeah  i mean if you if you would reduce it to a  some kind of a dramatic content   yeah  uhm  anyway it accounts to nothing uhm  and yet you see when when you  you see see people gossiping yeah i think they they're completely i mean there is sort of two words sense of feeling at home yeah you see  yeah   yeah  perhaps it has a psychological uh dimension as well as a social one and we are talking about you know one word social cultural uh pattern there which are evident or it's a  it's a form of social behaviour which is  specific to any culture to uh but i think there is a psychological dimension as well just as in humour there is a psychological dimension that you know it's a play of the uh uhm subconscious or in  in in grotesque in fantasy i mean it's  it's subconscious coming out  so even in gossip there are these these psychological factors isn't it ? some kind of hatred or uh maybe some feelings of angrer or jealousy or whatever you know one word instead of uh you because you don't have a way of expressing them openly or just saying how i hate so and so or uh i i detest that person and uh i wish i could kill him or some such thing  you don't uh pu put it in that way but you  gossip about that person or you talk about that person about   little things that the person does or doesn't do and so on going out with so and so or having a   one word   but that's one word   no i wanted to say they are psychological yeah probably trying to make some kind of distinction between this social and psychological yeah  and i i i don't think i don't think   not yeah not the total distinction but i mean these are two aspects  no i  no no i don't think they i don't think  they  yeah i don't think they are two aspects  i think they two words relatonship is rather organic uhm uhm it is psychological in fact if you try to understand it and see it in terms of the genisis uhm  you will find rooted in your collective unconscious uhm you will find it rooted in your then  obviously your habits are really coming to terms with it  right  right coming to and and expressing it yeah yeah so so we two words that distinction does not stand yeah  you see the the the in between the collective social and yeah then psychological  yeah  yeah you see what in fact you see one i mean one could say  is that this is the say the the the  pshychological factor that you are talking about would be i mean how an individual absorbs uhm you see or response to whatever one has inherited  uhm  uhm this is not that collective uh you see level  uhm that of ones uhm i mean social existence  uhm   uhm   uhm  uhm so it is they they there would be of course i am not trying to rule out the personal inclusion personal action uhm personal action will be there  uhm  uhm but the personal action would be see you will have to see in terms of uh i mean the style of one's feeling i mean talking about one word things or you see stressing certain things   yeah or  yeah  now suppose you were to take a the   con concrete instance you know  say a concrete instance of how we gossip in the staff room for example  so i am going to take a another instance like  stardust film gossip or some such things true true i mean staff room yeah gossip is more different from stardust gossip   yeah  yeah yeah see i i so we can take any context and that is the written uh  kind of thing and this is uh uh spoken but now if we were trying to  if we were to try and analyse uh what we do when we gossip say in the staff room or in in a party or something yeah that's true uh what what what social and psychological dimensions you you think are are  are they   i i'll tell i will tell i will tell i will tell i will tell i'll tell you  social and psychological dimesions are undermined uhm in even whatever we really say pass and start from gossips  uhm   uhm   but we are trying to one word what we are trying to do is yeah to either run away from certain things uhm  from certain tensions uhm from certain contridictions  uhm   uhm  yeah from certain say certain form their phase or certain sure yeah or you see we are trying to have adjustments yeah  or we are trying to really transform them  yeah into some kind of socially respectable kind of  communicate communication i mean comminicability  yeah   yeah uh i so the the the i i   mean if we if we yeah had i mean this you you they are not talking in the air one word not just floating there  yeah  uhm  i mean it's not just that i enter the staff room when i am off my say phase and i am off my say grounding uhm  i i am there and then ob obviously that kind of a gossip has acquired a kind of a grammar of its own uhm  it has acquired a gradient grade  of its own uhm  and i only fear that whatever we talk about in the staffroom uhm it gets talked about more  uhm under the one word of that grammar  uhm   uhm   uhm  yeah i mean one word abiding by a certain idiom or a certain you see habit of saying things  there are certain you see way of verbalising things uhm  rather than you see what may have been gossiped about if we were not i mean under this kind of one word of one word yeah  say of another language and striving for ah ha specific kinds of effects  ah ha  oh so you think that you know that english comes in   english comes uh in a way over it  english comes  we we being one word comes in one word  right this is this is this is an english coffee  laughs  yeah  and when i gossip gossip in english staffroom ha and the particular kind of say first one word of effects which we uhm think you see are respectable enough  uhm  ah  or which are interesting enough uh which you see  which one word have some air of say some air of respectability  uh  uhm i mean i do not know i mean this is it is directly you you wouldn't like to just wait say i mean just like i mean just would like to something that is uh vulgar or that is not  respectable  yeah  yeah  you see the now this scene of respectability is i fear yeah not merely a say a bottleneck uhm only in respect of samething expressing or communicating uhm  probably this also influences in a very constitutive  uhm and familiar way what really is said  uhm  uhm or what really is talked about uhm uhm  so therefore i mean with the the i think the gossip takes uh  yeah overtakes us  yeah and it's really is is played out yeah  through us  yeah  yeah i mean some kind of isn't it ? yeah  but you know it's part of that running away that you said in the beginning you know that uh it's part of our uh desire to run away uh now english serves a very useful purpose over there  because uh running away from our actual circumstances also means running away from our language or from our real being and so on  and so in the context of the staffroom uh what happens is that we run away from those uh real things and uh   no you can't say that   and and what do we run away too you see we are not sure   and what we run away too is a constructed   laughter you know discourse   it's it's a it's a constructed world cough and uh in that world as you say of course we are very careful that we don't violate some of the some of the circulated norms you know  we we we  we we are playing the game yeah  and the games for i mean for which in fact we device the rules uhm but now the rules really get better of us yeah so that we game is being played by the rules in fact yeah  and we are probably mean we we probably become instruments  yeah  yeah  so i find that happens quite a lot to me because what happens is uh sometimes i violate those rules laughter sometimes i what happens is that i am know in the context of staffroom one is not supposed to be talk talking seriously about it that is right that is what that is that they they that is the violation  or not yeah  yeah that's the violation  that is now sometimes i put my foot in then i start talking seriously  about something which is considered to be you know uh  not done there and  uhm see see that   that's not done and yeah  that is that is playing fouls  and that's the one word yeah  that's not something that yeah   you see it one word i i think if if there were a referee  yeah to see this match of uh yeah i mean to monitoring this match yeah i think he he would probably   yeah i mean uh declare it as foul  yeah   yeah   yeah  yeah that's right uh uh if you are being honest yeah or you are being serious you see yeah this is this a foul play  yeah   yeah  yeah this is not admissable  that's right  that is exactly as my difficulty here is uhm  that the say the gossip itself here uhm  say we we we we just say  is is is a kind of a construct  yeah  and it's a kind of a some kind of a game  you see   yeah yeah now which we are not very one word very acutely aware of yeah  you see once we once we start playing the game yeah the games get better off yeah then so do the rules yeah  and so we merely are then the puppets yeah  so we are just just his master's voice yeah 
i am uh professor prem singh of the department of the linguistics university of delhi  i am ravindra gargesh also of the department of linguistics university of delhi  uh well since uh we were talking about the problems uh that we face in analysis of literary text  uh you see besides you know the text in stylistic analysis  uh what other things you are paying attention to ? you see i am also engaged along with that the whole problem of  uh uh translation and uh and in that you see i have told you that  i've been dealing with this problem that all translations are at the le level of parole not at the level of langue  now how does this fitting include your theory of stylistics and understanding of a text ? ah that's very interesting you see uh first of all what comprises textual analysis because coming from the  dis discipline of linguistics we have to be micro approach to begin with the micro approach  now in the micro approach we have to see what the text is constituted of uhm uhm  that is the text is a larger uhm uhm symbol  uhm uhm  but what is that symbol made of uhm uhm  and when we break it into its uh constituent parts   uhm uhm then we have to look at it in terms of its language structures  uhm uhm  uhm uhm  language structures in the sense of in linguistic terms  as well as in let us say metalinguistic terms  uhm uhm  in the linguistics terms what are the patterns what are the  uh how the uh particular sensitivities are issues are coded or certain concepts are coded  and then how that codification does not remain only the prime way does not contain only primary limits but it is to have secondary limits within a larger context  uhm uhm so we have to look at uh the language at two levels  first level is the level of linguistic structures  uhm uhm  and in second level will be level of lexical significations significations within textual context  so what your significance is not really significant in the sense of uh the contemporary or french school in the sense that a particularly there is an a company where they are trying to deconstruct the text  you don't seem to be deconstructing the text in any significant way where either the the entire structuation of signification uh  falls apart in a way but at the same time it gives you the peep  a peep into human minds it also believes a kind of psychological and philosophical and historical forces involved in understanding of a text  very right very right  uh we are i mean the kind of analysis that i am doing these are variants between french school different way  but that was primarily because i think the text as way odd identity  and uh perhaps i would not like to begin analysis wherever i want  so that is one defect because for the in the deconstruction  one can bring in anything  you can bring in your subjectivity to interpret the text  whereas if text is structured if human mind is structured  or if language is structured then definitely the text must also uh  get restructured  and if the text has a structure we have to go from some recent structure towards the end or towards significations  basically what you are trying to establish is a kind of a  grammar of of stylistics and grammar of analysis  and you know if i quote uh that these all grammars leak so what are the leakages in your laughter  yes the grammar is weak and there are major weaks in this grammar so that   even even you see though in all linguistic analysis we know that in panini grammar which is called the perfect grammar is is really an imperfect grammar otherwise yeah  katyayana would not need to write uh would not have needed to write separately and then openly didn't need to get up and defend panini against katyayana and sometimes uh you know one word makes a uh fun of himself  yeah  oh alright   two words fool of himself when defending panini ahn uh so one word worried about is what are the leaks in your grammar of style and your grammar of literary analysis ? well there are many leaks ahn   it's leaving of it's leaving everywhere because firstly there is no comprehensive that the grammar of uh  literary analysis that one word you can put it like that  there is no comprehensive  for example for poetry for poetic analysis we require a separate set of parametres for analysis  for drama which may be a non-poetic text particularly  we'll require separate uh uhm parametre for analysis  and for stories or narratives we would require still separate parametres of analysis  so you see there are multiple levels of analysis i i and could say to catch that i say one is the phonological one is the morphological level third is a syntactic level in that way you can't you want to say that at this parametre of poetry in these parts fiction then these for drama  i say alright poetry is a kind of one word level  phonology and uh a drama at the level of uh morphology and and text analysis of a a fiction is at the level of syntax how would you defend uh your position against mine this this  your view   and   yes that would be uh my position will be at variance somewhat  uh for poetic analysis i would agree with you that uh  phonological patterns are significant morphological pattern are significant syntactic patterns are significant semantic configurations will be in the sense of figurative language are significant  and how these interact and lead down to larger meaning larger meaning constructs  but in drama things are going to be different because by and large we may have sentences which are incomplete  so there the unit of analysis cannot be a line because poetry would be line laced or stanzas  but in drama we'll have to be very different   we'll have to bring in discourse   we'll have to talk about speech events and we will have to analyse language as constituting speech event  and the drama would have to be seen as a series of speech events put together  and we will have significations speech that's all about it well i think there are but i still think uh that  one word more and more about it that most of this analysis is at the le at the level of parole not at the level of langue because it doesn't go into the soul of literature  uh so then i think there needs to be some compromise between old  what you call philosophical or historical analysis of the text there must be now two words now just say it's  a phenolo it's phonologian don't want to touch it uhm uh if we do that then your analysis is primarily based on the theories of roman jacobs  uhm and over jacob's and bob's to a most of the time what you will what modern people will dismiss as phonological analysis so that roman jacob's and one word  pushed in it's nothing  yeah  but uh but phonological analysis so we have one needs to kind of going to uh certain other aspects and we need to broaden  uh uhm from or your uh uh your theory of style uh then say  you're basically what's you're doing is as a modifying partial position  ah yes in a way you can say that for ra roman jacobsan i would say that his theory was a brilliance with it's  practice  in practice he was a grammarian cough in theory he was a phonetician  and the two well there was a significant between the two  uh whereas uh uhm for bob bob's known known uh linguistic facts as well he would account for known linguistic facts like uh uh   for the present one word yes bob was not interested in language for say roman jacobson was interested primarily and in a very fundamental way uh uh the uh the  language yes or the one word work uh verbal shiftance yes in russian uh russian phonology yes or french phonology  phonographs like uh like   yeah uh in a way yes   yes   yes   yes  history of french phonology and uh you know and uh his you know work on lithuvanian and latin accent  yes yes  yes they all you know basically he was concerned with language even his work on one word is basically how we as a linguist can handle and help those unfortunate people for this uh uh speech disorders yes we generalise the metaphoric mood and the one word  mood but uh but i think bob's was not concerned about any of these things and needed needed and a few words any of them is concerned with these issues  so they're actually they should be separated in a way totally as to separate theorotically approaches to our understanding of literary texts am i right ? well as far as uh the scholars themselves are concerned surely they are talking different things  but when we approach uh a problem theoritically surely we have a right to sympathise  and uh i for one would like to sympathise simpson's side  rather extend the jacobsonian model  because if you see the different analysis that jacobson has made  of the different texts in french and english and so on  always what he has done is he has broken down a text books grammatical structures and simply partition the grammatical practice  and that was the one word against him  that the elements that roman jacobson formed in a two words  could be found in a pattern of a newspaper as well  so he has dramatical patterning or he does not wants  want to do the text i don't think that that the correct position as for as  roman jacobson is concerned because roman jacobson is very much concerned about metres  you can't have him that cut a newspaper text and say there is a one word constructed every year say for example his analysis of uh great french poet one word alright where he talks about metres pushkins he talks about metres  you know while no where bob doesn't mentioned metres   yeah  so while he had laughs  that you also have been uh they have been doing it but trying to escape metres  no i have not never try to escape metre  in fact i begin with metrical analysis i begin in phonological analysis  that the first level of one word  the look what i mean is this is that you have not started  yes building a theory new theory of metres specifically using the same old metrical hollan and metrical structures and trying to apply them in new thing this kind of thing was done by kaiser and holla in here   very interesting book on you know that they have book on english metres  yes   yes yes   yes kaiser and holla  yes alright so what do we do probably how do we my my concern is how to integrate all these things into main theory of linguistic analysis  yes  and we must sit down must you know put our minds  into understanding these problems  i agree with you basically uh but with one difference role of ours is uh analyse is given the uh theoritical perspective of the analysis of narratives uhm uhm  take for example chaucer to come back  so we can't say that he was not language one word or he was not uh doing literary kind of analysis he was not taking literature as part of his one word  he was taking literature as well but of course his preoccupations much large  uhm  and uh what i mean to say is that of course there is need to integrate everything integrate more into this stylistic theory  what we have done so far is not that sufficient  metre must be seen afresh from new perspective i do agree with you and uh laughs   let's move back to again yes  let's try to understand uh the relationship of saussure with all these people particularly saussurian type one word yes and how people have been using them and now and then  sometime literary people without even understanding uh what is meant by it you know contrast and opposition it  what is meant by the saussure thing that uh all linguistic analysis is basically an algebra of oppositions and contrasts yes alright uh even if we leave out all other but this is exactly and if really think of that uhm two things come out of saussurian analysis very clearly  uhm  yeah one is that people don't understand that this whole theory is based upon two words theory of one word  ah ha  and other thing that come up very clearly uh all sort of sassurian these people are not kind to uh one word i don't understand that the concept of opposition is basically again red indian and foreigners   it's not saussure would you like to elaborate on that ? ah yes i can see uh when you when saussure talks about that x and y  and g uhm are in opposition and they are in a net net one word of contrast is there  uhm  uhm  alright then the same kind of thing was being said by pre-paninian  uh two words authentic uhm that sounds are primarily in a system of contrast and opposition they do not exist by themselves ah that's wonderful 
anjani i have always wondered how did you enter the linguistics  can you tell me something ?  sir that's the very interesting question i started my career as a teacher of english and in post graduated classes i was uh i started teaching henry james  and browning ahn  henry james because i was working on him then and browning because no one in that year was teaching browning   ahn  which year was that ? that was long time back sixty-eight sixty-nine sixty-eight  and then in under this graduate classes uh something very interesting happened the university introduced courses on language  ahn  and there was a professor i won't name who was trained in c i e f l in the earliest c i e and then in uh pune  ah ahn in linguistics   ah ahn  ah ahn but when he was asked to teach that course he refused  oh he said i'm a teacher of literature i won't do the job of this course  and now the head of the department of english in science college  was a student of london university and had undergone rigorous training in linguistics during his days but in his whole life he never got chances to teach linguistics other than that he was teaching only english and the english courses in classes  uhm i was the youngest person he said  okay uhm uh now there is an opportunity for you this is the syllabus and either you teach in the class or i teach it   laughs   uhm  uhm  and if you agree to teach i will teach you uhm  how to teach grammar  uhm  i see  so i availed those that opportunity like this yeah was it a sort of modern linguistic or it was a  traditional grammar   no no it was grammar in under graduate classes i see it was   it was actually traditional grammar in one word  you know hornby books and some other books i know but hornby was the main uhm and some books which c i e f l has just published in linguistics   uhm  so i said okay i'll do it  ahn  and when in off hours he gave me very good background for nessasary  ah ha  and of jesperson particularly jesperson and in the library at all college professors and all there so i got interested  ahn ha then when professor verma came to science college   he i was his student his brother was my classmate so he  persuaded me to join the central institute of english hyderabad  and there somehow i came in very close contact with professor gokak  accha   one word he was the director of that one word  institute in sixty-five uhn and that also was interesting in a different way  in patna university we had a book paper on practical views  where we were not getting the name of the author or the period when there is something was written  and we would argue with in the classroom  as to which period it could belong  who possibly could be the author just observe it for the style of writing  and professor gokak started during that class of kind of thing in this class there yeah  in hyderabad  so i could do very well uhm   that's what brought me close to it  but i was never very close to oldfeild who was teaching grammar somehow i didn't like him uhn  i didn't like his assistant uh who was an  american but i got along well with yadurajan and nambiar uhn  and my pronounciation was very much influenced by the  bihari atmosphere although in high school i was the product of an english medium school  our teachers were mostly but nambiar you know helped me in speaking nice english and all his lessons particularly with reference to long stresses we used to talk a lot  anyway then i went to south there was one the other was masica uhn for the   we became very friendly for non- academic reasons we just became very friendly  and then i wrote a paper that paper you know uh which was written in the train   uh  i see  you know i was uh called very urgently i had to go from  hyderabad to calcutta then to patna and back  and the day i was back was the day when we were supposed to  submit the term paper  so i had no time  touch and go i think in the train  one word and in the train and uh he was his best because of conditional causes exactly and all that  and then i got scholarship to go to chicago i would say  masica was some what influential he introduced my name there  uh i was one word to go there and then one word  these people something happened and uh that was political  uhm  so i was my name was chucked out and then i went for  under this chicago scholarship  and there i uh in the beginning i was very one word  without one word  i did not like phonetics uhn  you know bansal was not there when i was there i i didn't like it  and uh once or twice guide told me if you want to sit  in to literature he had no objection  i said no i'll study phonetics  so that's how i came in but the main point i would say  was that it had been a very boring experience to remain a teacher of english yes  and i've no one word of boring in the sense that you are in destined to teach the same author because nobody else is ready to change his subject you are right  so you go on teaching the same year after year go on repeating the same thing year after the year  whereas in this discipline whatever i learnt in chicago this is the best job uhm  but what i teach in the classroom like what i'm   i was going to teach is very difficult is very difficult  what what i acquired there yeah  so it's a process of one word and patience which goes on time what about you ? no when we went to chicago i one word interesting  when we went to chicago those were really the hot years  yes  i think we were yes and that debate between uh generative semanticists and  that's it what chomsky was trying to say   that's it  yes although it all started with chomsky himself i mean it all came out of respect in a sense   other that's right that's  right and they were also m i c at that time a few words  college uh a few words uh george lakoff  that's right  and uh it now seems that the issues were not really substantial i mean the   the issues were very substantial i see  the issues were very substantial in the sense that generative semanticists were the ones who took these basic thought  assupmtions and conclusions of this standard theory very seriously  uh ha  and in that process they ran into trouble  you you know one of the basic assumption was that all the meaning is there in the basic deep tructure uhm  you know you you remember the earlier argument as to why one or two words is better than the deep structure in that  manner is that it's not part of what you hear but one can analyse what is here is the basic thing that's the deep structure so if all the meaning is there in the deep structure  then you have to think about uh ways in which sentences develop from deep structure  yeah which made the process very complex  generative semanticists didn't find it  they made it as complex as was necessary to maintain this assumption uhm  chomsky on the other hand did not do that when he realized that it was has become very complex  he withdrew himself  yeah  and he said well one word structures one word  let's play a role as semanticists  and he and that was it he uh conflict in the hope so actually it was a better theory people had then trivial views of one word  you know for including one word  but still he he maintains the point to the extent that  one word  but as i was a part of this thing i can see that the issues were really very very serious issues according to us  but uh certain things disappeared with the one word  it it disappeared uh with what has suffered two words  not exactly the semanticists to uh uh founder of chomsky uhm  uh you see if you make something very powerful uhm  and he becomes so powerful that you can't control it  there is no it is not possible i know  no that is it  then it is no longer your methodology  uhn  do you remember the story of this fossil yeah  so the methodology with the generative semanticists developed uhn  which is so complex and so powerful that it could explain anything but in a very very complex manner  and there may be point two words george lakeoff withdrew things like one word that i wish one word had constructed yes  and things like global concect   global  anything could be explained in terms of global concect  and he also introduced what he called you know what is technically is called one word  uhm  you know like it is uh say uh po point uh three two seven  uhn percent uh now yes  that type of calculation pure mathematical conclusion  and that turned majority of practitioners yes  two words  it is true that uh you know the the financial crunch which you mention the other day uhm  that plays a very trivial role because there were other people who had chicago like uh have always have big problems that is including one word themselves no the point is how can two words trying to make is that that cohesive group was not there  and there was no attempted attempt  forming of no no there was society like group  no no there was a cohesive group uhm  i think that uh also a kind of a few words  no no it seems to me  there was a cohesive group though not located in chicago throughout the year  the other one word   chicago was chicago was the centre  all the participants used to spend there lot of their income on  two words  i see okay and free you know free publication articles were uh available as soon as they were titled yeah  and in some cases you know like sometimes one word  like writes the script time thing  uhn and he just get it xeroxed two words it could be  one word  and then there would be you know further xeroxing also  so it was not that  and chicago linguistic society was the centre of learning yes that you mentioned  yes that was the centre of for a while for those it was known not there not there at all he doesn't know how uh how much one word   was there  one word  ah how much fun was there how much excitement was there  you can imagine that somebody comes up with the bright idea  and he doesn't wait for the next day to go and meet macaulay   uhm and he writes up a note for pages and you know just push it inside the door uhm  and macaulay comes and looks at the notes and decides this is something which is really exciting and must be done  so it's macaulay who might justification for that analysis  i'm talking about electrical precomposition  uhm   uhm   yeah  ah ha which was actually if i use the term invention uhm  it was invented by his students not he uh ah  but he gave the justification so there was no in in terms of macaulays one word  yeah you were asking about me you know how did i  yeah  yeah one word  how did i get into because i was also like you teaching literature at the university and uh joined linguistics not very seriously to begin with  but one thing was there that i i did wonder about the way literature was used in language this is one thing that's  one word  and then i was very deeply influenced by professor pundit  he used to be the head uh english department  and we had a very distinguished uh two words was there then one word  but professor pundit in particular and i got attracted to socio- linguistic and i did a piece of work uh with with professor pundit on the teachers of hindi trying to show how hindi was  diverging into different directions one would get sanskritized one word  and then i did quite well in my m ed and mr pundit thought that i should be in two words in england  and there i was quite deeply influenced by professor one word  as a socio-linguistic including also the work of a few words   parti particularly the work of one word because he was my  one word   accha  and i worked on the punjabi immigrants there  i think that was the first uh research thesis on  immigrants assimilation of the local language maintenance of their own language and culture one of i think quiet often quoted  then i came back and uh fortunately got a job here  teaching linguistics since but yeah we can talk  uhn  uh well that's very fine i have no news since nineteen eight years one word sometimes eighty or some nine  yeah  eighty-seven perhaps uhn  little before that time seventy-eight seventy-nine yeah no seventy-nine yeah because i came back in seventy-nine  yeah  yeah okay, we met in hyderabad ah yeah that's true and since then all we have been introduced to each other  why is it that uh you and i not have problems  differental issues  uhm whereas i find that most socio-linguists uhm  do not get along well with their colleagues   uhm  you see i i am not talking just for personally yeah purely of academic level  what is your view ? you see i think uh the problem is that uh most socio-linguists i know particular in the indian context have opted for socio-linguistic as a soft option  whereas they they don't want to understand i don't think you can do good socio-linguistics without uh sort of fully understanding the structure of language  i think you have to be i think socio-linguist is is a way of being a link and really it's just a bit one word  so you have different perspective  you may have a generative perspective but you may socio- linguistic perspective but both are trying to be linguist  so i have i have always benifitted from what chomsky had to say or what the one word say or what other theoritical linguist have to have to say  i have never had any cult of socio   that's one word  there is a point that if you are doing socio- linguistic or one word linguistic you are concentrating from the linguistic point of view either on phonology or morphology or syntax or may be two of them or three of them yeah  and each one has to had statistical approach other than the question of socio-linguistic variables and how to analyse it and then what kind of conclusions you want to draw  ah keeping that in mind do you think that there should not be a conflict between theoritical linguistic and you know socio-linguist no i don't think i think they that the goals are  common except i will add one one word now this is my recent in the last three or four years  uh so far i'm concerned it should apply equally well with theoritical linguist and socio-linguists  but i think it applies more to socio-linguist because theoritical linguist can always find other justifications which socio-linguist i think will not be justify justifying with that  i think socio-linguist has a social responsibility  he cannot escape the question of language at all  a pure theoritical linguist who is dealing with it pure as pure form and a pure mathematical form will say i'm  interested in abstract logic and mathematical development although he may not you see but 
well the they represent not so expert little  warden and uh they're planning to one word   as a one word of  what was the main reason for that ? no particularly particular reason at all just and we feel that he is not caring about his job  hardly ever comes to the mess and all  or do the students demand something ? no no no no we we've got i think all things that we need  but so far the warden has never been quite good in his job  he hardly ever comes to the mess he's supposed to look after the food and all  he doesn't come to the mess at all  ah ha ha  just he atleast food about the   he's least bothered about anything except his  uh residence and telephone and all those things  one word  but don't you find any other way to convince him that  to show him how by some other means no we tried to convince him but unfortunately he's  beyond convincing  uhn but i think that this is the usual problem in almost all the hostels of d u uh that the authorities when they get  uhm residence didn't pay attention on hostel its  organisation this is the usual problem   uh  so in all the cases these the students feel that the authorities are doing nothing then the authorities should be one word   yeah yeah you people are justified and what i am saying uh that maybe that uh are something which uh which directly affects to the students that's why these people are very much one word  uhn  yeah   that's it uh and the thing is that the managing body and other things they are supporting  uh  how about the other one word part one word  they are okay  okay and uh they are okay means in the sense that they didn't create any problems ah ha  the warden as a matter of fact never created any problem but  he was useless laughs  as a matter of fact if we if we if we  don't have any authorities at all we're better off ah ha  i think that  ah ha  what about your r t ?  he's okay okay he is doing his post uh  yeah well whatever we tell him to do he does  was the concept of r t as the one word post no concept at all i don't know about any concept why don't you two words any authority in the hostel  especially in our hostel  yeah  or we don't just care about that authorities we do whatever we want oh  i thought you just say yes and one word sign of the  one word   i came to know that in one word  every hostel is like an institution and so that's why  they've appointed one r t uhm with other trainee   uhm  the question is may be uh that was the basic answer but our hostel i don't think has is an exception as   yeah   it's an exception  yeah  and if you say for that matter my hostel is fortunate in  fortunate enough to get uh r t uhm like you see we have ah your hostel has got a lot of problems for example  it is two words rowdy and all then the new  for whose one word he started kicking off the students without  uh one word   these problem are there   yeah yeah   problems are there problems are there what  i'm saying is that uh we've got an r t who does care about the study of the students study of the students yeah because if suppose you have got some problem in  ge getting your things done then he will come and ask   okay if you have any problem just say don't hesitate and one word   i don't know no our r t doesn't do that  our r t just comes once in a while shakes hand with all the boys then we start talking to him and he talks back we talk about all the to topic except the hostel topics  still you people are one word  yeah  and anything that's just  so yeah what do you think that just their target was to get uh get the two words   yeah  yeah yeah that's the main thing  they are not interested at all in this welfare of the students  why should a person care ? why should he throw his family means he don't care about his family rather than yeah he'll come and start looking after boys who know very little   yeah  yeah and uh what manner you people are approaching to the higher authorities ? no we've the higher authorities to just uh give the warden's notice they refused so we are planning to go on a hunger strike  yeah fast unto death  when you'll start ? it was supposed to start from today but the managing committee has asked yes that give some more time to one word   yes   but don't you think that uh its good to uh  in to inform other hostelers also means some hostel one word  of other well the other hostelers can't do anything about their own hostel so why should they do anything about our hostel  you you should just just inform that these people no that was therefore i'll tell you one thing my hostel is far far better from the other hostel  uh ah atleast jubilee there used to be a time when jubilee was like that but jubilee couldn't two words  now police enters jubilee without much you know but in our case  it's impossible for the police man to enter but i think that uh there were people in jubilee case they they attracted with the hostel itself uh one word also and one word and they two have given some  some sort of uh statement in papers regarding the students   uhn  well in favour of the students first of all there is one thing we must easily understand that whatever was happening in jubilee was wrong  that there are boys who were staying there for six seven years and they have never been enroll in any uh department  it was a matter of fact that sort of   but do you do you think that this is the fault of the students only ? this is the fault of students only because  the students themselves  no no  authorities i suppose no no no if the students uh do one thing you know  they can't do anything they will just keep quite there are two types of students one is that uh cool type  he'll just go on with the studies and doesn't bother about what yeah exactly is going around other type is that type they'll just interact with those very hoodlums   yeah  yeah just to be on the safe side yeah yeah  now this is two types the cool type will never do anything and the hoodlums just doesn't keep quite but this at that time i think it is the duty of the authorities to just have the matter straight   i've heard that jubilee people even most of the jubilee people i'll say appreciated it  yeah particularly lot of uh the many guys who were arrested in mid-terms   no because the image so see the  that's important no but it never went to that created in the paper no no no now see in our hostel that is different  because we realise of course there are a couple of students we just  mean they just seem to stay without just listen this really is one very important thing that any uni uni university especially in post-graduate courses there is no clearcut i mean time limit for session  and so you see in hostel they will say you  no no no  there is a clearcut no time limit but   then only for those people   no   how only somebody has got some problem in enrollment  this is its only for those people who don't have much say  who can't shout it's only for those rules are there but they apply only to people who are how could people were living from six or seven years and nobody went and asked that these people were   because there is sort of gadbad  that does us that's it that does us they seem to take out a knife a few words   no it is no because even authorities what  i'm saying that the authorities were were the main responsible persons you see  that they did not take care of the hostel and after that when somebody is dropped there and it is there  no some personal interest that's why they  the authorities in the beginning for example take your  this pundit was there  yeah see what he is used to do he used to interact with those very people  and if he wanted to get somebody one word  going down in a very bad way  he used to meet them and he used to manage that  so he uh  no he was a but he didn't get one word in it he doesn't want their help because i've heard that he himself claim to be a goonda or something he was a  goonda  yeah yeah that's what i'm saying no he is not afraid of those people  yeah but the pundit he because of his own act he used to do it no he he used to take the help of those he he never he never did take help  i've i've heard there was one chap in uh  jubilee who said that uh i can't do anything about uh this guy uh pundit because see he has helped me he has given the hostel to this person who didn't have any right to the hostel he gave one word  to this person because of my one word  uhn but the thing is in our case that's it if its okay in that case the authorities is itelf responsible unless authorities  one word it is not corrupt they can't do anything  no but you see and students were supported students or you see a student cannot be a very gentleman  two words  no no i'll tell you in my hostel there are about  ten boys who are sort of dadas you can say clearcut dadas  and there are other one eighty guys one seventy guys you can say who are this cool type okay this ten people will go fifty people will be watching their particular programme on t v  and uh these ten people will go and they'll do all of a sudden they'll come without saying anything they will simply turn the channel to the particular programme they are are not   then you can thus agree it was the authorities were responsible there   wait wait  what happened is they will change programme and the fifty guys they'll just keep quite   it's not the fault of those ten guys it is the fault of fifty guys who just keep quite  why do they keep quite ? yeah okay if i want to watch that programme that is not my one word i have to fight for it yeah  otherwise i can't watch it  one word   yeah  yeah no doubt  there are two things only either you join those people  or you fight those people  no there are and one thing about those people is when they realise that somebody is capable of fighting them back they will just join him they will just keep him in means they have very good term with him all the one word which is temporary you know controversial matter laughs  no no no but after all i don't think it's a controversial what do you think about your department infact uh about your study and the way they teach students here ? well fine  yes  uhm it's okay  do you think that there should be something else which should be included  no i don't think  i think  it should be no no department okay syllabus is also okay  the teachers are okay  and they give proper only thing is that uh the avenue should be large avenue should be job avenues and all facilities there is no job avenue facilities are also okay i think no no facilities to students and those who get get the degree yeah they didn't have an opportunity there don't have any opportunity yeah  almost zero   that's why no instrumnetal motivation and just adding one word   laughs  a zero  that's very good  ah don't you think that the the teachers should continue this department uh during late evening too ? that the students come no it is difference difference in the students i don't think students feel that there is any need of it  yeah i think just two words i have been here now for i think three and half years and i feel it's okay  it depends on the students if you want to carry on studies you can just go to lab and study whatsoever you like and if you feel the need of they all think that we cannot study but they if they want to  co co consult he can he can consult i don't think there is any problem so far i've never faced any problem whenever i feel somehow i've gone to any professor and he has been very glad to help me  yeah i feel so i don't know 
see my name is susheela padmanabhan from cochin   i'd like to deal with agriculture in india  do you ?  uh  yes i feel that i'm interested in too  agriculture   too  then can you suggest to me something about  the development of agriculture during this age in this  age and this year ?  at this stage  no then  i think so that agriculture is not more important at this stage due to the uhn climate uhn  climatic conditions uhn because i found that before just two months back uh just one month time uhn  that it was not rain raining very heavily   uh see the monsoon was not that much perfect uhn  actually what the crops needed uhn i feel like that  uhn   uhn   uhn   uh   uhn   uh   uhn   uhn  uhm  but now it has uh the monsoon has started uhm  to a middle extend i feel  uhm  uhm uhn i'm going to talk about the development we want in especially in india when are  comparing india with other countries  i want to know more about the development how we can develop our own crops uhm  now it is we are depending more more for   on othe other countries we are depending now a days uhm  but i want to have idea how we can develop our agriculture in india with our own efforts  how we can keep our own crops means now a days that uh biological experiments are going on ahn and we are totally  changing our crops all this uh biological experiments we are grafting we are taking other crops uh to develop it more and more to uhm produce more size uhn uhm that you  may be knowing   countries   uhm   more   uhm   efforts   ahn   uh   uhm  but uh but i feel uhn you told me about the crop   uhm much depends upon the soil   uhn   uhm  soil  soil  uhn  okay each one soil differs uhm and each one chemical fertilizers differ  uhm  uhm  chemicals were being used uhm for growing the crops  uhm  yeah  i feel like that uhm uhm  if they depend on the high quality chemicals uhm  then the crops will grow better uhm i feel like that way   uhn and if they use uh just rough materials uhm i don't think the crops will grow uhm grow uhm  means this all depends on the materials uhm what they use  uhm   uhm   uhn   uhm   uhm   uhm   uhm  uhm but my opinion is know uhm  if we don't use chemicals ah also haan  we can uh keep our crops when we are during uh  twenty-five years back we are not much depending on the chemicals  uhm we are using that cowdung  i think   uhm   ah   haan   twenty-five years back ahn   uhm  cowdung and all we are using that one word uhn waste  uhn  waste materials waste materials uhm with that no if we   continues continue that only we can uh keep the fertility of the soil and we can keep the taste of that  uh vegetable or fruits  now a days we are not getting that taste which we were enjoying twenty-five years back  uhm   of the soil uhm   but  uhm  that taste is different and now a days is uh  taste is quite different  different   but now  what you know but now a days uhm they are using all the superior materials uhm because of that only the taste is going i see in olden days they used to use all old methods uhm now new methods have been started  uhm   uhm   i see   uhm  uhm  like uh that uh different types of water facilities and all uhm  due to that also and especially they use this different types of chemicals what they use uhn  rough chemicals uhn  in olden days what they used to use that cowdung manure   uhn and different types of soil  uhn  uhm  but now those soil also are not available i  think due to the uh this uh poverty and due to the soil is not levelled   uhn   that soil i know want  soil is not levelled here na   ahn  uhm i want to uhm have an idea uhm  whether we can go to the olden days agriculture is it useful to our  uhm  yes but i think so few of them follow this method   uhm few of them not to use the one word they don't  laughs even know use of the  uhm   yeah  i want  i feel like that yeah yeah  what is my opinion is no ah we can have the olden methods ah but in a modern type  ah   ah  way ah  in modern way   ah modern way  see uh dripping uh wat irrigation system we can use  irrigation system  yeah  and we can use this uh waste material of our things  what this uh waste of vegetables and leaves and we must keep in that uh cowdung cowdung and uh bio   waste kya hota hai   vegetables leaves and all   cowdung  bio gas  bio it is not bio gas  gas is also bio  this bio means  manure manure manure bio manure ah that cowdung if we waste uh which is decayed and we can keep those uh give those manure and uh that system we can  if we use no that taste the quality everything  if follows  uhm now what we are eating no just a waste   it is just of a grass it is i feel  it is  uhn it is quite harmful after your years uh the americans will only will prove that it is a poisonous thing after using this chemicals and all no you will become a uh this uh harmful only for our health  my opinion is that if we go to our olden days but in a modern way modern type type of irrigation or  irrigation we can use for dripping and all that is quite convinient  and useful for us ah  but manure which we use now a days we can change if we change that system of manure and if if we concentrate on this agriculture we can have our own india which  the gandhiji  type   yeah   ah  had started dreamt dreamt i would say it is not materialised  dreamt  uhn  it is only a dream of gandhi  if everyone uh instead of running beh uh  after this jobs and services and industries if we use our own india our own land for our agriculture purpose we need not depend on other countries for  food uhm that is my opinion  and from let it be we got small poor or rich if we concentrate our aim on this agriculture we need not depend on others and we can have our own things so  and uh this uhm my uh aim is know if we use all this without using chemicals more if we use natural manure it is quite good for our health for the taste uh that in india it is possible   dream of our gandhi   taking uh   india   food   ah yes natural manure   possible in in other countries it is not possible but in india it is possible uhm because it is each one in uh we actually we indians uhm use different  old things only uhm old material old manure all these things  many villages are using this type of old things so their crops are growing i feel like that way  uhm   uhm   uhm   growing but uh  now it has some no that  but  due to the temperatures no uhm due to the monsoons also uhm and due to the it depends how much  ma manure and all the this soil uhm mostly it depends upon the soil   uhm   uhm   uhm  uhm that is depend on the rain   that is the and rain soil uhm soil  and different types of manure uhm when these three things are used or levelled uhm when they are  put in a proper order uhm i feel there is no harm in agriculture  that is no harm in growing the crops uhm but these things must be in a right order i feel i feel like this   uhm uhm uh okay because all these three must three things must come in a right line then only you i feel that we can grow agriculture but i found some of them even though they are means even in their house they have a small crop they grow uh haan  kitchen garden   uhm   uhm   uhm   uhm   uhm uhm   okay   uhm garden   kitchen garden we can they do they even if there is no rain uhm  they just try to uhm store water for the crops to grow what they are making for their own livelihood  uhm for their own purpose uhm i feel like that way  now some people are doing like that way uhm  simply keep on buying buying then it is no means actually first of all it is one word   uhm   uhm   uhm   uhm   uhm   means there is some kind of satisfaction   yeah at the time same time we are   yeah   and you can say no that we are  have done our own with our efforts  uhm i feel like that way  making our   uhm  uhm  because we ourself are doing there uhm in our place uhm different types of uh this beans and all  uhm we have done  uhm   uhm   uhm  uhm  and it is growing uhm but we are doing   uhm when there is no rain uhm we are putting  laughs we are storing one word for the water and all   uhm like that way when we get proper sunlight  uhm heat soil monsoon all these things   uhm   uhm   uhm   uhm   uhm   now a days uh so many uh this inventions are there uhm we can heat we need not uh depend on sun now a days  if gardens are there we can ke uh keep the heat with the proper want those inventions are going on yeah and we can keep those heat temperature i mean  uhm   yeah  temperature and all temperature water we can give in time how much water that crop need   yeah exact   ah that only i feel all these when  you are have given everything in time know   uhm i think so then and india will become a prosperous country uhm in agriculture uhm then all these three things if they are looked after well uhm i feel that way uhm  even if there is no water uhm we can bring water from some dam storage or bring from anywhere and we can  cultivate the land   uhm   uhm   uhm   uhm   uhm   uhm   yeah yeah  and the cultivation is more   most important essential now  we can produce manufacture the  machines with the use of that mechanical technology technology with technology we can produce manufacture this machine but agriculture is we depend on other countries this uh inflation will go high high and uh it is not our  one word to meet all this expenses  after all uh   high   one word  there is some an indian uhm  means we have to depend fully on agriculture and we have to develop our land  we have to develop our cro crops  and in such a way that it is useful for the ordinary man man  common man can do this agriculture if all this uhm uh materials and all the soil   what is needed that if it is given we can cultivate the land properly uh and our uh people also should be very hard working  and especially  land properly   hard working  hard working makes more ah man yeah  uh ha happier life yeah i feel like that way  ah   yeah   yeah  uhn  when once you are hard working in your work what you do   uhm you will gain for what you have done yeah in the end  uhm   yeah  yeah and for health of the old man or medium man yeah if we start the agriculture no i i don't mean that it should go on the large scale if it is just you start from the small scale  large scale  you may have heard no  haan yeah even one drops make a a sea ocean  sea  yeah 
how was the day today ? for me not very well it's been like usual  what happened ? today also i faced the same problem with tenth standard  what was the problem ? these children though they are in tenth standard they are not very serious about their studies  they keep on talking mostly the back benchers  and there are some students who come from the aff  influential families yeah they also trouble the others   yeah  yeah  yeah  actually because we can't say anything we can't do to this people these children because they have their business and all that they are not more interested in studies and all that  yeah  they might be thinking that we carry the same business  keep on troubling yeah  yeah  so no need for study actually i've heard one of the boy no  actually he said that sir i have my father's  business i just come here see to pass my time   see  yes one word  so he is troubling the others  yeah their parents should be called but  that's why the others  the parent should be called and actually now we are going to call the parents you know after the first unit test result uhm so we'll call them  we'll talk with them   uhm  their parents come and sign the results no  ah actually the parents no we have not still given but the students for they have been troubling not only me other teachers also lot of time so from them we had taken in written writing  that they will never do such a thing and twice or thrice they did the same thing  but still we find their behaviour the same way no change  they themselves have given in written writing   when we reported to sir and madam  they said that okay we are giving in writing that we'll  not trouble any teacher we'll be serious about our studies   but the same thing we find still they are troubling  or they would be given by   even i face the same problem  when i punish the student their parents come and ask me why you punished the student  they don't want punishment to be given to their children and they don't  they'll take the side of their children   and they want uh only benefit means like making them uh improvements in their writings and yeah actually when the child is doing something wrong  then also you should not punish and uh  yeah they should study  yeah even if they get zero we have to grant them anyhow  marks yeah actually no they they won't study  because of the parents attitude no we find even the  childrens children behave the same way the students when we try to yeah they take it lightly say something yeah it is   it is of their benefit they don't listen  yeah benefit they don't understand the meaning of benefit i think   yeah  yeah actually now a days keep on just uh doing that whatever they want in their  yeah actually now a days we find mostly earlier the parents were not like this  yeah first they used to ask   they used to say beat us  yeah  but make the student even i find so many sa  but now a days the parents have just become the opposite yeah  now they say don't beat the children even if they are doing something wrong don't do anything  even now the now a days parents emphasise no  that my child is sick everytime yeah and he doesn't eat properly he keeps on playing if uh they will say this all   but they won't say that ki ma make him uh beat him or make him do whatever you want never  but they they have to pass   yeah   yeah  yeah actually now a days especially we find earlier it was different during our time our parents they used to come and tell the teacher yeah we know how we have studied yeah yeah but now today you find the situation totally different the parents they encourage the children  yeah  encourage means they won't be uh looking at what they are doing but if they have been  not to be beaten  in these things only they are encouraging  if this happens no  teacher beats the child yeah they will come to fight  they will come till to the principal  then they have to  yeah  yeah see we teacher have to and every time they've to scold us  and that's the thing that is the problem with me also  even i face the same problem but i try to tackle it you know with uh i've got some problems whenever i have  actually not in this earlier school no i had problems like this most of the students no they are just like hooligans and all that yeah  become since i've dealt successfully with some of the children see if we love them if we pamper a little   you had to do that na that is yeah no if we pamper them little yeah  but sometimes no we have to go out of our way  yeah for these childrens especially though others they will think that the teacher is going out of the way means we have to give them many means whatever at first they have not done home work   yeah   some punishment is required  no actually at first no for these children no we should not give punishment  we should pamper them a lot  then try to make them understand  yeah because they understand  ah now now once they come closer to us no then only we understand now in the tenth standard they are grown up they understand the meaning of punishment yes they feel some shameful about that punishment  no actually i'll tell you  yeah they are not ashamed i'll tell you because once  when we took from them in writing the next time they did the same thing so when madam came to the class she punished the whole class  and then means to make them that whatever they are doing they were standing on the bench to make ashamed we send eighth standard students just go and have a look at them and you know what was the remark of tenth standard what's  to us let them come and see  means that was their reaction  so they were not bothered   two words  yeah that was their reaction when this eighth standard students they came in class there no reaction they didn't felt ashamed nothing like that  in even my class  though they are small they are very clever  clever in the sense uh not in studies at all but uh they are doing co-curricular activities and all that  one word  yeah beating and everything and using and abuses that don't know what they are saying sometimes actually what's the thing you know the parents they don't respect the teacher so the students also don't respect  yeah in our cla  class i can make out what the parent might be speaking   because at time you see even the parents when they speak about the teacher in derogative manners yeah yeah  so the children learns the same thing same thing and so we have to just shut them and nothing  that's the state  yeah now a days the situation has just become so different that uh we have to bear even whatever they say i never beat a student never in my whole life  i've never beat a single student but now when i came to  third standard i can see that uh they are something different because they are never means uh guided in a way to how to behave or how to talk with a teacher atleast  whenever we are uh saying something they without thinking they say out the words now  even i never beat  without thinking what are the words  yeah  yeah and whatever i've written on the board they take out the meanings of that but don't understand what is the question what is the answer for that never  but take out other meanings from that means how clever they are mean uh means unwanted things they are clever  other one word   yes  yeah actually that's the thing suppose  they'll always see what's the mistake teacher is doing yeah  they pronounce one word   not even that if that were always they will be uh what's the teacher  one word  i will uh give marks for the student if he takes out my mistake but they don't even take that much of pains to one word   that is they try no always they try suppose the teacher is writing the chalk is not proper  it's not writing  laughs  yeah yeah it's making sound and all they  it's a funny idea  yeah they will start laughing and all that yeah even we feel one word they will keep on saying they are very particular about these things laughs  when you ask them question the whole class never even i can make out only few students   yeah those coming in five firstly i think those only will give the answers everytime ahn yeah and even during inspection and all they only are very active and particular their parents do come and meet me but yeah  uh about others maximum i can find that i can give the examples  these students never never bothered  yeah   yeah   yeah   yeah  yeah actually even i two words  but their parents whenever i beat them the parents came and ask me purposely why  and the same parents said unnecessarily you beat my child  even for me the other teachers first only they warned me yeah that don't beat these these these child  because as i'm new no they told me  because if you will beat even if they have done something  wrong   yeah   but we feel about them no something no action will be taken against that you will be the  person to be blamed  so the parents will come and they will blame you only   blames means uh we have to take the blame  sometimes we have to take the blame on that  i feel about that only not sometime most of the time we have to take   most of the time means yes that is true  but uh sometime for these students also we feel yeah  even madam has told me that some students are such you don't beat them  yeah  yeah but i feel somewhere if these are to be guided just now  this is the way see i had a show-down with yeah one of the boy no tenth standard i had a show-down  yeah  now tenth is a and then i told them okay because  he argued with me like anything as i was means equal to him  one word   one word  ah that way he argued with me so i said i will not enter the class till he says sorry to me i came back i didn't went to that class for two three days  then madam interfered that boy was called and he said sorry even when he said sorry he was crying then i told him i made him understand see i'm not happy making you say sorry to me  that's not the thing but you should means respect me as a teacher  i'm elder to you i'm not equal to you you can't talk me just like you talk to your friends or your younger ones you can't talk to a teacher like that way so i made him understand nahi  that but now a days i find him but it has one word   nahi  don't speak that way but atleast he should be clever   no actually what the thing you know  somewhere you know what the student they tell no at home they don't treat us like this  if we shout at him no means this very particular boy when i shouted at him no to other teacher he said at home nobody shouts at me  so what that means we have to behave just the way their parents behave at home yeah parents behave and uh parents should come to know  they expect the same behaviour  but how can we behave that way you would have called the parents you would have called the parents  no actually he himself said sorry   one word actually i find yes  because this is not proper   but we should actually  now a days i find him little bit one word he scores he pays attention  yours is tenth so it is nice but uh we said that   so it is yeah we can't help out means whatever the way their behaviour   yeah we have to deal with you have to make make them understand and one word  but in our class what happens being a third standard we  one word should guide   yeah   no actually no there has to be a communication with the students and the teacher i i find that i have a gap with my students  yeah because i cannot have a proper communication with them that is true   that's why no we can't understand neither they understand me and i also can't understand them that happens with every teacher and yeah   yeah that's the thing and if once we have this no full communication with one other two way communication  then only we can say that

in your programme in your course no we just have to prepare the journals and thereafter   but it is just like something like the postal same like the postal one  haan yeah so you can get the experience uhn  in our postal course we have to go to the some school and teach them and then they will give you certificate uhn from that school  uhn  okay  then i have to submit that certificate to the  certificate from where i did this postal course okay  this is the very uh aid uhn  but that way we will get the experience ahn  how to teach them and how students can encourage   ahn  no i think there may uh there may be such thing  that we have to take the classes but now as i am working here means working as a teacher then it will be not necessary to attend again further class yeah uh school or classes so uh even uh i mean uh  have completed the project and that journal and craft also  this saturday i think one lecture is there  i have marathi notebook uhn  but you don't understand marathi   no i can't understand marathi so that day only i find out so i thought ahn  but you cannot understand no  ahn  no they will give their notes no  they will give yeah institutional uh uhm one word  and now your when is your exams ? exams may be uh month of uh october last week or in the month of november in the first week  so i have to whatever i may be i had to prepare ready for the exam study hard have to study hard now we have to study yeah  in the postal course also we have to study a lot yeah we have to refer only one word to one word uhn too many things we have to do but its only that we can do in our convenience you can do it   it's not that we have to do one section today  uhn  and uh by this only every saturday classes and we have the course  so i think in ganpati also i too much tired and uh i'm  suffering from cold and fever  and yesterday i went to doctor for uh for this and uh  even cough was is also there  my younger daughter also suffering from cold cough  very horrible  only last week my father-in-law was not feeling well my mother-in-law was suffering one word  and my younger daughter also uhn one word   otherwise you can  uhn  yeah now no they are going to uh take the yeah yeah  collect laukik no today rickshaw is not there so they came his teacher so means uh i had to go early no one word   one word   yes yesterday we were we were having bissi  for for all our all of our society member this year also  yeah twenty members are there  and how many uh rupees ? uh hundred rupees we are collecting means totally two thousand we'll take out two names and then distribute the amount uh to two two members  then we have to prepare tea and biscuits  biscuits yeah  i have also bissis two hundred  rupees a bissi  yeah  then we have to means uh that prepare some heavy  fo food means pau bhaji ah and all that uh bissi and twenty rupees bissi  and there are fifteen ladies are there  ah  okay  so you will get three thousand rupees if you get them one word  means uh twenty ladies means uh meeting each other  its very nice no nice  so and there only is one word  in pratibha nagar also there are uh bissi  but i didn't take part  i had to well after my second delivery i didn't take  but it is very difficult to maintain two two bissis the bissi was fully programmed uhn  so it was in our home  uhn  means it may be of uh that breakfast also there yeah but when it is in our home it is a very big we have to prepare some one word  uh  one word food na  yeah  and what is your idea about taking uh uh means english talking classes ? what is your idea about english talking classes is there no  i don't no because i have no idea how they will teach and  it is it is uh school onwards i didn't get ahn  i don't have and i don't have experience  because so many will go uh no but that is that is another thing because so many one book is there no rapidex rapidex english speaking course no it is also nice uh but uh  that is a  the same thing if we can read the book in sometime  we'll go to class uhn  the same result only this conversation is not there  so many will uh rush to the classes but i think  classes is not uh proper because english speaking means it will come by practice yeah yeah i think so  yeah yeah 
hello my name is uh biradar  hello i'm mrs mamta raybage  and we are having a discussion on todays children and maths  so sir what you feel about uh todays children how they are in maths ? uh childrens are okay depends upon there coach  coach means they should be coached from when they are in nursery u k g itself  the basic of maths should be taught to them means they should be taught in a funful way about the numbers  they should be introduced to the numbers  so that they'll make make might be uh good in maths when they go in the higher classes  uh then it became this uh good  so then it became nice only otherwise they'll didn't follow what is maths  no means uh i wanted to say that uh they should be taught the basics of maths now i teach in fourth fifth and sixth seventh standard maths  the children are not quite good in maths  but why they are not quite good ? what do you think what more something else should be done  so that there maths will become perfect  uh suddenly it will be become perfect only  so it depend upon that uh their environment  and even home did condition also  if they be in always that this is one word there are   not improve no improvement only  no means they don't know no here i will not uh that think that students are very weak  actually they are good only  uh if suppose sometimes if they will not ge get good  uhm diagrams or  i see what actually i feel all the types only  but even the bases uhm for example write in numbers  write in figures which they are taught from first standard even uhm still they reach the fifth standard they don't know even the basics   uhm  so what we call to it here uh i q some students having different different i q  so some some of them if you told one time they are going to  uh understand quick and some of them  for three years sir they are going in the same programme  say from first second third fourth  ah  and till four years a child normal child take any normal child if he doesn't know the difference between thousand and ten thousands and crore  atleast the basic should be good of maths that is why  if the basics are not at all proper how can they uh do the eighth ninth and tenth standard sums  addition subtractions are the basics  so what do you think about that ? what else efforts should be done ? no i'm asking you because uhn that means here actually they must do more practice by doing more uhm either sums either that uh writing so they are going to improve  no uh  for example take seventh standard   i'm teaching there maths but i take each and every sum on the board i make the students do the sum on the board but uh i finished my portion in ten to fifteen days earlier  i take revision but still there are failures in maths  so you being a higher uh this teacher i'm asking you  you give me a the guidence on how should i prepare the students for maths ? because i'm taking fifth sixth seventh for the first time maths so you give me a the guidence so that  na let the number of student failing be less  i teach my best because i take each and every sum on the board i make them solve on the board i take tests also i take revision also what else should i do ? one week i go on with only four to five lessons i have done  so what guidence you may give for that   no by doing more practice we can improve otherwise only that one time it is not possible  means what else should i take ?  i'll take tests also  i have to take make them i keep i competitions between the girls and the boys also  ah ha   i  ah so if it uh if you teach that is in one day  so you can take out there again give the same sums  all type of students some normal medium and uh extraordinary  the extraordinary they are going to take up quick only  and uh med medium class they can't understand soon  and you join with that one that uh brilliant one that medium  and so they are going to that means one by one they are going to discuss and suddenly they are going to improve  and we must do uh like before that you told that regarding competition uhm that is essential competition that   uhm  no because i take competition between girls and the boys i make one boy solve if he doesn't no i make one girl solve  let the competition spirit be between the both but even though in for having such a lot of efforts on them  still in their paper they have done nil might be my paper was hard  because i didn't  ah now  and i don't trust in giving the paper sums for revision  papers we can't say hard only because they already taught that same  no same matter i have taught only just i have i jumbled up the numbers here and there  all the sums were there in the text book itself but still they have not done properly in the exam  now what else guidence should i give because   this week   ah that   in that case we  in that case you must improve their writing only  writing and uh uh exercise   means they do the same exercise in classwork they do the same exercise at homework  they do it on the board also  means what do you think that the basic itself is not good or  now they are getting interest in maths  no by doing these all uh that means taking uh test and uh that this way they are going to improve and we can't say within that one month either this two month they are going   not one month now two to three months have become the school has started we finished our first unit test also  no afterwards that they are impro going to improve suddenly laughs so step by step  our fifth standard also is giving problem  do you know even they write one word  not even that fifth standard so all the side even higher classes also the same problem  even if we've given many times they can't understand  and if once one time if they understood they are going to tell soon they are going to understand  when after that one week either two weeks leave they can't   again the excercise because that means uh  they'll have one word  then uh repetition is not there when we left other that four five days we even that it is uh we can't tell express our views one word  but how come we will be every time doing the same thing  we have to complete our portion within time isn't it ? and again hammering the same and same and same sums we should complete our portion also we should have all the revision also  how is it possible sir ? so in only one week daily we must do one one sum  on that all exercise  sir we are having only half an hour period sir how come its  uh possible to do because in one week time we're having seven period of maths isn't it ? uhn and in seven period atleast we should complete two to three excercises in seven period  one exercise teaching and doing the excercises and their homework and their classwork then assignments are also there  and completing this much is impossible sir everytime to do one exercise one sum na of each exercise  even it is not possible by even in school also but in home parents they must take interest  that is the main thing na here that would again the main thing that they don't take at all interest in the  their children at all  if both husband and wife are working husband should do  no both not only husband he should help na laughs  he should help in their   because if they are working both they must do both  and it is not possible uhm either that uh one side only either husband or wife who who is getting that but no sir when time when both of them reach home okay the first thing is the wife should get up and make tea for her husband why ?  it's not like that that   no that is not rule no no no no  it's like that sir  never a husband says that i'll make a cup of tea okay you sit i'll make a cup of tea never he says everytime a wife should get up and make  both works same hours isn't it ? both of them are uh earning ah both of them are earning for the same house  ah i  okay it depend upon that even that wife also  if she did no smoothly one time two time he is going to observe  and why if she she prepared and she can't give that daily i'm  preparing this way that way uh if if she started like that only saying then he will never do  husband no i'll do i'll prepare it if she told and uh suddenly no with you so i'll  prepare he is going to say that  it depend upon their that uh  but i don't think that any husband is willingly saying that that i'll come to okay you sit for a while i'll uh prepare a cup of tea for you  indian husbands don't think like that you see so  no no it depend upon that   no no don't don't two words  uh not indian husband that depend upon that uh one word woman  no no  it also depends upon the atmosphere in which they live  because when husbands don't see their fathers working they also don't work in the house  my husband doesn't work at all  he never prepares a cup of tea he never does anything  sir sir you prepare tea ? oh yes yes laughter i prepared as so your wife is quite lucky na having you as a husband sir laughs  no that uh here was that uhm understand between both the  husband and wife  and even she is helping that all at my  in what ? uh that uh in home even uh one word she is also engaged in that uh regarding home uh uh two words this way  so we two we help in that she is also get relax   no but they say na even now  for example take that the husband doesn't work at all okay the boys one word doesn't work at all and then he gets married okay and he works  and that time the in-laws start blaming that ahn when you get married you start working this and that and he stops  like that is also they do  it may depend upon their parents  no but why do the uh husbands again change a lot ? they never change  they change sir how come you say like that  when everytime you're no it is not possible for your husband okay to do the work he is also tired we are also tired isn't it ? so for this we say sometime to do something  i don't think that he says generally yes come on  i'll do it  some once in a while once in a blue moon they help they say that okay okay i'll do but regularly a woman have to work in the kitchen isn't it ? actually that is indian concept what you say that uh uh that you'll that man that one word that okay okay indian culture says that women should work   yeah isn't it ? she should cook she should look after the children it's  alright  but even if they women is are working as much as a man she is earning the same uh monthly saving as a man itself  then why should he not work at home ? isn't it the ego of the man in which i'm trying to one word   yeah   no he must work if they are working both the side both husband and even she is getting the same equivalent to him and there is no difference between a husband and wife because that  that two are equal weight only  but they don't think na indian society never thinks that man and woman are equal  ninety-nine percent of them say that women even if she works for the whole day she has to look after the kitchen only alone laughs but don't you think that they are uh changing now  this is changing that only i'm saying sir but not uh only sir  might be in a society seventy-eight percent sir or the in-laws say that two words  see for example uh my wife uhm i mean i do a lot of cooking uhm i enjoy it that's all but then now that i've become a little old <{3  uhm i feel it is difficult to do see i do my one word in the department uh i do my work and when i come back in the evening  and when i feel very tired i may even sleep  so now i'm sixty-five sixty-two now  but then you know when i was young i used to go uh i mean my wife she does not work  she has not work but she had four children   uhm   uhm   uhm 
uh let me try with myself   i'm dr mrs parekar i am working here as lecturer from five years in the department of history and let me her introduce herself myself dr padmaja patil  uh working in the department of history from uh eight to nine years uh sometimes as a research assistant and afterwards that is from from four years  i'm working as a lecturer in the department of history  she is very close friend of mine sir uh and here is different uh in our to the opinion no opinion but if she says sir that is she is uh all they are living in the  one word  and i'm living in the dhule area so laughter  no if give different in friendship sir  no no  it is not making but it is uh uh giving some uh alternate shape to thinking i think so no ? uh because there are so many problems in uh villages that i'm same we are working in same place    that's very good oh  but there are so many different problems and so many different thinking  uh in that different categories and different social views sir  and she will talk about something no ? no apart from that we are good friends na   nai that's not a problem  and no she came from different background i came from another background uh  but still on some problem specially women problem   haan this is the very current and controversial issue in this country uhm we know but considering that point our views are equal our views are similar i think uhm  so uh  let us talk on anything because we are friends in that context   uh  so uh for let us start from this department uhm here uh you are teaching so many papers no ? so out of that which paper do you like to teach more ?  uh   haan   uhm   uhm   uh   uhm  i want to like because uh my specialisation in modern india uhm and i want to study it and i want to dis discover out some research work on the modern indian history uhm  mainly on the uh problems of women and recently there was some uh women problems and there is uh women policy uh that is uh declared by government of maharashtra and there are so many problems related to the village woman particularly and these women uh village women are not knowing anything about it now because of it  uhm  just just a minute uhm uh i'm interested to know whether in your syllabus the paper which you are teaching uhm modern indian history is there any topic which has been uh recommended   uhm by the committee specially based on women problems ?  uhm   uhm  yes there are a all in all indian history from ancient to modern yes there are one topic uhm in every paper in ancient indian history in medieval indian history in the uh peshwa period or we can say in maratha period yes yes and also in the uh modern indian history but in modern indian history specially it was concentrated that is their development and social movement in nineteen century women problem in maharashtra all over india in bengal movement and there was young one word movement coming from england and the rajaram mohan roy it's progress and then he was discussing thinking his views on that and that uh topic is here in the modern indian history  yes   uhm   yes yes  okay it means you think that as the topic has been included here  so our students they will learn they will come to know about the problems of women in india   uh  but do you think that these uh problem of indian women especially uh  it has its roots right from ancient period because i'm  teaching ancient indian history and i'm interested in it so when we start from the age of vedas uhm or more than that if we uh goes back to much earlier period no doubt  indian history goes back to much earlier period  but right from the age of ri rigveda i have ample truth that the status of women or the position of women uh it has been fixed uh  manhje though the people say that in the age of rigveda we don't get secondary status of women or like that but i don't agree with them   manhje though there are references to  gadgi and maitreyi and  so many women those who are uh tho  those uh got the opportunity to learn but apart from that in uh considering with vedic sacrifices and all other things i feel that status of women was secondary and vedic age was a base manhje when we come to modern indian history or modern civi uh how complex is history  uh   uh   uhm   maitri yeah   women's status   no that was uh  medieval indian history also yeah because of the invasion of the moghals no i know very little about medieval period   during that time also there was also supression of woman because of the that that is the invasion of moghals in india and that was mainly on in north india because they invaded south afghanistan and two words because that impact was on north india mainly that was not in south india so there was so many other societies which were women apart from other field no doubt there are some impact on all religions on caste and on this religion they were started the purdah system  uhm not giving exhibition to the women and during that in the home only not giving outside them permission to go outside that was the same thing in medieval period and when there was started modern indian history and then new ideas came from west  therefore some impact in the thinking of our individual that who were taken the modern indian education that is not english education and because of there was something strange in nineteen century and that was concentrated in our syllabus only okay in this way we have added all these things in our syllabus uhm that our student manhje   uhm our syllabus had been constructed in this manner that right from ancient period to modern period the students should have a link link manhje   uhm   uhm   link  what is the development of one's   haan when we talk on once  haan  when we talk on or linking between the development of women from ancient to modern till now  and they have concentrated they have to work on that research or anything or thinking because uh historian or any man living in this time thinking about the ancient period and he is linking the scene between the things happened on the human behaviour or the development of human behaviour  that is most important thing also   yeah yeah  no considering uhm this syllabus we are   uhm uhm quite satisfied uhm but uh have you seen recently the various types of advertisements on the t v and  uhm   uhm   uhm   there are so many advertisements  haan but considering that i feel that  uh we are deliberately making haan   the status of women secondary  haan   women   haan  means how the standard of uh women has been exposed there i don't like this that is the commercial purpose no ? in commercial purpose every company or every advertising expose a bit thinking only benefit of their product  manhje for every and because of that because of they are doing and we are permitting them always because one lady has even that uh photo copies no ? yeah manhje  that is why our main impulsion we are giving we are also contributing them  that is very recently that  madhu sapre is that  indirectly  madhu sapre is one of the representative of us  no doubt she is a model no after all laughs  but she is representing us no  although expressing   we can't change yeah we can't change her views though she afterward thinking about that i'm  not doing it purposefully and that is  but that is purpose commercial she wants to acquire money by that way   yeah  look commercial purpose is okay i can understand it but on one side you say that women lib when we talk of women liberation and secondary status of women and on other side we are allowing them ah yes to express to expose  ah yes   nai nai women is permitting them gents yeah even well they are taking such a poses and such photos if she denies it  how they were able to take it  because if you will look at all the ac actresses   uhm mainly marathi actresses they are that mamta kulkarni and shilpa shirodkar   uhm   always there is a rule it is a shameful thing i think manhje  it is shameful laughs thing but it is yeah being men focussed by men but ladies also giving  pro protection by girls also that is they want so uh become something hero  and because of that they exposing even they themselves only  uhm no but uh what is your experience about your uh village ladies and village girls specially uh village girls those who are taking education now a days no what is the problem women only then one uh thinking going on in the mothers of that girl that there are so many uh one word  changes no not changes and because of that my son will marry with educated person  changes  okay and so she will take the education that is not another thing because educated uh b  bridegroom want the educated girl because they mostly live in city and there is a a natural feeling in the all girls and also their mother and family members in their mind that there was a well behaved educated and there must be well man must be working in the city level not in the villages because there are so many problems in villages there are so many they send that girl in the farm  they don't want no ? because of that each have a feeling going on that uh girls must be given some higher education till their marriage not for there one word that is wrong that is not  because she must marry with doctors so they are permitting them to go into medical college for d h m h or b a m a only that one  they are not giving development to their career that is my point  no but you feel that all these new ideas and this modernisation in every aspect uhm manhje  not only considering pressure uhm because village girls they are more modern they are making quite modern now a days   uhm  not like but uh this modernisation of thinking in that context i am talking  so whether they uhm they are well acquainted with these ideas  because all women are like this  uhm   uhm   they are   uhm  never never because there is a lack of one word  lack of rea reading there are no never they a book  though they are uh matriculate  they never read any paper any book any magazine only they sometime go into the meetings that is the uh some uh festival   ahm they have t vs and   no uh no but i think the impact of television  on a village woman   television that is quite high   manhje at every evening that after completion of their   that is not changing in the thinking ability it is changing in the only their uh entertainment   yeah  they want entertainment  haan   not actually one word   they just want these movies and when the news will start they will just stop   will stop haan  they will stop the t v and they will go for their work in the house   yes  they only they will see movies and dancing programmes and other programmes like this some uh good family programme   programme  they also thinking about their they are inte interested only with this   that is not emotional feeling that is emotional feeling only    reading habits must help because of the feeling isn't yes what do you think   ah haan   yes  yes uh uhm that is why if anyone that is a   uhm     uh   easily stopped na not in this context nobody is reading now a days  that is not the case with village girls or village women  in cities also you know i feel uh this uh problem mainly with my son  now he is in in uh third standard  but uh just from seven or seven-thirty he used to sit  uh with the t v and used to see the programme every programme upto eleven pm  in our village also we have started uh one uh personality development class for some a ten year students uh in the village but never the students went there because he wants only t v  they never goes there  in any one word or any social or even they not in this for playing also  they are their interests are also  so this is a common problem common problem or   manhje impact of t v in this aspect that is it uh if it is a good impact then ah then we would not have talked like this  yeah and there are so many english programmes and english movies and all these things are very nice on the t v after ten  but uh they never uh because they want to go in the farm tomorrow morning and so they were   are going to sleep at eight o'clock laughter  after completing the marathi and other uh that is a  provincial movies and all the things     they don't they don't go     yeah  but nobody is well acquainted uhm with the  current problem of the women again this is my opinion because uh day by day when we look at the newspaper and when we look at the number of this dowry cases all these oh yes  burning down the girls and burnings of the women so that's  number is increasing on one side and on another side  that attraction   uhm   problem     oh yes   and they   and here  not only cities but in villages also there are every mother wants that she will give more and more to her daughter in comparison with others  that is their thinking and because of that they demanding that uh from husband that we want to one word we have to give it  because it is our duty  we have we must have satisfaction to our uh daughter we must satisfy our daughter  and daughter is also demanding there is not feeling that my mother is fa father is not he he's giving it is not enough but they are demanding

uh today i came to department at eleven fifteen what about your refresher course you wanted to go ? no no  do you thing that refresher course serve the right purpose  yes some refresher course serve the purpose  but what about the most of the refresher courses ? most of refresher courses are uhm not conducted on u g c pattern  therefore the purpose which  purpose is defeated uhm  isn't it true with also post graduation teaching ? uhn ? isn't it true with post graduation teaching ? see if some senior persons uh attended this uh  refresher course or gave lectures they are going to be  benefitted to even p g teachers uhm personally i'm saying that refresher course  these are very frustrating  no no and then in same way the my experience is not that  i see  because you know when uh i've been in dharwad   uhm there are some very good uh resource persons   uhm  uhm  they say like on many knotty problems like uh  a few words and ashoka inscription so there are some one word where refresher are useful to even p g teachers  no even i had a very good experience at in bombay  uhm  but if you take into consideration the overall picture in india  haan overall be specially in northern india uh th this refresher co courses are not conducted  very well  whole purpose is defeated whole they had even uh some refresher some university is even this uh the people would've remained absent and they give these certificates for example this uh indore university and many others  it is waste of time  yes the labour of time has one word money  is not money  and the basic purpose is not served yes i agree with you on that point  even their teaching at post graduate level it is so frustrating particularly use of english medium   english  because generally many of the students they offer uh marathi medium  so the point is whether we should switch over to english   uhm or whether the university should uh uh incorporate teaching into marathi language   uhm   uh no it would be better to teach in marathi but then because the majority will two words in ninety-nine uh people percentage they offer marathi medium  only one or two students uh if he will be outsider or non-maharashtrian he only offers english now what is the purpose purpose of teaching in english  english but in that case the university education will uh  lose its uh national uh no only maharashtra one word  marathwada nagpur yes  uh offer this marathi in which in instead of english they  teach in marathi they have to teach in one word  but thereby they will lose the national character  how ? that boys from karnataka they can't come to maharashtra or the maharashtrian can't go to but even in uh foreign countries uh they teach in this their mother tongue no  but the problem with india is of uh more of linguistic problems  we should have to have some common language  and that apart we don't have the teaching material in regional languages  yes but that is not the problem even in japan russia they  teach in their own language  but japan doesn't have the linguistic adversity as much as we have  you know we have no common language no except hindi or this  e e english  even this hindi was is opposed in uh south india  uh considering all this problems what i feel that we should have english for higher education isn't it ? but some nationalist leaders they oppose now this uh in  teaching of english  that is the problem with our whole education yes  structure   yes  yes  we just carry on the show  show yes  but the purpose is always defeated  defeated uhm  so what else we can do ? just to rise over this frustration  we don't have the uh satisfaction work satisfaction  yes  but we have no other alternatives  i think that is case in every department of our life not in the department but all over india also this problem all we are facing  the question of the work culture is never promisive  yes yes  but it is good thing that uh we have some modern transit here laughter uhm study the art he scored more and this one word  and intellectual  now he's uh uh facing his first uh examination coming november  yeah but you also must have helped him as a parent  yeah that support we give i brought books uh then tuitions and all other things  but the hard work is also credit goes to my student only  because he studied hard  but beside the financial support one needs the moral support too that you must have done we extended it  we both parents my wife and i  then we create this uh convinient uh atmosphere at home also not disturbing him in on any issue  right from the beginning he was punctual in his study  he got up early in the morning at five o'clock then he  one word in throughout the year  what was that  total two words  uhm he scored sir ninety-seven marks for two words into now he is in miraj in government medical college miraj  because again there is this preference for uh  one word  out of hundred uh seats uh only twenty-four seats are open  remaining seventy-six they are alloted to this category or other category  only twenty-four seats are open to these students  and his uh number was ninety  and how is your daughter ? daughter is fine  uhm i have not considered her anything to do if she likes arts she can go in for arts if she is interested in medicine she will go in for medicine  but actually what i'm telling her that you just go on working hard don't think of uh reservation or that sort of thing  my second son is also clever  he stood in uh in the first two words  he is studying in tenth standard  he is included in scholar batch  in scholar batch also he topped first uh in this uh first test semester  that is also true of her she stood first in her school but at the same time she did not only study but also participate in other curricular activity curricular activity in sports  she is active one word  she is more active  expected in one word  yes so i always tell her that percentage is not that important but the knowledge is very important my younger son is also allround allrounder   he took part in the sports games  he is good uh swimmer he is good runner he is playing cricket football   in on teachers day he become a various teacher  i think only that much we can do for our students  yes  because reservation or no reservation is not in our hand so only we can give some kind of confidence in them and provide this sort of uh guidence to them if you work hard  some day you will are bound to be rewarded  and reward come in their own way  not necessarily that everything they should hard work is essential  hard work is  to get any success  and positive attitude is also very important  one shouldn't get frustrated or disgusted because of this reservation policy  yeah  they always say that there is always a room on the top  place on the top  because now a days there is a lot of competition in every field  competition is there but this competition is not healthy  often it is manipulated competition   sir sir one word this uh  reserved candidate uh of fifty-five percent of student he get uh this seat to m b b s  but open candidate who who secured more than ninety-one  competition is   one word  correct  private college uhm  private colleges  no no in the government college this reservation due to reservation uhm  but open candidate even ninety-nine three he will not get   uhm  now as we say that the purpose of refresher course is defeated the same the purpose of reservation   this is also defeated  they go to delhi   it's a one word college not a one word  and it is aimed at electoral benefit  all our education policies should be over hauled  yes  now a days  this is in our country this is because the government take the popular decision yes  government doesn't stick to some basic level of standard or basic criterias  there is so much uh corruption in education too  yes there actually that in a every uh  so we study only for the sake of examination  examination not for the knowledge   examination  knowledge  and the examinations are because the students study only this uh superguide  they don't attend lecture  they were not uh punctual in their attendence in the class  they don't read any english book  they don't take notes in the class  they only depend on this uh uh super guides or the shortcomings  these are the bitter truths of a democracy yes  since all the elements of uh democracy are manifested in indian experience yes  but even though the uh all these are two things india is a great democracy you see in the world  that is it has played ourselves but in reality the experience is totally different  uhn that is  in every country this problem of this uh corruption  is going on  in every country particularly in russia  now other day i the political and other economic condition is worse than india in russia  no corruption is uh everywhere corruption one word  but the degree degree varies in western asia the religion uh west asia religion is very important for them  the islamic pe people they don't want any change  islamic nations they are static they don't want any change  any progressive progress  in comparison between muslim country india is better  other day i happen to see the list of uh ten countries in the world  where there is least corruption  the list is published in times of india  and what is the number of uh our  there is not a single city from india  i think only one asia i think japan yeah and singapore feature in that  yeah  no corruption there  corrupt it is easy to do themselves uhm in those cities  there may be corruption but it is not that uh problematic so the businessman they all of prefer that city  uhm  what is uh solution for to overcome this corruption ? in our case the democracy has attempted to the problems of corruption for example our problem in educational field  mostly they come from the one word uh elections for the academic positions whereas in america there are no elections for academic position academic position   two words the criteria in college uh  teachers are bound to be elected 
 laughs  both of you how do you find this your course ? well clears her throat it's quite interesting i mean uh like uh when it really comes to  practical point of view it's quite interesting  now at the moment we are just uh blindly studying regarding all the uh how the uhm dental materials used and how are the  things that are mixed together  and like what are the materials that are used for dentures and what are the materials that are used for fillings and everything  mixing dying and then setting them everything we are dealing in  dental material  whereas this is a such a bore   i'm in final year but like they have started from first year itself  so that we get a whole round uh must have point point of view regarding the subject  then uhm then regarding anatomy and then physiology and all that we come to know whether uh structures that are present anatomically and then physiology means like whether the system are  working and how how does it  suppose for example in digestive system like how does it get disturbed or how does the liver works and all those things we study in physiology  and then though they are like we find it quite dry at the moment but when it comes to the clinical when we see the patients and when we deal with the patients then it's quite interesting i mean  so you have started dealing with your patients and all ? no no we are uh just starting to face like we are in first year  so clinicals we start from third year onwards  so we are looking forward for training  so like your practical is still with like how is your  what is the process of your practicals ? i mean uh in third year or you mean in  every year every year we have got different practicals   no right now so far  suppose for physiology also we have uh two practicals like  amphibian and human physiology  in human physiology we take the samples of the blood and then we test the blood and then we count r b c count then w b c count then  like uhm after that we see the hemoglobin one word  and then differential count in w b c  all these things we count  that is to we take on the coughs our human blood itself  then in amphibian practical we dissect the frog  then we try to see the models which then the oscillation and then one word of uh nerves and everything  so that comes under physiology and bio-chem we have separately done like how are this uh  proteins and nutrition differential bet between the unknown solutions  they will give us some unknown solutions and we have to do the  experiments until we found out whether it's protein or whether it is carbohydrates or sometimes urea uh uric acid all those things  it's uh chemistry lab ? yeah it's done in separately in chemistry lab  so how many practicals you have ? how many practicals uh like for physiology we have  two practicals and bio-chem we have one practical and we have dissection in anatomy that's also a practical like  and then uh we have for physics practicals where we  like finding the cast and out of cast we have to form uh make display and although the display we equip with uh wax ring   like so those are some models like we have to know from now onwards so that is in practical practically in uhm for physics  so you are in second year now ? you are in second year ? yeah  then like uh after your after you finish your degree what is your further plans ? well if i get through perfectly you know i mean good colours then i would like to go for my p g and that's post graduation in we have got seven different uh like uh departments so in each department we can chose whichever you want to do specialise  yeah that's specialise  so i want to do in ortho  what is ortho ? ortho orthodentia that is uh they put braces and all those things  and what about chandini ? so far how is your ragging ? laughter  ragging laughs fine  cough  no you just tell like how your seniors used to rag you your classmates and  no they used to ask us about our biodata no ? and they uh make us sing and then dance  they are also enjoying uh we are also enjoying  so you also you enjoyed ragging  ah ha   what so what sort of ragging they used to ? mentally not physically and not physically  recording broken or a long pause  so uh what i mean what do you think about the people in india ? i mean here in hyderabad the people are it's  okay they are nice  i mean uh my friends they are friendly and uh used to help me a lot in my work  and this just a one uh one month back time i am here in hyderabad  so i have made friends with uh some of my classmates  and uh so so to say friendly and laughs  helpful yeah yeah helpful  usually the people here in i mean down in south they are very helpful yeah south but what i find the difference in  according to any i mean only in south eastern they are like in bangalore where the people are quite different like they are helpful as well as they are quite broadminded and they are quite friendly with the people and i mean i mean the environment is so different from hyderabad yeah whereas hyderabad the people are more conservative and like they don't like to go out even or at the first move they don't like to talk with people also  but whereas when they really come to know the people they like to help the people  then uh for example like whereas in bangalore you go out in shorts or even the females go out in shorts or anything like that they don't mind  i mean they are more advanced in all those things and then  whereas in hyderabad if you even wear a skirt even like then they give a good i mean back stare at you and you feel out of place like when you wear all those stuff  then you feel that okay somebody is observing me so much and you feel uncomfortable in all those things  whereas in bangalore you are free like  i don't think people will be least bothered like even if you go  almost like a naked female and laughs  so those are the difference according to the places also and whereas in madras when you can see the people are i mean what to say uh they are still yet to build up in all those things  atleast in hyderabad it's i mean they have become more modernised like in comparatively in twin cities like in secunderabad also the people are quite different and the girls and the boys all they are more modernised than in hyderabad whereas in hyderabad they still have the old cultures and so many things that even the parents they don't even let the girls talk with the guys  it is hidden talking like they get a good punch at home or something like that laughs  but whereas in secunderabad they are so fast they even go for  pubs and discos and here and there clubs and then so many other i mean extra curricular activities are going on  but whereas in hyderabad they are only stuck with their books and home and work that's all like  there is a lot of different difference  between these two twin cities itself  so then comparitively to north south is quite to see in study point of view south is quite good  whereas in north there is lot of activities may be it's  due to the influence of the tourist people from different countries and  all those things  so in north i should say they are more advanced than in study point of view they are not that uh good as good as in south so i mean that is the difference i find between this uh north and south  and what about ragging difference between north and south ? well the ragging in south is quite i mean quite cool i should say because you don't have any physical torturement or anything like that  they just ask some simple questions regarding your biodata  then your hobbies then they may ask you to sing a song or dance or ask for a treat   that's the maximum they do here  but whereas in north they literally kill the person like you know most of the people who who go to north for medical studies they are really scared  i don't want to go there because they are physically tortured like uh sometimes they even ask them to go the morgery and at midnight twelve o'clock whereas everyone is so scared like  laughs  yeah and thinking about dissection hall itself they really get scared and that also in the midnight uh   haan  so they asked them to go to the morgery whereas  in the morgery even the fresh bodies are i mean kept  so sometimes they i mean they ask the students to go to the dissection hall and identify so many things  at the same time some of their same collegues they must be hiding i mean lying down in the stretcher and they just wake up suddenly so  there was were two cases in north that two persons had died because of this type of ragging yeah yeah  and then it has been so far yeah  so far what i have heard is that in north they have asked uh  a guy they gave him uh a huge i mean piece of uh soap and they asked him to they gave him some specific time and asked him to take bath and finish that soap  well that guy he was finding very difficult to do that and he tried his best to finish that soap  so by the time he finished the soap he was admitted in the hospital   accha  that that serious he became  then uh there are so many serious ragging done by the seniors in north  but whereas in south like i feel the lecturers and the professors  whoever in-charge then the principal they are controlling the students in that point of view  but in north they are not bothered like they just leave upto the students  so the seniors really torture the juniors and  i mean they find it difficult to stay there so many students have left their course just because of ragging   so   and so far like what i have heard about uh  one college is that one guy was asked to go to the ladies hostel   haan  uhn the warden was a spinster so like  he has asked the guy to i mean the senior has asked the guy to go it is panties along alone like to go early in the morning and ask her what did she do with her husband the previous night  so at the same time like he refused to do  so they asked him to stand at the college gate with the panties alone uhn  so that that was when he became mad  and he is really a mental off the person now at the moment so those are the differnces you can find like how badly they are ragging in north and south  south how lenient they are  so what you like ? do you think that there should be ragging or not ? well in my point of view okay ragging means what they are doing in the south i really appreciate  unless you rag your junior by asking so many i mean whatever you want to ask that junior never bothers to say hi  even like in their later life like when the college goes on smoothly like  so in that point of view ragging is good  what i feel is so that you get to know the junior and the junior comes to know who you are and what a person you are  then you can have a healthy friendship i should say like  i mean the ragging should be quite healthy not i mean not unhealthy one  so champani you are new to this place ?   yeah  how do you find the college and the ragging towards you ?   the college is uh it's nice uh but living in so far is not so one word no ? yeah    the place is it's quite nice  so first day of your dissection when you saw the dead bodies how did you feel and when they showed you the i guess they must have have shown you the morgery where they have preserved the dead bodies  how they are preserved ?   yeah  so how did you find all those things ?   on the first day i was very scared even to touch the body  na  so how do you feel now ?   ah i don't feel anything now  i am sure you must have uh washed your hands at least  ten times before eating after touching the bodies  laughs     yeah    yeah it's so smelly no  ah then how about now you wash atleast once ?  laughs  because now we have one word   you don't wash you don't wash now  yeah there are students who doesn't wash at all and eat food because they are so used to it  ah ha i mean just an ordinary wash okay you rinse your hand in the water end up but you know it become so casual like yeah  but the first day when you go for a dissection or when you just touch the dead bodies you feel something and then when you go back home you specially wash your hands in the dettol atleast for ten times and you just keep on rubbing your nails and clean everything and you know that's how it happens but slowly you became like used to all those things 
hello  hello shastri here one minute hello uh you are speaking one word  i just i arrived at uh twelve o'clock  i see  by the time i came here it was almost two i see i have been ringing what was there any problem or uh  no the telephone misbehaves oh i see i thought so actually ah yes  it misbehaves ah ha so uh is rajalaxmi yes she is there okay one minute see actually ahn i mean i brought some  pills and some see capsule ah which her gave me  ahn   ah   haan   that's why i was calling from four o'clock i am actually going away by eight eight thirty train okay  uh leaving dadar mahalaxmi  okay   haan  so i was wondering ah uh i mean it's  already six thirty or past that isn't it ?

did you go to this uh meeting on fifteen   fifteen yes ahn ah kadepurkar  see we were we carried work home and this glossary and all that  ahn  uhm  finally there were other changes some rejection uhm uhm  and uh unfortunately there was no electricity nothing you know uhm  there was a total breakdown  uhm  oh i see we were to continue the next day  haan haan  but then there was this holiday and one word strike really so even the s s c board people were going to be away  uh  oh i see so it was the meeting went on upto five o'clock in that sultry heat  and then we i returned home means in the evening   haan haan  was there any any decision about another meeting uh ? yes eighteenth july is the what you call the first language  haan  then third or fourth july the third language third language and uhm this did that uh apte lady come  yes she came  haan haan how how did she of course she was very quiet probably she was just getting to know things yeah haan  and uh she didn't look that one word type   yes that uh   yes  yeah yeah  i was made to believe she would be   worry oh or worried okay uhn well uh everything was fine   i think i think she is not bad  no anyway i don't have to work with her i know i will be in other group i know but even then she didn't seem to be one of those one word though she has lot of weight to throw around  no doubt no doubt i mean may be she has  she is  she is physically very fat   laughs  i see is it no you haven't seen her  i have seen her but i've normally may have  may have put on some more weight in the meanwhile  oh she is quiet bulky yeah  no no no  because it is almost two years since i saw her three  or two or three years  three  ahn  because i i am one of those unfortunate people   haan who have been responsible for uh awarding ph d to laughs so many   haan   ahn i see actually i looked into her thesis also oh i see and that must have been three years ago  haan because i see   and i had gone i felt a lot of consolation looking at her size  laughs  come on and so she has a lot of weight to throw around and she did  laughter  she was good ah and then uh i see some passages were rejected  ah  ahn  and then   from the ones which we had already taken yes yes and then some in some cases  kadepurkar you know see another thing is he is conducting the whole procedure in marathi   oh how unfortunate  oh god  not being audible to half the audience oh it was not it was a messy affair  oh  oh i see so i was telling and wasn't gokhale there  oh he was there ah ha but he did a good job whatever you had assigned to him   i think yeah i think he is we had a session of passages and he had look through ah ha and uh   wa wa was was there more material forthcoming  i'm i'm just e e e  ahn yes yes of course material did come   haan haan  so we have made a fresh selection in the meantime michael west dictionary has come very good very good we all got a copy oh i am glad  yeah  ah so the now we are meeting on the evening itself   haan with some more material  haan  alright and then i told kadepurkar look   haan  we are not going to look at the material one word  endlessly  haan  now you make a final selection and we will start working no no i think that snag is somewhat there  haan  that you know i have i have diagnosed the case but i have got to haan do that unfortunately no   job of coordinating in the sense that people pulling in different direction   haan   haan haan  it looks like one word  like you know the board people ahn want to assert their whatever you know  ahn  it looked like it and they are not able to select  yeah  no no they want to assert there right alright but then uh  i mean i not all not many of them were really academically uh capable of you know isn't it ? yeah i don't know really yeah it's all the you see uh uh what you call  one word was not very wrong yeah  but the way she went about was wrong   that's right anyway yeah the point yes uh   yeah   yeah  but then we have to somehow manage the show  exactly so i i maybe you know atleast in my presence  they somehow seem to agree to many of the things that i  you know one word it looks like that  this time people were opposing  i know  and uh my group is not so bad yeah  except that lalita ghatge everytime she brought a piece   uhn it was one word down to l three   uhn  oh really but she said why don't you all one word include me in l three istead of doing this   haan  i am doing other peoples work ahn she was annoyed  ahn  actually that may be a good really because the small  one word you know ahn and if she can really be of use to l three   ahn  but it doesn't two words material production i don't know  yeah what she is capable of ah yes but you know the whole problem is except wakankar in that group uhm nobody else really knows the job  uhm  i know i know  wakankar has been a school teacher yeah yeah he has uh actually been in the field  ahn  uh in our case uhm we have something called common sense  uhm  uhm in our group oh oh then  a few words yeah we may not have the experience uhn but we have common sense  yeah yeah   uhn  uhn  now your uh gentleman kulkarni didn't turn up  oh i see  yes he didn't turn   he must have had some problem yeah  yes i think somebody was ill  one word   haan  he wrote to me in london  two words he i think his one word    he had gone to bombay yeah somebody was ill and unfortunately she died also actually a relative of his  oh i see  i see and there you know a relative was in london and i was to go and see them  i see  may be anyway yeah   that may the reason i mean in any case i i mean last meting atleast i thought he had got some material and they were accepted  haan  ultimately you know somebody has to do the job anyway  let's see right uh what else how are you ? oh otherwise theek hai then uh uhm you know two words  how is that you take the whole thing   and she asked me no no she is waiting for a letter from the board  i i she asked me did i read letter and uh because  one word he came on the fourteenth no next day  yeah  right on thirteenth right  so raj rajni's brother nothing was right ahn i know  so i said probably it was read at the board level yeah so i said anyway i'll find out i asked to pradhan uhm  so that he watch over there that letter was really  presented uhm so he said whatever we want to tell her we will write over there atleast she must have received but she hasn't received anything from them oh  was the letter read ? yeah letter was read and actually discussed every point was  uh actually mm sort of taken haan  and ultimately this uh see people felt that there is no point in uh  uh you know discussing everything  haan   haan  we just stick to the old decision that she drops out and there is an end of it  yeah  so you know  haan 
see now verona ah nalini actually i'm nalini   accha  after a long time you phone na  yeah  for a very long time we have not met  i know that's why so i have decided  what happened ? uh about what ? no why you didn't ring up for a long time ? uh yeah uh i was not well for some time  accha accha  so i couldn't ring you i see or i can't even meet you ah ah so now i decided to ring you at least speak to you on telephone why you are not going to work also ?

whatever may it goes i think people have to accept it uhm  incidently haan ho  how is the disturbance in your part about dandia   haan  no there are no such celebrations here yours is the perfectly peaceful residential area it appears because  ah  uh are there any in rajarampuri ? the they are there are in rajarampuri  accha so everything is really no no not in the area where i am staying ah  so  i think sykes extension there is a photograph in  today's sakal   accha  uh i think there are many enthusiasts there  ah but they didn't have the uh requirement of getting up early next mo morning and going for work  same thing  ah  so they can relax  today is a holiday  ah  but i think this has been going on for the past few days  that that is for all   it'll continue i think till the uh end of the festival yes from first that is the from pratipada  to navmi   haan  and dasara is the tenth day right right  so so does it go on for all the ten days ? yes  ahm uhm it start from navratra first day ahm  then you go on upto tenth dasara  is tenth   even if the  i think in yesterdays or day before uhm there was an article in the times   uhm  yes yes yes yes   what's in it  how i mean noisy and uh the spirit behind it has been lost completly and it has now become you see more or less uh a commercialized uh laughter all sorts of things can take place ahn and you know it's an excellant opportunity to see girls right right mix with girls you're right and girls  i mean from the families where you would probably not be able to pick your say nose also  you're right  right right so that is and unfortunate part of it is the community which you supposed to have this kind of skill ahn is  not uh aware of the risk that it involves right  in exposing the members of the senior members of this family  ahn   right   perhaps you see  we have been pushed into the background ahn  others have taken over it   ahn  ahn that's what it seems now   it it appears  and nahi also it got mixed up with you see western thought laughter culture kinds of you see entertainment  nahi  with their tiparies in their hand they have all those western dances   uhn  but you accepted uhn  that indeed there is no longer you see either religious or devotional like it seems to have lost its meaning altogether that is that is but then the i don't mind if it has lost meaning to those people themselves ahn  you know it's certainly disturbing to the others right right  it goes on till three two or three in the morning   and  and the the times of india report says that the decibels are hundred haan which is  which is very high pitch   haan  right  a nine tunnel truck laughter you see as we see it on our highway in front of our college ahn everyday when we engage the classes   ahn   yes yes  hardly anything can be heard you see whenever uh if the vehicles pass uhm through at the same time   uhm  that is true you know we can't help it  but fortunately in nagala park there is no such disturbance and you should be really pleased with it correct  how is akshay ? nice he is ahn  it's a holiday for him today  ah ha so he's at home   accha  he was not well for quite sometime really ? yes  what was it ? i don't know i see he hasn't got an appetite that is  that seems to be his main trouble i see  uh either he has no appetite haan  or has i mean becomes so i mean angry at times   haan  ah ha  over himself  i think he must be very playful that is one of the reason  he's of course playful ah if he is playful you know they just forget right  ah very often that they have to eat and suddenly when  they feel very uncomfortable they start crying and we were all you see   and don't realize  for a fortnight uhm  uh on a tour for south india oh i see ah ha perhaps that too is a strain you see uhm correct  so after his return uh he wasn't well for a day or two i see  but now he seems fine   fine accha uhn  incidently i hope you know  uhn  i lost my dog   achha yeah sorry   yeah  uh i mean what brought about the the end ? nothing it was just a natural death  out of old age   maybe i think   old age  you see  yes  ah  see after a particular stage ah as it happens in case of uh man  ah  yes yes of course any living thing you see  ah any living thing there are there're  the process of degeneration start  yes everything has yes come to an end  yes  yes  then how did you i mean dispose it off  uh we buried him in our uh compound   ah ha   that's what i too thought  yes  i had i had i i had invited a pe vet  ah about a month back  ah  right  and then i just sought his advice because you know i had earlier gone to dagade  ah  dagade i mean just out of curiosity i said look here if you don't mind i would like you to tell me something about this ah  and we just settled on one point that is china ah  because that is the one which can   yes yes you told me that you had been to china and there you  yes haan  so he was just kept on it  in the meanwhile i he say dr dagade adviced me   haan that i should get uh the vet   haan and seek his opinion   haan   haan  so that we will be able to diagnose what is the problem ? i see  so he came uh and he said sir i think this is just old age  ah  and i was not very much interested in torturing him at  this age   right ah  so i just went on feeding him whatever usual milk   you take   that's right  and uh a ju just allowed him to be   that's right the way he can live   that's right  sick people will be  ah nursing of it was necessary for a   the last fortnight  ah  because i had to clean him ah every  uh twice a day and then every other day i had to give him a sort of a uh uh sponge bath or something like that   ah  but uh that was only for about a fortnight and the end was damn peaceful ah  even the earlier night he was alright because the last one uh  four days i think ah all that he could have life was in his eyes   ah  ah   cough  he keep kept looking at us  so you just found him i mean dead or  uh no  it just happened ah that the earlier whole day he was a bit uncomfortable moving sides  perhaps shifting sides   ah   ah ha   perhaps  uh there were indications uh no but then that was a sense of activity also ah  then the evening which he lived and then we put him in a small kind of a cradel like thing that i have got done for him ah  and uh then twice or thrice that night i went to him  saw him ah breathing normally  ah  ah but one thing i didn't like was that he had not changed his position in which he was kept ah  and then early morning i went to him to to find out what is to be done for him and then whether he needs cleaning ah  whether he needs water   ah  ah  he was breathing  ah  then i went there and he just had a sort of a something like he uh a few words in kannada  ah   a few words in kannada  he must have just slept ah he just ha he just belched once ah ah  without anything coming out of it it was dry thing  ah ah  ah  and uh then he did it again a bit of it  just belched   haan  and then that was the end that was the end  so when i was very much in front of him ah he just slowily reduced his breathing   ah   when did it happened  ah  when did it happened ? this was on saturday morning saturday it's about almost a week  ah yes because on saturday i was on leave  ah  but have you bought another pup ? well i don't have ah we have yet to think of it we have not given any thought to that ah let us see  ah  because you need it you see  yeah we need it   of course you have been  we need it but   it is a necessity  but prof goud there is other part of it also ah  it involves certain amount of attention and other things yes that is true  ah so  but then the you see purpose why you kept  john for him so long   yes  right ah  so but i i also sometimes no feels guilty about him ah in the sense i had to keep him chained  right or keep him indoors ah and then i felt well  was i doing a right thing ?  right   ah  yes yes now once i had it him haan   i had no option  haan  right  and you could not uh change his habits  after having uh   i see  ah  let him out and i mean wander about freely  no that's no no that was not very easy but with difficulty i could have done it but then the trouble was he was kept indoors when he was strong and he could fight others ah  now at a later age when he was not so strong ah  and perhaps he could not fight with other dogs   right or tear them  right  ahn  then exposing him to lot of unknown or stray dogs right  and inviting infections for himself and for us  right  ah  was not very desirable uh  so that queston is at the moment not taken into account it is left entirely to veena and therefore i'm  not thinking about it  she must have come back yesterday or yeah she came last night  she came last night  and what about vishvas has he  vishvas has gone to hyderabad now  transfered  ah ah  with his wife  ah so he's posted there or ? no he's not he has for the first time gone for his divisional training   ahn and the divisional training is supposed to be in his own division  ahn  right right  so since hyderabad he's supposed to be his division ah south central   ah  ah  he has gone there and then he rang up ah  he just told us that he will be uh back here somewhere on thirteenth or fourteenth   one word  uh   that's his zonal head quarters  zonal head hyderabad is zonal head quarters  ah incidently ah uh in your college   uhn is there any possibility of finding a trustworthy painter  ?  ah   uhn  painters you mean  painting the house  uh yes i'll i'll try you see  no i mean i just  i'll tell you somebody ah  ah  i mean a man whom you know and who happens to be a student and he has been in the college for few ahn  ahn ha  i think even in painting ahn uh some students have done a course in the i t i  ahn  really  i remember because ah i asked them causally you see  ah ha  they come to me for admission or for one word  ah you meet every student  ah everyone who comes to me  so they tell me you see uhm what i mean  training they have had and or what job they do   uhm  uhn and all i mean sorts of skilled hands are there ahn even including masons are there laughter for actually i mean working as masons   i see really or undertraining you see  i see  because if some some of them  uhn they are children of masons  ah ha 
hello  hello  hello   haan good afternoon  good afternoon how are you ? yeah i'm alright   accha this uh did you convey that message about tin oxide ? yeah i have conveyed to them  ah now the fifty k g might be a problem they are saying uh take hundred because for from the point of view of packing and transporting ah they are saying take hundred k g's   ah  but hundred  can i ask them for airfreight hundred k g's ? hundred k g is too big quantity you now  ah that's what they are saying ah   i've sent them a telex again  ah  yeah  to see what they are why they are saying that  no but then i can do one thing ahn  if you can ask them to uh uh pay for the advance ahn  i can also arrange the advance   nahi nahi they are not talking about money uhm  they are not talking about money yeah  they are only saying   haan  fifty k g's will be hundred k g's will be economical   haan  fifty k g's will not be economical  no for air freight fifty k g is okay for us  haan no for you it is okay yeah but there is some other implication there  haan which might increase the cost that is what i am worried  haan  no but let them specify that no ?  haan  why there should be increase ?  haan  why there should be an increase no i've asked them why ? yeah  so let them tell us uh i mean i got the message but i remember last time also they have airshipped fifty k g no no no that was the first time sometime back yeah  when they first started  but they can also help us nahi nahi  second time  nahi nahi   nahi nahi it's not the question of helping  yeah they should do it  yeah unless they have specific problem  haan haan  which i have asked them to spell out uhm uhm   haan  ah  but in which case you know they what they say whether it is fifty k g or hundred k g haan it will be they will be able to air freight by the end of the next week  haan  oh but then what is the use ? ah  you see by by end of this month i'll i'll get the consignmnet  yeah by the end of see my worry is ahn that between uh end of this month and uh second week of uh uh what is that uh january   ahn i'll have problems   ahn   ahn   nahi what i'm saying  yeah if the air freight is end of next week  yeah   haan  air freight it takes about three days na ? but it takes about ten days for clearance  is that ? yeah  haan haan  so now you see they have to immediately ship fifty k g immediately they say it's not possible  haan  see they can uh earliest they can dispatch before the  end of next week  end of next week is too long  haan  so can you please ask them that you can also represent our problem no ?  nahi nahi i've already represented  i'm saying it is an additional requirement  haan  it is because as as of the time that'll be taken for the two fifty k g's to be received by them yeah they want fifty k g urgently  but why at all they have shipped so late ? ahn  why at all they've shipped so late ? see when the l c was open ahn during uh first week of november  ahn  ahn they have shipped by end of uh uh november  haan  so that has caused the whole problem yeah yeah  but even l c must was not the first week of november sir yeah  any way that there is no point in my arguing with you yeah  but the thing is this now they say by end of next week   is   but i i firmly believe that if you convince them on phone haan they will definitely ship fifty k g  haan   nahi nahi nahi you see the point is  haan  uh this the material may not be available readily  haan  fifty k g's or hundred k g's   haan  so they have to make it and then send it  haan  so that is why they've said next week  but   any way they've to manifacture it now  <[ > we're their regular customers   any way i've i've no i don't want to delay any further yeah  suppose they say next week should i ask them to go ahead ? yeah you ask them to go ahead  haan but hundred k g's you don't want ? no hundred k g's  but fifty k g's there might be some price implications i'm trying to verify why  see that is all negligible  no any way i'll come back to you  ah ah ah  okay  but it is you've to act very fast  no no i can't act faster than what i am doing now ah  but only thing is you uh as soon as i get the  clarification for the price yeah i'll ring you up  yeah  okay then you will have to comfirm to me yes or no  okay  okay  thank you very much right  i received that one indemnity bond form here  that uh one cheque  for b h e l hyderabad yes b h e l hyderabad the june ninety-two cheque is bounce uh uh had lost ah  so now our agent ahn has asked for a indemnity bond and hundred rupees stamp paper  ahn  ah ha so that he can get a fresh cheque why not we do one thing yes we should ask the b h e l yeah to issue instructions to their bankers ahn that this cheque has been lost by in transit  yeah   ahn  they will never do sir ah  this government organisation ah ha they will never  ah ha  they can issue a instructions to their bankers that  the cheque has been lost and stop the payment   sir that i've asked  you know in my letter ah ha i've  told them very clearly ah ha that this cheque which was issued in june ninety-two has already lapsed ah ha because we are in december   ah ha   ah ha   ah ha  ah but they insist always ahn for an indemnity bond to be kept in their file   ahn   accha but then then why it is to  whomsoever it may concern why not in the directly in the favour of   b h e l   that comes in the one word  that comes in the narration if you see uh i have got that uh yeah there is uhm  issued by the bharat electricals limited  yeah   this is the standard  yeah this is the standard format instead of that we should address it directly to the bharat electricals no no this is the standrad format ahn ahn for any indemnity bonds for any government customers  ahn ahn   accha   i've been issuing it for municipal corporations and  all government institutions   ah ha ha ha accha  this is how it is always one word  what happen to this cheque ?

you really no last time we exchanged na  yeah  yeah yeah   accha  we exchanged last time and last time then he reimbursed us tisco some securities uhm in exchange of auto light   uhm   arre you gave him kya ?  nahi ye to that time we gave it  accha  uh but with the clearcut understanding ahn ahn  that this type of deal will not be entertained in future  ahn ahn   accha accha  so whenever you'll be dealing in the securities please bear in mind yeah and how come your securities department is not aware that some securities are uh pledged   wohi wohi haan pledged with some other person and will not be available for selling till this particular dates  correct and they are freely entering into any sort of deal yeah and then asking us to exchange some securities   yeah   wohi   correct   yeah  these guys i'm telling you  ah very poorly managed ah ha ha  now now also he is telling me like that only that if you insist on settling the account we can even settle the account  haan   lekin apko interest dena hai to muzhe kuch kamana bhi hai to with that one i'm  requesting you that you please release this one karke   nahi nahi i didn't follow one word  again  uh he says that now when i'm  borrowing from you yeah i've to earn also something uhm uhm and with that one uh this particular deal is giving me some good amount of profit ah  so if at all you are exchanging these securities i'll  be uh good in the market otherwise i will have to go back on my words   yeah   uhm uhm   ah  tell him to go back laughter  these guys are all these all natak haan  ha ha ha   he's used the money for bill discounting  ha ha ha  not for uh this thing  correct correct  so you tell him not to give the money  correct  two words  let us see uhn  perhaps anyway now he is acting smart because it is already due  na   accha accha accha   ekvees ko due hai na  ha ha ha  perhaps this vivek chaubal haan  or nagendrarao haan some uh  somebody from these two they will contact you yeah   to   haan   haan   yeah   i'm putting my foot down correct corect correct  you know what they are thinking is that i'm  refusing without asking to elpro   haan haan haan  because you know sort of i they think that i don't want to exert and go to elpro and company   haan haan haan  i told him this see professional company nobody  will do  this this this  this type of things are strictly business deal yeah how can they are even i would have thought it twice even before to request yeah laughter  no another thing i'll tell you no some banks exchange securities  haan haan  but if they exchange they charge them for it yeah yeah you know like supposing i take and overdraft from  let's say city bank  yeah and uh for every certificate that i exchange they charge some five hundred rupees  exactly  will they pay you ? exactly  uh ha  uh  give this idea to r k m   laughs  no any way r k m's coming on sunday  accha   to till that time i've not commented any thing but i have given my indication that this is virtually impossible yeah but i will open up just a topic as a sort of formality with r k mehta  chalega  okay if at all he thinks that okay we've to keep the relations and we've to think otherwise  yeah okay then why why i should be bad in their eyes  laughs  correct correct  but this is very unprofessional correct correct  no it is not done normally yeah yeah  abhi aap baki ka one word  dekho na where we have had trouble yeah yeah  in fact but konthal got realized he got realized na  konthal got realized  he's a thorough gentleman  even the tata two words that got realized  accha   i've absolutely no problem no problem  i've single transaction clean deal yeah  and got settled  correct correct  uh with a word of thanks that's all  ek hi isme kitna gadbad and   gadbad hai   and  yes yes uh  at one time they have to give the tedious certificate and other time they have to give the post- dated cheque for the interest  at other time they have to exchange the security   yeah posing for the one or two words   a few words  capital and not interest no  exactly laughs and so so many things yeah that is true   chalo any way uhn  see you   chalega  uh but uh please officially talk to r k mehta on sunday  yeah i've got it in mind yeah  sure  ahn  okay okay   you'll also kindly update him no yeah yeah  ahn yeah thank you thank you 
yeah  okay i'll call him he want to go to airport from here to airport ahn  but the flight was late uhm uhm so that's why he has gone to campus  so  from from campus to he will go to airport  uh to receive shivaraj patil yeah  i see  so the from uh then uh from there he is going to  no he'll be there in the campus only  no today tere is a talk no but that is in the evening no yeah  uh he will go  yeah okay then okay  he has not come on the line  hello  uh good morning good morning uh you've been very hectic uh  yeah i know even now i'm waiting for just  one word to the airport ah ha because that flight is  delayed  ah ha  yeah  which you know four thirty  and where is he staying ?  raj bhavan   raj bhavan  now i called your residence yeah i was told that you are going to airport right  so uh you will be coming there along with him or no no no uhn he is going to raj bhavan   uhn  ah  i'll come back to campus uhm uhm then uh i'll probably you know still little bit ahead of time uh  and then somebody will go to dr one word  will go to raj bhavan to bring him i see  i was looking at the airport uhm whether he wants anybody to come there  uhm  yeah  or he'll come earlier yeah  now uh you see is the speech going to be recorded  no we wanted to record uhm the taperecorder doesn't seem to be working  uhm  uh do you have a transistor recorder ? uhn i've uh i don't have a transister recorder but you know my friend as you know dr s v shastri uhm uhm  uh he has come here for today uhm and he is doing some u g c project uhm uhm  for which spoken english so he wants to record uhm uhm so he has got a taperecorder and everything ah  so he was keen to record that   ah  uh you see the he shivaraj patil's and the text of his speech is ready uhm and he's suppose to bring it to the airport uhm but still he will deliver it  yeah  so you can bring it it may be good if you can record it  uhm   uhm   yeah  yeah but only i wanted your permission no it'll be a welcome uhm because university is saying this thing is not working ah so if you  maybe come a little bit earlier yeah then they can plug in and test it yeah because you that mike condition system we don't know  uhm   ah   yeah   yeah   that's right  so he'll be there before i will you know come with him   ahn or he may come directly uh before four thirty  ahn  very good that'll be nice uh so you will be there  i will be there and muralidhar and gosaval yeah but your those people will have to be told yeah oh yes i'll if i'm not there  uhm you'll have to wait yeah  untill muralidhar yeah because he will be there till  everything starts  uhm   yeah   yeah  and he has got a very sophisticated system like in the t v  uhm the person you know if he puts that uh to his shirt  uh uh then the voice is recorded very accurately  that is how he recorded for the last time  uhm   ah  no but in this in this case uh  uh i don't know whether that would be possible  we have a system whereby uhn see it is connected from the mike   uhn  mike that type uhn that will be better  uhn  yeah because he'll be speaking into the mike yeah any way if uh will he will   let him bring it  supposing his equipment has separate mike uhm that also can be put it put there yeah and we can put it somewhere some side table uhm uhm  it will be good if he comes a little early uhm  so it can be tested  uhm  yeah  sometimes uhm instruments of this and that won't match  uhm   that's right  so so i am going to airport okay that will be twelve thirty he is coming   okay  yeah so i want detail no ? uh that's okay uhn three minutes have remained yeah i'll uh then i see you there at four thirty and while coming back uhm  may be we will see something else is possible  yeah   i'm keeping a car uhm  uh may be you konw you can you and kunj can leave chandrachood and you can go to v t or something yeah yeah  uhm  oh yes  no problem yeah uhn  okay okay then see you then  yeah bye  i had a hello  hello yes what about the programme ?

poona poona   poona yes  so they called uh students from our department yes  for the written exam right  after those who were qualified for that were called for an interview yes  and interview was conducted by uh you want all that  yes yes it was conducted by the now one word mr kardale  and one patanjali shetty yes  so they said whether we would like to do sports reporting yes  so i was keen on that also uhm  so then after that uh after a month or so they said that they are taking as reporter here in pune yes   indian express   yes  uhm  but that was uh they wanted me to join before my exams yeah  so i joined in april nineteen ninety nineteen  eighty-eight  so till nineteen eighty-eight you join indian express  yeah yeah  as a trainee reporter yeah  may first to fifteenth i took leave yes for the exams  yes  ah so i gave my exam during that time right  then i joined back ah  then what and the next thing was my result yes  i got a first class right  then in october eighty-eight i married yes  so after marriage sudha went to bombay yes so she got a   job   i also and that that time indian express was short of people in bombay yes  so for their desk ah pune desk  ah  yes  so i asked for a transfer ah and i was given it immedietly  ah  yes so i went there but sudha had gone over to bombay earlier yeah earlier  and how long were you alone in poona ? poona i would have been alone for say  two three months  no one month just one month yeah within one month i managed everything yes  okay so ah october fifth we married ah  by november tenth i was in bombay ah  so  ah  then i joined the desk there ah as a sub-editor  ah  yes  and at the pune desk right and uh then sudha got a job in free press yes and i was conf i went on probation in november itself that is after your pe period as trainee journalist you were on probation   probation  yes and provisional period was how long ? three months  three months yeah yeah and after completing the  two or three months i'm not sure about it yes  so after completing probation i became permanent yeah  but on the desk the problem was later on it came that pune edition unit every one will go for night shifts  yes some seven o'clock till twelve o'clock  everyday  that means everyday you would have been require to   everyday we have to do only that particular shift only yeah  because they didn't need for anything else yes so i ask for a transfer to the bombay desk ah  so when i went to the bombay desk uh they put me on two shifts one was the mid shift that is on two o'clock to eight  o'clock yeah and alternate we had night and this mid shift  yeah  yes  so that was also getting quite boring laughter  so i wanted to shift to that uh reporting yeah  so at that time i was i think right from the begining your main interest was reporting yeah reporting not desk but i had gone to bombay because  yeah because you wanted the transfer to bombay yeah that's right   that's why you accepted the desk yeah that's right and i was not very su uh knowledgeble about all this that it was difficult to shift from desk to reporting right so at that time i had written some sports copies from here from pune for indian express  yeah  they had a sports uh suppliment yeah  extra sport it was called  yeah  yeah  so rajanbala was handling that and he knew i had written and uhm he had liked couple of thesis  uhm  yeah so when i was in bombay he just came to know that i was there uhm and said why don't you join the sports desk  ?  uhm  yeah  so i put in an application uhn to the news editor saying that i want to join the sports desk  uhn  yeah but they wouldn't leave me because they were short of staff on the desk as well as they didn't want anyone moving from there yeah all petty yeah politics  yeah  politics  so i then he said no you have just come  no no was there politics between the say those who i mean the person who are in charge of sports desk and yeah yeah there is lots of politics  accha  uh uh although they had equal rank  equal rank but they never let you like you don't give your personal interest i see ah you know that sort so you hold on to the persons who are working with you yeah you hold on to the person for your ego problem   yeah as well as staff shortage also  yeah  yeah  and moreover you don't see eye to eye with the other  laughter yeah  yeah basically because of that uhm  then he said at that time ke wait for five six months you have just joined then i will consider it  so i waited for six months and again i put an application yeah  so he said no at that time the new r a had com  complained the converse haan so he directed it the application back to the news editor who said no  haan  ah so it was getting too much  yes  for one month i just didn't go to office laughter  without informing them  without informing them yeah and i made the rounds of all the newspaper offices down  there   yeah  at that time daily was revamping they had a new editor yeah  rajat sharma  ah who is this aap ki adalat  yeah now he yeah  so he  aap ki adalat  he had just taken over uhm and they were revamping and looking for more people  uhm  yes  so i just said take me as a reporter uhm  chief reporter there was one mr rangan uhn  so he interviewed me and he said he found me okay yes  then he uh took me uhm and i went without a pay hike also i just wanted to get out yes  so one after when the month was getting over i just went in submitted my resignation in the off day yes from  indian express laughter   yes  luckily i got the job yes that is what matter  yes  yes so i went there and i started doing beat nearly all the beats were handled by all the people who were already there yes 
he says one minute  about that uh mm letter sir  about uh that letter  board of studies letter i gave it you no yeah yeah i gave it to you yeah and uh you please check it up  yeah  yes sir  go through that uh paragraph yes sir and if you bring it back i'll get it typed then we'll send it   yes sir  yes sir uhm yes sir   uhm  uh are you coming now this side ? yes sir i will come now please talk for ten minutes i will come sir ah accha  but uh uh the same drafting i can do na   ? the dealing  the same type of that some of it are to be changed okay sir because yeah that is from my point of view  yeah and uh catering to my yes sir  requirements and needs perhaps yeah and probably i think uh you have to yeah change it a little bit ah ha  and project a little more ah ha about your own grievences or whatever fresh points are there ah ha that we have to put it down and then write isn't it ?  yeah   yeah   yes sir   yeah   yeah   ah ha   ah ha   ah ha  ah ha  sir about that chaya i received a letter from uh the director of uh uh school education that chaya katti uhm could you tell me something about it sir ? even i don't know anything about it   uhm  see  ah the nineteen eighty-six  ah   called that national policy on i mean that new education policy is there isn't it ?  programme of  right sir  national policy of education yeah  uh they have prepared a kind of uh programme of action  pune yeah for the state  right sir   yeah   haan  that is for the state they have prepared in nineteen ninety-three  ah ha about that they want to finalise  ah ha  and they have identified some people  ah ha uh in each department ah ha and uh they wanted uhm that this person should go through the d o a draft which they have prepared at s c r t   yeah and then to the governments and uh whatever additions deletions will be there ah ha they should make it and then hand it over   uhm   yeah   ah ha  thats all  thats all  haan  and for that probably i think we did a kind of honorary job uhm uh but the new syllabus and new programme of action and whatever we decide ultimately ah ha will be the final one and should reach entire state  and the all the direction and all the ah ha  uh schools ah ha will be impleminting this particular kind of new contents that all we suggest the thing  uhm   ah ha   ah ha   ah ha  i see otherwise you know the programme of action actually what to do  ah ha that we have to suggest to them  ah ha  ah ha  they are keeping a book in the sense  it is in the book for no no programme of action nahi nahi you can you can recommend for preparation of new books  i see you may recommend for preparation of new contents   ah ha a new methodology new approaches new a t or i t   ah ha whatever it is uh yes whatever you suggest  uhm will be taken up uhm uhm then the action will be permitted   ah ha   ah ha   yeah   uhm   uhm uhm  who are the other members sir ? uh from our college uh because that day i was there i gave all the names of our college first ah ha  uh mrs katon ah ha  for minorities and or something like that i ask her ah ha  probably she must have been given minorities and only accepting that kind of strategy ah ha even that several  two words ah ha  then myself   ah ha   ah ha  i see and for english uh sharma ah ha  dr sharma  ah ha  and then uh uh professor venkateshwar rao for telugu ah ha  and then uh like that quite a good number of people are drafted ah ha  uh professor anwar jahan for administration ah ha  is there any chapter on science education also sir ? science education is there that was given to you  no sir they have given   there are measurement problems  evaluation means ah evaluation measurement  ah  yeah evaluation measurement must have been given you are you are dealing with education research also perhaps   ah ha that's why  ah ha  sir before going to the meeting shall i read something and go or uh   nahi nahi not not necessary because content point of view ah ha there will be absolutely nothing  ah ha  so need for pre no need preparation  no need  no need  i see well you just go yeah and uh you can discuss and prepare a kind of plan  for action uhm uhm  what we should do ? you know they they want to know uhn what shall we do first of all  uhn  yes sir  and this these are the things which we you should do  that you are going to tell them  right sir  and uh while telling uh that you will be uh already you have prepared a kind of draft or some directons they have given that is not uh open and one that is almost a special one  right sir  uh for the structure you have to give final consent  right sir that you know this you should do this we should not do and ultimately you can say that this can could be taken up this could be  not be taken up etcetra i see  now that you can complete that way  today i have taken leave sir after taking first pay i know i know i understand i  as a first pay you know infact somebody told me ah ha ha   that's why uh i was just asking you know   ah what your tommorrow's programme ?  ah  yeah  by the by a very interesting information yesterday have you seen eenadu ? yes yes we have discussed already about telegu university judge  we've discussed it we've discussed i want to go to the court today  you ? yeah myself or uh someone uh who is known to us   ah and we want to collect that judgement copy  ah  yes yes yes yes  that we can manage yes because they conducted interviews during elections  uhm so judgement gave in favour of uh not in favour of university   uhm   that's okay but anything uh   it's very positive point no which one which one is it conducting these elections are important ah or issuing the orders are important ?  ah  uh  issuing the orders is the main thing isn't it ? yeah that they should note out ah  ah that part they have to stress not conducting the interview  interview you can conduct at any time there's no problem ah ha  that is that are for that also there are some restrictions  nahi but you know we don't fall in that  in that provision that's all because this is in september november and september yes  elections uh held in november uh december uh elections elections were last month november uh december sir  yes december first and december fifth  no no  they are telling no the elections notification came on first or second november isn't it ? right sir since   haan  uh this uh as far as the severe circumstance they won't come under the perview of ah ha this category  ah ha  but uh it seems eiliah told to tirupat that they should not no organisation should conduct interviews before three months  that we don't know because ah ha from the date of notification is of course we know  ah ha  i see uh date of notification came at what time ? ah ha  was it in september ? notiification came in the month of july  no no no no  haan  this notification must have come somewhere in the month of october or so ah ha exact dates you know  ah ha our first time elections were held in andhra pradesh   yeah yeah that kind of notification   yeah yeah  and primarily you know the the issue orders were issued on fifth that is on the election day itself   that is wrong  that is wrong that is wrong  haan that is wrong  on the election day they should not issue  yeah  and specially these elections the orders should not be given uhm  because the candidates if they are if they belong to a particular community or category or uh political party they the what you call the wave reaction will be there isn't it ? uhm  a ripple of it  yes sir  and the ripple of it goes to larger communities and then they begin claims and vote for this a particular section  yeah yeah thats how uhm  these election orders also should not be given ah  but they may argue they will say on first we have not given because ah on first uh the election in the city was there  ah  right sir  when they only ripple in the but in the telangana region was there anywhere  yeah yeah in entire north telangana ah uh there was a that was election day  ah  uh then it is alright  and then we you have a chance yeah  because uh north telangana means osmania jurisdiction  one or two  yes sir  nizamabad yeah  ah ha then its alright yes  nizamabad comes under osmania isn't it ? yeah yeah  not kakatiya  yes sir okay then we can take it up yes sir  its okay then that part is that way yes sir  today what are your plans sir today ? are you coming ? no somebody is coming ah ha at two thirty  ah ha   accha   i'll wait for them shrinivas is here now ah ha  and then you could have  that's great no now he has come back  ah ha  i think uh he understood things ah ha  he went to namrata institution and was saying it all that now he realised  a little bit not fully  still uh of course its okay we'll slowly console him uhm yes sir sometimes some consolation should be given to him yes sir and already one project is there in hand yeah yeah c i r from that i can divert the funds to him yes sir  already he has done some amount also yeah yeah of course there is uh only five or six thousand yeah  other thing also we can give what is there we've  the amount together yes but then unfortunately that thing is not working thats all   yes  yeah yeah uhn yeah he needs money  yeah yeah he is a brilliant boy but uh somehow ah ha  psycologically he is upset   ah ha  ah ha  thats the point ramakrishna has come today ? no he is on leave today  ah ha ramakrishna is on leave i think so because he has not applied ah ha  he may apply tomorrow  ah ha  ah ha he may come and then say for yesterday i'm  giving his application i see  because  sir from monday onwards i too want to take leave sir for four days because total i have five c ls uhm so from monday to twenty ninth   uhm  monday is a holiday function day isn't it ? oh monday is a holiday  maybe ah then i can take upto thirtieth  probably thirty is  thirty first is a meeting your total leave vanish from the camp yeah laughter  we can think of that ah yes sir you come we will discuss about it yes sir  not much ah  yes sir  okay then i will wait for you  okay  until then  okay sir  okay  thank you very much 
so proteins are the major bb-work   food material that is the important food materials  which are use used for the growth and development of the  of body either plant body or the animals body  so these proteins they are the macro molecules  proteins they are the bb-work the macro molecules  so this these proteins can be the several kinds of amino acids  several types of amino acids are present in the protein molecules  so in plants the amino acids they obtain from the inorganic process that's from that means it is from the   atmosphere itself  the plants and also some micro organisms they have the ability to fix the inorganic nitrogen and to convert it into the amino acid form  but in the case of these animals they have to depend on the plants for the amino acid source the source of amino acids they have either they have to depend directly or  indirectly  what does it mean direct depe uh and the directly dependent means   one-word  in the case of herbivorous plants uh sorry herbivorous animals  they have to depend on the animals they are depending on the plants for their foods  so they are getting direct ly the food materials from the plants understand  but in carnivores they are directly depending on the plants for their amino acid source  that means they are eating this uh flesh of other animals which are eating the plants or otherwise you can say that carnivorous animals they are eating herbivorous animals that means indirectly they we are getting the uh source of the protein from the plants understand  so this amino acids are the made up of the components of the amino acids are also carbon bb-work hydrogen  oxygen and the nitrogen  carbon hydrogen oxygen and the nitrogen and in some cases sulphur is also present in some cases the present of bb-work sulphur  bb-work  so there may be either monocarbocilic or dicarbocilic acids  bearing one or two amino groups  these amino acids may be either monocarbocilic or dicarbocilic acid bearing one or two amino groups  that means the you will you will not be know  knowing that a carbon atom has four valency isn't it  so these four valency for the carbon atom it is attached to one amino groups bb-work and to one carboxic group and to one hydrogen and one to the side chain one to a side chain  and the side can may be either polar or nonpolar  so every amino group is a so this amino acids may be they are of bb-work basic amino acids and acidic bb-work  and neutral amino acid bb-work  basic then acidic and the neutral amino acids then what does it mean basic amino acids  so every amino or group is known as the and amino acids having a free amino group is known as a basic amino acid for example lysine and arginine bb-work  so this lysine and arginine they have it they're having  one carbocil group and two amino group one carbocil and a bb-work and two amino group that is why they are known as the basic amino acids and the acidic amino acids they are having one such amino group and two carboxic groups  and two one carbocil bb-work one amino and a two carboxic group  one  so they are known as acidic amino acid  so and another group they are having one amino group and one carboxic group n h d   carbonic group  one carboxic and one bb-work they are known as neutral amino acids  for acidic amino acid for example glutonic acid and uh aspartic acids glutonic and aspartic bb-work  and for neutral amino acids examples glycine alanin valine  phenylalanine etcetera bb-work  glycine alanin valine etcetera  so these are the three main type of amino acids that is the basic amino acids acidic amino acid and the neutral amino acids understand  then if two amino acids can this these amino acids  can be linked together by means of peptide bond  two amino acids they can be linked together linked understand linked united together link  together like by means of peptide bond peptide bond  bb-works  so like that several peptide bonds to form a linear chain of many amino acids  have you understood that chain the two amino acids they can be linked together by means of peptide bond so like that several bonds will be forming and like that a linear chain of peptide bonds can be formed  so these are known by the name together these are known as the  peptide it is together form a peptide bb-work  so what is a peptide ? and what what will you say peptide what is it ? a peptide is formed by forming   by the  different parts of the  by by joining of  by forming pep several peptide bonds understand  that is peptide bonds are formed in between two amino acids two amino acids can be bonded together or joined together by forming peptide bonds  so like that several amino acids will be united or bonded together to form a linear chain of amino acids they are known that amino acid molecule is known as the peptide a single peptide a peptide is formed by the bonding together of several peptide bonds understand  that means several amino acids join together forming a linear chain of bonds known as the peptide bonds and these linear chains a of molecule contains a linear chain of these bonds they are known as the not a single  peptide okay a single peptide is formed from several amino acids joined together or bonded together understand  that is known as a peptide  so we will uh these proteins are micro molecules formed by  from a large number of peptide  that means a protein molecule contains the large number of these  peptide  but the function the the structure or the function will be different  the properties of protein will be different from the properties of a peptide or peptide bond understand  that means the protein molecule contains several peptides  and also the peptide bonds but the properties of the protein differs from the properties of the peptide understand  uh we know that a protein molecule contains several peptides but the properties are different   property of the protein is different from the property of the  peptide understand but protein molecule contains several peptide  then let us see the function of the functions of  amino acids bb-work  so the main function is the they are the building blocks for protein  that means what what does it mean ? main function building blocks for bb- work protein the the main function is the building blocks for proteins that means several peptides or the amino acids are uh  constitute the protein molecules that means the main function and another is that is said the specific amino acids are also converted into different types of biologically active compounds  certain specific amino acids they biologically convert to form several biological compounds  for example tyrocine it is converted into form of tyrocine is a amino acid bb-work  it is converted into the form of known as tyrocine  bb-work  tyrocine and a adrinalin that is also a harmone  bb-work  adrinalin and another the skin pigment melanin that is also melanin bb-work that is the skin pigment  melanin is the skin pigment you know what is it skin pigment ? you don't know so that is the skin colour you know we have the the dark people or black they are having in their skin having the larger quantity of the melanin pigments  so the less melanin pigments have the fair colour  that is the present presence of these pigment only give the colour that is the black colour individually and melanin pigments   some in some cases we have seen that the people they are not having this melanin pigment have you seen  so they are known by the name this such people they are known albino bb- work  albino  they are lacking the pigment they do not have this melanin pigment that is why they that means the these something  these amino acids or tyrocine will be lacking in their body for  for the conversion of this pigment for the production of this pigment melanine pigment producing a materials  material for blacking blackening in their body  that is the pigment the total pigment  is absent in their body that is even then why their skin   also is having white colour isn't it ? because our this uh our hair is uhm black due the presence of this melanin pigment  so in such people they do not have the ability to produce this pigment melanin that is why they look colourless colourless people or albino  so another uhm this plant harmone indole three acetic  acid and vitamin nicotinamide etcetera are also formed from a tryptophane bb-work  the amino acid from amino acid tryptophane  these plants harmone known as indole three acetic acids  and the vitamin nicotinamide etcetra are formed bb-work  indole three acetic acids that is a plant harmone and the vitamin nicotinamide that is also formed from the amino acids tryptophane  so we know that the main constituent of the glucose is carbon hydrogen and oxygen isn't it ? so here in the amino acids carbon hydrogen oxygen and nitrogen is also there so this here the n h group or the amino group is removed then it will be converted into glucose  and like that the carbo-oxyl group can be removed then it will form the carbon-dioxide  so these are the functions of amino acids understand  so next is the nucleotides bb-work  so these nucleotides are also complex molecules forming a part of the information transfer system in the cells  the inform what is information transfer system  ? what does it mean ? the transfer of information from cell to cell or nerve  from the nerve impulses like that that is the information  transfer system the information will be transferred from cell to cell that is the information transfer system  so they the they are the basic units of nucleic acids also you know that nucleic acid  which are the main nucleic acids ? the d n a and the r n a  d n a  what does it mean ? d n a means what does it mean power  deoxyribo nucleic acid and r n a ribose nucleic acid   power   ribose  so the basic unit of nucleic acids are the  nucleotides  so these nucleotides also contain carbon hydrogen oxygen nitrogen and phosphorus a nucleotide when are contained contains   carbon hydrogen oxygen and nitrogen and a phosphorus so each nucleotide is made up of a cyclic nitrogenous base apendo and one two three phosphate group  each nucleotide is made up of a cyclic nitrogenous base  apendo and uh one two three phosphate group  so the the nitrogenous base is bb-work  occurring in nucleotides are they may be either purine or  pyromidin bb-writing  so then nitrogenous bases occurring in the nucleo tides are they may be either a purine or a pyromidin  so the major purines are adanine and a guarine  bb-writing  so this the major purines are adraline and a guarine and pyrimidins are bb-writing thymine uracil and the cytocin thymin bb-writing uracil and cytocin  so this uracil is present in the r n a isn't it ? uracil that is seen in the r n a  so the apendo is either ribose or deoxyribose  the apendo that may be either ribose or deoxyribose  so the nucleo tides are thus called the ribonucleotides or deoxyribonucleotides  so if a nucleotide contains ribose the apendos then we will say it is a ribo nucleotide  and if it contains a deoxy ribonucleo tide then it is known as the deoxyribonucleotide  for examples of ribonucleotides are adrinalic acid  adrinalic acid bb-writing  adrinalic acid is an example for ribonuclei nucleotide an example for deoxyribonucleic nucleotide is the  deoxyribo nucleic acid that is the deoadrinalic acid  deoadrinalic acid bb-writing  so adrinalic acid is an example for  yes  it is an example for the  uhn  adrinalic acid  it is the example of ribonucleotide  ribonucleotide and deoxyribonucleotide example  deoxyadrinalic acid  so this ribonucleotides are the basic units of ribonucleic acids or r n a  the ribonucleotides are the basic units of ribonucleic acids that is r n a and also deoxy nuc uh ribonucleotides are the basic units of deoxyribonucleic acids  so that is the d n a  say a combination of these nitrogenous base is the pentosugar  is known as a nucleo tide  so what is a nucleotide then ? nucleotide bb-writing nucleotide what is it ? a nucleotide is formed by the combination of a nitrogenous base with a pentose sugar   a nitrogenous base  that is known as a nucleotide 
today we are study studying  about rotation and revolution of the earth  i believe you know there are two forces two  motions of the earth  one is on its own axis and the other is  ? around the sun around the sun  the motion on its own axis is known as   noise  what is known that motion is known as   bb- work  rotation of the earth  earth  and the movement of the earth round the sun   is known as   revolution  revolution of the earth earth  now what time does the earth take to take  one turn on its axis ? twenty-four hours twenty-four hours  is your answer complete ? twenty-four hours or less than that ? sir twenty-four hours  it is twenty-four hours with reference to the sun  but if you take it with reference to any other star  then it will be less than twenty four hours    twenty-four hours  say for example this one here  we are taking this as a reference point this side  and then want wanted this much  in twenty-four hours in less than twenty-four hours but in twenty-four hours what happens ? the earth moves a little around the earth because in three sixty-five days the earth has to complete  complete one movement   twenty-four hours  so naturally one day if it is a three hundred and sixty degrees bb-work  then one day roughly we have three sixty  bb-work five days bb-work  but let us say this is three hundred and sixty degrees then  it will take roughly uh four minutes less  than twenty-four hours  because in but we find actually uh  say every fourth year is a big year is a leap year  leap year  means one day is added and in one day  we say the earth takes one turn but this is with reference to any particular say this window in this case  so with reference to window but in one day the earth has advanced a little and this way second day uh say two minutes third day three minutes and this way in one year three hundred and sixty degrees it has moved round the sun  so naturally if we take this this way three sixty degrees that is one minute or better put it this way bb-work if it is three sixty degree also means bb work  in one day  one degree  one degree makes a difference in time of four minutes   bb work  we have noted fifteen degrees making a difference of bb work one hour bb-work   one hour  so one degree will make a difference of how many minutes ? four minutes  two  four minutes bb work  fifteen degree divided uh say bb work  sixty minutes sixty sixty minutes dividing this so  four minutes   sixty   four minutes  so one degree makes a difference of four minutes four minutes means every day the earth has to turn  one degree  in order to face the sun  suppose it is here this day next day it will turn this  next day again this much  this much  one degree every day bb- work  so with reference to any other star our day is less than twenty-four hours and that is  twenty-three hours and  twenty-four hours  half of fifty-four minutes  twenty-three hours and fifty-four minutes  bb-work  so what is this state ? a day of twenty-three hours and fifty-four minutes  that is called sideral day bb-work sideral day  one degree less than twenty-four hours and then we have another solar day that is of twenty-four hours  that is of twenty-four hours  so we have two kinds of days one with reference to any other star of universe twenty-three hours fifty-four minutes  and we have another day with reference to the sun that is of  twenty   four hours bb-work   twenty-four hours  you also know that the earth's  axis is inclined  towards bb-work  the earth is moving round the sun and the  earth's  axis with reference to the plane of orbit or orbital plane  also called elliptical plane or plane of ecliptic  bb-work plane of elliptic  this is an imaginary plane  let us say this table is a plane and  on this plane  the earth's axis is inclined this way  like this here  so this is an imaginary plane in this case here  near the table  but in that space a plane like this is there  and the earth is occupying this kind of position and then sun in the middle  so with reference to this imaginary plane that is  plane of ecliptic  plane of ecliptic  ecliptic bb-work  the plane with reference to the plane of ecliptic  or orbital plane bb- work  the earth's axis is inclined how many degrees ? let us say this is the plane of ecliptic  and it is like this bb-work  so this inclination how many degrees ? cannot be ninety  forty  forty-five degrees fifty fifty  fif  this is  forty-five degrees   sixty-six and half degrees  sixty-six and half degrees bb-work  like this  if this is the plane of ecliptic this point see this  bb-work  this is exactly here if you put it this way   bb-work  much inclined from vertical it will be twenty-three and half  bb- work  this is sixty-six and half bb-work  and this is  twenty-three and a half bb-work  together ninety degrees  so with reference to the plane of ecliptic  the  earth's axis has an inclination of sixty-six and half degrees but when you take it from perpendicular this is the plane of ecliptic then perpendicular then from there if you take this angle then it will be twenty-three and half  so you can express it this way with reference to the plane of ecliptic the earth's axis bb-work has an inclination of sixty-six and half degrees  but from perpendicular drawn from the plane of ecliptic  the earth's axis has an inclination of  twenty-three and half  degrees   twenty-three and half  now there is a one question   bb- work here bb-work say this is the plane of ecliptic  bb-work  we have a arc bb-work here  bb-work  and we have this inclination bb-work   you might have studied this kind of things sometimes  bb-work  must have you studied  four positions of the earth bb-work  round the  sun  so sometimes you find this kind of  diagram  bb-work also sometimes you find bb-work  this kind of diagram bb-work  also sometimes you find bb-work this kind of diagram now which one is correct ? sir  the first one because of the why do you say the first one is correct ? give arguments   one word  now let us see and one more  bb-work  when you have like this ?  a few words   bb-work  why ?  a few words  sir earth is the  may be slanting the earth's axis is inclined inclined  uh  uh with reference to the pe at twenty twenty-three and half it has perpendicular from perpendicular  from the axis here what is the case ? um revolves uh but yes ? the axis of the earth is uh  revolved what do we mean by sixty-six and half degrees from the plane of ecliptic bb-work  this is the plane of ecliptic for our purpose here we are measuring this  this is imaginary now remember  here we have salved it so sixty-six and half  if we put it here is it not sixty-six and half  ?  bb-work  measure this angle bb-work because this is plane  imaginary so measure from here  is it not sixty-six and half ? yes it is  if you put it here  again the difference again after the you measure from this side  so it may also be there yes sir  so what about this ? is it correct ? this is correct at least because we put it this way yes sir  so it's like this the position has changed so this is correct  right ? yes sir  if you put it this way what is wrong ?  bb-work  measure from this side  one sixty-six and half  you put it here  measure from this side sixty-six and half  from here same thing sixty-six and half so is it not correct ? bb-work  this much  why do you say that this is correct this is wrong ?  one or two words  and what about this ? look at this one  twenty-three and half degree and with a correct size correct  but where do you find twenty-three and half degrees  or sixty-six and half degrees do you find here ? but it is  how ? let us see  here put it this way sixty-six and half degrees but from your side it is appearing perpendicular perpendicular but it is at sixty-six and half  is it at ? it is at sixty-six and half  not here also sixty-six and half  but from your side it appears perpendicular uhm  so one way this is also correct  but what about this ? bb-work  some are like this some are like this  so what is needed they all must be   inclined  in the same direction   inclined   direction  they must be inclined in the same direction   same direction  but otherwise all these three are correct  how many days the earth or what time the earth takes to take one round around the sun ? sir days or days days or time better say time   sir three sixty-five days  three sixty-five days three sixty-five days  is it ? bb-work  yes sir  once a year  once a year   bb-work  because we have a longer year after four years so it it is also one fourth  bb-work of a day   noise long pause  now let us see if this is the position  of four positions of the earth round the sun  then you also know that two days in a year  the sun's  vertical rays strikes at the equator  we have noted  two days in a year  what are those days ? yes december twenty-second noise   bb-work  two days in a year the sun's  vertical rays  strikes at the equator  means the days and nights are equal all over the world  sir sir twenty-second december  twenty-second december and it is also in the  one or two words  when do we have longest day in india or here ? twenty-first twenty-one twenty-second june twenty-second let us take twenty-second bb-work  june sir twenty-first june bb-work  okay twenty-first june bb work  the day is longest in northern hemisphere  means where does the wait let us say take also when do we have the shortest day ? sir january twenty-second december  february   exactly the after six months   sir twenty-second december  sir twenty-first jan it should exactly be after six months  exactly after six months  sir twenty-first jan it should exactly be after six months  so it cannot be january  sir december  sir december sir december what date ? twenty-second december december twenty second okay bb work sometimes uh one also writes twenty-third  december  so from twenty-fourth december bada din   bb work  we have christmas on twenty-fifth  so say it may also be twenty-third december  bb work so this is summer season in india  this is summer bb work  summer of northern hemisphere bb work  this is winter of  northern hemisphere   northern hemisphere bb work  now you tell when do we have  vertical rays shining at the equator  it must be also in between  so what may be the dates ? when the sun's vertical rays fall  or strike  on the equator or at the equator ? bb work  sir march  twenty-third march   bb work  twenty-second twenty-third  twenty-first   twenty-first march  march  any other day ? no sir no sir sir march fifth  after six months what date it may be ? sir september september twenty-second  so twenty-second september  twenty-second september  bb work  now if this is the case where will you put  these days  four days we have now bb work  one bb work this bb work  here  bb work here bb work  put it this way bb work one two three  bb work and four bb work  where will you put twenty-second december  ? what happens on twenty-second december ? where does the vertical uh ray of the sun  strike ? at the tropic of cancer at the tropic of capricorn ? capricorn  so this is tropic of capricorn vertical rays striking here  and the southern hemisphere south pole has  day for six months bb work  see here bb work   sun's rays are vertical at the tropic of capricorn  yes and all these areas are under sunlight  so this position will be from which date ? twenty-second december   december   bb work  what is the position here ? bb work  sir twenty-third uh twenty-first june twenty-first june  right sir ternty-second june okay twenty-second june bb work  it all depends upon because sometime you have leap year sometime you do not have so it may be twenty-first it may be twenty-second and sometime people even write twenty-third  so that doesn't make much difference 
 bb-work  so the last time we had studied the external structure of heart mammalian heart  today we are going to study about internal internal structure bb-work   internal  as you know that the mammalian heart it is four chambered bb-work  can any one tell me which which are these chambers  are ? auricles and ventricles  yes very correct  two auricles two auricles bb-work two auricles and two ventricles  which chambers are called as auricles ? say clearly  the upper portion  which are the auricles ? upper portions are auricles yes very correct  the upper portion the upper chambers are auricles   bb-work and the lower ones are ventricles ventricles  in the same way these auricles auricles are usually  are very thin wall structures bb-work whereas the ventricles are very muscular  each side of the auricles and ventricles they are interconnected the left side and the right side  now they are interconnected by an aperture common aperture  which are known as auricular-ventricular aperture bb-work  it is internal effecting through auricles no auricles auricles and ventricles  noise   auricles   auricles and ventricles  now these auricles are guarded by valves which  prevent prevents the blood flowing again  on the same side or going back into the ventricles or auricles or you can say that that it prevents the back flow of the blood  the left side auricular-ventricular aperture here in this diagram you can see  it is guarded by a valve which is known as bicuspid valve bicuspid bb-work bicuspid valve or you can  call it as a mitral valve also bb-work  what is it function what to prevent the back flow of the blood from auricles to ventricles  similarly the right auricle and the ventricle is again guarded by a valve which is known as tricuspid valve tricuspid valve bb-work  these valves are very strong and made up of muscular tissues  which open into the of course of ventricular side  and to keep it there keep the flap as it is it is  held up by some tissue chords which are known as  collisentinel collisentinel bb-work  so this is the internal structure now how does working of the heart takes place ? by left and right ventricle aperture they may be  left side takes the bicuspid and right side the tricuspid auriculars  auricular-ventricular aperture  left side this side entering that means that left side auricular-ventricular  aperture is guarded by bicuspid valve and the right side of the auricular-ventricular aperture is guarded by tricuspid valve bb-work the two auricles act as a reservoir of the blood which  collected from the side of the all sides of the body  it comes and get stored in the auricles  from auricles then it goes to the ventricles and then ventricle when it contracts it gets closed into the vessels  this is the general working of the heart  bb-work  auricles when the auricles contract the blood flows into the ventricles and when the ventricles contract the blood flows into the vessels  which are these vessels can any one tell me ?  bb-work  from the le left side from the left it goes to the pulmonary pulmonary vessels bb-work  what do you mean by pulmonary ? going towards lungs bb-work  then what about systematic arteries ?  bb-work  systematic artery are the main vessels which supply blood to the body organs different body organs  now these vessels also as it opens into the ventricles of their own side in the vessel itself it also contains or it also based on that which are known as cellulilar glands bb-work  in this diagram here see this is the in  systematic this is pulmanory and this is described here  now the blood which comes to the right auricle it comes from different parts of the body that means it should be definitely veinal blood  what do you mean by vienal blood ? bb-work  into the  de- oxygenated de-oxygenated  bb-work   oxygenated  this is a degenated  pardon me  degenated  de  genate  de-oxygenated blood because it will go for purification to the lungs  except one vein which brings purified blood which is that ? that day i have told you about it  pulmonary  pulmonary vein  though it is called as vein but it brings oxygenated blood  because the direction of flow is towards the heart  but it carries oxygenated blood  in the same way the pulmonary artery which is going away from the heart that other aor this aorta  but these carry veinal blood why ? or these carry de-oxygenated blood  why ? can you tell me ? then why the name has been given as aor aorta ? only because the direction of flow is towards the body organs away from the heart  now which are these two veinal blood systems are ? which is here this blue one superior and inferior venacava  bb-work begins superior inferior venacava bb-work end  the superior venacava brings de-oxygenated blood from the  upper portion or head region of the body bb-work  head ante anterior against these  de-oxygenated  and inferior means from the lower portion of the body  bb-work  these two aortas open into the right auricle  then when the auricle contracts it goes to the right  ventricle  then from ventricle when it ventricle contract the blood goes  into the vessel  from right auricle which vessel it will go ? bb-work pulmonary vein pulmonary artery pulmonary  artery artery yes  which will take the blood to the lungs for purification in the same way left auricle receives blood purified blood from the lungs  as it contracts the left auricle oxygenated blood then goes to the left ventricle  and the ventricle after contraction it takes blood through the vessels to to the different parts of the body  or main systematic arteries bb-work  but aorta and uh sorry uh auricles and the ventricles  they contract together or the auricles they will contract at at the time  so the working of left and the right auricle will be going as i have just explained you  ventricles also contract at the same time  both the ventricles   and the working   and they are undertaking  no no two two together  auricles first then ventricles  how many times this contraction takes place ? seventy two uh   seventy-two uh good   seventy-two times  seventy-two times  can you measure it ? know there is some instrument  electrocard iogram  stethescope bb-work which helps in  miss what is the meaning of electrocardio gram   counting the sounds of this contraction miss what is the main function of electrocardiam  that spinal  that function of e t p radiocardiam  that is electron  how to count these in the first medical you have to first count these lub and dub sound bb-work  lub and dub sound  lub  and if you want to count it by your finger tips you can  there is pulse rate  pulse yes pulse rate you can just near the thumb  i mean the pulse is  no no i mean  left hand  here it is this count near the thumb thumb side portion this is bb-work  now there are two types of these veins also now the ephatic portal vein and the one more is there portal vein renal portal ephatic portal  bb-work  what do you mean by the portal vein ? why not it is simple vein ? portal vein ? because this vein is not directly going to the heart but it goes through some one of the organs  there it gets filtered on the nitrogenous amonic material and from there then the simple way to go to the heart  from heart then it goes to the lungs for purification  so there are two portal veins hepatic portal vein and the renal-portal vein   hepatic portal vein goes to the liver  bb-work liver for filtration that is nitrogeneous material and renal- portal the filtration takes place in kidney  for amonic material  again that would be the procedure only  so in this way there are two portal veins and different types of veins in the body which help in collecting the different  veinal blood and then getting stored in the auricle  which auricle ? it will come to which auricle ? main vein  right auricle right auricle correct  have you brought your text book today  please open your book  just open your text and look at the picture that is uh  page number sixty-seven  yes  here is lesson for you  this lesson is about a great scientist  now just you go through the lesson before you read there are three questions they have given a b and c  and first question  can you mention some well-known companies in india which make commom medicines ? some companies are preparing medicines  can you name them ? which are the companies ? one one by one  pfizer  pfizer good  procter and gamble  procter and gamble  any one from that side ? procter and gamble only two companies ? sir sir godrej  godrej is not uh medicine  sir anacin yes loudly please  anacin company anacin that is not a medicine  ajmera  ajmera  two famous enough  and just second that b one  have you heard of the bengal chemical and pharmaceutical works do you know what they make ? where is the bengal chemical and pharmaceutical works ? where is it situated ? where is it ? bengal chemical and pharmaceutical works  yes come on  bombay  bombay  where is in bombay ? exact location  can you tell us ? worli  worli  very good  the bengal chemical is in at worli  then which things do they prod produce ? sir drugs yes  kalpana come on  yes reshma  nerve tonic  nerve tonic that is after reading lesson  i think that you have already read the lesson  medicine medicine please be seated then do you know who started this company ? p c roy  p c roy started this company okay now there is a picture  just glance at the picture  see what are there in the picture first just observe the picture only  don't answer me now  one two three four numbers are given there  and then some equipments are there  only two minutes  observe it   if you don't mind let them try in pairs  pairs   two in each pairs  yes  let them discuss  find out the answers first  yes  and give the answer later on  you go and sit there   you decide your answer first  locate the picture one two three four  sit in pairs   whether it is number one  and  what is number one you decide  ah  what is number one number two number three number four  you have to decide yourself   you decide your answer  ah  later on let them speak up  don't turn the page that side yes come on  first gas burner second no no no enough  first one is ? gas burner  gas burner sit down  then first one is gas burner  yes ? second one is sci scientist  scientist  yes third ? flask  flask  acid  acid which one ? fourth one fourth one is acid  now sir sir turn the page page number sixty-eight they have given the words here  scientist acid gas burner and flask you have already told the those names here  now the just look at the b  what is this a picture of ?  sir sir  p c ray  p c ray because they have already mentioned there name is given there p c ray  now what is the scientist doing there ? experiment  not in all only group wise  the scientist is doing experiment experiment correct   experiment  then just i will read the lesson loudly teacher starts reading   p c ray  the neighbours did not know what to make of the young man  that he was a college lecturer and scientist they knew  and he did experiments in small laboratory he had set up at his house  but what scientific purpose could he hope to serve by dumping on terrace sackfuls of cattle bones he had got from the local butcher  they had put up with the odours that had often been wafted to them by breeze from his laboratory  but the stench from rotting bone and flesh was unbearable  crows had also been littering houses all around with bones picked up from te terrace  after several days of this they could stand it no longer  they told the young man to take away the bones  if he did not they would call the muncipal authorities  at this juncture a friend came to the rescue of the young man  he had a vacant plot of land a little away from any house  end of reading   yeah   starts reading  at this juncture a friend came to the rescue of the young man  he had a vacant plot of land a little away from any house and the  bones could be dumped there  that was done and one evening when he found that the bones had been well dried by the sun the young man made a bonfire of them  there was trouble again  policemen attracted by the fire arrived and he had a hard time convincing them that he was no murderer destroying evidence and that it was not human bones that were being burnt  the next morning he took the ashes of the bones to his laboratory and treated with them sulphuric acid  when the superphosphate of lime thus produced was mixed with soda  a solution of phosphate of soda was formed  the solution was then put into large basin and boiled  this produced lumps of phosphate of soda crystals  the young man took a lump and chewed it  he smiled happily  he had converted the waste cattle bones into a medicinal compound from which nerve tonic could be made  the young man began to produce the tonic on a large scale  it was cheaper than the imported product available in the market and was as effective  in the beginning druggist were not ready to keep this desi  medicine but doctors who knew the young man and the effectiveness of the tonic canvassed it and it became popular  this was the modest beginning of the bengal chemical and pharmaceutical works now one of the biggest chemical firms in the country  and the young man was prafulla chandra ray today ray is recognised as the father of india's chemical industry  and he not only developed centres of research in chemistry and trained brilliant young chemists but also by original research placed india in high position in the world of chemistry end of reading  now read the lesson silently for three to four minutes
now in this what happens we have to take ammonium chloride and clay lime in the ratio of three is to  two  what is the ratio ? three into to two now this i will arrange as in shown in the figure see in your figure  now we heat the test tube and we pass it the gas is allowed to pass over this line tower why ? because when it pass through line tower the ammonia becomes dry it helps in drying ammonia   ammonia  now as this gas is lighter than air it is collected by  the gas jar is kept inverted over the line tower and the gas is collected  line tower  have you understood ? yes now we take this is by we collect by the downward displacement of air now we check some of the physical and chemical properties of the gas  now first physical property we see that it is has no colour inside is colourless gas   gas  then the smell is strong  it has a high strong smell   high strong smell  teacher noise  then  so we can say  what can we say about the smell that it is the pungent  smell   smell   what how it is smell ? pungent smell  then the next property is it is lighter than air we have seen in collection of when we are collecting the gas  we are collecting by the downward displacement of air   air  so it is naturally lighter than air   lighter than air noise  now this gas is also soluble in water how can we check ? take water and drift the gas which is coming out  we see that the gas easily dissolves in water and hence we say that the gas is soluble in water   soluble in water noise  now this gas will neither support  cumbustion nor it will burn itself  combustion   burn  so it is not a combustible substance nor it is supporting  combustion   combustion  means the candle will go off   off  now this gas can be easily liquidified on cooling you can liquidify  this make into or turn into liquid and it can be compressed now have you understood the physical properties ? yes or no ? yes  now this we see the chemical properties of the gas ammonia when combined with water you get ammonium hydroxide what do you get ?  ammonium hydroxide   ammonium hydroxide  the formula for ammoniun hydroxide is na four   o h   o h  n h four o h   o h  what is the formula for ammonium hydroxide ? n h four o h  now this when a one or two words takes in  hydrochloric acid is taken here the jar we see that white fumes  of ammonium chloride are seen  means what ? ammonia react with hydrochloric gas to form   ammonium chloride   hydrochloric gas   ammonium chloride  now once again we repeat the physical  properties   properties  can anyone tell all the physical properties ? ammonia is a uh colourless gas  it is lighter than air it is it is highly soluble in water noise  come on next property bhushan ? ammonia is colourless gas uh it has uh sharp pungent uh irritating odour  it is lighter than air it is soluble in water  uh it can be liquidified by cooling in low pressure  it is combustible in air and uh it is not  it is combustible in air ? it is it is not combustible in air neither it supports  combustion sit down  now the chemical first chemical property  yes priyadarshan ? ammonia gas is basic  okay and how will you can you say that ammonia gas is basic  ? it turns red litmus to blue   red litmus to blue  okay next property ? asha ? it reacts with water and forms ammonium hydroxide it reacts with water and forms ammonium hydroxide  ammonium hydroxide  what is the formula for ammonium hydroxide ? you kapil ? n h three plus uh  no teacher  no ? n h four four a  what is the formula for uh ammonium hydroxide ? n h four o h  now the gas when kept with turmeric paper the turmeric paper turns yellow brown brown  the yellow colour change to brown   change to brown noise  now we see the next property  you take the mixture of ammonium chloride and make lines  and put it in a dry test tube  now just insert a hot platinium wire into it now the hot wire will supply heat to the mixture  yes  and it reacts platinium is acting as a catalyst now what do you mean by the word catalyst ?  wire  a substance which helps in chemical reaction  one at a time  the substance which helps in increasing the rate of reaction but does not take part in the chemical reaction   increasing the rate of reaction but does not take part in the chemical reaction  so what happens this gas oxidised to colourless nitric oxide gas  ammonia gas oxidised to colourless nitric oxide gas  the nitric oxide further combines with oxygen  oxygen and from air and it becomes firm reddish brown  coloured nitrogen dioxide   oxygen   brown coloured nitrogen dioxide  this nitrogen dioxide fumes are seen in the test tube   test tube  so yes what happens when clay lime and ammonium chloride   mixed in a taken in a dry test tube ? when a hard platinium wire is inserted when a hard platinum wire is inserted ammonia gets oxidised to form nitric oxide  this nitric oxide further takes oxygen from air and you get brown fumes of nitrogen dioxide   dioxide  here platinium wire is acting as a catalyst   catalyst  so can anyone repeat the point  yes uma ? hot platinium wire is inserted in the mixture of  ammonium chloride and clay lime then hot uh then ammonia gas is oxidised into nitric  ox nitric oxide nitric oxide takes oxygen from the air and that and red brown fumes of nitrogen oxide we get  okay  now you please sit down  now we see the third property that bb-work cold concentrated hydrochloric acid is taken in a test tube and the ammonia gas is passed over it  it combines uh reacts with the acid and forms crystals of  ammonium chloride   chloride  it forms crystals of ammonium chloride   ammonium chloride  so n h three plus h cl gives you n h four cl   n h four cl  have you understood ? yes  means it readily combines with h cl forming crystals of  ammonium chloride   ammonium chloride  can anyone repeat the properties ? ammonium uh uh reacts with ammonia reacts with ? ammonium uh uh  ammonium reacts with the oxygen two times only this much ammonium reacts with the h cl forming crystals of ammonium chloride  and tell the equation n h three   n h three plus h cl gives you n h  four cl sit down noise  now we see that this ammonia reacts with cold concentrated sulphuric acid and nitric acid  so take sulphuric acid in one test tube and nitric acid in  another test tube   another test tube  pass ammonia gas through this test tube  we see that it reacts with sulphuric acid giving you ammonium sulphate crystals of ammonium sulphate and it reacts with nitric acid giving you ammonium nitrate nitrate   nitrate  so which should which can you tell me the   summarize of the property that it gives salt it forms salt with when it reacts with its acid the respective salts are formed have you understood ? yes  now see this chlo hydrochloric acid it is forming  chloride ammonium chloride with sulphuric acid it is forming sulphate ammonium  sulphate   sulphate  with nitric acid it is forming  ammonium nitrate   nitric   ammonium nitrate  can anyone repeat these three properties noise  yes samir ? the the ammonium reacts with hydrochloric acid to form and to form ammonium chloride and it reacts with  sulphuric acid to form ammonium sulphate and it re reacts with  uh nit nitric acid to form ammonium nitrate  so any difficulty to you ? no  or you have not understood ? yes we have understood  so then we see the next property  when ammonia gas is slowly passed through copper sulphate solution what happens ? a bluish white precipitate is formed  a bluish white precipitate of copper hydroxide is formed and when more ammonia gas is passed this precipitate dissolves in the excess of ammonia and a solution of deep colour  blue colour is formed  precipitate means  what do you mean by precipitate ? the residue which is remaining at the bottom  the residue or the substance which remains at the  bottom   bottom  now see here when ammonia is passed through copper sulphate you get a bluish white precipitate  but when more ammonia is added this precipitate dissolves with  and you get uh da deep blue colour solution  have you understood ? yes  so when you pass more ammonia the precipitate divo  dissolves and you get deep blue colour solution  can anyone summarize the properties ? summarize means tell in short  all the properties or one property uh one student  the che the chemical properties of ammonia are  ammonia gas is basic which reacts with water and form ammonium hydroxide  it burns in atmosphere oxygen with yellow flame  it combines with hydrogen chloride to form ammonium chloride  it combines with oxygen in the presence of a catalyst to form nitric oxide  it gives phosphate acid  ammonia reacts with the solution of salts of nitric to form precipitate of that oxide  so have you understood the chemical properties of ammonia ? uh yes  now we see the uses of ammonia  now first it is used in manufacturing manufaturing means making of washing soda and  sodium bi-carbonate   sodium bi-carbonate  and also in nitric acid   acid  now last year we had seen how ammonia is used in preparing nitric acid when we were studying acid  now washing soda and sodium bicarbonate are different  the formula for washing soda is sodium carbonate na two c o three   three  and for sodium bicarbonate it is na h c o  three   na h c o three  now this sodium bicarbonate is used in preparing food or  making the substance porous  while washing soda is used in ma washing clothes  big clothes or blankets this washing soda is used   used  now it is used in uh manufacturing of fertilisers like ammonium phosphate ammonium sulphate and urea  now these fertilisers help in increasing the food crop of  uh by adding fertiliser what happens the quality and the quantity of the food crop or the grains increases  so these are used ammonium is used in as a fertiliser so that we can get more yield of crop noise  now ammonia is also used in medicine  now solution of ammonia is used in laboratory as a reagent now what do you mean by the word reagent ? what do you mean by the word reagent ? fooding agent which  a substance which helps in chemical reaction  a substance which is helping in chemical reaction  is called as a reagent   chemical reaction   reagent  now this liquid ammonia is also used as solvent we have seen what do you mean by solvent is in which the substance gets dissolved   dissolved  so that solution in which the substance is getting dissolved is called as a solvent   solvent  now ammonia is also used as a solvent  some substance get dissolved in ammonia  now any difficulty in chemical properties and uses of ammonia ? no noise  now just answer the questions orally noise  describe the laboratory of ? what are the chemicals used in preparing ammonia by laboratory method ? yes ? uh in laboratry methods uh ammonia ammonium chloride and clay lime is used  ammonium chloride and clay lime is used   clay lime is used  what is the ratio of the mixture ? the ratio of uh the mixture is three is to two  three is to two  what is done to the mixture ? the mixture is heated  the mixture is heated   heated  what comes out of the tube ? the ammonia gas comes out  through which it is passed ? yes ? it is passed through delivery tube  to the line tower through the line tower it is passed through the line tower   line tower  why is it passed through the line tower ? yes ranjeet ? to dry  to dry the gas   dry the gas  how is the gas collected ? yes ? by the downward uh downward displacement of jar  so any difficulty in this no 
the development of painting in india interruption  on page number three hundred ninety-two  as far as paintings are concerned here comes the role of frescos today the colours are much faded  but it is of its own kind  another type of frescos we find at barhat in bihar  and luckily ajanta paintings are in maharashtra  the line used by the ajanta artist is unique unparalleled  though i have mentioned the example of barhat in bihar but  ajanta frescos are are of its own type of its own class  depicting various stories in the life of buddha  in northern india the frescos at bhag also  the mughals brought with them the traditions of persian painting can we call it indo-islamic school of painting or art ? anyone of you ? can we call it indo-islamic school of painting in art ? it can be called as it can be called indo-islamic it can certainly be called because of fusion   aini akbari mentions a number of artists abdul samad mir sayyed ali miskin dasvant  dasvan mukand  so some of the famous names of the painters of the then times  have been mentioned here  now page number three hundred ninety-four   sir ninety-four  jahangir was a great patron of painting  patron means supporter helper  one who helps us like a father is a patron  one who helps us like mother is matron  and original words they are from sanskrit coming to latin  and then in modern indian languages like english  so original word is pitro and matro   jahangir was a great patron of painting  was akbar also a great patron of hist uh painting ? or only of painting ? wilson smith has mentioned in his book on akbar that akbar was a patron of all fine arts  and i will include literature also in it  so foundational work of the development in painting was already done during the period of akbar  from second battle of panipat fifteen fifty-six  closing year of akbar's life sixteen hundred and five so foundational work was done  but his son who took the name jahangir came to the throne in sixteen hundred and five and died in sixteen twenty-seven  so during this period of twenty-two years indian fine art  specially painting got tremendous stimulation and boost  so painting in india both of miniature type and mural type have been developed during the period of jahangir's  special  but only to be a patron not knowing anything about the art is it possible ? anyone of you ? no sir no sir  why not ? now raise your hands  yes  without knowledge how can we draw our various things and ideas can not possible correct  so a man who knows the work can only get the work done  from others   that's why rigorous training is imparted in india to the cadet who become officers in future  so he must had have a fair idea about any type of work  then only he can get it done from others  that is he can command perfectly  hotel de matol must be a good cook himself otherwise holding that post in five- star hotel at bombay or any other international centre is not a joke  so not only we see but quite profeciency in any branch of work  or discipline is a must  specially painting and various schools of art in painting developed during the period of jahangir mainly for a reason that he was master of the art himself that he has mentioned  then nadir murad bhishandas manohar govardhan  mansoor and faruk baig they all got help from emperor himself  darashiko was a patron of painting  who was this darashiko ? eldest son of shajahan  youngest son of  eldest son of shajahan was darashiko  what is the speciality about darashiko ? can you mention one point in one sentence  first stand and then give the answer   he was a the greatest  yes ? sit down yes ? he practised what he preached   haan  you please explain that  means uh he never ignore for interested in art so that he get man and what he told he would himself  yeah  i would give the answer to this question myself like this  he was a liberal minded man  he was a follower of sufism  he was tolerant to all religions and therefore he was a patron of all schools of arts  all types of religions wherever he found some sort of spark  he was always ready to run there as a patron to help it  so all types of artist got encouragement from him it was not that only the muslims got it hindus were in majority  perhaps this might not have been liked by aurangzeb and may be because of that darashiko was disposed off  even put to death  and the rule which aurangzeb afterwards introduced was full of fanaticism too full of debauchery  that may be the reason darashiko is a great personality  he got many and various books of sanskrit translated into persian  such type of liberal man  can he encourage arts in india ? raise your hands and answer because my next question will be please explain  yes ? he was learned scholar and free views on others means  yes but  such type of man who is a you can say a saintly type of man  can he encourage the arts ? perhaps  no not so  sit down yes ? as he was in interested in painting therefore he  used to encourage   accha was he encourage uh uh was he interested only in painting no he was interested in literature he translated many book of that indo-persian books and he used to read them  yeah  so literature painting  was he intersted in architecture ? no  anyone raise the hands  no  jahangir was specially interested in painting exclusively and therefore this book which is the publication of n c e r t has specially mentioned the name of jahangir here though  darashiko in with his limitation has previously tried to encourage various arts  the most important schools of painting emerged where the  rajasthani and pahari schools   pahari  what is this pahari school ? if anybody knows  sir it is one word pahari school anyone else ? you ? it is from pahad   haan pahari work comes from  pahad   it's pahadi so pahadi da  is many times pronounced as ra  so in mountainous region in the himalayas various schools of art developed  in painting also  so all of them put together are known as pahari  paintings  what is this rajasthani painting ? sir desert desert  yes ? developing in rajasthan developing in rajasthan  it has got nothing to do with desert because mainly the paintings in rajasthan are about life of shri krishna  and the period of the early life and afterwards desert period  was around mathura and then in gujarat because the new city which he established can you tell the name of that city which was established by shri krishna ? dwarka dwarka which has now seen the bottom of the  ocean   ocean  please sit down  it has been unearthed by one word noise  haan under the supervision of him it has been located now  so it is a very good proof about all descriptions which you find about that city in mahabharat  sit down  then languages and literature  two main groups of languages the indo-european or indo-aryan and dravidian  why he has said indo-european and indo-aryan ? because aryans came from aryavarta  no i would like to suggest you one method  yes soman ? because aryans came from the north uh northern track of asia and they have got their own language  yes ? the aryans came from the region of caspian sea  yes  around the caspian sea from central asia  some of the tribes went to europe some of them  reached in india  but they are included in the indo-european group  so indo-europeans or indo-aryans  why this uh word indo comes there ? sir they came to india   india  river indus  means that tribes of the aryans who came to india  can they be called indo-europeans ? if they centralised form of culture of india if they can be called as indo-europeans then what is the  need for the use of word indo uh uh indo-aryans ? you think and answer  not just your guess  because they are the aryans now settled in india then only you call them indo-aryans  then nothing about indo-europeans at all  because they come neither from europe nor from india  they come from central asia  so indo-european what do you understand by the word indo-europeans ? europeans coming in india europeans settled in india  europeans settled in india never  there is no record because indo- european is a false language  indo-aryans is correct  and aryans who settled in europe  what word he has used for that ? indo-aryans  aryans who settled in europe ?  indo- europeans   europe  it looks simple but it is not simple  so now finally last question  to what branch do we belong today ? indo-aryans  dravidians  dravidians  anyone else ? indo-aryans indo-aryans  if we are indo-aryans and one boy said dravidian then what is the difference between indo- aryans and dravidians ? now burden will fall on your shoulders  dravidians were in india  yes ? they were  they were original inhabitants of india  they were original inhabitants of india before coming of whom ? aryans  before coming of indo-europeans or aryans  aryans  or indo-aryans  where do they live even today ? southern part of india what is this method ? means what part of india ? southern part of india southern part of india only  then those who have settled in forest because of the onslaught of the aryans original inhabitants of india as you have just now said  who were defeated by the aryans  history records that they ran away into the deep jungles and forests  what are you going to call them  you say you uh dravidians are settled only in south india  that's why this question i am putting up ? before coming of the aryans all the people they who were living in india according to your definition are original inhabitants of india  did all of them run to south ? nobody ran to the east north or west ? ran ran  then what are they ? what are you going to call them ? are they there today or not ? yes sir  then what is their names ? tribes schedule tribe tribes  whom we have scheduled in the constitution so we call them scheduled tribes  now my final question  those dravidians who you say that are in south india can you call them scheduled tribes ? no no sir  why not ? just now you gave the definition i am only clearing your ideas yes ? these are minorities that is they referred they have been a few words  then ? from there orissa  imparts yes ? there have been means uh indo-aryans sir indo-aryans then  some of these split into  dravidians  then what is the use of calling them dravidians  they are not called as dravidians  you see the reason is like this aryans came  conquered india defeated the original inhabitants but all this drama was played in north india  or such a long period aryans just could not come to the south  for two reasons  first thing north india is not a small place  it is very big area  thus they would be going by slope only  if they come across the mountains naturally they are going to avoid that side or direction  so their journey was eastwards till the conquest of  modern bengal assam arunachal pradesh that is upto uh uh jaintia patkoi hills  and patkoi hills  patkoi hills  sir hills garo khasi patkoi patkoi then they would turn to the south  so it took a very long time for them to defeat the people who were already settled in south and who had developing  developed their special culture and they had developed their languages with the different scripts this is important  cultural heritage is mainly this  so kannada andhra and was telugu malyalam and tamil is basic languages of the original inhabitants of the country  or of dravidian nature  but they were not misplaced  they were not disorganised they continued to prosper and develop their own way of life which is known as culture  so dravidian culture is mainly in south india in that sense  sanskrit was a language of the indo- aryans  does it mean sanskrit was not the language of the dravidian group  ? yes sir but it might  pointed question you think and answer  last boy ? no  no  no   one or two words  dravidians people may have learnt that language from the aryans from the aryans only ? because yes sir   unless  ah unless the aryans penetrate into the south they can not understand nor they can come in the contact of uh indo-aryans  language that is sanskrit  can there be a language without grammar ? no  no then what is first grammar or language ? grammar language  follow one method  what will take first ? what will come into being first grammar or the language ? the language and  first language  first language only will come  the child who imitates the parents and tries to speak doesn't know anything about grammar  but once that pattern is set then someone had to bring it into rules  then once the rules are framed all the things or writings  or your way of speak is not according to those rules then we say this is not correct grammar  but is it a language ? yes it is it is a language  so sanskrit language aryans brought with them only from central asia  but the period is early the people were in the form of tribes war type of warriors better conquerers  but once they settled on the permanent footing in the  sapta sindhu areas that is punjab then someone must give some rules also  to consolidate it to classify it to make it classical one  panini did that work 
we had already learnt about the space flight of yuri gagarin the pioneer in the field of uh space flight  we have come upto the launching of the spacecraft  further we studied will study on page fifty-seven  page number page number sir page number sir page number  fifty-six at fifty-seven  fifty-seven  how many days after the launching the first and the second stages of rockets had bend down and fallen away the spacecraft projectory altered as i turned to go into orbit parallel with the earth  surface  gagarin pulled himself towards the window i can see the earth in a haze   i'm feeling fine  a moment later he added it looks uh beautiful   he was rather uh startled and exasperated when he looked through the window to the earth down below  he says i can see in a haze or it was not very clear the vision was not very clear it was murky or rather uh foggy or misty  therefore he says in spite of the fact that i can see the earth in a haze it looks so beautiful  he loosened the scarf holding him to his couch  his body weightless in space rose slightly above the seat  though still held uh loosened scarf  he was in fact floating in his cabin  when he loosened his belt he was floating in the cabin  as you are aware of he experiences the weightlessness there in the outer space therefore he was floating  every three or four minutes he repeated his instrument reading through the radio telephone and received confirmation from ground control  straight in front of him in his cabin was an instrument panelled with the globe navigator  a remarkable device which represented the earth below him  the globe slowly resolved as his position altered in relation to the earth  quite often he had to come into contact with the earth station  or it is otherwise known as the earth controlling station  there was the panel of instruments displayed in his cabin  he had to observe the readings and the functions of this cabin  and it has to be conveyed through the telephone to the uh ground station  and they will confirm and accordingly they give instructions  what is to be done uh how it should be done so that he is always in contact with the uh earth station though he is all alone in the  vostok  in the cabin away from uh the earth hundreds of miles  travelling at the tremendous speed of uh about eighty thousand uh  miles per hour  still he is in contact with the earth station and  it is the two way system  he will inform them and they will accordingly uh instruct him what is to be done and what not to be done  but the minutes after the launching he was over south africa  south america   all is well he reported i am not too much troubled by the feeling of weightlessness  the report was given to the world by way of moscow radio  forty-six forty-five minutes after launching he was just above the south america and he conveyed uh to the earth station though he experiences weightlessness fear of gravity   it does not cause any harm to him and this report was rather broadcast by the moscow radio to all the  peoples in russia  a little later the atlantic was below him just visible only surface and of course quite invisible was the russian tracking ship  using radar equipment to keep contact with the invisible spaceship a little later he was above the atlantic ocean  so he could see the sea or ocean clearly  he could not see the tracking ship  a ship was uh equipped with radar sophisticated uh  instruments to track the uh course of uh gagarin's flight he could see the ocean clearly  despite he couldn't see the ship which is uh detailed for tracking his uh flight  after just over an hour the space flight he was passing the coast of africa a red light in the instrument panel gleamed  this was a warning that the descent would begin in ten minutes  he checked the instruments again and then reported that all was well  while he was above africa a red light was gleaming  shining this was an indication his return journey should start within a short while   do you want to make an alteration in the flight plan  ? he was asked from the earth station the ground control he was asked whether he would like to change any uh change in the  schedule of his or plan of his flight whether he wants to remain in the space for a uh extended period ?  cough  he replied that he was not to be brought down as planned sorry  he replied that he wanted to be brought down as planned although he would how nice to go round the world again  and although the cabin was stored with ten days supply of food in case of any landing difficulty gagarin thought it best to keep to the  prepared flight scheme  he informed the ground control though he would like to continue the flight for an extended period he wants uh everything should be done according to the plan or the schedule  therefore he said that he is ready for everything is ready he checked for the return journey  at just the right moment retro-rockets were automatically fired  to slow off the spaceship at the same time the cabin was turned to exactly the right angle for the entry of the earth atmosphere  this operations were dealt with the with by a computer on the ground although in case the need gagarin could have used manual control  automatically the retro-rocket that means to slow down the speed  and tearing off the uh spacecraft because when it enters the atmosphere there is rather there is the line imaginary line the outer space and the atmosphere  there was a lot of rather you see that what you call that uh  heat generated when the space spacecraft re-enter our uh atmosphere that is why they used to make the spacecraft with a particular  uh metal which can resist or withstand the astronomical amount of heat produced even then uh spa cosmonauts astronauts are also uh made to wear a number of space suits to avoid any harm when it re- enters the uh our atmosphere  so it was ready retroket rocket that means for receiving coming back automatically it was fired everything was done by computer  though there was the alternative provision for gagarin to operate these things manually if something goes wrong he has to come back to the earth therefore they always keep the contigency plan or alternative arrangement  if everything goes smoothly the computer will operate  if the firing of the rocket from time to time the tearing off the spacecraft everything will be monitored and controlled by the earth controlled station  after this exactness was record a very slight error might mean a lightening at a point of many miles from that intended  a slightly greater error could result in a descent with a space cabin at the wrong angle and it's destruction by the heat resulting from the air friction  it had to be done very meticulously  very uh rather you see that uh uh exactly in the sense very with clinical precision precisely everything has to be done  a minor negligible error can cause uh a tremendous uh rather you see that a damage which may cause the destruction of uh  spacecraft and uh cosmonaut gager gagarin himself  so everything has to be very precise  gagarin felt the jolt of the breaking rockets gave the shattereing rock but the change was not violent as he has expected  he felt the sensation of weightlessness gradually leaving him as he started his returning journey the air brake was applied he could feel the jolt suddenly he was rather you see that uh jolted or moved  and then he was feeling the rather you see that the  gravitation of the earth as he was nearing to the earth the weightlessness was rather vanishing or on the decrease  the pressure became stronger and stronger as the vostok  descended  his face visible on the television screen became drawn and tight almost in the flatness  the nose forced in the eye sockets widened  he could barely see  speech was beyond him though his hearing remained  the voice of the ground controller was saying that all was well when that spacecraft the vostok re-entered the atmosphere for a few moments it was unbearable for him  his face was flattened his eye sockets were bulging and  he could not even speak  only he could hear and he could hear the ground station was telling everything was going on smoothly after the schedule  don't worry  otherwise he was experiencing there for a uh few moments  quite uncomforatable because his face was swollen or flattened eyes were bulging  he could not talk  restlessness he felt drowsiness he felt except he could  uh hear  the agonizing g-pressure lasted only a minute or two  then it was lifted his weight became more normal  this unbearable and agonizing the painful the most painful experience lasted for two minutes  then he was alright  above target and on coast parachute raised coming on it was control system  then again it was conveyed everything was in perfect trim perfect condition   extended noise  the voice prepared him for the physical shock as the parachute opened above the capsule  the slowing down of the vostok was so abrupt that it was like a blow in the church  the spacecraft also is fitted with a parachute  we can imagine when it travels at a tremendous speed of eighteen  thousand miles if if it comes back to the earth at the same speed  it will come and dash to the earth to the destruction of uh  spacecraft and occupant  therefore it has to be the speed had to be curtailed or contained the there was the parachute it was opened  from the window he could now recognise features of the land below him  it was an old training base in contrast with the rest of his journey  the descent was quite slow  but the ground in fact was coming closer and closer to the  consider considerable speed  as he was coming down and down descending flight returning flight he could see the land  it was an old discarded uh uh training station there he was going to land  the final stages of the descent were first seen by two women working in the fields of the widely spread parachute descended  with the mysterious cabin suspended below it  the woman's first thought was that they were witnessing the arrival of a spy  it was not very long since an american airman reconnoitre high over russian territory had been brought down  the resulting neutral spy trend in russia had got great sensation  throughout the world  when he was descending two women happened to see  they were rather frightened because at that time the  sensational uh bringing down of the u-two plane  u-two plane is a it was a spy plane of america  it is took it took off from pakistan  uh it it could not be rather you see that traceable unless a country has got a sophisticated instruments  if it flies over india we may not be able to know whether it is flight of course now we are in a position in those days you can imagine in sixties only uh russia or some advanced country could detect the uh reconnoitre means spying flight of this planes it is called u-two plane  it took off from pakistan because it is a close ally of united states even today it is the close ally  so they allowed the planes the spy plane to take up reconnoitre plane or otherwise it is called espionage spying is called bb-work  this plane was on a mission to espionage or spying  russians uh could uh detect the presence of this plane they brought down uh with a missile  and the pilot was captured his uh name uh if i i'm not wrong uh powell  an air-force officer a pilot called powell  he was imprisoned  after many years with americans and russians negotiated and uh  he was released he was given his freedom  in those days this sensational news was spread all over russia  about the bringing down of uh u-two spy plane  this woman the poor uneducated woman of the countryside  took this as an ameriacn spy plane  they were rather frightened when this spacecraft was coming down with the parachute over it  they mistook it for a united states or american spy planes because the news was uh raging at that time about the bringing down of this u-two plane the spy the plane on its espionage or reconnoitre was brought down 
the ground water  i was talking about the rain water which enters which falls on the surface of the earth is distributed in three ways now can you tell me the three ways in which it is distributed  yes naresh ? uh first it percolates uh means uh it percolates   where does it percolate ? uh when it falls on the ground yes ? what happens to it ? it gathers into ponds correct  and it falls as rain sit down  which is the other one ? miss it is evaporated  okay it evaporates  third one ? which is the third way in which the rain water is it goes underground  okay he said it goes underground on slopes the streams are formed  correct   slopes down the slope the streams are formed  good afternoon sir addressed to another teacher who came in   sit down sit down  sit down  so which is the third way ? it flows down the slope to the river to form a river  so the three ways in which the rain water which falls on the surface of the earth is distributed  first thing it is eva some part of it evaporate  second one it flows into small streams streams to join to form a river  and the third one is that it percolates inside into the  surface of the earth  now the third one which the water percolates inside the earth forms what we'll call as what would you call it ?  to the river  well  okay well  but where are these wells ?  where does where is the water in the well ? ground correct  that is underground water  so today we are going to study about the work how this  of underground water bb-work  how this underground water is useful to man  now underground water you know the water percolates inside the earth  but it is not the same throughout on every part of the surface  it is going to be different and it depends on various  factors  now yesterday we were doing i told you about how water falls are formed  okay ? and we were talking about the structure of the earth  now suppose we take a mountain  this is the base noise  as i told you yesterday the waterfall has underneath it  you have permiable non-permiable   non-permiable  what do you mean by non-permiable structure ? in which the water doesn't percolate correct  because the surface is hard and because it's not porous the water cannot get inside  now when the rain water is falling on the surface it gets as you told me goes inside  now where is this water going to settle ? yes ? it goes under ground where do you mean ? what do you mean by ? at the base correct  somewhere here  is it not ? now this part is going to form what you call as the water table  is it not ? this part where the water is settled down is called as a water table   now this now this amount of water in this water table would depend on various factors  can you tell me what would it depend on ?  one or two words  correct the amount of rainfall  now wherever er those areas which have  high rainfall the water is going to be more in percolate more inside anything else ? nature of the soil inside the water table correct the nature of the soil  excellent answer  where esle ? what all what are the other points ? third one yes ? inside the earth loudly please  inside the earth  correct he said he said the same thing the nature of the soil  structure or level of level of the water table okay sometimes  he is given a different answer but that is also sometimes what happens that er uh mountain may have two water table you know two in the in a  non-permiable wa structures like in the cases i told you about a waterfall  now here the waterfall is going to be above  there are going to be two different waterfalls water tables  this wat kind of water table is called as perched  water table  is that understood ? now which is the other point on which the water table the amount of water is going is going to depend on ? level of the ground  okay the level of the ground  what else ? loudly please close the door  size of the mountain size of the mountain anything else ? see the top of the mountain the tip is not a very big place not a very you know it's it's got it has  uh how would you define a mountain ? yes naresh ? the area of high altitude with steep slopes to the land correct now what is the second point you said was steep slope  is it not ? nahid  now this area is going to continue  if the slope is steep what will happen ? yes uh mukesh ? the circulation will be easy the circulation would be easy of what ? anybody else ? sit down  yes kabra ? the water is sloped down  okay and what would happen ? continue with that now what ? the water is percolated correct the the slopes some you know more steep you would have more water getting inside the water table  so these are the various aspects on which the waterfall  the water table depends  something else ah now let's go back to our very basic  how do rain fall ? on what do they depend on ? the amount of water evaporated correct  evaporation correct something else ? good point when something else related to that yes ballal ? there is there more water okay what happens where where which are the regions where you would have more water ? you know more more rains to be more precise yes ? the slope of the mountain correct  something else ? it is actually two words which is uh okay  and then  you're coming somewhere near  miss uh the water get deposit  okay now next  all the points you hilly regions hilly region  okay hilly regions  hilly regions hilly region  yes ? from the sea  sea okay  you're getting you know trees correct  excellent where there is more vegetation because of the leaves attract the water as a more scientific reason  you would have what is called as more rainfall there because of the trees so vegetation is the point noise  the other is evaporation  yes ?  one or two words  okay afterwards  now these are the various fa factors on which the water table is formed now what does this water table why is it used ? how is it used ? how does man use this water table ? can you think ? how does the man how does man use this water table ? by taking water from the well correct in the form of well yes ? by digging canals  its inside  yes ? wells okay wells of different type  now we see now we have seen in various movies and we have heard in various documentory we have heard in we've read in newspapers and we just know through our general knowledge that uh  we cannot you know dig a well any way which you like  now can you tell me why is it so ? underground underground ? springs are there okay he says underground springs exist we will talk about what is a spring afterwards some places are uh weak  okay very weak but something else you know water is not getting in correct yes or they may be to be more precise  anything the area is non-permiable yes non-permiable yet some wherever vary where those regions then you have water table and where it is easy for the man to dig you may have   what wells  you know where the water table is high and exist possible for man to find dig for a well  now in maharashtra you have under konkan coast tapi purna basin other various areas where a lot of wells are found because of the water table is even in the sahyadri  now can you tell me why in the sahyadri ? the reason is very obvious  in the hilly region because of excessive rainfall and it may have the structure of permiable and non-permiable rocks you may have well there  somebody said that the wells are dug in areas where there are springs  now how would you define a spring ? you know what a spring is ? everybody likes to go to lonavala for holidays rainy ti  season specially and you see a lot of springs and waterfalls also  now how would you describe a spring ? yes ? the water which uh slope underground falls from a head we did something like that way it is similar definition what was that ? a waterfall there is a difference between a waterfall and a spring  ground water is one word the ground water you can see on uh tap also  is it not ? how would you differentiate between a spring a tap and a waterfall  ? the underground water coming out with force correct  underground water comes out with force as she said  it is a natural outflow of water from the interior of the earth  now where does this water come out from ? can you just link up whatever we did till now and try to tell me the answer  yes bilwa ? the water table and loudly bilwa ? there are water table and the okay  they were there are water table and the earth crust is weak  so there are the regions where you have waterfalls  where you have something called a spring bb-work  now suppose here there is a crack or a weak structure  now the water this is the whole the whole   water table  the water is coming out  and you would have what you would term as a spring  so spring is the natural outflow of water some from the interior of the earth where the crust is weak  now the springs are of different types  springs suppose there is a cavity you know there is she said the crust is weak now suppose if there is a cavity here  you know what a cavity is ? what is a cavity ? empty space yes ? empty space empty space  okay a kind of a hole you see here where is this term used mostly cavity ? where have you heard this term ? dental problem dental problem  cavity is with all the people  everybody all of us like eating sweets and we develop what you call as a cavity is it not ? so suppose similarly the now take imagine the structure of the earth the mountain or any place bb-work  like a mouth having a cavity now when the rain water falls on the surface what is going to happen ? there it store water correct all the water might get inside and get stored here  and suppose there is a crack due to erosion you would have a spring coming out  now this spring it may be termed as uh cycle spring a cycle spring  where there is a cavity in the earth in the you know in interiors you would have the water get stored and due to some crack or erosion of some kind the water comes out through some outlet to form a spring and that kind of spring is called as a cycle spring  now from the spring we will go to something which i was telling you yesterday as a continuation that because of the structure of the earth and because of the various minerals found in the earth you have beautiful structures underground caves formed somewhere  now i will show you suppose there is an area  you know earth consist of maleable minerals  now suppose there is this surface of the earth which is  which's got a lot of lime in it lime stone structure limestone how uh how how would you what is the you know how would you call that uh the scientific name for it ? the i don't know how to tell you that  now h two o is carbon uh water you say how uh how would you call limes ? calcium give me in alphabets c a c o three okay bb-work somebody said c a c o three  if an area has got a lot of c a c o three as you say what would happen ? how does this dissolve ? this does not dissolve in water alone  you have some yes ? carbon di-oxide correct  the carbon di-oxide which is in the air and which  you know join the uh is mixed with the rain water makes it to  weakens the limestone structure and make a lot of depressions erosion takes place  and this area where this surface of the earth where limestone structure is in dominant is a dominant rock structure we would call it as a limestone topa topography  limestone topography  or for you to know something more about bb-work  it is also called as a cast topography   cast topography it is taken from the word cast it is a name of a district in yugoslovia  it is got which is prominent rock structure is the limestone structure  that is why it is also called as termed as a cast  topography from its name of the district cast in yugoslavia  now as i told you erosion takes place with when c a c o three  mixed and the water which you have carbon di-oxide leads to dis  uh leads to limestone dissolving with water and having displaced small kind of depression  now small this may be termed as a pot hole bb-work  a bigger one may be termed as a as gorges to termed as  gorges  now if this continuous say years together you have very beautiful structure forming then  now this you know this the limestone dissolving this water  and sometimes what happen when the limestone dissolves with the water some part of the the lime remains behind  others get you know it washes away with the water and a very small millimeter of lime is remained there  is that understood ? similar structure will take place at the base at the surface  a small structure may remain here or the other water which has lime is washed away  now this goes on for years you know millions of years small small limestones particles remaining behind and they have been given different term  now this is called as stalagmite  stalag mite the other is the stalactites t i t e s stalactites now for you this is very confusing how or how you are going to remember which is stalactite and which is stalagmite stalagmite which is stalagmite ? i will tell you something to remember  mite something to do with mice it rhymes with it  due to some extent mice where is it found ? on the surface  so stalagmites are on the ground stalactites are on the  ce ceiling 
now you stand up ? tell me what is this ? bamboo  this ? uh cotton  sit down  how are these two things prepared ? by  with the help of what ? bamboo  bamboo isn't it ? and also with the help of the means of  means of production what is the means of production ? how they are prepared ?  bamboos with the help of bamboos as already told but how ? with the help of what ? teacher with machine machines  teacher no teacher with the help of hand   hands   with the help of hand hands     with the help of hand hands    and these ? teacher  these these with the help of what ? machines  so these things are prepared with the help of  machine machines and these with the help of hands  hands  now let us see to in today's   lesson how these this machine age started ? machine age started and then how this industrial revolution started ?  noise  so let us take up now this industrial revolution bb- work industrial revolution>  first of all let us study the meaning of industrial revolution meaning bb-work  there are you see just say as you study   the world history  man has passed through several stages isn't it ? in its economic growth he has passed through several stages  first he was a wanderer moving from one place to another place  then he started agricultural activities in then he started having so many other activities isn't it ? so that way why he he was engaging himself in one or the other kind of activities ?  revolution   in in order to progress in order to progress and in order to satisfy his needs  isn't it ? in the primitive stage he used to have only stones  only stones were at his disposal isn't it ? so he was using the stones and preparing instruments out of it  you know how he made fire as you know by friction and everything you know and the other weapons also he made out of stones and then in the agricultural stage he started making use of wood wooden plough and wooden instruments he started preparing  understood no ? so why he prepared all those things ? in order to satisfy his needs   needs  that was his prime necessity satisfying his needs was his prime necessity   needs  as the time passed his needs increased  there is a va vast difference between the needs of the man in the past and needs of the man in the present age  our present man man's needs are vast unlimited but whereas in the past they had only limited needs  as he has thinking capacity you know that man is an  a thinking animal with the help of his thinking capa  capacity he started finding out new things in   inventions and discoveries he started inventing new things and discovering new lands  and other things  so that way he progressed well  so in the eighteenth century in some parts of the world let us uh refer to those parts later on some parts of the world they started using this   these machines  they started preparing machines  new inventions and they are specially machines they started  you know that  you may be having a little idea about that  what type of machines and all were produced  but if you just said the meaning of the industry here industry means even prior to eighteenth century there were industries isn't it ? there were industries and they were producing so many things  one one example of the same kind this basket and this these steel cups   i have now here  cups  they used to prepare cups not of steel but of  bronze copper gold silver they used to prepare no  even that can also be called as industry  understood ? what i'm telling you are getting the point no ? yes teacher but yet this industrial revolution which started in the eighteenth century was completly different from that of the previous idea of industry   industry the meaning literal meaning if you just referred to the dictionary it will show you that  industry is nothing but making useful goods out of raw materials  whereas this industrial revolution is completely different  it increased the production  new inventions were made  it is the production was on a  large scale  not only that it changed the pattern of the society  way of life of the people was completely changed  understood no ?  you have studied the meaning of the revolution you know complete change in the way of life of the people   so in this industrial revolution changed the life of the people completely society itself was changed  did you understand ? that is the meaning of here industrial revolution  change in the means means  and in process of production  so now let this industrial revolution is uh not a sudden movement it didn't occur within a fortnight or within one  a month or within two months  it's gradual process  in the eighteenth century it started  in the eighteenth century it started and slowly  it spread all over the world  first it started in england then it spread to other parts even now also industrial revolution is not complete  in india and china the industrial revolution started in nineteenth century  whereas in african countries it has started just now  in some of the african countries it has started just now that means even now also the process of industrial revolution is going on it is not complete  some countries like england america and all no ? they have achieved full progress understood ? as far as industrial development is concerned  now next topic  factors favouring an industrial revolution  some eight points are there eight factors which generally favour an industrial revolution first one is growing demand for products bb-work  increasing trade and discovery of new markets  you know prior to industrial revolution  in the twentieth century only these two countries america  russia is disintegrated now u s s r is disintegrated  but we will talk about we can talk about   those russia and uh america   they they become poor i mean uh superpowers  but prior to that in sixteen seventy medieval period  britain was superpower like  you can't call it super though but it is was   the strongest politically stable country in the whole world  britain  and it had control ov over   several parts of the world it has had colonies no ? all over the world  our india was also one of the colony of the britishers  and they were successful in all these continent asia africa and european countries they acquired so many territories so many colonies were  under them they were powerful  so there the industrial revolution started first  as they were having colonies as well there was increasing demand for products  you know their colonial policy you know the britishers colonial policy  they didn't allow any industries or any progress to occur in a colonial state   that's why in the colonies there was increasing demand for products  finished product and as much usable goods  then increasing trade also as they had so many colonies they were having increase  increased trade also with the with those  colonies then discovery of new markets  they were not happy with whatever they were having   they were have going for more and more colonies  who are going for more and more colonies ? england   european country espece european countries especially britain   britain  then second factor that favoured the industrial revolution is  the need to change the productive process  prior to industrial revolution they used to prepare the goods with the help of hands  you know ? in order to prepare the small one small  basket they need needed more than one hour no  ? yes  but this type of sturdier ones cups  steel cups   they can be they can prepare or   we can manufacturing we can manufacture this type of cups more than thousands  they can produce with the help of machine isn't it ? so that way the wasting waste of time they were planning to have such a machine which produced more things within limited time  so that way what happened is need to change the productive process start  they wanted to change the product the means of production  next the third is discoveries and inventions  these discoveries you know the difference between discoveries and inventions ? i think so  can you tell me the what is the difference between the inventions and discoveries ? inventions means uh inventing a completely new thing and discovery means to discover uh a land to find out the land which is already existing no not known  known  it is already existing but unknown to the rest of the world that is discovery invention means ? it is no just like which what was not at all there there and it is found that is invented that we call as inventions   there   inventions  then next is sit down this discovery is you know in eighth standard you have studied about the geographical discovery so many lands were uh land routes and lands were found out by great sailors like vasco de-gama  megallan and so many other sailors you have studied all this  de-gama  and inventions for the invention is as far as inventions are concerned they found out new machines  that we are going to study in detail in the next chapter again  so that way discovery and inventions also should be there that also favours industrial revolution next fourth factor is capital needed for producing machines see in order to have a factory or a an  industry you need a lot of money not in thousands in  crores in lakhs and in crores  we need isn't it ? so that poor country too for the poor country it was not possible to accumulate that much money  so only a few countries like england were accumulating capital on large scale so that was capital capital means money that is  also one of the important factor that favoured the industrial revolution  next fifth one  an atmosphere conducive to the freedom of thought  if you are have one example i'll  give you if i just scold you and beat you and if i make you only whatever i am asking you you must learn i am whatever  i am dictating you that only you must write and only you that you think you have to study if i tell like that then i am curbing down your capacity to think you won't think then you will become only copycats  there is no work there is no opportunity for your uh uhm intelligence understood no ? to show your intelligence there is no scope only  so whereas if free atmosphere is given then you will come with new ideas no ? so that will lead you in some of the countries that is specially england there where it started first industrial revolution first statred first in england no ? they had free atmosphere that is democratic atmosphere they had   this democratic atmos because of this atmosphere they could think freely and they could find out new things and they could invent new machines and all that  sixth one is availability of coal and iron  in order to have industry we have two essential factors first one is iron then the second one   coal   iron   coal  with the help of iron you can make so many things machines and other articles you know and then steel can also be made with the with the help of iron  then coal coal is also equally essential  for what ? advani ? he is not attentive noise  i am asking you coal is also essential in industrial development how is it essential ? and how is it useful ? what is coal you know ?  kolsa  uhm what type of kolsa ?  dagadi   dagadi kolsa it is called as you know in  marathi   yes  yes ? yes use ? for producing thermal energy  for heating the iron iron  particles in  that is that is that means for generating n h thermal energy it is called as  so in order to run the machines power is essential no ? power is essential so that power is can be  obtained by heating the coal run with the help of the coal we can obtain the power to run the machines so that these two things were also available in england   let's have a skilled labour to handle a machine if you have visited any factories factory   you have visited any factory or uh industry  they have so many divisions like like uh   welding moulding dyeing they fitting this that so many you no ? so that way there will be so many departments like  to handle this each department they should be  have skilled labours who are having some technical know-how regarding that paticular department  that is essential  otherwise it will be like sambar daba  in one daba only all things are kept no  that way only one person only handling all the things that  means there is no excellence you won't expect any excellence in that  so for each ever whichever one field only for example if you take welding and you will become perfect in that particular field 
all right now we've been looking at catford's theory of  that doesn't mean uh you should not write  okay just because it's being recorded doesn't mean that you shouldn't take down notes  of course you will have to  uh let us first look at the way he uh we have seen at uh we have looked at his theory of language  this is basically a model of language description which is borrowed from halliday  uh which is known as a scale in category model of uh english  grammar  now let's turn to his discussion of and classification of translation type now catford's theory of translation is essentially a product oriented theory  why do we call it a product oriented theory ? because his main attempt is to look at different kinds of translation and classify these translations into different categories   he's not looking into the mind of a translator  he is looking at the object of translation  the object that the translator has produced  which means that he is looking at the empirical product of translation  what has been actually produced  and he is not looking at what was going behind the translation in the mind of the translator  so this theory is often called a product orientated theory of translation because the approach here is empirical  it tries to analyse classify categorise translations  products of translations into different types  now for catford a theroy of translation is essentially concerned  with a certain type of relation between languages  and therefore he calls it a branch of comparative linguistics  now in this he is very much his approach is very much like the approach of halliday  halliday also if you remember argues that translation is not an independent branch of dis or discipline    uh it is a branch of comparative linguistics  where you compared languages so to establish the comparability between languages  how far they are structurally similar or dissimilar you use translation  catford however goes on to define the translation process  further  he says translation is always unidirectional that is you can always translate at one time from one language to another and not vice versa  that is translation has a direction from english into marathi or marathi into english unidirection  one direction  at one time you can't translate from both english into marathi as well as marathi into english it will have to be a unidirectional process from one language to another  that language from which you translate is called a source language and the language into which you translate is called a target language  and translation is defined as the replacement of  write down the definition please the replacement of textual material in one language that is s l by eqivalent textual material in another language  now obviously there are two key terms in this definition  one is textual material and another is   eqivalent textual material  the term eqivalent  so essentially he is talking about a particular type of text and a particular type of eqivalence  these are the key operations key terms in translation  so before we go on to to discuss the term of the term   eqivalent let us look at the types of translation  uh that he argues there exist  these categories of translations or types of translations are  proposed in terms of extent of translation level of translation and rank of translation  level of translation extent of translation and rank of translation  let us first look at the classification according to the extent of translation that he proposes   there are in each of these there are two types of translations for in all there are six categories of translation that he proposes  so according to the extent to which you translate a text  how much of the text you are translating in a syntagmatic sense  in the linear sense syntagmatic means linear  so are you taking the full text for translation or are you taking only half of the text for translation ? how much of of the text are you taking up for translation based upon this this is known as the extent of translation  now he says if you take the entire text for translation it is known as full translation  if you take only half of the text it will be partial translation so full versus partial translation  now this text may be anything alright it may be a single poem it may be a book of short stories  collection of short stories it may be essays a novel whatever  it can be only a sentence also  text will depend upon how much you have taken as a unit which can be once again of course sub-divided into different units if you take the totality of the text in translation uh you translate the entire text it is full translation if you translate only part of it it is known as partial translation and this relates to the term extent of translation so he proposes three terms extent level and rank  and the first classification according to the extent is full versus partial translation  now in partial translation once again obviously some parts of the text are left untranslated  this may happen for various reasons for example if you are translating the description of a marriage ceremony uh from marathi into english  if there is a sentence sanaiche mangal sur  hote ghumat hote  how will you translate the term sanai    you can't because there is no equivalent for  sanai  now in that case probably we'll have to keep some of these terms just like that in the translation  you will have to say uh i don't know how you would translate this into english but you will have to keep the word sanai  if you might probably say shahnai   okay to make it sound different from the marahti item but you are not proposing any english eqivalent term for  shahanai or sanai  so there may be different reasons why you increase parts sometimes there are no equivalent terms there are no equivalent concepts also  in that case case you will have to keep the term as it is uh in the uh translated text so there are different reasons for why you uh have to adopt the processes of partial translation  now the other uh distinction that he proposes relates to the level of language in question  this classification according to the level of translation uh  is proposed as total translation versus restricted translation  now total translation means translation made at all levels of the source language  when we looked at the theory of language that he was proposing he discussed  he said that he talks about different levels of organization of language for example there is a phonological level there is a morphological level there is a syntactic level  these are all different levels of language now what level are you translating for example he gives later on an example of if you write indian airline  the word indian word indian airline you can write that in english i n d i a n a i r l i n e s or you can also write write it in e and then a nukta on top d with kana matra ya and  na this is also possible you can use uh devanagari script in other words so in restricted translation in total translation you are taking you are proposing translation equivalence at all levels of  the text morphological syntactic etcetera and graphalogical also  now the problem is only uh you don't have equivalence between graphalogical level  you can't have equivalence between graphological level because these are two substances so there won't be any equivalence between these two but you can say that there is equivalence in sentence structure  noun phrases uh word okay or uh clauses main clause-main clause relative clause-relative clause this can happen so in total translation equivalence are proposed at all levels in restricted translation you have you have  replacement uh of only of few levels okay uh once again the third is uh the rank of translation now we use in traditional terminology we use free  translation uh as a term literal translation or free translation  now catford classification of translation type here  unbounded and bounded translation   bounded is rank bound translation and unbounded is translation which is not rank bound which shift up and down on the scale  now let us look at what this means exactly  if is there is a sentence which has a noun phrase and a verb phrase  you translate noun phrases as noun phrases so article by article adjective by adjective a noun by noun  phrase by phrase clause by clause  this is that is the rank of there are different ranks we know  the rank of clause sentence phrase word and sound  your translation may be tied to these ranks  as i said article by article noun by noun adjective by adjective adverb by adverb this is verb by verb this is possible when you translate like this it is known as rank bound translation  sentence by sentence translation that is also rank bound translation within that sentence you may have rank shifting  when we were discussing the scale of rank rank shifting  we discussed that phenomenon of rank shifting and we said that when a sentence a clause for example functions as part of n p we say that a  clause is actually in the higher category and the word or the phrase is actually in the lower category  but a clause can function as a part of the phrase  right ? when we say the boy who was standing in the corner  now who was standing in the corner is a clause which is part of a phrase noun phrase  here we see rank shifting taking place  where rank shifting takes place we say that it is unbounded translation  it is not rank bound  sometimes in traditional terminology when we say that this translation is literal translation and this translation is uhm free translation these are the terms which we usaully proposed you might be asked a question on this uh the difference between traditional terminology of describing translation products and  terminology used by catford  now in traditional terminology we use the term free and literal  in both senses  right in when we talk about literal translation  we may mean uh word by word translation   literal translation word by word or we may also mean sentence by sentence translation  the traditional classification is rather vague  sentence by sentence also becomes literal word by word also becomes literal or meaning by meaning also becomes literal  if you translated a phrase such as kakhet kalasa  and gavala valasa  if you translate this literally word by word it will give some very funny meaning i suppose in english  that will be literal translation where you are totally ignoring the meaning uh you are translating each word but that meaning is not going to be the meaning of that particular proverb there  there can be also example i gave you some examples from the bible je majakadun tijmadhye janmvile te  a case of rank bound translation case of rank bound translation case of literal translation  but remember rank bound is much more clear and definite clearly defined because you know that this is the rank of clause or sentence or phrase or word or sound for phoneme  whereas in literal translation the term is rather vague because in literal translation it can be anything  it can be sentence uh by sentence translation word by word  meaning by meaning okay  but literal translation will always be rather awkward  unless the two languages are absolutely identical which would very rarely be the case it would be a very awkward translation  whereas unbounded translation see we are establishing  clarity between the terms that catford proposes and the terms that have been proposed in traditional translation criticism  catford proposes terms like unbounded and bounded    bounded is according to the traditional terminology literal translation  and we saw the difference between these two terms  in uh unbounded translation you can take liberties with the text that means that sometimes a whole sentence may be translated in a word it is possible to do that  or one for one word you may use one sentence  sometimes in unbounded translation catford doesn't discuss this possibility but it is possible to even delete or add portions of the text add to the portions of the text or you can delete some parts of the text this is possible 
see children i will be uh talking about weathering once again okay   we'll be talking about weathering  now just behave as if you've not learnt this chapter okay  i'll start with from the beginning  now the atmospheric conditions condition   is never constant  it keeps on changing okay there is always throughout you have rise and fall of the temperature okay now as this rise and fall of the temperature affects  human being our skin for example you find that in the cold season  your skin get shrivelled  it get shrivelled it get cracked your lips get cracked  so they are subject to that the changes in the  atmosphere okay the rise and fall in the temperature  now similarly this atmospheric condition this rise and fall of the temperature also affect other components for example the rocks  now like how the wear and tear of a skin similarly the rocks are also subjected to such wear and tear okay due to the rise and fall of the temperature the rocks are also affected  now how they are affected ?  we'll be doing we will i will be discussing that also shortly  now this wear and te tear   it's this uh atmospheric ke changes in the atmosphere a affect the rock and this rock get soften breaks up into pieces  so this is known as weathering  the softening and the breaking up of rocks is termed as  tear  weathering okay the wear and tear like how our skin for example get shrivelled gets cracked  or even in the hot summer season you find it very dry okay you find your skin getting very dry similarly the rocks are also subjected to such wear and tear  and this that exist so the rocks been uh they  are exposed to the atmosphere always  they are always exposed to the atmosphere  this wear and tear of the rock the softening and the breaking up of rock is termed as weathering okay so could you repeat the definition weathering yes ranjeet ? there are uh there are the wear and tear of  of rocks by the atmosphere upon the rock is called weathering  yes of cou upon uh so the softening and the breaking up of rock in geographical term is defined as weathering weathering  weathering  sit down take your seat okay now this weathering can be classified into two types  okay chemical weathering and mechanical weathering   mechanical weathering  okay we classify this weathering into chemical and mechanical okay now what is this mechanical weathering ? that is mechanical weathering is caused because of the rise that difference in temperature the variations in temperatures  cause mechanical weathering  so how does it take place ? what happens to the rock because of the variations in temperature  ? what happens ? the rock gets expa any ma now rock material  when heated gets expanded expanded  expanded  expanded when cooled get contracted contracted  contracted  okay so variations in temperature how does it afffect this rock ? the rocks in the hot summer season gets expanded and when the temperature falls in the winter season gets contracted  contracted  contracted  so this expansion and contraction in the for co  for a long in a course of time what happens ? the rock become becomes loose  it gets weathered  it gets weathered it gets weathered and it starts crumbling  breaking up into pie breaking up into pie  small pieces and from the small pieces into gravel from gravel into very fine particle noise and it becomes ultimately  sand  so the sandy nature of the desert is the result of ? <$ch  sand  mechanical weathering  cough  mechanical weathering so this mechanical weathering is caused because of uh the variations in temperature   temperature  and the variations in temperatures are change in atmosphereic conditions okay the changes in atmospheric condition this uhm we'll just recall what is mechanical weathering complete with this pavle  how would you describe mechanical weathering ? the disintegration of rock yes the disintegration of rock right  due to what ? disintegrate means what ? breaking up  so why how does it break up ? the change in temperature the change in temperature the rise and fall in temperature yes in most in detail  manasi ? teacher dis  just elaborate on the topic disintegration of the uh rock into the chemical process is called mechanical weathering yes due to chemical changes uh  i am talking of only mechanical weathering the changes in the physical temperature so that rock changes weathers it then uh it gets uh how does it get weathered ? the small pieces travels and fallen into the tanks when large pieces but you haven't explained how does it get weathered ? how does it get weathered ? if mechanical weathering is uh result of the variations in  temperature   temperature  so how does the variations in temperature affect rock ? okay let her answer changes in temperature affect rock when the temperature gets more hot the rock uh expand the temerature gets more hot or temperature rises the rock is expanded and when it cools down the rock the rock also get contracted yes due to uh this process of rock finally get uh uh rock finally breaks cough up into pieces  cough because of more weathering it breaks it to   form sand yes  so the sandy nature of uh desert is the result of  mechanical weathering   mechanical weathering  anything more to say ? okay okay so this was what is mechanical weathering  now what is chemical weathering ? now this rock material contains various minerals present in it okay see  weathering  now this uh in this atmosphere the various components of atmosphere what are the various components of atmosphere ? if you recall your earlier portion done in the lower classes what are the various components of atmosphere ? water vapour oxygen gases this water vapour gases nitrogen oxygen carbondioxide various gases presented present  in the organ  then uh dust particles these are all components of the atmosphere now now these chemical these components like water uh carbondioxide water vapour they change the chemical composition of the rock   rock  and when the chemical composition of the rock is changed  it is termed as chemical weathering   chemical weathering  okay  so the various other components of the atmosphere like water vapour uh then carbondioxide nitrogen and the way other uh these organ dust particles they act upon the rocks  the chemical composition present in the rocks is changed  and this is the results do result  and then this is then subjected to various changes  even the chemical composition of the rock changes again it gets weathered  and this can be termed as chemical weathering  so we learnt what is weathering the definition of weathering that the weathering can be classified into mechanical we have learnt mechanical and chemical   chemical weathering   chemical  mechanical is the result of the variations in temperature   variations in temperature  while chemical weathering is the the chemical composition of the rock is changed the chemical composition of the rock is changed  gets changed because of the action of these components components like water-vapour carbondioxide  etcetera  water-vapour carbondioxide   is they act upon the minerals in the rock  they act upon the components and the minerals of the rock and   the the composition of this rock is changed  so this can be termed as chemical weathering   chemical weathering  okay  now now we move to uh at now besides the variations in temperature besides these uh uhm chemical composition getting changed because of the other components in the atmosphere there are others also other methods other ways also by which the rock is weathered okay  i hope you are familiar with the term weathered now what do you mean by weathering and what is weathering of the rock  ? okay now various other factors are also there now there are various external agents of uh the nature okay which act upon the different components in the atmosphere  okay now this external agent can you tell me what are the external agents of uh nature ? yes raja ?  one word  external agents of nature which acts upon the rocks  wa wa wa wa water  water yes  rain water ground water then glacier spring  seawave wind  yes  wind  wind seawave yes they all erode and weathered weather  the rock particles in the atmosphere okay now this rain water the rain water which falls on the earth surface okay they go down in the fo they can they are in  form they join the seas they they  form rivu rivulet  they go into the they get percolated into the  ground and they form ground water  other then that the rain water also is the  responsible for the weathering of rocks   rocks  how ? how is the rain water responsible for weathering of rocks ? we saw how the variations in temperature affect the rock and how the rocks get weathered okay we saw how the chemical components of atmos  how the components of atmosphere are act upon the minerals in the rock and chem chemical  composition gets changed and we saw how weathering takes place  now we shall see how this rain water acts upon the rock and how the rock is weathered because of rain water  okay the rain water which falls on the earth cough  surface gets into uh it falls and it gets into it also enters the rock how ? the cracks from the cracks of the rock they enter the cracks  cracks of the rock okay so this rain water gets collected in the crack of a  the rock   rock  now when the temperature falls when the temperature falls this water doesn't remain as water as well what happens ?  it freezes   it freezes in the extreme cool temperature the water freezes and forms ice   ice  now ice requires more place   more place  it requires more place than water  so what will happen ? when they form ice it requires more places and so therefore the rock is has to get gets expanded  the rock has to get expanded okay the rock expands the rock expands and the crack   widen   widen  the crack widen   widen  so this is also again in course of time this doesn't happen in a day or two or in a year or two in course of time in course of time ultimately what happens to those particular rock ? the rock it gets it disintegrated it gets broken up and they the weathering of rock takes place  so rain water is another factor which causes  weathering which causes weathering  weathering  okay  now uh other creature other the other  other than all this even human beings even living beings  are responsible for the weathering of rock cough for example the rat which burrows itself which makes burrows or digs underground soil to live inside that  earthworms there are so many other these creatures which live under the soil soil okay  so they in course of time by burrowing the soil and eating up the  they uh weather the rock they weather the rock material and these are also one of the uh causes why the rock gets weathered   soil   weathered 
so today we do a lesson about mahatma gandhi who was a humanitarian okay  mahatma gandhi the father of the nation was the first great leader who not only fired the consciousness of the masses for independence but also boldly let the struggle for freedom against the british in india  and we know that mahatma gandhi's weapon for freedom was ahimsa   ahimsa  okay  he provided a moral foundation to indian politics and laid great stress on the spirit of fearlessness  his autobiography the story of my experiment with truth is a classic of our time  so he book he wrote many books  one of them was the story of my experiment with truth   and the chapter which we are doing today is from the last chapter of this autobiography of his  in this extract we see the firm faith of mahatma gandhi in truth and ahimsa  to realise them one must have self-purification in mind  word and deed  the style is simple and direct and sets the readers thinking  noise  it is not without a range that i have to take leave of the reader and why does he say he has to take leave of the reader ? because it is the last chapter okay don't answer chorus because it is the last last chapter of his autobiography okay  last  so he says that it causes great pain to him that he is taking leave of the reader  i had set a high value on my experiment and i do not know whether i've been able to do justice to them  i can only say that i have spared no pains to give a faithful narrative  so he says that he has i have set high value to my experiment he has attached great importance   great importance  he has attached great ipmortance to his experiments with   truth okay  truth  and he is not sure whether he is able to do  justice to those experiments with truth okay   justice to  treat them with fullness and clarity justice  to treat them with fullness and clarity  so that every one who reads the book will understand what he is  writing about  i can say that i have spared no pains to give a faithful narrative  that he's done all that he can do to give  the account of truth that appeared to him in the right way as it appeared to him  to describe truth as it has appeared to me and in the exact manner in which i have arrived at has been his ceaseless effort  so what has been a ceaseless effort ? to speak out the truth and come on yes ? to describe truth as as it has appeared to him and in the exact manner in which he has arrived at his conclusion okay so his ceaseless effort was to ar to describe truth as it appeared to him and in which way he arrived at truth okay  this exercise has given me inaffable mental peace because it has been my fond hope that it might bring faith in truth and  ahimsa to the waverers  and he says this exercise of reproducing truth as he  felt about it as he arrived at truth has given him inaffable mental peace undescribable mental peace  and why does he say ? he says it has given him inaffable mental peace because he has always cherished he has always hope that those who work against  ahimsa would follow the path of ahimsa  once they read the book  okay  so it has it was always his desire his cherished desire that what was his cherished desire ? yes ? after reading the book uh or a everything which is  the one who were  the one who were waverers and they don't know about truth and ahimsa haan that uh  it might bring the waverers uh to that  haan  in the principle of ahimsa  those who were doubtful about the principle of ahimsa  will start following it  my uniform experience convinces me that there is no other god  than truth  so he says that there is only one god and that is  truth   truth  and he does not vary in that  okay he is definite about it that there is only one god and that is  truth   truth  and if every page of this chapter does not proclaim to the reader that the only means for the realisation of truth is ahimsa  i shall deem all my labour in writing these chapters to have been in vain  so he says that first of all he is convinced that there is only one god and that is truth   truth  and another thing he says that in every chapter of the book which book please ? my experiment with truth his experiment with truth okay  in every chapter of his book he has tried to explain that if you want to realise truth if you want to reach to the goal of truth you have to follow the path of ahimsa     ahimsa  okay  i shall deem all my labour in writing these chapters have been  in vain and he says that in every chapter he has tried to explain  that the only means of realisation of truth is ahimsa    ahimsa  and if people do not understand it then his writing  that book and explaining about the principle of ahimsa  is all in vain is futile is useless   in vain  okay  so what is gandhiji's uniform experience convince him ?  gandhiji's uniform experience convinced him that there is only one god and that is truth okay  and how uh what does he say that the only means to realise truth is what ?  ahimsa   ahimsa  the only means to realise truth is ahimsa   ahimsa  okay  and even though my efforts in this belief may prove fruitless let the leader re readers know that the vehicle and not the great principle is at fault  so he says that i he wants to make himself very clear that even after reading the chapters of the book if people still have doubt about the great principle of ahimsa  then they are wrong  it is he who is writing the book may be he is not very clear in his writing and that is why people have the doubt about ahimsa   so he that is the vehicle he himself who is writing the book  he himself is wrong somewhere and not the principle of   ahimsa   ahimsa  after all however sincere my strivings after  ahimsa may have been they have been imperfect and  inadequate and why he says may be he is wrong ? why does he say that may be he is not exactly correct in explaining about ahimsa and writing about ahimsa  ? yes ? because his principle of ahimsa is very  uh complex and it can not be described in uh simple words yes  it is very difficult to describe such a great principle as   ahimsa  and he says that whatever he has seen may not be fully the full of ahimsa  everything of ahimsa  so he said he has tried his level best to describe   ahimsa  the fleeting glimpses therefore that i've been able to have of truth can hardly convey an idea of the indescribable lustre of truth a million times more intense than that of the sun we daily see with our eyes  and what does he say that he only has fleeting glimpses that is vanishing views  okay something which passes off within a minute okay  and he says that it is very difficult to explain  truth whose radiance is million times more than that of the   sun okay   sun  so the brightness of truth is much more than the brightness of the sun   sun  in fact what i have caught is only the plain faintest glimmer of the mighty efflugence  and he says that the radiance the lustre of truth is so  great is so wide that he has only caught the faintest glimmer   faintest glimmer  the dim fading light of truth he's got  and it passes off   but this but this much i can say with assurance as a result of all my experiment that a perfect vision of truth can only follow a complete realisation of ahimsa  so one more thing he says is that if you want to realise truth to the fullest if you want to see truth at its very best then you have to follow the path of ahimsa   ahimsa  know what ahimsa is ? okay follow the principle of ahimsa  only then you can have the full perfect vision of  truth okay   truth  so how can you have a complete vision or perfect vision of truth ? yes pinky ? we can have perfect vision of truth by realising of  ahimsa  only if you realise ahimsa you can have the perfect vision of truth and how what is the power of truth he has described ? how has gandhiji described truth ? yes ketan ? like an one word  say it in complete  power of truth is  haan the power of truth  it is very powerful it is very powerful it is uh said that it is ? million times more than that of the sun million times more than that of the sun  okay the radiance of truth is million times more than that of the sun   sun  to see the universal and all pervading spirit of truth face to face one must be able to love the meanest of creation as oneself and if gandhiji says that if you want to practice  ahimsa practice ahimsa which is found everywhere the to practice truth which is there uh you have to practice ahimsa  if you want to realise truth you have to practice  ahimsa and the most important thing is you have to love  all living creatures and the lowlest uh   the lowest of creation you should love as you love   yourself okay   creatures   yourself  so to see the universal and all pervading spirit of truth face to face one must be able to love the meanest of creation as oneself  so one first of all one has to identify oneself with all  living creatures and love the lowest of god's creation and a man who aspires after that and a man who  speak truth okay who speak truth cannot afford to keep out of any field of life   one word  so a man who is a seeker of truth has to be attached to any field of life in which he is involved  that is why my devotion of truth has drawn me into the field of politics and i can say without the slightest hesitation and yet in all humility that those who say that religion has nothing to do with politics do not know what religion means  okay so he says that his devotion to truth he was a seeker of truth always in life  and because he was a seeker of truth he was drawn to the field of politics  he wanted to make politics free from violence and that is why he entered politics  okay so he says politics also should be free from violence because a seeker of truth he has to follow the path of ahimsa  ahimsa   ahimsa  correct a seeker of truth has to follow the path of ahimsa    ahimsa  and so he says that is why he had enter politics   cough  identification with eveything that live is impossible  without self-purification  and he says first of all he says that you have to identify yourself with all living creatures  all creation of god god   god  you have to identify yourself amongst all creations of   god   god  and he says if you want to identify yourself with all creations of god then you have to be self- purified   self-purified  you have to be self-purified cough  without self-purification the observance of the law of  ahimsa must remain an empty dream  okay and what is this self-purification ? yes ? self-purification means purification in mind word and deed purification of mind word and deed  your thought speech and action   word and deed   speech and action  okay  so without self-purification he says you cannot follow the path of ahimsa  and if you don't follow the path of ahimsa you cannot realise truth which is god  according to gandhiji   truth   god   mahtma gandhiji  okay  god can never be realised by one who is not pure at heart so the first important thing of self-purification you have to be pure at heart good in your deed good in your  thoughts action   heart  god can never be realised by one who is not pure at heart  self-purification therefore must mean purification in all walks of life   life  and this is very important because if you are self- purified  you are good in thought speech and action   speech and action  if you are good you can make others good  okay   others good  so he says that if you are self-purified you will naturally see that your surroundings are also purified  it is also good  and purification being highly infectious purification of oneself necessarily leads to the purification of one's   surroundings   surroundings  so what does purification of oneself lead to ? come on yes uh you ? purification of oneself means purification of the surroundings of one's surroundings   surroundings  whereever he is in any walk of life he will see that  everything else is also purified is good okay   purified  but the path of self-purification is hard and steep  to attain perfect purity one has to become absolutely passion-free in thought speech and action to rise above the opposing currents of love and hatred attachment and repulsion  so he says that we are talking on self- purification but it is not very easy to be self-purified because if you want to be self-purified you should be absolutely passion-free  emotion-free in thought speech and action   passion-free   thought speech and action 
the ant and the grasshopper somerset maugham is the writer of this fable  the fable the ant and the grasshopper  is well known  it teaches the moral that one must work hard and save for the future the famous british writer somerset maugham deals with a very  conscientious and prudent elder brother and a happy go lucky younger brother in this prose  why does he refer to the fable ? what is his attitude to having moralising ? you will find the answer in this prose  when i was a very small boy i was made to learn by heart  certain of the fable of la fontaine  and the moral of this was carefully explained to me  among those i learnt was the ant and the grasshopper which is devised to bring home to the young the usefulnesses that  an im imperfect world  industry is rewarded and greedyness punished  it is the meaning of fable  my apology for telling something when everyone in politely but inexactly supposed to know the ant spends a laborious summer  gathering its winter store while the grasshopper sings on a bale of grass singing to the sun  winter comes and the ant is comfortably provided for but the grasshopper has an empty larder  he goes to the ant and begs for a little food  then the ant gives him a classic answer  what were you doing in the summer time ? saving your presence i sang all day all night  you sang why then go and dance  i don't ascribe it to perversity on my part but rather to the habit of childhood which is deficient in moral sense that i could never quite see those advantage to the lesson my sympathies were with the grasshopper and for some time i never saw an ant without putting my foot on it  in this summary and as i have discovered since entirely human fashion i sought to express my disapproval of prudence and common sense i could not help thinking of this fable when the other day i saw  george ramsay lunching by himself in a restaurant  i never saw anyone wore an expression of such deep gloom he was staring into space  he looked as though the burden of the whole world fell on his shoulders shoulders  i was sorry for him  i suspected at once that his unfortunate brother has been causing trouble again  i went up to him and held out my hand  take down the difficult words  you read out the words   haan   bb-writing begin prudent - careful happy go lucky - carefree larder - room where food is kept martin  - french man greedyness - lack of industry - hardwork greedyness - irresponsible behaviour conscientious  - honest bb-work ends noise  prudent - careful happy go lucky - carefree larder - a room where food is kept martin - traditional efficient lack of industry hardwork greedyness - irresponsible behaviour  conscientious - honest  the ant and the grasshopper it is a fable  fable means a short story which deals with the animal and it gives us a moral  so fable the ant and the grasshopper it is based on and is famous and it also teaches the moral that one must work hard  and one will should save for the future so this moral we will get from this lesson the ant and the grasshopper  it is written by the famous british writer somerset maugham  the famous british writer somerset maugham he deals with a very  conscientious and prudent elder brother and a happy go lucky younger brother in this story  so we have two brothers which is one is very careful prudent and conscientious very honest and another is very carefree happy go lucky they are the two brothers in this story  why does he refer to the fable ? what is his attitude to having moralising ? you will find the answers in it so first the writer has given the fable the story  about the ant and the grasshopper  when i was a very small boy i was made to learn by heart  certain of the fables of la fontaine is a french poet and the scholar  and the moral of this was carefully explained to me  among those i learnt was ant and the grasshopper which is devised to bring home to the young the usefulness that in an  imperfect world industry is rewarding   it's always hardwork industry means hardwork it is rewarding if you do the hardwork you will get the prize which is a reward  and greedyness is punished   greedyness irresponsible behaviour in this parable  if you do you will be punished in this world  so this is the moral of this lesson  it is a reasonable fable the ant spends the laborious summer gathering its winter store  so throughout the summer season the ant worked very hard and gathered its food for the winter season  while the grasshopper it sit sits on a bale of grass and is singing to the sun  so instead of doing the work grasshopper in vain waste the whole time in singing instead of doing the work  while the grasshopper sits on a bale of grass singing to the sun  winter comes and the ant is comfortably provided for but the grasshopper has an empty larder  larder the room where the food is kept  so the ant it has full of larder whereas the  grasshopper's is empty  he goes to the ant and begs for a little food  see what the ant says the ant says then the ant gives him a classic answer there is a traditional answer  what were you doing in the summer time ? she is not ready to give food for to  the grasshopper  then the grasshopper answers saving your presence i sang all day all night  so throughout the day and night the grasshopper  waste wastes his time in singing  you sang why then go and dance  so like this the ant gave the answer  she is not ready to give the food to the grasshopper  i don't ascribe this  so here the writer refers to the story i don't ascribe this to perversity on my part but rather to the habit of childhood which is deficient in moral sense  so this story it is lack of moral sense in his childhood  that i couldn't never first reconcile myself to the lesson  so which is moral of the lesson the author is not agreeing my sympathies were with the grasshopper and for sometime i never saw an ant without putting my foot on it  so here the writer has a big sympathy for the grasshopper  not for the ant  so this reference we'll get in the story of this reference  why the author showed the sympathy to the grasshopper ? my sympathies were with the grasshopper and for sometime i never saw an ant without putting my foot on it  in this a few words i sought to express my disapproval of prudence and common sense  so he is not agreeing about the prudence that he could not it was not being careful that is a prudence  i could not help thinking for this fable when the other day i saw george ramsay lunching by himself in a restaurant  so in this story there are two brothers one is george ramsay and another is tom ramsay  so next day the writer saw george ramsay in restaurant  i never saw anyone wear an expression of such deep gloom  so he was in very sad mood  he was staring into space or looking to the sky  he looked as if the the burden of the whole world fell on his  shoulders  i was sorry for him i suspected at once that his unfortunate brother has been causing trouble again  so he was worried about his younger brother tom ramsay  i went upto him and held out my hand  so who are the two brothers ? george ramsay and  one or two words   george ramsay  the two brothers were george ramsay and tom ramsay  how is george ramsay ? he was prudent  george ramsay was prudent  george ramsay was prudent  then how was tom ramsay ? nishan ? tom ramsay was a was carefree  look at the page and say  he was a happy go lucky  who is the author of this lesson ? the author of the lesson is somerset maugham  yes ? the author of the lesson is somerset maugham  how the ant spent its time in summer season ? the ant spent a laborious summer gathering its winter store  the the ant spent laborious summer collecting  collecting the winter food  how the grasshopper spent its time ? arun ? the grasshopper sits on a bale of grass singing  singing to the  singing to the in summer  come on tell ? the grasshopper sits on grass and that of grass singing the singing  yes  in summer the grasshopper sits on a bale of grass singing to the sun  so who is labourous here ? ant ant ant  what is the moral of the story ? shweta ? the moral of the story is that one must work hard and save for the future  read yes read it sit down cough  come on you are not copying  the fable the ant and the grasshopper is well known  it teaches the moral that one must work hard and save for the future  the famous british writer somerset maugham deals with a very  conscien conscientious and prudent elder brother and a happy go lucky younger brother in this story  why does he refer to the fable ? what is his attitude to have been moralising ? you will find the answer in this story teacher teacher  now a few words cough  when i was  when i was  when i was a very small boy i was made to learn by heart certain of the fables of la fontaine and the moral of these was carefully  explain to me  among those i among those i learnt was the ant and the grasshopper which is devised to bring home to the young and   the useful lesson that is in an imperfect world industry is rewarded and greedyness punished  it is admirable fable i apologise for telling something which everyone is politely but inexactly suppose supposed to know the ant spends a laborious summer gathering its winter store while the grasshopper sits on a bale of grass singing to the sun  winter comes and the ant is comfortably provided for but the grasshopper has an empty larder  he goes to the ant and begs for a little food then the ant gives him a classic answer teacher teacher what were you doing in the summer time ? saving saving your presence i sang all day all day  you sang why then go and dance  i don't i do not asc ascribe   it to per perversity on my part  but rather to the habit of childhood which is defecient in moral sense that i could never recon reconcile  myself to the lesson  my sympathies   sit down  jaya sit down  my sympathies were with the grasshopper and for sometime i never saw an ant without putting my foot on it  in this summary and as and as i have dis   discovered since entirely human fashion i sought to express my disapproval of prudence and common sense noise  now who you read it i could not help thinking of this of this fable when the other day i saw george george ramsay lunching by himself in a restaurant  i never saw anyone wore an express expression of  such deep gloom   gloom  he was start starting staring  into space  staring into space another student  staring into space he looked as though the burden of the whole world sat on his shoulders   noise another student i was sorry for him i was sorry for him  i  i suspected i suspected suspected at once that his un  unfortunate unfortunate brother has been causing trouble again i went teacher teacher  noise several students talk together  thank you very much 
 area and volume of a regular solid  so what is a regular solid ? a regular solid is one in which all the sides and angles are  equal   equal  can you observe here ? yes sir all sides and angles are equal yes sir  so what is the name of this figure ? what is the name of this solid ? prism prism yes this is called prism prism  now observe this face of this prism  so here this is what is it's top top  this is base base and these are height  height   base   height  the lateral faces lateral faces now see this shape of what is it is of base and its   lateral faces   lateral faces  and now the shape of shape of what is it base and lateral faces are different  shape of lateral faces and base are different   different  now compare these lateral faces only  what is the shape of the lateral faces ? rectangular rectangular rectangular faces   faces  and compare to what is it ? rectangular compare the top and the base base  what is the name of this one ? square square base isn't it ? now see the top as well as what is it the lateral faces  how these two are there ? which ? top as well as lateral lateral face  are these perpendicular to one another ?  lateral  yes sir no sir yes sir  lateral faces and the coordinator the base are  perpendicular to each other   perpendicular to each other  understood ? yes sir so such a figure or such a solid is known as what does it is ? prism  and here this figure that is prism has how many faces ? six faces six faces sir shailaja patil  here this prism is having what is it is square shaped  face therefore this is called square based prism  and let's take another prism which has three lateral faces  understood ? so here what is the shape of the lateral face ? rectangle rectangle or rectangular face and shape of the top of the top and the bases   triangular shape  triangle bases so this prism is called ?  triang   triangular based prism   triangular based prism  now we want to find what is it is surface area  do you know how to find the surface area ? or do you know how to find the area of a rectangle ? yes how do you find the area of a rectangle ? half base into height area of a rectangle length into breadth  length into breadth   length into breadth  and how do you find the area of a square ? side into side side into side side into side because all the sides are equal in  square   square  now see here how to find the surface area of what is it is prism ? in order to find what is its total surface area what we should do ? total surface area here we can find what is it is the area of rectangle rectangle  rectangle  that is of one shape  similarly you can find the area of this shape similarly you can find the area of this shape means we can find the areas of quadrilateral lateral faces  and we can also find what is it is areas of top as well as   base   base  so total surface area means what ? total surface area ? now we can calculate the what is it surface area of what is it each face  but to uhm find the what is total surface area ? it means what we have to do ? we have to find the we have to find the sum of the what is it is areas of all these faces  so total surface area include the area of what is it is the lateral faces as well as the area of what is it top and base   base  now here we have the what is it is model  model of the prism  understood ? can you prepare a model of this type ? yes sir so you can cut out the shape of a prism in cardboard  now here see you have what is it is prism and you have prepared what is it model and open it up  when you open it up what happens ? you will get what is it is figure of this prism  yes sir  do you get the figure of this kind or not ? yes sir  suppose here the length of the what is it is  prism the length of the what is it is prism  rectangle rectangle taking the rectangle  length of the rectangle is eight centimetres and its breadth is a centimetres   a centimetres  now here do you see that part ? do you find that it is a big rectangle ? they are not the same  and here what are these ? square  yes what are these actually ?  top and the base   top   base  right  so it means we want to find what is the total surface area of the prism  to find the total surface area of the prism what we have to do ? we have to find and we have to add the surface areas of these lateral fa faces plus what is it ? the base is the area of the top and the base   base  right  so total bb writing surface area area of prism is equal to what is it is area of top and base plus area of  and base  rectangle  area of lateral faces  four rectangles four rectangles four rectangle yes sir  so area of top and bases these two have the shape of a square  therefore what you can write here ? area of base into two because these two have what is it is same area  these two squares have same area  plus what is it is area of four rectangle  now compare here all the rectangles have same height  yes sir  that is same length and they have same breadth that is a centimetre  understood ? so area of four rectangles what you can write four into  area of a rectangle  area of a rectangle   rectangle  now how do you find the area of a rectangle here ? and how do you find the area of a square ? just find out this one  so what is the formula to find the area of a square ? side into side side into side   side  so here area of base these are base but the bases have the what is it shape of what is it square therefore what is the formula here ? side into side what is the side of the square ? a a a a square  a therefore area of base into two is equal to what you can write two into a square   two into a square  plus four   two  sir four four  now find the area of a rectangle how do you find the area of a rectangle ? we require length and breadth   breadth  so what is the length of the rectangle here ? h h centimetres and breadth of the a  so it is length into what is it is breadth breadth  understood ? now here two into a square plus four into a  four into a   a  four into a means what it gives us ? four a square  four into a four a's are here a plus a  plus a plus a means what is it ? four a square what is it ? a length yes what is the length of this side a a this is a this is a this is a  a   a  you are adding a four times   four times  it means what it gives you ? four a four uh four a  breadth of four triangles  length of  breadth of four triangles  not breadth man sit down  that is called as perimetre  this is the perimetre uhm  perimetre means what ? sum of the sides  sum of the sides do you know that ? yes sir so here we can do what is it sum of the sides of this  base base so four a means what is it is two a square plus four a  into what is it base base  so two a square means what is it two into area of the base bb writing base plus plus four perimetre  plus four  perimetre of the base into height bb close  height  height of what is it ? prism height of the prism  it is as well as height of the rectangle   rectangle  height of the prism  so will you solve an example now ? yes sir  so let's see the model example that is given here  find the total surface area of a prism with square base  in which the side of the square base is four centimetres and height  six centimetres  so what is given in this problem i shall write here just here  blackboard work  find the total surface area surface area of a prism  prism with a square base with a square base in which the side of the square is four centimetres and height six centimetres bb work end  yes what is given in the problem ? side and height side of the what is it is square base and height of the  prism is given  then what we have to find here ? total surface total surface area  now here we've derived what is formula to calculate what is it is total surface area of the prism   prism  so what is the formula to calculate the total surface area of the prism ? two into area of the base plus perimetre of the base simple  into area of the base plus perimetre of the base  height into height plus base  so substitute these values in your what does it is  formula  so total surface area bb work begin total surface area is equal to bb work end what is given ? two area of square area of the base   base  how do you calculate area of the base ? four into four  has he given the side of the base ? yes sir yes here  what is the length of this one ? four centimetres if this is four can you calculate the area of this base ? yes sir how do you calculate it ? side into side   bb work begin  area of the base is equal to what is it is  four into four that is equal to sixteen  what is it square centimetres square  centimetres bb work end   base   four into four   sixteen   square centimetres   centimetres  so here two into area of the base what is the area of the base ? sixteen square centimetres  bb work begins  square centimetres bb work end plus  perimetre of the base  so how do you find perimetre ?  centimetres  that is nothing but what is it sum of the sides  so here how do you find the perimetre ? sum of the sides of what is it is base  so what is the length of this base ?  four centimetres   four centimetres  four plus four plus four plus four   plus four plus four  sixteen so here we can calculate and what is it is all the sides or you can also multiply the side of the square by four so what is the length of the side here ? four a four  what is the length of the ? four four four centimetres  bb work begins  so four into four   four  and what is the height of the prism ? three three height of the prism is three six centimetres  three  now solve this one  here two into sixteen centimetres  sixteen noise  thirty-two square centimetres   square centimetres  square centimetres plus sixty here   twenty-two four into four sixteen plus six   twenty-two thirty-two plus what is it is ?  sixty   twenty-two   sixteen   twenty-two  twenty-two  twenty-two so fifty-four  fifty four square centimetres   four square centimetres 
begin the chapter the indian constitution  in that we will be seeing the salient features of the indian constitution  uh we know that india was not free  nineteen forty-seven august fifteen india became free  but along with freedom we needed some framework of laws  laws and bye-laws for a better government  the british had laws but they were laws more favourable to them  so therefore we needed to make laws that are favourable to us therefore we will see the chapter the indian constitution cough  when we talk about the indian constitution we are talking about the ideals of the freedom-fighters  the ideals of the people the ideals of the people around the world  that is why we are going to see in this chapter what are the ideals ? or what are the ideas upon which our laws or our bye-laws or our constitution is based ? therefore we will consider the salient features of the indian constitution  in nineteen forty-seven nineteen forty-six we had the  constituent assembly or a group of people who would be studying the various constitutions of the world and then formulating a constitution  based on the study of the various constitutions of the world our own constitution  the constituent assembly was the large body it was not possible that uh all people would take part uh in the actual work of framing the constitution therefore a smaller body was formed a smaller body was taken  known as the drafting committee  the drafting committee had a specific task  the drafting committee had a specific task number one of studying the constitutions of the world and number two of forming or creating a draft of our constitution  what we mean by a draft is not necessary that it is the final product no  it could have changed  therefore they made a a draft so that we could study the constituent assembly could study the draft and then if they required they would make the necessary changes before the final constitution could be made the chairman of the drafting committee was dr b r ambedkar  and it had a various members on it  dr b r ambedkar was chosen because of many aspects  he was uh good at law  he had studied abroad uh he was an individual who was  interested in uh the upliftment of the poor  he was an individual who was involved in the reform uh in the movement the national movement  and therefore he was chosen as the uh the chairman for the drafting committee whose main work was to prepare the draft studying the various constitutions of the world  therefore the drafting committee collected the work of drafting the constitution and placing it before the constituent assembly  the constituent assembly published the constitution the draft of the constitution throughout india  all the members of the constituent assembly studied the draft  all the members of the drafting committees studied the draft  all the eminent people in india  all the teachers and those who were really interested in the real ideals and the future of the country studied the draft  and there was a provision that any individual who thought fit  that a certain change must be brought about in the draft wrote to the constituent assembly  they made their remarks  they said something in favour and somethings against a particular clause of the draft  therefore with this process of bringing out a change for the better finally the constituent assembly took into consideration all these suggestions and made the constitution of india  the constitution of india was formulated  the constitution of india was applied  the constitution of india is in use  but many a times we don't realize its important we don't realize its salient features in our  in other words important essential features of the constitution and therefore we don't realize its importance  we know it is there but if we do not know what is in there ? cough  so we'll consider some of the salient features of the indian constitution constitution  the first thing that we will consider is the preamble  preamble is the most important part of the indian constitution  we could consider it as a a a magnacarta of the  india indian constitution we could consider it as an important introduction   we will we could consider it as an important uh core of the constitution  why because in the preamble lies the important principles for which india uh is known for  for which the constitution was made  for which the people of india fought for which we live  therefore the preamble is very very important  now we will see what is there in the preamble for us to jot down  note offered to observe or study  number one  the main thing that is stressed in the preamble is the soverrignty of the people in the world we we the people of india  we the people of india formulate the constitution  we the people of india make and adopt the constitution  we the people of india have these ideas uh in our constitution therefore it is not i previously we had monarchy a king would have his own constitution at his uh whims and fancies  he would have a constitution and based on that the country would be ruled but sometimes even they wouldn't follow what was said  they would change constitution would change  the people would change  and therefore it was i i the king or i the queen declares such and such a thing there was nothing uh any more like that to be therefore we the people we declared to ourselves we adopt the constitution we have these ideals for ourselves  that is why the power of the people is very much imposed in we  and that's a very important aspect  never before in india was such a principle stipulated that is the basis of democracy  we that's basis of uh our functioning now  it was not there before but it happened when we became free therefore the sovereignty of the people was established or made clear in the preamble  the second point that we see are the different principles that are enshrined uh in the uh preamble  enshrined in other words mentioned in the preamble stipulated in the preamble uh put forth in the preamble and those principles are sovereign cough socialist  secular democratic republic  india to be india to be a sovereign socialist secular democratic republic  now we will see what every word means  so that we will have a better understanding of uh the preamble and also of these basic principles which are there in the preamble  sovereign when we talk of the word sovereign we know that prior to independence india was not sovereign  in other words india was not free  in other words someone else was ruling on our territory  in other words the pre people  were the subject and the rulers were someone else  also another aspect of this was that the people were not having their own government  there was one monarchy  so all that was there prior to independence was different  therefore india was declared to be sovereign indicating that  india is free indicating that no other country has any power over india indicating that india is free to make its own laws and its own constitution  that is why that word sovereign  sovereign means all powerful all powerful  so it very plainly lays down the principle of india being free  india being independent and that was very essential for us that is why the people or the freedom fighters fought for they wanted to be free  they were not going to be satisfied with anything short of  sovereignty therefore the first principle of being sovereign  when we talk of the word socialist or socialism there was socialism in the world uh when india was striving for freedom  socialism in russia socialism in china and other parts of the world  socialism was uh stipulating or bringing out the idea that all people are equal and therefore the property the land and the wealth of the country must be divided equally  in that everything belongs to the state and nothing belongs to an individual  therefore socialism because of india's specific condition because of the condition of the masses which was very pathetic in those days  therefore socialism was liken by the people of india and therefore it was framed  but the socialism that we adopted was not that of russia or china or not that kind where everything was owned by the nation  where everything was nationalized  nothing was private  it was of that kind of socialism that we adopted  the the peculiar brand of socialism that we adopted the peculiar kind of socialism that we had was mixed economy  mixed economy means that part of the economic activity in india  would be nationalized and part of the economic activity in india would be private  therefore all those important industries which are of national benefit are nationalized  banks are nationalized mines are nationalized  all wealth of nations  therefore those railways are natioanlized they are the wealth  they are for the importance of all the people  they are for the need of all the people therefore those uh industries or that part of the economy which is required by all is nationalized  and that part which uh remains in the hands of the private people there are some industries which belong to the private people so therefore we have a mixed eco economy   nationalised economy and private economy so our kind of socialism is not that which is likened to the socialism in russia or in china  secular is the next next uh ideal that we have chosen  secular or secularism we might wonder what it is  there are a few countries in the world which have a state religion specially in the middle-east there is the state religion but there are other countries who follow democracy which do not have a state religion  india was also a country which acquired independence in nineteen forty-seven where there were important major religions in india  jainism buddhism hinduism sikhism christianity and so on and so forth  now in a situation like this the leaders were confronted with a dilemma or problem where they didn't know what to decide or which religion should get importance though there was a hindu majority  there was a muslim minority there was a christian minority  therefore importance could not be given on the basis of religion  so they opted for a secular state indicating that india will not propogate any state religion that india is secular state  that india will not be biased to favour one religion and not favour the other therefore all religions are equal in the eyes of the state  no religion is more important than the other  does not matter whether it has the majority or a minority of followers  therefore this ideal of secularism was very favourable so that all could survive within india  so that all would peacefully live as they have been doing for centuries  the hindus and the muslims the hindus muslims and the christians these hindus muslims christians jains and the buddhists had been surviving for the centuries together and therefore it was thought that they would continue to stay in a secular state together as they had been doing before  the next ideal that we have is democratic republic  democracy as defined by abraham lincoln it's  a form of government where the power lies with the people   it's a form of govrnment which is of the people by the people and for the people   a very a very uh a very ideal thought  a very ideal uh type of government  therefore whatever is done the people are responsible whatever is decided the people are responsible because it is for the benefit of the people  and the functioning of that gevernment will also be by the people  uh with the method of election  so a very ideal pattern that was choosen for india was democracy socialism was there a very a very a very uh likeable ideal because there was a a difference of rich and poor in india if socialism uh if socialism was adopted in india as it was in russia or china perhaps the country country could have been made economically different  but in other matters it would have been different therefore they chose democratic republic  we were free and we will rule the country that is why we the people the sovereignty of the people  republic in that we had our own constitution  we did not mean the uh the constitution of another country to rule us  but we formulated our own constitution therefore it was a democratic republic  therefore it's a very balanced view that of the constitution that we get in the preamble we the people rule the country and those principles which will make india a strong state is sovereign secular socialist  democratic republic 
okay today we are going to do the topic cell specialisation that is how cells are specialised to form tissues  so far we have learnt all about mi uh unicellular organisms  okay how a single plant looks plant cell looks   like ? how a single animal cell looks like ? what all it contains ? what are the organisms within a cell ? also now we have to study how many cells are arranged together or when they are grouped together what do they form ? what is the form of cell organization ? please raise your hands  a collection of cells  forms ? tissues tissues  so this is what we are going to study a collection of cells  forms a particular tissue and why are the cells organized together to form the tissues ?  it's because they have to carry out a specific function  so far you have seen that one single cell carry carries out all the activity  now when a group of cells get get together they will carry out  the same activity but at a larger level at the more quicker rate of doing it  one cell and ten cells doing the work  it is just like one person doing one work and ten persons doing the same amount of work  which will get over faster ?  ten persons   ten persons doing the amount of work so the specialisation of cell to form a tissue is to carry out a work and this is mainly found up in higher animals and plants  now the definition of the tissue is a group of cells  specialised for a particular function  okay a group of cells specialised for a particular function to perform may be absorption of water in the plants or to perform uh energy uh energy production  okay that is work in plants and animals  or like chlorophyll production in plants or the enzyme production in animals  so for a typical function in the cells are grouped together a set of cells are known as tissues  today we are going to study about the types of, plant tissues as well as animal tissues  the plants and animals are totally different from each other both of them are basically living organisms  but what is that one one feature which distinguishes plants and animals ? plants prepare their own food  and animals do not prepare their own food ? they take it from others from the plants what is it present in the plant cell ? chlorophyll  the presence of chlorophyll what is chlorophyll ? green colour  green colouring matter green colouring matter  what does this green colouring matter do ? what ability does it have ? yes ? it gives the green colour to plant no  it is brown  no yes uh anybody ? it absorbs the heat of the sun it is the only substance from which the plant which has the ability to absorb the sun's rays  do you understand any animals which can absorb the sun's  light and prepare their own energy ? no no so the green chlorophyll that is uh the green colouring matter the green pigment within the cell of a plant has the ability to absorb out the sun's rays and convert it uh use it for the preparation of starch that is the basic food material of plant  now what are the plant tissues ? plant tissues are of two types one is  meristematic tissue and the second is permanent tissue   meristematic tissue and the second is permanent tissue   for example ? and the second is ? permanent tissues  now meristematic tissues are usually found at the tip where tips of the plants where active growth is taking place  like the tip of the root the tip of the shoot that is when leaves are being produced or the bud that the bud is going to give rise to a plant or the lateral graticules which you are going to give direct to the animal plant cell and leaves etcetra or the auxillary bud  what does the auxillary bud forms ? uh auxillary bud is the thing which will give rise to leaves etcetra  now meristematic tissues are uh those cells which are found at the tips of actively growing parts of the plant  these cells are polygonal in shape and it has a centrally  placed large nucleus a very dense cytoplasm and they do not have any vacuoles in them no air pins are present and there are no intercellular spaces within these meristematic tissues okay and these tissues are contrary devices they form in larger size and give rise to a new set of cell  and the main function is to form new tissues for the plants  then you have the second set of plant uh the second set of tissues sorry and that is the permanent tissues   permanent tissues  now in the permanent tissues you have again two types as simple permanent simple permanent and  complex tissues   complex tissues  okay  the simple permanent tissues are they are not uh very complex in their structure and also their functions are not very high that is they do not have to perform extremly vital functions for the plant  vital means those functions which are vital for the life of the plant so the uh to see that the plant keeps alive  okay  these types of tissues will perform certain functions and the vital functions are the permanent permanent tissues and the simple tissues the simple form of permanent tissues are the one which form a support adding support for the plant or which forms the main structure of the stem or the root or the leaves  and it provides support mechanical support to the plant and to some extent they also help in preparing food for the plant  okay you have learnt about plastid in our previous chapter  then we have learnt plastid as the starch  one is the   chlor chloroplast  please raise your hands  girls durga ? chloroplast yes  chloroplast chrmoplast and one word   chloroplast chrmoplast and one word  now chloroplast is the one that absorbs the sunlight  chromoplast gives colour colour to the plant other than these and it use of flower is very important one with starch present in the flower   colour  so the simple permanent tissues some of them i mean the leaf or flower and as well found in the preparation of starch one word the preparing of the one word now suppose if you put simple permanent tissues in the two words  there is no simple permanent tissues when the name of five a few words and these which help out in the preparation of starch okay now which are the type of simple permanent tissues we have to see  the first one is parenchyma the second is  collenchyma collenchyma and the third and the third is  sclerenchyma   collenchyma   and the third is   sclernchyma  we are learning what is it ?  noise  okay now out of these simple permanent tissues  the most simple structure is of a parenchyma cell these are usually green in colour they are spherical  root in cell there are lot of intercellular spaces in between them  they have a large nucleus and many vacuoles around along the thin cyctoplasm plus the other cell uh cellular orgnelles are present  and they are filled with a number of plastids  these plastids help in the preparation of food  the parenchyma cells that is revived they are circular in shape loosely spaced having a lot of inter-cellular spaces  the cell walls are thin and they have a large nucleus which push to one side by the secondary based vacoule plus the plastids are present in large number in the case of parenchyma cells  plastids are not are present in the leaves and the  cells and if you have to release the very green in colour in the presence of the green colour plant  then we have a second okay the function of the parenchyma is preparation of food  the second type of cells are the collenchyma cells  these have got a very definite structure and they provide mechanical strength to the whole plant  there is a charact characteristic  thing about the collenchyma is that they are a firm thickening at the corners of the four corners of the cell  this is one of the characteristic features of the collenchyma cells that is the cell corners show thickening of a specific substance the thickening is made up of cellulose plus pectine  okay  these are substances which are found uh mainly in plant uh plant bodies rather than animal cells  do you know that the cell wall in in plant is made up of cellulose which you studied in your lower classes  okay but uh collenchyma cells are made up of uh additional substance called pectine which gives it more strength or which makes it more tougher than the normal other cells  even though parenchyma cells contain cellulose in their cell walls yet uh which gives it a definite shape around the around the structure  but uh collenchyma cells are i told you they provide mechanical support to the plants and for this sake they have to contain a certain hard structure in their cell body  and this is made by a combination of cellulose plus pectine and this is fo found in the presence of in the form of cell thickenings at the corners of the cell  also then the rest of the structures are there like the vacuole or  nucleus the other chloroplasts and the cytoplasm  so remember collenchyma provide mechanical support to the plant body  they are mostly present in the outer layers of a structure like  the periphery of the leaf uh of the cross section of the leaf or  the borders of the stem  okay the outer walls of the stem to give that thickness to the stem or the outer walls of the root are all made up of collenchyma cells and it gives that stiffness to the plant  do you understand ? now the last type of permanent permanent tissues uh sorry simple permanent tissues is the sclerenchyma cells  these are single shaped cells and as it is growing or as it is maturing what happens is the central part of the cell  starts moving in cytoplasm  and in fact the part gets tougher after sometime and it it becomes very hard and tough  and the collection of sclerenchyma forms uh structure called as one word  what do they form ?  one word   one word  okay this is the one word formed in the sclerenchyma cells start moving and start moving moving out in the inner part of the cytoplasm and what what is important is that the sclerenchyma  gives out the important fibres that we obtain today in the form of jute and uh from the jute plant and the hemp plant okay  so these fibres which we use for making sack or for making even now a days uh jute cloth is attaining a lot of importance  all these can be obtained from our sclerenchyma fibres which on maturing have got certain stone cells or one word and these stone cells give a toughness to the cell and they end up  becoming the fibres of the plant  thus the sclerenchyma cells are found in large numbers in certain type of plants like the coconut  the coconut palm then you have your jute uh tree or your hemp etcetra where fibres are obtained from these plants i shall tell you about these again we use for variety of uh  provisions like making of rope of choirs or even matresses coir matresses or then the latest is jute cloth  so this completes our uh one topic that is simple permanent tissues  these tissues have not uh have not totally lost their ability to divide that is if we want we can bunch their form they can still undergo cellular division and form new set of cells this is what distinguishes simple permanent tissues from complex permanent tissues they have not totally lost their ability to divide that means  when the cell is formed it grows in size but also it has a necessity  it can also divide and form another set of cells  what we have learnt is that only meristematic cells are capable of function cell doesn't it ? but in certain cases usually simple permanent cells can undergo  uh cell division if the need arises though not always  then you have a large size of cell plant cells and that is the complex permanent tissues  these are the most important tissues of the plant because they perform the very vital functions like conducting of water and conducting of food materials  this cell the complex uh permanent tissue which  conduct water are known as your xylem cells   xylem cells  and the permanent permanent tissues which conduct food materials are known as your phloem cells   phloem cells  these are found in the innermost regions of the plant or  of the plant structure like the stem the root or the leaf of the tree  the inner most structure of these is form of these root structure the xylem and the phloem  why are they called as complex permanent tissues is because  the word complex is a very key word  if these cells once they are formed once a particular cell is formed it loses its ability to divide it can not divide again and form another xylem cell  it remains by itself and it goes on performing its function and after a period of time when it has finished its uh life life cycle life period it might die off then a new xylem cell might come in its place  but this cell on its own will not give rise to a new set of cells now both these uh cells that is xylem and phloem are found in the form of tube towards the whole length of the stem or the whole length of the root or the whole length of the leaf  they are perfectly arranged in such a way to form a tubular structure or tube like structure so that conduction of the material becomes much easier but even may be in the form of water based minerals or it might be food materials in the case of phloem  okay xylem conduct water through out the plant body  and phloem conduct waste food material towards the plant body  now if you want to see the individual structure of xylem and phloem  the xylem has got you have two sets of cells again in the xylem and they are called as tracheids and vessels  okay so you have xylem tracheae and xylem vessels and both these are found in association with each other you will never find only a xylem tracheae or you will never find only a xylem vessel  and in the phloem you have two types of cells you have  sieve and companion cells  and one characteristic feature of the phloem cells is that at the top walls okay the top walls are not continous but they have got fine pores in them to form a mess like structure or matting like structure in between the two top walls the top wall structure in between two cell  and this fine mess like structure acts as a sieving place for all the materials food materials that passes along the wall  so only a certain type of food material can pass pass through the phloem tubes having a definite size  all the larger materials will not pass through the sieve  the food material can be easily accumulated by the rest uh  the leaf of the plant through the one word of plant 
what is the difference between h and h two ? difference between h and h two ? raise your hands if you know   name of student  no he was sitting in the ninth standard  okay  what is the difference between h and h two ? nobody ? one is uh  yes yes h is the one atom of hydrogen and h two is the one molecule of hydrogen yes that is this particular h stands for the atomic symbol of hydrogen while h two is the formula or molecular formula of  hygrogen noise  what is it h stands for ?  atomic symbol while h two stands for  the molecular formula   atomic symbol   the molecular formula  okay what is the relative atomic mass of hydrogen ? relative atomic mass raise your hand one point zero zero eight one point zero zero eight   eight  okay isotopes of hydrogen ? isotopes of hydrogen ? no ? rahul ? molecules of hydrogen stand up and say  molecules noise of horn  kiran ?  a few words   a few words  now when you put that one word one and one what does this means ? which isotope is this indicate ?  noise  what does this particular symbol indicate or this representation indicate ? yes savita ? it is uh it is ? the one word   noise  so what will one h one stand for ?  procium   procium okay now tell why do you guess or first tell me what is this subscript stand for and the superscript stand for ? noise  subscript stands for ? atomic number atomic number  nupur subscript stand for what ? mass number mass number mass number atomic number atomic number so okay what does this particular subscript stand for ? mass number mass number  why are they written mass numbers here ? or what will show the formula one or two words   because there is a difference there are different numbers of neutrons  because there is difference in the number of  neutrons   neutrons  and neutrons or mass number means ? noise  mass number means ? number of protons number of  protons  number of protons plus number of neutrons   neutrons  present in the the nucleus of an atom  the nucleus of an atom   the nucleus of an atom  all right okay then next we go to about the occurance of hydrogen  hydrogen can occur in in which two states ? hydrogen can occur in which two states ? jivan ? we get the atom in the free state give the example where where it is occuring in the free state in sun in ? sun  sun and ? noise and ? atmosphere atmosphere of  earth earth and  sun  sun okay rakesh in the other state give me the examples ? rocks and minerals  in the rocks and minerals see so hydrogen occurs in two different states in the free state and in the combined state in the free state it is specially present in the atomsphere of the sun and in the other stars of the universe and in the combined state it can be present in the rocks and minerals and what else ? tissues  tissues of ? animals and plants okay next is about the preparation of hydrogen  now you can prepare hydrogen by two words  noise  there are some general methods of preparation of hydrogen isn't it  ? give me some names you can prepar  prepare hydrogen from ? sejal cold water from cold water okay  then ? boiling water boiling water and ? alkali noise  alkali  alkali any more ? any more ?  that's all  teacher in water gas from that is found after the industrial or the commercial production   industrial or the commercial production  these all are mentioned here are the general methods of  preparation while these what you mention now were for gas  this industrial process of preparation of hydrogen okay sit down now give me one example for preparation of hydrogen from cold water ? yes sachin ? potassium calcium  what are they ? what are they ?  potassium calcium   active metals  they are ? active metals active metals how do you know they are active metals ? sameer ? they react violently  they react violently so ? they are active metals they react with uh cold water and produce uh  okay they react i know but how do you come to know they are  active metals ? yes sheetal ? from the activity series of metals from the activity series of metals  they are present at the sit down they are present at the  ? top  top of the ? series so those metals which are at the top of series in the active series are called as the active metals so active metals like potassium sodium and calcium react with  cold water to produce hydrogen   hydrogen  okay now explain the process of reaction of potassium with cold water ? replacement one word  how does potassium react with cold water ?  noise  how does potassium react ? student name  how does potassium react with cold water ? when potassium ash is added to cold water what happens ? ajit ? no do not know how they react ? do you know the equation ? do you know the equation or no ? the reactions ? no potassium with water will give you what ?  one word  you are preparing what is that ? what are you preparing ? hydrogen so one product is going to be ? hydrogen  k o  teacher  three uh okay so we were discussing about potassium  reacting with water  potassium  one product isotope will be hydrogen hydrogen  hydrogen  so what will be the other product ? k o h k o h that is what ? potassium potassium hydroxide potassium hydroxide   hydroxide  now tell me the process completely in detail  that is the whole process which you wrote in an eq  equation involved in it  yes hemant ? it is not used i want the process it is not used i know  but if you add it to water it will show some reaction the the reaction will be violent and and and  endo endothermic  endothermic ? it is an endothermic noise  what is the difference between endothermic and exothermic  ? what is the difference between endothermic and exothermic ? teacher teacher teacher  come on come on hurry up  in the endothermic it is revolved and in exothermic it is evolved no noise  anybody else ? exothermic is reactions in which heat is evolved  exothermic alright that was right what about endothermic ? no heat is evolved ? heat is heat is absorbed  do you follow or no ? so when potassium reacts with water what happens ? it reacts violently and it is an exothermic reaction what else any other point left ? any other point left ? what happens to the heat that is evolved ? ignites  it ignites the hydrogen gas yes it ignites the hydrogen gas that is formed  next is what happens with sodium ? how does cold water react with sodium metal ? tanuja ? noise  hurry up  reaction with sodium is evolved uh with more thing is  and it reacts with one word and sod   sodiumness forming slowly reacts with the  probably revolved above the water ah and when it revolves in water what happens ? it noise  to obtain the noise  i am not asking that when it is revolving in water what happens ? why is it revolving in water ? because its  reacting with water to give you hydrogen  hydrogen gas and   hydrogen   a few words  in sodium hydroxide noise  the active metals like potassium sodium calcium react  one product is hydrogen because you are using it to prepare hydrogen only and the other is always the product found in hydroxide  if it is potassium it will be potassium hydroxide if it is sodium it will be sodium hydroxide if it is uh calcium it will be  calcium hydroxide  alright sit down now if you want to obtain a steady flow of hydrogen gas  from while preparing it from sodium metal what do you have to do to obtain a steady flow from the gas ? of the gas ? kiran ? sodium metal is amalgamated  is amalgamated means what is it done ? amalgamated what is the meaning of the term amalgamated ? thats one word  no that is the different term totally noise what does it do or what do you understand by amalgam or amalgamated ? its an alloy miss an alloy of metal with mercury yes it is an alloy of a metal with mercury so you have to amalgamate sodium with mercury and what else do what else do you have to do ? that is the only thing you have to do teacher to obtain the steady flow of the gas  savita ?  teacher  wrap it in a wire box  wrap it in a wire box okay so you what will happen then you will get a steady flow of the hydrogen gas that is evolved  then next we go to calcium  how does water reacts with calcium ? i already gave you the answer before itself  how does calcium react with water ? if you have listened to me carefully you will know what it is   one word  the first thing we said about potassium  we said what ? the reaction is one word violent  rigorous and exotherm   one word  after that we place sodium because it is less vigorous than  potassium okay and thirdly now we have to come at calcium  so now it will be ? hydrogen potassium and sodium draw back to both sodium and potassium   potassium  alright now what is it left ? or why cannot we use calcium in ?  noise  why cannot we use calcium  why can't we use calcium in the production of hydrogen ? hydrogen  why cannot we use calcium in the production of hydrogen ? minaz  because it is an expensive method because it is an expensive method   method  okay now how do we collect the hydrogen that is formed in all these above cases ? by downward method how do we collect the hydrogen gas that is formed ? rakesh ? by downward downward displacement of by downward displacement of water  aftab tell me why do you have to collect it by downward displacement of water only ?  a few words  why do we collect with by downward displacement of water  what is the reason ? because it is slightly soluble in water slightly soluble in slightly soluble in a slightly soluble in water slightly soluble in water and what else ? what is the other reasons ? and lighter than air  and lighter than air   air  so you collect it by the downward displacement of  water   water  then next is about preparation of hydrogen from boiling water which metals react with boiling water to give you hydrogen ?  noise  amit which metals react with boiling water to give you hydrogen ?  a few words  no it's not so magnesium magnesium only magnesium zinc  iron iron  zinc and there is one more metal  iron  iron  iron okay  so magnesium reacts with ?  one word  so these magnesium zinc and iron are ? less active metals less active metals than potassium sodium and calcium  they react with water now a bit differently than  what uh than how the sodium potossium and calcium were reacting what is the difference ? none ? the intention is to prepare hydrogen only or to be burnt hydrogen when the reactor is boiling water  but what is the difference between the other two process the other one word  are you following the question or no ? no both these metal or all these metals these three metals  the active metals potassium calcium and sodium are reacting with water to give you hydrogen and something else what is that ? the hydroxide of those metals right here these metals magnesium zinc and iron which are less active than potassiun sodium and calcium are reacting with water to give you hydrogen but they are giving you some other product what is that ?
well we will be discussing today the lesson that i have already started do you know the lesson that i am going to discuss to  today  malefactor malefactor malefactor that's right that's right and i do hope that by now all of you might have read the lesson  and understood the contents of it too  right ? the first question that we are going to raise today for discussion  is that do you justify the title of the story ? do you justify the title of the story ? i mean you ? would you ?  what's your opinion ? sir the chapter raise the sir denis is not not   actually actually a criminal criminal but uh like  he uh does the he does uh he opens the screw unknowingly right he doesn't know that it is really a crime  actually he does it unknowingly  so what you mean that he is not a criminal one ? no he isn't right  yes please what do you have to say ? that the title malefactor doesn'tjustify the uh  doesn't justify on denis because he is not a criminal and he doesn't uh commit the act knowingly he just uh does it unknowingly and tells the judge also that he had done and doesn't hide anything like a a professional criminal okay if we turn the pages of our text we will find that he knows he does know that unscrewing of the nuts may lead to the rail accident  if you see the line you will find he confesses that  we know that it may lead to the train accident that's why we don't unscrew all the nuts we unscrew only few  sir he doesn't say that we know that accident will occur as a result so he says that we know that the nut holds the railway track right sir he says that nuts cannot cause an accident no not that one but he does he does know that if we unscrew all the nuts  it may lead to train accident causing the loss of life and property  he does know  what are the other clues by that you can justify the title ? you can't say that here whether he is a criminal or not  noise  sir first thing he said that he was a very poor man yes it was when that he said you can't find lead or nail  uh uh on the street or you have to buy that ah so he was  a very poor man so he drills hole into pluck out nut from the track  ah  right  perhaps you would mean to say that while judging him as a criminal we must see his situation too  the circumstances he is pressed by  we find that he is such a poor man that he is not in a position to buy the other thing to use as sinker as he is pleading again and again that i do it i did unscrew the nuts only to  use them as sinkers  perhaps his financial condition is not so that he may buy the  other thing or substitute of the nut  isn't so ? anything else that you have to say ? yes ? noise  anything ? you wanted to tell something ? no  then what else you have to say ? is there any other clue whereby you can prove that he is not a criminal ? the one thing that you have clarified is that it is the  demand of the circumstances or he is pressed by the circumstances that's  why he unscrewed the nuts anything else ? the criminal was not an educated  he is not an educated one educated man and even he doesn't know anything about the  track anything that it can cause accident by plucking out of the lines right  may be accepted  sir lot of whole society are unscrewing the nut but  but an individual cannot be termed say that he has unscrewed the nut  so rules of the society is also there  so  right whole society means the gentry  there is not only the denis alone  when but other people of the community are also doing the same thing  sir he doesn't hide the name of anyone but he tells two or three names more to the judge right this shows that he was not a criminal  but one thing is there suppose if the majority of the people are doing the same thing you how can you say that  it's not a crime ? can you ? if majority of the people do the same work does it means uh file any logic or thereby can you say that yes it is not a crime because the large number of people are doing so  so how can we accept this one that because not only denis but other fellows are also doing  other members of the community are also doing that's why  it's not a very serious crime  it is a  sir it is a crime  it is a ? crime  if it is a crime then you might be justifying the punishment too given to him yes sir  denis does qualify as a criminal with one more reason because  the law says that if the committer does the crime knowingly and so he did it do it knowingly  right it was stated in the law panel code one zero eight  means the gravity of the punishment should also take care of whether something is done knowingly  what is the intention of the person doing a particular offence  committing a crime intention of the mind should also be uh taken care of  so was there any intention like that one ? no  was there any bad intention ? no sir no  so we can say if there was no any bad intention like rail accident or other things like then he must not be given that much severe punishment  he should not be levelled as a criminal  why ? because he did it without knowing  so if we sum up the things we can say first of all that it is the circumstances it is his financial condition that made him to do commit the crime  second thing is that his intention is not bad he is doing it unknowingly  there is no any bad intention of causing the rail accident  causing the loss of life and property no intention anything else ? on the ground of that you can say that he doesn't deserve that much severe punishment noise  is there any more points ? can you recollect ? yes can you recollect ? noise  can you ? no  no  anybody else in the class who has any more points  thereby who can say that the title of the story malefactor is not appropriate one ? yes ? the society around him made the circumstances that they made him to do that  but the role and role and of the society  that is the ? the whole world of the crime world the they  depend on society around us  how the society is responsible ? because he says that they the wise men and the uh men of the village do the same work  right  it means that from the childhood he is made to do the same thing  now that we have already taken that is more number of the people do the same thing that is an offence we cannot say that it is not an offence  sit down please sit down  yes anything else ? noise  so in your view the title of the story is not appropriate one  ? no sir can you think of can you substitute any other appropriate title to the story ? if this one is not appropriate can we give any appropriate title to the story ? can you think of any new title to the story ? sir poverty is great crime  poverty create crime  poverty ? create crime  poverty creates crime and why only poverty ignorance is also with that or both are coincided very often ? sir sir innocent criminal  innocent criminal  then the title suggested is suggested one is innocent criminal  what is your re reaction to it ? sir criminal criminal cannot be called innocent no  the criminal cannot be called called  innocent then he is a criminal sir but sir he is a  then  sir but sir he is innocent  sir he is little bit innocent  yes sit down  okay that a criminal cannot be but you know that one of the merit of the title is to create interest in the story too  if it is an innocent criminal then perhaps you will be interested to learn that how an innocent man became a criminal  it may create some interest too  can you think of similar title ? on the same line can you find any better one ? okay if not according to you what type of punishment does he deserve ? noises  in case   a few words  in case he is not a criminal one but he has done something wrong you know  knowingly unknowingly whatever is there but he has done something wrong and he has been caught red handed too  what type of punishment would you like to accord to him ? yes ? he has to reveal the plan causing the liability that  that they are but not the individual particular in society to be taught as has given me a one word to seek a as if they had deliberately done then a few words noise   then  then one thing perhaps you want to say that we will take this one as a feedback and educate the society tell the people that this is something very wrong they must not do  he must be instructed like that one and should be released or any other punishment ? he should be  yes please ? he should be let off with a warning or at the most he should be imprison for one or two months  he should be given either the warning or ? imprisonment at the most for one or two months not too much  right  not more than one or two months  anything else ? vishal ? you know the what is the target what is the aim of the punishment ? just to bring improvement and check the further crime  just to bring the improvement as well as to check the further crime too  so one is that he should be given either a very light punishment one or two months imprisonment with some warning another one is suggesting that the fellow should be left  and government or the agency should take it as a feedback and tell or educate the other people regarding the offence that they should not do it  right ? they should be told they should be uh educated that it is something wrong very wrong it may lead to severe punishment and they should not do  right mass awakening anything else ? anything else in the capacity of a magistrate that you would like to ? sir the presence of that many people in the village as petty according to famous man also do uh make that uh net so he wants more nut in that so it's mass awareness is needed to educate all the village and warn them that they had to do no more plucking of the nut from track site right right i do agree  i do agree with you that such an ingnorant man such a  simple honest man should not be given a very severe punishment atleast one or two chances must be given to him to improve himself and the other members of the community should also be  shown that this is something punishable and they must leave it  i think that such honest fellows if given the chance they will improve they will leave such crimes  they will realise the gravity of the crime  understood ? you know till the very end denis doesn't understand that what for he is being sent to prison  till the very end he doesn't understand that what for he is being sent to the prison  right ? why ? he is punished he is uh given a very severe punishment  but till the very end he doesn't know that what is his crime  he doesn't know he couldn't understand it why ? or if i repeat the question like that one what are the crimes in his eyes ? according to him what are the crimes ? he thinks that  he thinks that unscrewing a nut from the rail track is not a crime at all  then what are the crimes in his eyes ? yes ? that his brother was not paying the tax  he thinks that  his brother was not paying the tax and he is being sent to for his brother's crime  right  he thinks that those who fight they must be punished and he hasn't  fought with anyone that's why he doesn't deserve  right  yes ? denis uh says stealing stealing is punishable  so don't you think that he has stolen a nut ?  noise  don't you think ?  noise  he has done unknowingly  he did it unknowingly  right  he is not stealing the tax  he not stealing tax  accha one who doesn't pay the taxes he deserves the punishment  right ? sir coming for judgement what ? sir there is one thing that he never a few words  please sit down  yes ? so i think stealing non-payment of the taxes and he thinks that he has not stolen anything  he has not fought with anyone and he has paid his taxes so he doesn't deserve the punishment punishment understood ?  that's why till the very end he couldn't convince himself  that he is a criminal  though he was found criminal in the eyes of the law but he couldn't convince himself that he is a criminal  okay  so is there any confusion regarding the story ?  punishment  no sir  or is there any other questions that you've got in your mind ? anyone any sort of the questions or doubts ? 
good morning children  today we are going to do the lesson the missing mail   what is the name of the lesson ?  the missing mail   the missing mail  can you understand anything about the title of the story ? missing mail  what do you understand by that ? what is missing mail ? mail means what ? yes ? train alright  what is the other meaning of mail ? yes ?  inaudible  letter very good  mail you know mail saying they say which carries the mail van and all that which carries letters to the the station so here the missing mail means the letter that has not been delivered  are you able to follow this ? the letter that has not been delivered  and now you tell me the personalities of the post man is going to play a part isn't it ? if the post man is very rude he doesn't listen to you he throws your letters at that time how do you feel about him ? he is a bit rude impolite doesn't talk to you nicely  and the other one who talks to you in a very nice manner do you find any difference between these two persons ? ah devyani can you tell ? teacher we can't with a person who is not polite and uh yes yes  if the person is very courteous polite then we feel like talking to him  if he is rather very rude and arrogant that time you don't feel like talking to the person  similarly when you go to a doctor a doctor who listens to your suffering your troubles and all that with a patient hearing he gives you and he talks to you in a very nice manner half of your troubles are over isn't it ? and suppose a doctor is there he talks to you in a very bad manner  i mean he doesn't talk to you much he doesn't inquire much about your suffering and all that how do you feel ? which doctor are you going to visit frequently ? the one who is going to talk to you in a very nice manner  listens to you and pays attention to what is  what are your problems and he tries to find a solution to that  so here in the present lesson present story we are going to come across thanappa the postman of the village and let us see  how he deals with the people there how much he has i mean he has uh he has identified himself with the people living in this village each and everyone he knows by their names and he identifies himself with their troubles sufferings and everything and gives them advice when it is required  now the story goes like this  all of you look into your book the teacher reads  though his beat covered vinayak mudali street and it's  four parallel roads it took him nearly six hours before he finished his round and returned to the head office in market road to deliver accounts  he allowed himself to get mixed up with the fortunes of the persons to whom he was carrying letters  at number thirteen kabir street lived the man who had come halfway up the road to ask for a letter for so many years now thanappa had been had seen him as a youngster and had watched him day by day greying on the pyol  sitting there and hoping for a big prize to come his way  through solving crossword puzzles   no prize yet he announced to him everyday   but don't be disheartened   your interest has been delayed this month somehow  he said to another   your son at hyderabad has written again madam how many children has he now ? the teacher explains  could you follow a little bit of this postman named thanappa  ? now let us see though his beat covered vinayak mudali street the name of the street in which he had to deliver the letters to the various people  so here it took him nearly six hours only one street   living the people living there he had to deliver the letters but how many hours did it take for him ?  six hours   six hours to deliver the letters  can you tell me what he does in those six hours ? why so much time he is taking ? why does he take so much time ? why ? what is the matter with him he can just throw the letter and come back but what does he do while delivering the letters ? dhanya ? teacher he a few words  yes he inquires about their welfare he ask them about their problems and all that and he tries to find a solution to their  problems   that's why the work which is to be finished within one hour is taking him six hours to complete  so here he allowed himself to get mixed up with the fortunes of the persons  what do you understand by the phrase get mixed up with ?  what's the meaning of this phrase ? kanchan can you tell the meaning ?  a few words  no what does he do ? means uh what meaning are you getting by that ? with the fortunes of the persons to whom he was carrying letters  what do you mean by that ? he mixed up with  he's very what is it ? he mixed up with the villagers means he has got intimate contact with them  he knows very well what are the problems and that's  why if anybody is hoping for a money order or anybody is  wants a prize or anybody anybody wants a suitable match for his daughter like that he knows each and everyone's problems and he identifies himself with all their uh whatever they want with all all their things is identifying and that's why the writer says that  he mixed up with the fortunes of the people  and now the particular man whom he is talking now is about living in thirteen kabir street and this man thanappa had been seeing right as a child  he knew him and this man today is an old man who is now having a marriageable age daughter who is to get married and now this man is eagerly trying for a match to his daughter  so here he says the man was sitting on a pyol   pyol means a carridor in front of the house  and this man is a little bit inactive you can say throughout the day he will be sitting there and trying to solve the crossword puzzle  what is a crossword puzzle ? have you seen it ? do you ever tried to solve it ? you get in sunday magazines and all that magazine sections you are having everyday in the hindustan times and  statesman in the last page you have it isn't it ? so this man is very busy trying to solve it but up till now he was not successful and he could not get a prize  what does thanappa say to him ? he says no prize yet  mallika ? that way when he passes the postman passes through that way  the man eagerly looks up at him why ? because he is expecting a prize  he wishes that thanappa should intimate him that he had won the crossword puzzle for that week or month and he is going to get a prize  but thanappa says no prize yet   you haven't won a prize  but don't be disheartened  disheartened means don't be disappointed  yes student name  disappointed yes very good  disheartened means don't lose heart don't lose courage have the will power try try like that and one day you are going to be successful   your interest has been delayed this month somehow  he said to another  now another first he has gone to another house to deliver a letter  and there the man is expecting some interest and he consoles him that his interest has been delayed a little bit but it is going to be added to the and soon he is going to receive it  and then to the third one he says your son at hyderabad has written again madam how many children has he now  ? he says to another lady your son has written a letter from hyderabad and now he enquires about your welfare   the teacher reads   i did not know that you had applied for this  madras job you haven't cared to tell me! it doesn't matter  when i bring you your appointment order you must feed  feed me with coconut payasam   the teacher explains  and now here is another person who had applied for an interview  he informed him that he had got selected and he has got the appointment order to him and he says you have to give me feast  because i've brought good news for you  so like that each and every person very intimately he knows what are their problems and he finds the solutions and through the letters which he is delivering he expects that they are getting someting good  something good is going to happen to them the teacher reads  and at each of their places he stops for nearly half an hour especially if anyone received money order he just settle down quite nicely with his bags and bundles spread about him and would not rise till he gathered an idea of how and where every  rupee was going the teacher explains  you see the concern of this postman  he talks to the person if a person gets a money order he does not quickly deliver the money and get it signed the form  and leave the place  he would sit down along with his bag and baggage he will talk to the person enquires him about the expenditure which is going to do with that money and he fears that ensures that each  rupee is going to be spent in a fruitful way  it is not being wasted  are you able to follow this point all of you ? how intimately how much personal interest he is taking in the affairs of each and everyone and how much he is concerned about the expenditure of that person the way how he is going to spend the money  which he had delivered just now through money order  whether it is being done the expenditure in a fruitful manner  or it is going to be a waste that he finds out from that person  and gets satisfaction only when he sees that it is spent in the right manner the teacher reads  if it was a hot day he sometimes asked for a tumbler of buttermilk the teacher explains  when it is very hot that time he would ask for a glass of buttermilk the teacher reads and sat down to enjoy it  everybody liked him on his beat  he was a part and parcel of their existence their hopes  aspirations and activities the teacher explains  so the people living in that particular village this postman thanappa is just like a member of their family  are you able to understand ? why ? because unlike the other postman of today nowadays what do you find a very rude they don't bother about what you have received  whether it is a bad news or good news nobody bothers about it but here he would go and sit with them talk with them  listen to their problems and assured them and give them advice  regarding what is to be done  so what type of a postman is thanappa ? a very caring affectionate kind polite type of man shall i continue sir ? addressed to someone who is recording the teacher's lesson  now look here the teacher reads  of all his contacts the one with which he was most intimately bound up was number ten vinayak mudali street  ramanujam was a senior clerk in the revenue division office  and thanappa had carried letters to that address for over a generation now the teacher explains  and now the pa particular  person who is going to be the hero of our story is mr ramanujam where is he working ? he is working as clerk he is working  kanchan ? he is working as senior clerk yes he is a senior clerk in the revenue office  sit down please  and now the teacher reads  his earliest association with ramanujam was years and years ago   ramanujam's wife was away in the village  a card arrived for ramanujam  thanappa as was his custom glanced to it at the sorting table itself and the moment he was ready to start out went straight to vinayak mudali street though in the ordinary course  over hundred and fifty addresses preceded it  he went straight to ramanujam's house knocked on the door and shouted postman sir postman  when ramanujam opened it he said give me a handful of sugar before i give you this card  happy father ! after all these years of prayers ! don't complain that it is a daughter  daughters are god's gifts you know ... kamakshi - lovely name ! the teacher explains  and now we find he is associating himself with the  happiness of ramanujam  ramanujam is blessed with a daughter and thanappa had come to deliver the news that he has become a father  a daughter has been born to him and he assured him that   dau daughter is born so he should not feel sad because according to the our hindu custom people are not happy when a girl is born in the family because all that trouble to get her married the large sum of dowry that is to be paid  dowry you know what is it ? 
okay please be seated  kindly sit down   haan i know i know  dipti will you be sitting here ? not i okay now you take this seat  that is not better that is not good better you have your seat here  no i will not sit  close the door one or two words  shakil don't play with handkerchief  okay what i intend to do today yesterday whatever i have taught you regarding magnet that we will begin today once again  instead of giving class work to you today i will repeat the same  thing  okay let us start with magnetism what is magnetism ? ravi ? what is magnetism ? magnetism is uh magnets attract magnet attracts attracting pieces of iron is called magnetism ajay ? so the magnet is called as a substance which attracts uh which has the quality of attracting other substances to it  other substances do you mean non-magnetic also ? iron is one or two words  who attracts iron nickel cobalt ? magnet  magnet so this force of attraction of magnet towards magnetic substances is called magnetism or magnetic force  so we begin with magnetism  what are the properties of a magnet ? avinash ? properties of a magnet  yes avinash i am talking to you  uhm don't raise your hands uhm ? magnet attracts iron magnet always attracts iron and also magnetic substance is called load-stone nickel cobalt and some varieties of steel  what is the second property vikas ? a freely suspended magnet always comes to rest pointing north direction what is a freely suspended magnet ? subhash subhash ?  what what do you mean by freely suspended ? mahesh ? the magnet is tied to a string and is left to suspend we will have to take a stand tie it with a thread and  hang it and just move it  it will go on moving go on rotating for some time and after that  it will come to rest that is always the same direction called north and south  now this north pole of the magnet is actually the south pole of the  earth the south pole of the magnet is actually the north pole of the earth can you tell me why ? ranjana ?  why why are they different ? because unbalanced pole of the suspended and right pole of the  but we have only one magnet here  we are talking about one magnet  uhm harish ?  i'm telling south pole of the earth is attracting  north pole of the magnet that is the geographical south is attracting  magnetic north pole  and am i talking about two magnets or one magnet ? one magnet  yes divya ? you are talking about one magnet only one magnet jayanti ? you are talking about two magnets which is the other magnet ? earth is the other magnet yes our earth is the collection of magnetic substance  our earth also behaves like a magnet therefore what is actually real north pole is the earth's  south pole and what is actually  i am sorry what is actually the north pole of the earth that is the magnetic south pole and what is in reality the north pole of the earth that is the south pole of the magnet  okay let us go to the third property of magnet kavya ? third property of a magnet  any property that you know  roopa ? like poles repel each other like poles repel each other and unlike poles attract each other naveen what do you mean by like poles ? please be seated  what do you mean by like poles ? what is a pole ? sachin ? what is a pole ? end of a magnet which attracts more more power than  miss miss the end of the magnet is uh attracts the maximum  it has maximum uh power of attraction that is called a pole   a pole  rather you can say that pole is a place of maximum attraction don't say end  the place in a magnet which has maximum power of attraction that is called a pole  how many poles are there shruti ? there are two poles two poles are there mohit what are they ? north pole and south pole north pole and south pole  so there are two poles in a magnet but when we bring two magnets together how do they behave ? tripti ? when we bring two magnets together how do they behave ? they attract each other  how ? how do they attract each other shilpa ? they a few words  okay anybody else ? yes ? girish ? girish you try  how do two magnets behave when we bring them together ? divya ? uhm likely poles repel and yes when we bring them together we will always find that north and north will repel and south of one magnet will attract the north pole of the other  so this is how they behave on coming together  then next property of a magnet  yes ajay ? the magnet is having maximum attraction at its poles the magnetic attraction is greatest at its two poles and is lesser in the middle  have you ever heard about magnetic field ? yes ma'am   what's just like ordinary playground or a field have you heard of magnetic field ? mahesh what is that ? earth is a magnet earth is a magnet  so whole earth is a field ? no  field of magnet ? anybody else ? why don't you try ? uhm  please sit down  because the earth behaves like a magnet because the earth behaves like a magnet ranjana ? the two ends of a magnet when uh rest against and when the object enters the magnetic field it gets attracted to that it gets attracted to that  so we can define magnetic field is that region upto which a magnet can affect or can exert its power of attraction on the object  and that field is again limited one it can't extend to a very long distance that area upto which a magnet can exert its attraction towards the magnetic substance that is called magnetic field  a smaller magnet has a small magnetic field a huge magnet will have a bigger magnetic field  similarly earth also has a magnetic field  next property of magnet which we have not discussed so far ? yes sanjeevani ? any other property ? deepti ? magnet is called a loadstone loadstone is magnetic substance  and magnets are basically made up of loadstone only  that is not the property  yes asha ? in the one or two words in a magnet yes why a bar of iron and a bar magnet they behave in a different manner ? why an iron bar is unable to attract another piece of iron ? if we just see the internal structure of a magnet that is a bar magnet and a bar of iron we do find there is a difference why there is a difference ? because of molecules  the arrangement of molecules in a bar magnet and a bar of iron they are totally different  in case of ir bar ir bar of iron what do you find ? what change do you find in bar of iron and bar magnet ?  a few words  arrange in what ? arrange in what fashion ?  a few words  uh that boy pratap ? pratap is not there ? yes avinash you try  please sit down  what about the pattern of arrangement of molecules in both the things ? in iron the molecules are not arranged uh in proper manner uh in magnet it's it is arranged  arranged in proper manner what do you mean by that proper manner ?  that's north uh north uh north north of santosh don't play with it  okay let us try to analyse  in case of bar of iron the molecules are arranged in a  any manner they like that is hap-hazard arrangement or zig-zag arrangement  but in case of bar magnet the same molecules are arranged in a line in a line or in a row and that too with all their north poles facing one side and south poles facing the other side therefore we find maximum attraction on one side of the magnet due to all north facing domains are on one side all south facing domains are on the other side  now what are these domains ? these domains are nothing but the other name for the molecules why a magnet gains the property of attraction ? this is because of a specific arrangement of its domains or molecules in a particular fashion they are all arranged in a row that attributes or that gives the property of attraction to a magnet whereas a bar of iron lacks it  now if by some force or some artificial means if we can arrange those molecules can a bar of iron be changed into a magnet ? mohit ? can we change a bar of iron into a magnet by making the molecular arrangement ? by making it same same how ? how can we do so ? by rubbing by rubbing  by rubbing  how this rubbing should be done ? santosh you can try ? santosh how can we rub a magnet ? a bar of iron with a magnet and get get an another magnet ? rub straight what do you mean by straight ? triveni ? we should rub in the same direction no we should begin with one pole and start rubbing the magnet  and then again lift it and again bring the same pole again start rubbing it and lifting so by repeated rubbing and lifting the magnet  we can also convert a piece of blade or a bar of iron into a  magnet  what do you call this kind of magnet ? a permanent magnet or a temporary magnet ? please be seated  what do you call this kind of magnet you have made by rubbing ? prabhakar ? yes hemant you try ? temporary we call it a temporary magnet  abhay what do you mean by temporary magnet ? a temporary magnet is a magnet which uh loses its property after sometime but the moment uh gradually lose their arrangement power or they are  get again the same zig-zag they get arranged in the zig-zag manner and they lose it  what are permanent magnets ? what are permanent magnets sachin ? they do not lose  they do not lose they also lose their property but after a very very long period of time yes harish ?  a few words  permanent magnets are magnets which lose the the power after many years and uh like they  okay permanent magnets are those which lose their power after a long period of time  have you heard about electro-magnets ? yes yes what are electro-magnets ? how can we make electro-magnets ? jayanthi ? electro-magnet is passed through electricity  yes if we take any metallic wire and some how pass electricity through it by coiling around an electric wire all over it we find that same ordinary piece of metal gains the property of attraction and it starts attracting pieces of iron that is when we pass electric current through a piece of the metal it becomes a magnet and such magnets are referred to as  electro-magnets yes harish ? generally we make electro-magnets with the instrument of iron generally we make electro-magnets with the help of iron  by coiling copper wire on iron formulate the electro or uh the  that is if we wrap alumin wire on aluminium yes that can also be converted into electro-magnet  can you just yes ranjana ? electro magnet is one which a few words  yes you are you are right but this this kind of electro-magnet we can convert big big pieces into magnet for our  quick purpose  but in case of rubbing you have to have very big magnet and again rubbing will take a very very long time and it it is possible only with the help of small piece of blade or a safety pin or a  small object  but when we want to make big magnet electro-magnets are used  in many other places so that is the best method though it is again a temporary the moment we switch off electric current again the same piece of iron becomes an ordinary thing  no more a magnet miss can we make uh other metal from the one or two words  no no we can't  only iron we can rub and convert it into temporary magnet  now what are the uses of magnet ? what are the uses of magnet in our daily or day-to-day life ? vikas ? magnets are used in the boxes and uh electric current in pencil boxes for what purpose ? for  yes for closing the box  we need not put much of effort just leave it because of the attraction it get tightly closed yes divya ? in door in  door door they are also used as door closers automatic door closers you leave the door because of attraction yes because of attraction the door gets closed in refrigerator also you leave it it gets stuck to it because of the magnetic force  ravi ? in the dia diaphragm diaphragm of a speaker and in motors  next santosh ?  a few words  speak loudly  it is used by navigators in order to know the direction and for that matter they use a special type of magnet magnetic needle or magnetised needle that is fitted in a watch like thing we call it a compass  with the help of this compass needle they can come to know the direction in which they are moving so they help the navigators to know the direction in which they are sailing or moving  ranjana ? in iron factories yes in iron factories where lot of scrape iron is produced due to cutting or due to sawing of the bars  that scrape iron can again be melt melted and re-used therefore to pick up that scrape iron from the land or from the soil or from the broken pieces we make use of cranes fitted with the magnet which can go on collecting this scrape iron  mahesh ? girish ? magnet is used in referigerator they are used in refrigerators i have told kavya ? in generators in generators for what ? miss miss  let her answer yes for generating what ? electricity  have you read it somewhere that magnets are used in generating electricity  yes kavya ? have you read it somewhere ? i don't think anywhere we are using magnets to generate electricity  ravi ? what do you say ?  a few words  where ? in generator  that is where ? in the middle of copper wire  that day also he has told us that in the middle of the copper wire we put a magnet then ?  a few words  by the copper wire and thats how it is transmitted  so we are generating electricity but we are unable to tell where and how ? you must know where and how it is being generated 
now today we are going to start the new topic   the laws of return laws of return  now already you have studied regarding the consumption topic  there you have studied regarding the behaviour of a consumer  how a consumer is reacting towards the prices in the law of demand you have studied that when the price increases the quantity demanded decreases and when price fall the quantity demand is  increased  now here you have studied the behaviour of a consumer that how the consumer always tries to maximise his satisfaction  now under the laws of return we are going to study the behaviour of a producer  that how the producer is trying to find out the relationship between the input and output and how this input-output relationship is  useful for determining his cost of production  because his returns depends upon the cost of production  so under this now laws of return we have to study three different types of laws the law of increasing return diminishing return constant return and we have also to study the returns to state  but before we start with the law of increasing return  or law of variable proportion we have to be very clear regarding these certain concepts  so the first concept regarding which we have to be clear that is the production function production function  production function now you can write on this production function begins to dictate  according to professor lepski production function is  production function is a technological relation is a technological relation showing for given state of technology  showing for given state of technology cough  this explains cough how much can be produced  how much can be produced with given amount of input with  given amount of input   the functional relationship the functional relationship with the physical input and physical output  is known as production function is known as production function ends to dictate  it can be written in the form of equation it can be written in the form of equation as quantity is equal to f  a b c d quantity equal to f a b c d  here quantity b b work begin q means quantity  f means factors of production a b c d b b work end  different factors of production a b c d different factors of  production begins to dictates  this equation shows cough this equation shows  quantity produced depends on factors of production  respectively  this equation shows quantity produced depends on  factors of production respectively  production function production function expresses the relationship production function expresses the relationship  between quantity of output quantity of output and quantities of various inputs and quantities of various inputs ends to dictate written now in this production function what do you come to know  that what is production function ? it is a type of technological relationship which is existing between the input and output now do you know what is the meaning of input and what is the meaning of output ? what is the meaning of input ? yes ? yes answer me   it's alright it's a new topic but you must come forward  now for the production of commodity what do you need ? raw materials raw materials so all these raw materials are input  this factors of production as land labour capital raw materials all these are the input  now there supposingly there are two labourers and they are producing ten chairs  now what is the relationship between this ? raw material also they are using along with that now what you will say ? that making use of all these two labourers they are able to produce the ten chairs in a day so this is the production function that when we employ the two labourers they are producing ten chairs  when we employ the third labourer the production function will  change because they will be producing now more number of chairs  so what is production function ? it is simply a relationship between the inputs and outputs input is here the factors of production or the amount of the goods which we are using for the production of other commodities and output is the commodity which you are able to produce after making use of the input  and production function is giving you the relationship between the input and output  thereby having this much of factors of production how much commodity we can produce so to that we are calling it as a input and output relationship  begins to dictate  then further two things must be noted two things must be noted in respect of in respect of production function  first production must be considered with reference to a particular period of time production must be considered  with reference to particular period of time  written ? second  production technology should not change production technology should not change during that period  production technology should not change during that period  because when technology changes because when technology changes production function also gets changed when technology changes production function also gets changed  ends to dictate  now these are the two things which we have to keep in mind regarding the production function that it should be related to a particular period of time and during that period our technology should not be changed  because if the technology will change then our same production function relationship will not be there  why ? because with technology advancement when the technology changes  new input output relation come  so then our that production function cannot exist  so when we are studying it for a particular period of time during that period it is essential that the technology should not change as accordingly firstly the clothes are being produced with the help of handloom device  now production was less and after that some period new technology has come and now we may start producing the cloth with the help of powerloom you can say  so naturally input output relation will change and production function will also change  then begins to dictate in economic theory two types of production function are there  in economic theory two types of production function are there first when some input when some input are kept constant when some input are kept constant and other is changed and other are changed ends to dictate  written now this type of production function will be available in the short period  now i had explained to you already the concept of short period  market period and long period  from the adjustment of the supply point of view  now can you tell me now what is short period ? now again you have to go back  it's very bad  what is short period ? during the short period the supply can be input to the yes  short periods are that period in which we can ad  adjust the supply to a limited absence only by taking the variable factors of production  i told you there are two types of factors of production  fixed factors of production and variable factors of production so in the short period we are keeping the fixed factor as a  unchanged because now just now you have written that in this production function some inputs are kept constant and others are changed here fixed factors are kept constant and variable factors are changed during the short period and supply is at the dip at your limited extent and in the short period then a little laws of returns are applicable as the law of increasing return diminishing return and constant returns these laws will be applicable in the short period  why ? because in the short period you are not taking the fixed factor we are simply taking the variable factor and when you are taking the variable factor in the beginning  then the returns starts increasing  why they start increasing because earlier you are not making proper utilisation of the fixed factors of production now you want to increase the production and by employing the variable factor you are able to have the better utilisation of the fixed factors of production because of this your return have started increasing  but after some time your result return will start diminishing now why they will start diminishing ? why ? because now the variable factors as you are increasing the variable factors on that thing your variable factors are becoming more in proportion to the fixed factors and they are getting lesser and lesser shares from the fixed factors to work upon them and because of this their return starts diminishing  so you have to keep this thing in mind that this first type of production function is applicable in the short period  now second is there all the inputs can be changed  all the factors are changed all the factors are changed  so this is the second production function and it is applicable in the long run because long period you know is that period where all type of adjustments are possible  supply and demand can be adjustable to any extent and all the factors of production becomes variable  and under this production function you will be selling the returns to state  uh became one of the diff diff difference  coming between them  there in the short period laws of return here returns to state because in the second production function you are totaly changing the scale of the production and because of the change in the scale of production what is the change in the return ? that is studied under the returns to state  so this is regarding the first concept of the production function  then your next will be besides this you must have a idea regarding the tot meaning of total  product average product and marginal product  because if you are not clear regarding that also then also you cannot understand these laws of return  so first of all we will study the total product  so what that is ? product  now what is the meaning of total cost ? although it is not related to you this but still i want to connect this topic with that  total what is the total cost ?  a few words  i am asking you what is the meaning of total cost ?  a few words  don't study at home you one word  total cost is the cost of producing a commodity  whatever total money if a pruducer is spending on the productional value providing is known as the total cost  okay and it includes fixed and variable from both  then you have studied the total value cocept also  what is total value ? it is the money received which is being received by the producer  while selling up certain amount of commodity in the market  whatever money he is getting to that we are calling it as the total value  now similarly the total product is the amount of the goods  which are being produced by a certain number of producers labourers or input whatever we are using by making use of that whatever we are able to produce to that we are calling it as the total product  you can write down the meaning of total product  be regular otherwise it will be very difficult for you  begins to dictate  total product of a factor is total product of a factor  is the amount of the total output is the amount of the total output  produced by given amount of factors produced by given amount of factors given amount of factors  as the factors are increased total product also starts rising total product also  total product also start rising but the rate of increased value but the rate of increased value at different levels of output at different levels of output  in the beginning in the beginning total product rises  at a increasing rate after a point after a point total product starts rising total product start rising at diminishing rate as the employment of variable factors as the employment of variable factors increases as the employment of variable factors increases ends to dictate  written now you can take this how you can find out it is increasing  you you can take the number of labourers and total  product and total product from which you can come to know how it is  firstly increasing at an increasing rate then it is increasing at a diminishing rate  now accordingly then the zero first labourer is here the total product is n unit  the second labourer is employed the total product is eighteen units  the third labourer is employed it is twenty-five  the fourth it is thirty and fifth it is thirty-two  and fifth labourer it is thirty-two  now what did you come to know from this ? it is first of all it is increasing at a increasing rate or not  ? than it is increasing at a diminishing rate  than from the first labourer you have employed the second labourer the total product has increased from ten to eighteen there has been the increase of eight units  in the third case also it is not as if there is an increase of the  seven units now in fourth case you see there is the increase of only  five units so the rate of increase is decreasing  then in the fifth case you find there is increase of only the  two units  why it is happening this ? because now when the first labourer was there the fixed factors were more and they were not being fully utilised  when we start with second labourer there was a better utilisation of both factors of production and the production has increased when we employ the third then also it has increased  but after the fourth labourer we find when we have employed the fifth labourer the rate of increase in the total product is  diminishing it is diminishing because as the variable factors are increased  they are getting lesser and lesser shares  now these fixed factors you work upon them and because of this  their total products starts diminishing okay  is that okay 
we have in this studio today three prominent persons  related to carbohydrates technology and industry  let us introduce ourselves  former senior district director ahmadabad textile industry research association  he is head of carbohydrate research division  he is currently working there as emeritus csir scien  uh professor  dr k r bhattacharya is a former scientist central food technological research institute  and he is an expert in food-carbohydrates  and we have dr p m shah  he is a technologist in a industry related to carbohydrates  typically making starch and its products  now dr shrivastav i request you to tell us what are diverse materials which we call as carbohydrates and what are their common and less common uses ? then i'll also like you to elaborate how india acquired technology on carbohydrates which we are uh looking today  and how do we compare in utilization of our carbohydrate research  uh carbohydrate resources compared to international level ? carbohydrates are one of the most uh widely and  commonly occurring products in nature  we use them almost everyday carbohydrates are either sugars which are normally sweet  or they are made up of sugars  carbohydrates either are of one unit or two units  several units or hundreds of units  those which are one unit are called sugars those which are two units are called disaccharides  saccharide is standing for sugar  those which have three units are trisaccharides and so on tetra penta and then polysaccharides which are  which have a large number of sugar units in their molecular  structure  to illustrate the diversity of carbohydrate materials  we have here on this table a number of carbohydrate substances the first is a single unit sugar called glucose  it is also known as dextrose which is commonly used  during recuperating process of patients  then we have a disaccharide with which most of you are familiar  and this is cane-sugar or sucrose the sample is also here  then we have a large variety of polysaccharide  the most common of which is cellulose  by the name itself you can understand that  this is the sugar of cells  or the polysaaccharide of cell and that is why the word  is cellulose  all plant cells are made up of cellulose  among one of the most common substances made up of cellulose or cotton a sample of which is here  similarly paper on which we write is also made up  of essentially cellulose  then we have another material which actually is a seed carbohydrate and it is starch  it is a polymer of glucose unit  this is also widely present in seeds and in stems  and in tubers  some examples of these are also here  we have rice which has a large quantity of starch  in it  then we have corn from which starch industrially  is isolated  now some of these products are converted into food materials  snack food or fast food  for example the corn when puffed gives popcorn  and potato which also contains lot of starch gives potato chips  these samples are also displayed here  besides the example shown here there are large number of other carbohydrates for example the skeletal material of insects and  sea animals like shrimps and crabs and lobsters is made of  made up of a polymer of which is a sugar modified sugar  glucose i mean  and this polymer is called chitin  at present there is lot of interest in this polymer  these because it occurs to a very large extent among the sea  animals   we're all familiar with the cane sugar industry cane sugar is one of the cheapest and purest  organic material which is available  it is more than ninety-nine percent pure and its cost is anywhere from rupees seven  to ten  then we have the cotton which is the basis for  all textiles  whether hundred percent cotton or blended cotton  similarly paper as i mentioned earlier is essentially  cellulose  and the paper is made from the wood which is chipped and then converted into pulp and then later on  converted into the paper which we use for writing  recently we have a one word industry which is uh based in india and in pakistan  and cultivation of it is mostly in rajasthan haryana  gujarat and punjab  although in india we have modified many of these  corbohydrate polymers like cellulose starch and gums  when we compare the level of technology available in our country vis-a-vis the advanced countries we have still  far to go  even though india has made considerable progress in  utilizing its own sources of carbohydrate materials and  based on this several industries old and new have been set up dr shrivastav has very much elaborated the industrial uses of carbohydrates  now dr k r bhattacharya who is present with us and he is an expert in food uh carbohydrates  he can additionally tell us about the technology we have in carbohydrate utilization as food  you know one of the primary requisites of the food  as we like it is its texture  by texture i mean the qualities of how we perceive the material in our mouth  whether it is hard or soft whether it sticks to the mouth  to the teeth or whether it doesn't stick  whether the food crumbles when you bite or it slowly melts  so the it is liquidic or it is soft  now this is the totality of these is called texture  now take the taste of uh the potato chips dr shrivastav has mentioned or the the popcorn  now that has crumbled uh if you take uh potato as such  then it is soft it doesn't crumble like that  or take for instance the case of idli   which is a very popular food in south india and now has become very popular throughout india  now it has a definite texture  it's extremely soft and pliable and yet it doesn't i i it's not pliable in the sense that it it deforms slowly i i i   it brakes   it is it is soft and yet  breakable  now the point i am trying to say is that this particular characteristic food this called your food its texture is contributed most importantly by its carbohydrate contents  a rice contains starch about ninety percent starch  maize contains about eighty percent starch potato contains  but for its water content virtually mo  more than ninety-five percent of starch so if if if cornflake and and potato chips  and there are other materials which contain other kinds of uh  monosaccharide polysaccharide or different kinds of carbohydrates  now it is these carbohydrate content which contribute to the largest extent to the texture  to our perceptions of food as we like it the food have not only nutritional content not only its  taste perse but also the texture perception by which we like or dislike a kind of food  dr bhattacharya you've given a very interesting example  and i suppose the texture of the same carbohydrate food can be modified like a cooked vegetable made from potatoes that has one texture  and the chips have quite a different texture so i think this is a part of your technology that we can change the texture of the same material  yes uh prof mathur what you say is very right  uh as you mentioned potato has one texture  potato fried in a particular way has one texture potato fried in a different way and in different form has a slightly different texture  but uh what i would like to stress is it is not only the way you prepare it is not only the way you process but also the inherent inherent uh composition uh inherent trite  content quantity quality of the carbohydrate could play a very important role  dr bhattacharya as in one aspect on which you might stress upon is the energy which is uh given by the carbohydrate  material that are ingested by people  because this is the family source of energy  beside texture energy is a very important factor  which is contributed by carbohydrates  yeah i think it's a very good point dr srivastav and dr mathur has reminded me  we eat food for for primarily two reasons  one is for energy and the other is for various  constituents that our body needs  uh energy means various energy doesn't necessarily mean only the work that we do  we need energy not only for the work we do but our body itself is doing millions of functions continously  even if we lie perfectly still and that even then we need  approximately twelve hundred to fifty  fifteen hundred calories per day just to maintain our body functions  now as dr srivastav very rightly mentioned it is the food which enables us to obtain that is this energy and carry out our functions  now it has been shown that carbohydrate particularly starch  sugar they contain approximately four calories it is a kind of unit a measure like uh inch or metre or gram  it is a kind of measure of energy  each gram of sugar or starch or carbohydrate material  contains approximately four calory of energy per gram  so if we need uh let's say on an average some two thousand calories per day an average man  then you can say we would have needed if we ate carbohydrate alone we would have needed approximately five hundred grams of carbohydrates  of course we don't eat this much because we eat other things as well you know we not only eat carbohydrates but we eat proteins and fat and fat supplies much more energy for the unit weight  as compared to carbohydrates  so as uh dr shrivastav has very rightly said supplier of energy  but uh i'll again come back uh human being's   needs now satiation is a factor  so liking is a major one word provide that we enjoy our food and that's why you eat  we just when we eat we just don't think that we must maintain our body and we must have nutrition  we enjoy food so we eat  and the texture is a very very important part of the content dr p m shah the technologist in a carbohydrate based industry will elaborate about the prospects of this industry   it's relevence to national development and our technology compared to international standard  now the relevence of this carbohydrate or carbohydrate chemistry is very much in usage to human life  right from morning when you get up you use either a carbohydrate or its product  take for example in the morning you're doing like  using a tooth paste  it contains a product of carbohydrate  secondly you go for a breakfast you have got something  on starch  you wear clothes it is made up of either cellulose which is a carbohydrate  or it is processed with a carbohydrate called starch for sizing or finishing  then you come to the uh children for as a confectionery  there it is a product of carbohydrate  then you come to the medicine which is required either by young boy or a woman or an old man it is also containing some products of carbohydrate chemistry  then the industry is such a marvellous industry  that none of its product is used is wasted or it is completly utilized  take for example the manufacturing of starch  there you take either rice starch or maize starch or a  one word starch  all its constituents are either converted into starch or  its uh ingredients are used somewhere in the cattle feeds or  in some other indusrty  so the beauty of this industry is that nothing is wasted  even the waste water is used for one of the based industry called pharmaceutical industry  so you can understand the rele relevence  of this industry in the human life  now coming to the other aspect of man uh this  natio national important things other things now our industry say as for example starch industry or  its other products which is called refinery refined   products  that is the total productions of the country is to the tune of around two hundred crores of rupees  and we are utilizing nearly about two hundred thousand tonnes of grains  say in terms when i say grain i usually mentioned  mention maize  then to the exchequer it is giving nearly about thirty to thirty-five crores of rupees  not only that but it gives a direct employment to more than eight thousand people  and indirect employment to the other eight to ten thousand of people  now this is just i give you a small uh some idea  about the industry  now what are we manufacturing in carbohydrate industry ? we take right from the grain  we process the grain and separate its ingredients of which it is composed of  it is composed of if you take a maize it is composed of four parts  one is called oil bearing substance called germ then protein which is a protein like substance then starch which is a carbohydrate and fiber which is called a celluline birch  now similarly also in one word or in rice you have got not only same proportion but a different proportion of starch and fiber or celluline substances  now technically speaking when we are doing this carbohydrate industry starch or a refinery product our  machinaries are practically comparable to what we have got in the most advanced countries  not only that but our products are meeting the standards and specifications of international requirements  you take our products it meets i p standard but it also meets u s standard or british standard  that is all our products are meeting the standards  therefore you can very well understand that the processes that we are using it the technology that we are adopting is same as what all other advanced countries are using  and technologically i don't think we will be in any way  away or slightly different  only thing we may have some difficulty that the advancement of the computerization which is available in the western countries may not be here because we have to use either a human or we have to use a human as well as a mechanical man not that much of computerization 
the last phases of the election campaign are coming upon us very soon  it has been a tragic election in a way  introductive tragically  and we are now approaching the last phases   phase of the election  with uh me this evening is a very interesting panel  we have our the chief election commissioner mr seshan and  we've dileep padgaonkar editor of the times of india  and we have prabhu chawla a great one word of  indian express and i'm nihal singh a columnist  uh mr seshan if i might ask a rather genuine question to begin with  you have proved to be the most controversial chief election commissioner in india's history  uh do you think it is because of the prevailing political climate ? or do you think it is because of your personality ? or do you think it's the combination of both ? i think my good fortunes are related to several factors  i think the current election is perhaps the most sensitised election as i've been saying for the last two three months of all the election that have been held in this country  uh certain things have improved certain things have not improved  of course you ask the question which i'm a little at a loss of word to answer am i controversial ? i remember telling somebody very recently and i would like to repeat that that i was not intending to be a very soft aids weapon of doing this work  i had uh cautioned everybody that the election commission intended to take it's work seriously  and make sure that the country would get the election which it is entitle to which is a fair and free election  and as far as i'm concerned anything which comes in the way of a fair and free election it's a good object to be satisfied  if unfortunately that produces controversy i'll say  two words i've sinned  well i think dileepji wanted to raise the question of the abruptness of some of the decision no i how they were taken  ?  no i  no i i did want to take off from where you left  to say that uh we have here a situation where the  entire political class seems to be ranged against the election commissioner  and i i have been trying very hard to find out how he's  achieved this remarkable feat in this remarkable period of time uh is it because uh not just that you wanted to to take this election seriously but also that the rot in the electoral process that stretch in such a long time ago did you expect to stand it in one go so to speak ? uh dileep i must apologise for not responding to the statement you made about what did you say the rot which is set into the system  in my own rather limited way i've been saying and i will say that what had happened as i mentioned before is a certain loss of credibility in the election systems spread all over the country  and it's loss merely is not a question of losing faith in election in one small part of the country or the other  the entire system's credibility is at stake  now you put it in stronger language i am by training and otherwise not accustom to using harsh language  so my answer to your question would be that uh uh may be you are perfectly right in saying that i tried to put right whatever was in my view not right or whatever is in the country's view not right uh at a rather faster phase then what the system could digest  but all that i can tell you is that the founding fathers in the constitutional the representation of the people rank clothed the election commission with an abundance of powers  which the lordships in the supreme court repeatedly replace it until these are power  as one set of lordship once said it is not as if the election commission so one word in a difficult situation hold its hands and fold in prayer and say good lord give me guidence what to do  yet i do even now pray to god for guidence very often  but i don't always wait and stand until the guidance is fully available in writing  i should act  this i have made clear and i have acted to the best of my ability no mr seshan i am raising a different question all together belief has ended with broader question of rot which has set into the system  but i rightly put in the beginning that you were determined to  to remove any obstacle in the free and fair elections  but what it counts around now after your various action postponing the election counter manding the election  it seems you have assigned to yourself the role of a supreme court judge of india  where you don't hear anybody  you deliver justice without telling anybody what are the cause for delivering this particular kind of justice  you're giving a judgement saying you're  hang  when somebody protest then you say come here and  i'll hear you  what is now that is trying the credibility of situation is your one sense sided decision making  you have not heard anybody  you see in a political democracy dialogue is an  ess essential ingre ingredient   of a political system  and you're just sacrificing the dialogues at all  well uh prabhu all the time i say is that i indoubtely agree with you you said you're a supreme court judge doing various things   i'm equated to a supreme court correct but they hear everything no no no i'm not  you're not hearing like supreme court no no no i'm not denying in the least that the right  natural right of justice of being heard ought to be available  but i can only go by the rule book which parliament has handed me down  in certain places what does it say for example if i may at the risk of uh of of of wasting listeners time mention in fact yes you have to waste listeners time no i i no no no no i am not no no no i was not suggesting that you let me complete first because you have been when you are quoting the parliament   is the has the parliament given you power not to hear anybody ? no no please no i was not i was not suggesting  in the least that your question was a waste of time i said i'm  going to quote a section of law which could tantamount to spending a little mere time when it is justified  it says if the election commission is satisfied it can do so and so so and so in appropriate place  now i don't want to get into again a legal argument for the question  you're perfectly right that if the time is available and the oppurtunity is available the courses of natural justice must all be followed i have no disagreement with that at all  but if you had to take a decision which have to be taken   in within hours if not less than hour  then it is not always possible to go through hearings and what not  number two is that where the proof is abstractedly available  without necessarily listening to but it is not for example you refer to counter manding  this counter manding decisions are not taken against any candidate it is against the state or place in a particular constituency   a few words  but does it what are the implications of counter manding implications are serious  but if you cannot hear the party no parliament in nineteen eighty-nine decided that if booth capturing happens the election commission and if i may say so with great respect it doesn't say election commission may it says  the election commission shall countermand the election  after hearing the party no he says not hearing the party   no no  let me again mention this to you that where a situation has produced evidence adequate enough to say that hearing is not necessary i feel it called upon i feel called upon to take a decision  i mean i don't disagree with you i do not want to disagree with you at any stage  that a right of ordinary justice natural justice demands that somebody should be heard who is likely to be affected  but in that case somebody might even argue if i countermand the election in a particular constituency i should hear all the people  why only the candidates ? if i countermand the election in constituency x then  surely i should hear all the people in that and not merely the twenty thirty forty candidates who have filled up i i mean who have been nominated by the mr seshan you are trying to set up conventions  which are creat which are creating   more problem you are creating political instability by deciding decision one taking one decision in the morning taking some other decisions two days later  may i may i put it more specifically this point  uh the fact that you said you counteremanded x number of uh  consitituencies alright elections in these constituencies  later you came round to say well i'm  reconsidering my decisions  now that leaves you open to a lot of criticism and also it   it intr introduces instable  instability in the political set-up  that is one point and the other is uh that has been raised by a number of parties is that you are supposed to have told one delegation that  as far as election officer's reports are concerned the days those days are over now that is how it's been reported  maybe you would like to answer this question   well let me answer the second part first  and uh i i i'll come up to a little later as far as the question of total dependability of the official heirarchy of officers to be impartial in all that they do is regretably no longer available  whether it is uh officers at higher level officers at the lower level or one word work reciding in polling offices and polling stations  people who work as magistrates and others people at higher level district election officers and still higher  i may say with all the humility i possess  in all the humility i possess that the point of time at which  one could say without asking any question that this report would be totally impartial  any content mistakes of facts which are genuinely mistakes of fact but which they are not those of if i may use very bad word committed people is no longer available  this i did mention to more than one political party  but we have tried to make sure that there are enough checks and balances built-in in order to ensure that somebody say so if not adequate for taking an action  this is as far as it concern now you raise the other question you countermanded and then you are hearing people yes  does this create the instability  it certainly creates doubts in the minds of people whether the election commission is in two minds about its own decisions as far as i am concerned those five counteremanding decisions were taken with a full sense of responsibility after analyzing the status and hundreds and hundreds of reports which were received on the twentieth there was official report they were none of the official report no i'm sorry i i don't concede that statement to you  i don't concede the fore factual possession to you  you may be referring to report from a certain set of offices like look here chief election commissioners office in the state  i'm again mentioning you  you've the returning officer in the state  i'm mentioning it you i have reports of the returning officers  i have reports of the chief electoral officer recommending rec recommending   this countermanding  look i i i'm sorry i am not going into individual specifics  i am mentioning again  in coming to certain conclusions we are not taking into account or failing to take into account any kinds of valid information i will tell you we have returning officers reports  we have chief electoral officers reports  i have sent out three hundred central officers  now you might well ask what is this enormous waste of resources and money to sent three hundred observers  now what was behind the sending of observer somebody could have asked this question  why do you have to sent central observers and state observers they sent all the time last time we had   they are not sent all the time  they were not three hundred but hundred a few words   i'm may i mention with all great respect that last time around a total of seventy-five people were deployed throughout the country  this time i deployed three hundred not because i would like supply to deploy more therefore the election has not been smooth even after deploying three hundred no no i don't recommend that   election has been   i will let me tell you the elections were smooth in haryana  they were smooth in himachal they were smooth in rajasthan  they were smooth in madhya pradesh they were smooth in andhra pradesh except for minor cases here and there  they were good in andaman they were good in lakshadweep  they were largely good in west bengal  now you come to the core area of u p and bihar  we get into areas of greater and greater worry  i won't use any other word  we get into areas of greater and greater worry   that's why there is some charge that you are listenning to a particular political group no no look i have mentioned again and let me again submit to you that if at the thick of the game people get ang   angry against the umpire  i am sorry the umpire will have to put with it 
 in hindi  you know that's right today was uh suppose to have been the first day of brave new india  a day on which we were to radically restructure our our economic policies and therefore transit on to a high growth path after a short period of painful adjustment on and that was what it was supposed to be how it turned out to be is really going to be our discussion we are likely to have with us on the panel today people who have been in one way or the other involved in this uh exercise to fashions a brave new india  i'll uh introduce them straight away  uh mr pranab mukharjee deputy chairman of the planning commission mr deepak nair chief economic adviser of ministery of finance government of india mr v k loria is here as an a   consultant  also with us on the panel uh on our side of the panel is in-house one word uh dileep cherian and therefore i'll  take off by asking dileep the first question dileep do you think uh the way the day has unfolded it was uh  brave new india in the making ?  i'm not entirely sure whether it's uh  brave enough  sure mr manmohan singh has done quite a few things that this country desperately needs   it's certainly an economist kind of budget with lots of political cheese cake thrown in  but the budget has to be really seen in the backdrop of the other major documents that was presented today which is the industrial policy  as it needed to address in some sense three or four basic needs of the hour  one the need for austerity  second a need to restore confidence in those who seek and ought to invest in india  and three to fashion as it were a completely new kind of economy  but to my mind the budget does do some other things that is including these areas  it certainly delivers as far as the capital market is concerned  i think it does some of the much needed reform to the money market   i'm happy to see that defence expenditure has been held at the level at which be held  and a lot of the restructuring in the customs duties to my mind move in the right direction  but that's not enough  i think it disappoints in certain other areas  uhm i am not entirely happy with what happened as far as the public sector is concerned  neither an industrial policy nor as far as the budget is concerned are enough signals being given as to what is going to happen in that area  not enough is seen as far as curbing of conspicous consumption  that has become a social problem in the country is going to be done  and i am worried about the signals that are sending out for corporate investment  and i think for some reason or the other perhaps for good reason of his own manmohan singh seems to have been dissident on three other areas  one is on the business of n r i except for what he has done as far as gifts are concerned  this doesn't seem to be enough incentive for n r i's  to invest back in india again  i am concerned about the hesitation to hit at subsidies  much much harder  and i don't see enough effort in this whole belt tightening exercise that we've been talking on for so long in tightening of government expenditure  so these to my mind are areas we ought to worry about  there are two more areas that i would think cause concern today  i am worried about the kind of unchecked growth of interest payment   it's forty-two percent now  and dr singh says that it is going to go up to fifty percent  if it's not checked by nineteen ninety-four nineteen ninety-five  and this would have been a very good time to get rid of that burden of debt release to rural sector which seems to  be uh costing the economy about for four thousand five hundred crores in the three year period that we are looking at  these to my mind are areas of concerned today   a summary of mr cherian's view is repeated in hindi  i see that uh mr mukharjee has got the congress manifesto open to page twenty-two which says which says  the economy uh mr mukharjee i'm sure you agree with dileep when he says that it delivers on a b m c  but i'm sure you have uh difference with him when  when he says that it's diffident disappoints  and areas of concerned  uh firstly i would like to point out that budget is one instrument followed with many other which reflects the   government's policy  and particularly this year's budget is to be reviewed  in the context of industrial policy resolution which has been announced this morning  trade policy which has which was  announced a little earlier and certain readjustment programme which have been initiated by the government itself  congress as a party was committed to the electorate of this country to restore balance in the economic system and  wanted to put the economy on rate  therefore certain structural adjustment were absolutely needed  if we wanted to come out of wood  to my mind this budget is an adjustment budget in the sense it has initiated a large number of message which will pay dividend in course of time  bold initiative was needed and bold initiative has been taken  uh pardon me for interrupting mr mukharjee now uh dileep made a point and he says that he is disappointed  uh at what budget has done in the public sector for instance uh uh  the expectation was that it would much more would be done  uh uh   i'm coming to that  if you look at the industrial policy resolution and the proposals in the budget you will find that what we committed we have done it  firstly the area of operation of public sector has been limited  and more areas have been open to private sector  this investment in the public sector has been announced in the budget and through these process public sector would be made  more accountable competitive and it would serve the social  obligation for which the public sector institutions are built up  even his comment in respect of the for instance uh our liabilities towards the interest payment i do agree that it is uh sizeably of high order  but what can you do ? no finance minister can say that he will not fulfill the commitment by paying interest on the past borrowing  therefore finance minister has made it quite clear in his statement that the distortions which have taken place will be ractified  over the period of year  certain time will be needed   that's why this year's borrowing has been  limited  even the reduction of non-developmental expenditure  non-planned expenditure is substantial  and the budget has given a clear message what the government feels uh uh may i may i just take up from uh there  deduction in non-planned expenditure is something that i would like to ask uh mr nair this question  uh may be we had a gap of information so therefore you could clarify if we have gap of information  is that you said deduction in non-planned expenditure is down by four point nine percent if you exclude interest payment  and in the very next line uh you go on to say that actually it is down by over fifteen percent  now these are two uh is it is it  that eleven point two percent went down on government uh on the interest payment  now let me explain non-planned expenditure excluding interest payment in terms of the budget estimates for ninety-one ninety-two is four point nine percent lower than the revised estimate  for nineteen ninety ninety-one  now if we had introduced low one word and expenditure  non-planned expenditure has con had continued in keeping with past trend  then the level would have which would have wished uh is the level from which have attend the fifteen percent production  so fifteen percent is ex-hypothesis so if you four point nine percent is with respect to the non-planned expenditure of past year  so if you  it is in a sense phenomi phenominal  figure it's not a real figure  because i think the budget says that it's sixty-two thousand crore rupees it would have reached had low corrective been applied that that refers to fiscal deficit  may i  you know i believe that the union budget for nineteen ninety-one ninety-two must be situated in the wider context of the crisis in the economy that is both acute and deep  micro economic imbalances lie at the root of this problem  the government has leaped beyond its means  it has done so by borrowing at home  the country has leaped beyond its means  it has done so by borrowing abroad  now i'm sure you would accept that neither the government nor the country can afford to leap beyond its means year after year  but these are now i am sorry i mean would you say that the kind of  pace at which the adjustment of living beyond one's means is being done fast enough  at this point of time given the crisis we have the adjustment could have been sweeped up and more substantive  the same incentive and the same one word is that as it was may not be there next year  when you two words when the finance minister present his budget  i do not agree  look any further postponement of micro-economic adjustment  which is long over due uh would make an exceedingly difficult  situation   no i'm not asking about the question i think two or three persons speaking together  no not at all uh i believe that what we have achieved in this year in terms of a credible fiscal adjustment which i hope would lead to micro-economical stabilization during the current financial year and continued fiscal consolidation thereafter is impressive  let us not think in terms of the coventional budget deficit  which is the borrowing the short term borrowing of the government from the reserve bank of india  let us look at the revenue deficit which is the difference between revenue expenditure and the revenue received to the government  or the fiscal deficit which is the difference between the revenue received and the total expenditure of the government that is met by borrowing  now what we have done this year is to reduce both the revenue deficit and the fiscal deficit not simply in absolute terms as compared to last year but in very substantial terms as a proportion of g d p  now the fiscal deficit is going to come down by two percent in point of g d p that is about twelve thousand crores   dileep that is not insubstantial that is very substantial now we are we're achieving this by two means  on one hand you have revenue received two thousand  crores of additional resource mobilization that is both progressive and non-inflationary and two thousand five hundred  crores a few words  so we come to mr loria uh let us get quick comment  dileep on what mr mukharjee said then what mr nair said and then uh no as far as the forces of adjustment having begun i certainly have no quarrel but i think this we didn't have very much choice  the second factor we need to look at in this budget is the context in which it was written in a sense  meaning we have to make sure that we confirm to certain needs of the international community which is one of the potential lenders  that needs to have confidence in india  the point that is some how seems to worry is that i worry because the political will to do change is most when the crisis is more secured  and i do think that the backdrop of the kind of manifesto that the congress had which before it came into power as you hear allowed for many of these changes  some of them are there in the industrial policy some are there in trade policy but more could have been achieved is what i feel  and if the pressure is off i worry that the pressure on the ministry on the finance ministry in a sense to do this is to be  reduced   dileep let us now speak of uh some way   where you left off that   a few words yeah okay   a summary of mr mukharjee's view is repeated in hindi  vinod let's now get the voice of uh industry and uh the professional sector  mr loria what do you think uh there are some confusing or uh  one can say not very uh encouraging signal for the corporate sector for instance the deputation has been stuck  uh for instance the cooperation tax has gone up  and then the three main fears of industry which was in both  confession which was uh the liquidity squeeze and which was inflation are still there are still hanging over industry so how do you expect industry to react to this budget ? well i will put it this way  uh i i first like to make a very brief comment on what i think of the budget i think it's one word   sure  and i it we may not be awakening to a brave new year  but we have certainly not going to awaken every year to a brand new budget  this has set the pace it has set a new path  and i think from next year onwards we will not wait for this day with bated breath 
this man was lucky  mr doraswamy who has been in captivity now for weeks of agonizing weeks  agonizing both for his family and for the nation  we still don't know when he is and if he is going to be released now terrorism itself is a form of blackmail  but holding hostages is even worse  we have here now on my immediate left mr george verghese  the distinguished journalist and mr jamanadas akhtar the distinguished writer  both happened to be members of the press council  but we have resisted the temptation of discussing george's  famous report  because george has better face his critics not his supporters  now george would you give us some of the national and international dimensions of this holding hostages  well taking of hostages has been with us for sometimes  uh throughout history hostages have been used as a means of building up pressure on authority of whatever kind  in more recent times we have seen high-jacking as taking up hostages in the air  whole groups of perfectly innocent people who are flying from one place to some other destination  and using that to ask for whatever it is left the captors wanted  around the ground as we've seen in many part of the world and in our own country uh the taking of hostages is again being used as a means to pressurise authority  to use to specific demands that are made by various  groups that take them in captivity   we've just seen the clip about the swedes who were taken hostages in kashmir and u f f to mr doraswamy  but we have the same problem in other parts of india in assam in andhra pradesh may be in punjab  and in other parts of the world in iran in lebanon and uh  elsewhere  so that this is becoming a universal phenomenon and one which  civilize nations and government and communities have to fight   it's not an easy task because it is traumatic both for the individuals and their families as well as to the governments who have to decide and for the community at large  miss akhtar with a special background of kashmir connection would you like to through some light  yes  i would like to confine myself to the problem in kashmir  i remember that in nineteen seventy-seven when i was in birmingham the kashmir liberation front leaders were there they had their headquarters  they had abducted a senior diplomat from the india  indian high commission  they wanted to get release mr makbul butt  but when the government didn't release they killed that indian diplomat  and after that makbul gutt butt  was hanged in tihar jail  the same jammu and kashmir liberation front british  news alleged major amanulla had their head quarters in muzaffarabad and also in karachi   he went he run away to america  when the government wanted to arrest him  he came back to kashmir and came back to kashmir  and pakistan  he organized a gang and he started terrorism  uh at the first uh his uh party didn't uh indulged in kidnapping  but there're other groups in kashmir  the main group is hizbul mujahideen  it is controlled by the jamait-e-islami of pakistan  and its head in pakistan is kazi hussain ahmed   this this jamait as you remember i think that in the last phase of the bangladesh government these jamait islami workers they picked up several uhm professors  doctors and others and killed them in dacca  and this jamait islami it was accused of uh hiring the services of uhm of sayed akbar who had assassinated mr liyakat ali khan  another worker of the jamait islami had assassinated dr khan sahib  and now they have uh so many workers there're so many terrorist a a armed terrorist they had uh fighting they were fighting in afghanistan  then they shifted to muzaffarabad  they are infiltrating into kashmir valley of kashmir  and mainly this this gang is responsible for kidnapping the uh intellectuals professors engineers and others you imply that our friend and neighbour is actively involved yes it is actively involved   he will not it will he will not say that he is actively or any way involved in it for instance in ninety-seven forty-seven when pakistan attacked kashmir the pakistan government said no we're  not involved in it  these are some tribals who are who has gone there to help their brothers  in sixty-five when pakistan again attacked kashmir general ayub khan said no we are not concerned with it  the people of kashmir has risen in rebellion in nineteen seventy-one they attacked again kashmir  and when general zia at uh induced or   organized a rebellion in in afghanistan he said no we're not concerned with the rebellion   we're just helping these uh uh sharnarthis  from afghanisthan   we're not giving anything uh uh arms or weapons or other anything to these uh persons  now this same group headed by that gulbadan hikmat yar  is organizing these raids   pakistan government is supplying weapons and  we know that what is going going on in karachi now jamait islami says that its workers are being kidnapped and and tortured and assassinated in karachi by their political elements   one word  are there training schools for kidnapping too do they yes they have   they they have kidnapping and training schools for kidnapping and terrorism around muzaffarabad and then in tribal area  george do you agree with this uh analysis or view  well i i'm not sure about the background and the  uh details because question of kidnapping and hostages is not confined  to kashimr as i said it's a phenomenon one finds uh in   many many places in our own country and abroad  the question is why is it done ?  it's a form of psychological warfare to build pressure  whether for political aims or for other aims  now in kashmir there are several groups  you mentioned the swedes  i think uh they were detained by particular group i am not sure whether jungbaz jungbaz the the jungbaz force   i'm not sure whether it is the same group that has uh kidnapped  jungbaz jungbaz  is it true that the groups run into hundreds now  more than one hundred  what the  more the official count is about one hundred and forty-three uhm  but here again the the problem that the authorities face  is in dealing with uh a multitude of different groups which have perhaps different sub-motivations within a larger purpose  and the question that the country has to face is whether in the kashmir or elsewhere  how does one deal with this ? does one submit ? does one give in ? or does one hold out and with what consequences ?  but it  i think this is the central issue that needs to be faced   but it  it it suits our friendly neighbour to have as many groups as possible so that you know you can't deal with anyone particular   so that no political solution is possible isn't it  ?  well  well that well that may be so uhm  but as i would say if one looks at the problem in assam  alpha or peoples war group in andhra it's a different set of circumstances there  but kidnappings yeah have been used as a prime instrument of pressure therefore it's not just kashmir and i think we need to look at this not as isolated problems kashmir or andhra or assam or anywhere else  but to try and fasten a national approach to dealing with the problem that could adopt anywhere for the variety of political  and other reasons  yeah  but you see even the former home minister's   daughter was kidnapped and there was prompt action  one criticism was that they acted propmtly because he was the home minister of the country  yes  now in the case of others it drags on as in case of dorayswamy for weeks  would you view this as a moral problem as a legal problem  as a national problem  how would you categorise this problem george ? well it's not a legal problem   it's really illegal   it's beyond the bounds of the law and and and the constitution yeah  it is a moral problem uhm and a political problem  uhm  uhm the kidnapping of the home minister the former home minister mufti uh sayeed's daughter uh rubia sayeed was perhaps the first of this latest series  and may be thinking a new government had come into being and a new chapter was opening there was some pressure on the government to release  uh to negotiate with the uh captors of this young lady and secure her release and the other view was the government should have held out  because there was strong criticism of the kidnapping of a woman  which was considered to be unislamic against any of the traditions that were being upheld uh as the course which the struggle was being waged  but for what ever reason the government gave in  i must confess that i myself for that time went along with the feeling that all right if the release is granted uh and this young hostage is released miss sayeed uh may be that's a good thing  but i think perhaps we need to think afresh because once that  is has happened it has made it more difficult for the government in successive cases to take a stand because the question immediately uh raised is well why aren't you negotiating for the release of this hostage ? is it because he or she does not have a home minister  as a father or some other very important person as a brother  and does not the life of an ordinary average person count as much ? that is the dilemma that we now face  perhaps the time has come when i think across the board we have to take a view whether it is kashmir or andhra or assam or  one word or anywhere else  whether it is a government of one complexion or another call an all party meeting to take a national view of how the nation should deal with hostages  otherwise one is going to be blackmailed all along the line everywhere by anybody  what do you think miss akhtar mansoor  two word i feel that there is no difference  between kidnapping for ransom or kidnapping for putting pressures  to get the criminals released  what happens a man murders six seven eight twenty   per persons  when he is arrested his party kidnaps any person  maybe two three four persons a professor may be a doctor may be engineer or or a high official  and they say that you release our criminal friend  otherwise we will assassinate your persons yes now this is i think this is a crime  and no government should give in  what happens when you start releasing these the  persons the kidnappers they feel that their position has become strong  george if i may express my own view life is more complex than particular formulation  yes  uh there can not be a white and black case of either you release or not release  situations will differ  circumstances will differ personalities will differ  how and in a democracy public opinion will met  well personalities will differ yes  but will principles differ ? that is the question  and i think as jamnadasji has said you are really bargaining  with criminals  take the case of mr doraswamy some people have been released  as part of the bargain uhm which was not kept by the other side according to the government   uhm  uh the kidnappers want one of their leaders i think it is uh mr shalla to be released  now according to the official version mr shalla was responsible uh for the killing earlier of uh some hostages  including prof na nashirul huque  the very distinguished vice chancellor of kashmir university  and subsiquently mr khera the general manager of the h m t plant in shrinagar  now if because of the pressure of mr doraswamy's  kidnapping a killer of two other hosteges earlier is to be released  then what is the principle involved and where is  will it end  because this will be go on from one hostage to another and the government will be made to yield all along the line and that would be unacceptable  i think you are quite right in saying there is no absolute norm  there is no black and white yeah that is true  but some governments the israeli government for instance has taken the line that they are not going to submit to any kidnapping  and let the kidnappers face the consequences of killing  their hostages  let public opinion and their own people turned against them because they too are under psychological pressure   yeah  so i think we need to take a national view otherwise i can't see this problem being uh whisked away   it's going to sail us week after week in one situation or another  what i think we need to do is that to get together all political parties to discuss this  what should be the national policy that is taken ? whether it is a congress government in andhra uh congress government in uh assam and opposition government in some other place president's rule george  assam  frankly i i one or two words any unanimity on any problem in this country  name me one problem on which the country is whole heartedly  unanimously agreed  well if it is not easy but i think if one tries to be still what are the principles ? yes are all hostages of the same ? yeah is the motivation the same ? is it political ? is it criminal ? what is the background ? can one then distill some principles on the basis which public opinion will assert itself  certainly it is one thing to negotiate  but i think negotiation is part of the process of high-jacking  of wearing down the opponent yes  get them confused  get them to contridict themselves  develop rival force and pressures in the other camp weaken their resolve  give more time to investigative forces to find out where these hostages are ? see if if they can be rescued i think that barring a two or three political parties extremist may be in punjab all other political parties will join hands and support the government if the government  wants to take some strong step   yes  george would you favour that there should not be compromise at any cost  what is your personal view ? well as i say i started out in this round ah  personally taking a view that is alright if rubia sayeed was was released   ah  i now feel perhaps that was a mistake   a mistake  because once we did that we were on the slippery slope  and it has been said by others are we not as good as  that young lady ? is it not the same blood ? does the more recent hostages not have parents relatives  friends miss akhtar what is your solution ? my solution is that the government should take strong uh uh position and should get co-operation from the opposition parties  mr sahay the difficulty is that in punjab mr verghese knows though the news have not been appeared they are not so flashed but actually there are so many cases in which the government  have has released criminals  but gentleman would it be a fair summing up  if we say that we agree that holding hostages is one of the most criminal acts   and  absolutely yes  we are agreed that there is uh a need for a national consensus on this  yes  national and international and international and also we are agreed that the political parties should meet  perhaps to that we may add that it's not enough for political parties to meet intellectuals social workers others the inter-state council so that state government brought in   uhm uhm uhm  yes brought in  but that it is not merely a government problem   it's an emotional and human problem absolutely yes and it has to be dealt with at that level  hope so  that's right would you like to add something in about a minute  i think that uh your solution is correct and uh we must support it  george ? yes  well it is uh not merely necessary to built that uh  that that consensus  but also try and understand the psychology at work  so that we can deal with it it is a form of psychological warfare yes so the nation has to be prepared to accept that  and public opinion ultimately must prevail in these matters   and that needs to be educated  than  we may perhaps end this discussion on the note that we  have fervently hope and pray that doraswamy or whoever else  or whoever is held captive probably is released  and the government doesn't really totally surrender on this matter naturally our hearts goes to mrs doraswamy and family  yes and to all others  but this is a problem that we really must confess  significantly the liberation front has also appealed for his release  i hope i mean he gets released soon on this note gentleman i thank you thank you thank you 
this is all india radio  taking sides in our national programme tonight we bring you a discussion on media attitudes in the context of privatisation of the electronic media  since only the very rich can afford these private channels will the content of their programme reflect their bias and the bias of the advertisers  the programmes be aimed only at those who can afford them  all those who run these channels be persuaded to aim them at the poor and the backward  we view the electronic media as an instrument of social and economic upliftment  in short will the social attitude and economic compulsions of the fourth estate force them as it has in the past to take sides taking part in the discussion are kuldeep nayyar the emminent  coloumnist madhu trehan executive producer news track p c chatterji former director general all india radio and b g verghese  the noted columnist who also moderates the discussion  we are discussing this evening uh social attitudes on the part of the media uh broadcast print and the other  but the very main point to start with the is the discussion that has been initiated uh rising out of the congress manifesto which suggest the need for privatisation uh broadcasting or atleast some competitive challenge through public  co-operation  will this really change broadcasting ? will the content of programmes undergo any change ? and will the viewers and listeners get something more  different from what they get now ? uh madhu what do you think ?  first first of all i think the government has to make its position clear  nothing has been clarified by the minister about what exactly they are planning to do  uh there is a lot of confusion and if this is any indication for what the new channel is going to be like i don't think there will be much opening up  first of all they have to take a de  decision on whether they are going to clear doordarshan  because if they do open up a second channel as it should be  as one one word a free channel then who would watch  doordarshan  so they have to take a very gutsy decision  we are two words doordarshan to open up a channel i don't know if any government do have the guts to do that in india today i a few words suggestion that the government channel state channel existing channel be extinguished   prasar bharati will take over that will be there will be a transformation as far as all india radio and doordarshan are concerned  and then the other will be a private or competitive channel or channels  but who will watch it ? who will watch uh doordarshan when you have a private channel to compete ? well let's ask kuldeep and then they will have to improve  actually the analysis is if doordarshan is just like what it is today nobody will switch it on  but uh if there is a private uh channel which is producing a better programme naturally doordarshan will have to  produce better or not to see it  but george i don't know my feeling is ki  this whole thing is being confused purposely  i think the government does not want to impliment any  prasar bharati bill  and the whole thing  a few words   i'm sorry i'm sorry it's a mess now  so it the whole thing has been introduced just to delay  postpone things i don't think the government is serious about giving  control of this media in the hands of independent people uh though government control still states but state government is not willing to  part ways with that kind of authority well let us presume that the idea is to go ahead  with the prasar bharati act though it's been very slow  uh in the circumstances then how should we proceed  now as a former director general of all india radio or broadcasting what would you say  well the first thing that government has to do is to invite legislation to set up its body an independent body which is going to assign frequently   it's not the government that has it in a in few countries it is an independent body that does it  the next thing is to draw up the sort of priorities that you want of the alternative programmes that you think to   of continuing  yes it is  if the only alternative that you can think of is commercial  then probably uh uhm there may be trouble but i think it's  a mistake to suppose madhu as you as i think you were making  mainly that if uh a private channel comes or a commercial channel nobody will watch doordarshan  one word or listen to all india radio  fact is that people thought that would happen to the b b c it didn't the b b c still does mm control a vast section of the audience so what's the loss  but they still do and we are still setting the standard for  for what ought to be insat doing  now the question is on what basis do we allot channels ? but the the basic question is why count and change ? what do you want broadcasting to do in terms of what it is now and what it might be ? and what is the kind of change that you would envy in terms of the new order  yes which we are thinking of uh a second channel  again in the hands of the people who are going to compete uh who are going to attract more listeners and viewers on the basis of  showing may be some films or programmes which is is really in that consumerism  now my feeling is ke the purpose is partly lost  consumerism would be end of what middle classes you say yes definitely for example the ho how do we ensure in this country that uh this vast country where the people have certain other kind of ethos  how do we appeal to them ? because if this second channel comes and it is competitive  as it should be  and if it is in the hands of some people who can afford it  then there aim would be to one word   that's right  they're not very who are going to be worried about uh you can do it do it some programmes for the uplift of the people i think they may need more than two channels  maybe third channel or may be fourth channel  some channel given to the university some ch   channel given to the people  because the purpose i have in view is of course one view is  of course entertainment one word  but other way i think is we must do something for the uplift of the people  use the tv use the whatever this medium is for uh fighting some prejudices  right like that well let's ask madhu here well i think what kind of content would you have if you were to have  this opportunity ? i think uh i disaggre with ku  kuldeep in that but i don't think there is a hard line between uh social purpose uplift of the people and entertainment  i think that had been the problem with doordarshan   that it catagorised so strictly that either it's cheap vulgar entertainment or it is boring programmes for education which is so boring that nobody in the right mind can watch  i think that what has to be done is that there has to be a merger of the two an infertainment  and up uplift of people will come from people who want to watch programmes which is so interesting that they don't know whether they are being educated and their prejudices are being broken down  things like that like uh uh the tragedy that took place in sindhu recently where lower caste people have been uh butchered and put in gunny bags  i don't think that kind of film would be possible if an emotional beautiful film was made which made the higher caste people aware of the feelings and made the the lower caste mess anonymous to them i think the large part of it is the anonimity  so i think that all this i think that just making money making revenues is looked down upon  i don't think that so i think that making re   revenue should be uh tied-up with the fact that you know that you can make money by doing things that will move people right but we hear uh you are really talking about uh news  and uh daily affairs current affairs  what about extention education other things that are not really marketable ? where would the money come from and what would it cost to put up such a channel such a network ? because there is no scope in just of the metro or the larger cities or the country as a whole and we talk of people which are these people that we are talking about ? where do they live ? what is their level of understanding ? what language do they understand ?  is it is it english or is it all our fourteen schedule languages and numerous other unscheduled and tribal languages  then don't you know that it is a major issue because what you are talking about the languages  if there is any say four or five privatisation is concerned if  they  again time and again we have dealt with this problem and   uhm and on radio i think you've you have got to do it  uhm  but you have also to be interested in going outside the framework of all india radio and and doordarshan how would you address this problem which people what caste  how do you one word  you see uh a programme to uh not very well up and what the cost would be on television but i know that there would be some thing like ten times  uh atleast ten times if not for uh for uh a one word  worth in capital and then the exenditure but take a small thing like one word radio  that is people are they are interested in each other they have common problem they come and participate they discuss their problem  then they go ahead and try to do something better  now uh i mean the question is where does the money come from ? well i think we really have to go out into the market to see where the money is and where it comes from  this opposition that people are not interested in uh a in anything but making money  uh i think it's a mistake  there are any number of trust they're running hospitals   they're doing various other things  if the said uh uh potential in radio and television  i'm sure they will come forward now you told us about look up station video or radio  even otherwise   we're talking about four five six crores  not more than that  but you know i'm talking of national hook-ups  when we're talking of hundreds of crores   kuldeep where do you think uh uh our options lie ? because broadcasting has been very much talked down in the sense  we've national broadcasting then regional broadcasting local broadcasting in the sense is yet to come the communities  now if you think of starting from the bottom then it becomes managable as you have said you have a hospital or you have a school or university people want to spend that because the career teaching is that it needs it and  it's useful  our teacher talking about current affairs talk  talking about you know since it is a very high level  then one is really talking about films that may be a of of  of uh interest to high guard people to well educated people and to very weak  otherwise we're talking to farmers simple people in their language  how would they manage this ? this is the question i'll ask to ask to kuldeep and madhu you also because this is really were the boiling butter comes in  i think the idea of a local station is a very good idea i think it's been tried abroad  uh and uh i think while madhu was commenting on my uh  vocation that i one word counter view i one word i think mr madhu was missing one side of it and that is what i want to answer  and it is take for example the mandal commission  report  how many people really explained what it meant  of course our tv picked up the stories that little boys were killed the boys were that but this look here this is wrong with the hindu society  that here is a society which has not treated human beings as human being for thousands of years  maybe this was the wrong idea to be the way it was done but was it exploited if these now stations are there  maybe these were like small kinds of uh outlets  maybe these are the places where we can drop again this thing because these are the people from below  these are the people at the grass roots and help them to overcome their prejudices kuldeep i wanted to button there if i may and also doing one or two words what madhu was speaking in a programme of that kind what is happening to people in different parts of india i think uh the important thing is not that you tell people who know about themselves but you tell others in different parts of the country that look this is how people are living in a certain part the network would be important and i think uh madhu where i very much agree with you  there is enormous interest of people in other people  we know next to nothing but so many extremely interesting groups in our country and i think television could and radio could help the broadcast but can we do that ? unless there is some kind of a right unless there is some kind of break up unless there is some vague one word nothing alse can work  in that way kuldeep is one thing that nobody can disagree with the regional station i think that is the way that that india should go because with that many languages i think it'll be crucial if we give uh local stations atleast a certain amount of  hours before the before the national hook-up   one or to words  i think we're talking about explaining to people about why something like mandal took place about the vote bank  i think that's their patronising  i think that i don't think we have to explain  i think what we have to do is to bring whatever is happening  to them and deal and and show that this is not this a channel  this is a person this is human being this is what's  happening  and i think i trust our people one word indians  wherever we live in india that they will respond that they will feel that yes this is the child who had been hurt and this is the woman that had been raped this is the man that has suffered injustice  and i think people will really respond when we when we remove the anonimity that we have of each other instead of the formality and the distances  which is something that our electronic media has done and when we see constantly you see on programmes people are fake they are artificial nobody talks like that they normally do in their life even the language is is not colloquial 
we are here to discuss the priorities of the eighth five year plan  the other day the national development council met and approved of the directional paper  uh which is preceeding the actual meeting of the eighth plan uh there used to be approach papers before every plan and as  an economist who also had a sense of humour once quipped about the fifth plan it's not the it's not the approach to the fifth plan but the fifth approach to the same plan  emphasisng the similarity that exists in all our plans  now one wonders whether it'll be different this time and to discuss such issues we're going to talk about whether the planning concept is still relevent into these world  and if so in what way is the eighth plan going to be different from the past plans  we are going to discuss i think the main thrusts of the eighth five year plan whatever they are and whatever the priority there may be  we are going to reflect on the size and the shape and the structure of the eighth plan  and finally i suppose the financing aspect where the resources are going to come uh to meet the needs of the plan  and while doing this major issues like budget deficits uh shortage of resources uh shortage of infrastructure and also the balance of payments questions all these will come up  may i first ask uh uh dr nitish singh sen gupta who is with us  other then and he is the secretary of the planning commission uh other then dr syed hashim raza who is advisor in perspective planning in the planning commission and dr uh arvind veermani uh who is advisor in the ministry of finance  uh it so happens that all of us uh are doctors here you know and as alexander pope once quipped who shall decide when doctors disagree  however let me ask uh dr nitish sen gupta whether he feel that the planning concept is still relevent today and could we think of the eighth plan as a a matter relevent to todays time and change circumstances  well at a time when all over the world there is a general uh debunking of the concept of planning we feel that  planning is very relevent  although it is another thing that any planning has to build on  the gains reached earlier by the previous plans and also draw on the development experience of declinations following different   it's way slightly different routes  in our opinion planning is very relevent although it has to  shed off a lot of the past traditions  it has to acquire new traditions and new experience empirical knowledge so as to make it uh so as to acquire a new meaning  it is relevent  what do you think uh dr hashim raza ? uh the relevence of planning in our country is to be seen in the context of two very important and major areas uh where we need to keep on the developmental phase  one is the area of human development human resources which includes the development of taking care of the health by and large  uh taking care of the education building up training  uh along with the provision of certain uh items of minimum needs fulfilling the basic essential needs of the people in general  now this is what public sector will have to take care of  particularly in a situation where large gaps still exist  in the need for the services these items public goods and  uh the provision which already exist  another important area where i think planning will be  remain relevent in our country for quite a long time is the building up of infrastructure  this include energy it includes transport infrastructure communication uh and it also includes infrastructure like you know certain essential one word variations  uh therefore in both of these two though in the later part  uh uh the eighth plan particularly welcomes the involvement of private sector wherever possible for example in energy private sector has been invited to take part ah ha  but it's par  participation in the coming next few years will only be at the margin for private sector has to learn how to come in we've  to learn  but hasn't it learnt considerably in the last forty years  uh i would like to ask dr veermani an in-view of this new trends towards privatization  uh an in-view of the fact that uh the new policies of the government in this country too uh are talking of deregulations and decontrol and handing things over considerbly to the private sector is there still some need for economic planning ? uh yes certainly  uh and i would like to add one more area uh which has been  uh not mention by dr hashim and that is the area of micro-management in some sense uh even countries which don't have uh planning in the sense that we have used this word uh still have to plan their micro-economy  and that is the area which will remain in a sense even after all these other three uh have passed the way  then now let us come to the aspect on this and i would like to ask dr sen gupta uh in what way is the eighth five year plan different from uh the past plan ? are there any innovations that are peculiar to this plan and can we talk of it as a different entity compare to the past ? eighth plan uh prof khushroo is different from the previous plans in quite a number of ways  as i said in the beginning it tries to build on the experience gained earlier  we are starting against the backdrop of very significant growth rate of five point five percent throughout the decade of the nineteen eightees and five point six percent during the seventh plan period uhm uhm  now so this on the at the same time because of our inprovidence in the recent past   we've been subject to the need for this kind of rather  uh dramatic process of adjustment in our economy   which is which makes our task somewhat difficult now this plan will seek to ma make  ta take the maximum gain out of the investment already made  it will be a plan for consolidation  it is time we give up the uh earlier race about necessarily making a plan bigger than the pa pre previous   one in terms of allocation  it is time we give up accepting let us say five hundreds schemes when you've got resources to complete uh only about hundred schemes  it is time to uh give all attention to completing project some time so as to avoid time over run and cost over run  again it is also time to give up this earlier uh uhm you know misplace priority on a number of things you know like for instance we give a lot of attention to running industry  now government has given up uh vacated a large number of areas in industry hoping that private initiative will take over uhm  then secondly uh let us say things like literacy and population control  now sixth and seventh plan we practically gave up population control  uhm  uhm uhm  now it is now understood that if only if the all the growth that has taken place in the industry services agriculture if only we have been able to control our population growth to the rate achieved by let us say china  i think how much that el how much difference that alone would have made in part of the terms  uhm then secondly so today government will concentrate on infra-structure as prof hashim mentioned mainly transport  communication agriculture irrigation  not so much on industry now except certain basic and heavy industry whose area also has been drastically reduced  uhm uhm  then we neglected social development very much  we give up a any attempt to achieve literacy  uhm now eighth plan will concentrate on achievement of literacy and universalization of primary education by the time the plan ends  and then vocationalizing scondary education  it will not give enough of direct governmental uh attention  uhm to higher education etcetera etcetera except to the extent necessary for upgrading the requirement   uhm  and there a lot will depend on uh utilizing private initiative to supplement government efforts  so many respectable governments role will be the role of  a facilitator for desirable activities  and doing tha taking direct action only in the infra-structure and only in social human development  so it appears that uh though there are important areas which planning will address uh even now  uh there are other things which have to be done by other sectors of the economy  the private sector also would have something to do with it  uh dr hashim do you fe feel  that there are innovations in this plan other than what dr sen gupta has mention uh prof khushroo i will suppliment what dr nitish sen gupta has said  by emphasising one aspect of approach to this plan  in contrast with the earlier plan is that this plan very prominently relies on the involvement of people for achieving a number of things ah ha  which earlier was thought to be achieved just by an outlet  by financial expenditure ah ha  it is very explicitly recognized in this document that it is not the financial expenditure that can achieve everything in fact in course of time expenditure has diminishing return in terms of its effectiveness in achieving target ah and therefore involvement of people which brings you to the development of rural institutions ah the proper institutions uh a phrase which was used in the second five year plan  i think is becoming much more relevent now developing institutions adequate to the needs of the people  and that will be one of the very important i feel  this plan this plan for the first time talks of indicative planning  ah  ah ha  infact in india we had a mix  mixture of indicative planning as well as direct planing of investment and targets in certain areas of public sector  uh our achivements of indicative planing can be seen in the sector of agriculture  uhm where the production is done by millions of farmers  and yet when the sixth food grain target when we decided that we have to become self-sufficient in food-grain production  we took a number of steps indirect steps by way of creating infra-structure by way way of way of a package of policies including controlling prices and of stocking  and to which we were able to achieve agricultural target  now we will be paying a little more attention to the instrument and the methods of indicative planning and in large area widen the area of indicative planning  so this will be another  now uh i notice that we have had a series of plan in this country  every plan has had a huge budget deficit  uh there has been a shortage of resources from taxation and borrowing  and therefore borrowing from abroad and particularly borrowing from the reserve bank of india has been the order of the day that has let to all kinds of uh inflationary pressures in the economy  and the story of indian planning generally is a story of inflation it also is a story of balance of payment deficit partly for the same reason that the domestic economy has been inflated and exports were not released from the domestic economy considerably  uh dr veermani uh would you say that there are some new things that there is some new thinking or some innovations in the  in the area of budget deficit management and in the area of balance of payments management in this plan  yeah let me uh uh just give couple of examples where i think of genuine effort has been made uh to take account of the resource constraint  as the popular expression is to cut your coat to to fit the cloth  uh one uh both things have been mentioned by secretary of planning  uh one is the area of social expenditure where uh the focus is on realistic and achievable targets rather than spreading the money uh too far and wide and not achieving uh specially ta   targets like literacy population control and so on  and second is in the area of infra-structure where if one may put it a little strongly uh earlier government may have had a kind of  uh dog and the manger attitude that uh they said that everything had to be done by the government and if the gap could not be closed it was postponed indefinately sometimes for decades  uh the attitude now is that if we can not do it uh let us uh have the private sector do it so that the goals are achieved  uh so this is basically is a reflection for this attempt  uh to take account of this resource constraints  uh i would like to add one kind of word of caution in a sense  uh because there are still assumptions uh in the plan that public savings uh the adverse tre trends  which have marked the the short decade would in a sense be reversed and the public saving performance would be improved  i think that is critical uh to the plan and perhaps later on we can discuss in what ways that may be achieved  thank you very much now i would like to come to the area of the main thrust of the eighth five year plan  what are the sectors which are being regarded as the priority sectors ? what are the areas of achievements which are being uh regarded as uh thrust areas ? if you were to order priorities what would be the list of these your priorities dr sen gupta ? i will give this priorities but they would not necessarily be  in terms of one two three and four yeah now agriculture for instance the idea is to carry the  green revolution from the north of india where it has been very much uh manifest to those areas parts of the country where it has not reach reached before  and secondly to use agriculture to build up exportable surplus the plan assumes that indian agriculture has tremendous capacity and elasticity about uh to create providing a surplus which can be used to meet the requirement of other parts of the world and also to keep us a valuable balance of payments support  then population i've already elaborated on the importance but the idea is that the crude birth rate should be brought down from thirty point four per thousand till to about twenty point uh six by the end of the uh seventh five year plan and the growth rate of population will automatically come down from uh two point one percent which it is at present to about one point eight percent  we still have to go to achieve the rate which china has achieved and you can see what how china has progressed in terms of economic development  then poverty alleviation in general especially by concentrating on the rural areas and on the urban property   poverty  and then employment the plan promises to create ten million jobs a year  and hoping that uh by that by the end of the century with all the problems of all the problems of education all that we'll be able to largely solve the unemployment problem  then literacy  literacy because that is very important and we propose to uh achieve full literacy by the end of this century  by concentrative attention  then coming to infra-structure well roads have to be given importance communication has to be given importance and irrigation has to be given importance and energy  but irrigation again there is a kind of idea to switch on from  the earlier exessive concentration on big project  recovering a lo involving a long gestation uh period and a lot of resources on to medium and smaller size  irrigation projects which can be applied very sort of operative  implimentated march more quickly  so uh and then uh of course irri uh energy of course is very important because if we cannot uh have proper electricity of the one word proper mix of hydel and thermal practically all development will come to a stop  but there the problem of resources come in dr sen gupta i i did feel that bringing the the ambition and the aim of bringing the growth rate of popula no not the growth rate   the the the the fertility rate or the birth rate of population from thirty per thousand to twenty per thousand within a five year period is a is a i think a pipe dream really 
there are ten days to go and then we will witness the elections in punjab which perhaps are going to be the most difficult  ever held in this country   it's not known how many people will or will feel free to come and participate in them  uh what kind of uh state of disturbance there might or might not be  and therefore what kind of value should one attach to this exercise ? what does it hold in in the in terms of the future of punjab ? these are some of the questions which uh i'm going to explore this evening with a group of very experienced observers of the scene  on my immediate left is mr prem bhatia chief editor of the  tribune at on time  khuswant singh probably the best known non-political punjabi i would say laughter  and mr girilal jain formerly chief editor of the   times of india  i know it's a difficult question to answer  we can only guess  but let me invite your best guess estimate  on first of all the very crucial question do you think that uh  it will be an election which will hold meaning in the sense that a substantial proportion of people will come forward to participate in them  ? and i mean i think thereafter it would be necessary for us to look into the question what is it that can be done between now and the day of polling which would possibly improves the chances of a higher voter turn-out ? prem would you like to have the first shot at it ? well the reaction public reaction at the moment  and that is fairly good criterion of uh making an assessment the public reaction is a mixture of despair cynicism  and some hope  i i i'll suggest let's go into the reasons later but give your short answers first put your uh what shall you say your guess on the table  when we'll explore it the guess about the future  about the participation level punjab has been known for a very high percentage of voting in the past  never less than sixty percent  yeah sixty-seven  never less than sixty at the worst of times  ah  well i would be a great optimistic if i would say sixty percent are going to turn-out  my own guess would be closer to thirty  and i think we'll be lucky if we get thirty percent  ah ha  well my ques answer won't be as brief because i've just been looking at the   i'll i give you a second by to the  one word later  to record  yeah  what's your pretty guess i you know it's not as easy as that i i as prem said that uh punjab has a uh a very good record of large turn-out yes  uh the lowest has been sixty seventy percent when a boycott has been called in the past  uh this time i'm not sure the boycott is being called again  but i i the general impression as i've seen is that if  the polling is above sixty percent it will be regarded as a success if it is between forty to fifty percent it's a draw  and if it is under forty percent then the boycotters will have that uh  would you would you have a little range in mind  do you do you think how far   how far up and how far down it should be ? i i think you be don't wish to make one or two words   would not like to make a guess  giri would you speak what you make out if it is one-third uhm if it is around thirty-five percent yes i would regard it as a success   even   uhm   yes   would you would you expect thirty-five percent  ? do you think it will be ? i don't think it will be  it would be closer to thirty than to thirty-five in my opinion perhaps very precise guess somewhere between thirty and thirty-five is really making it very precise  i want to address uh one question to you in this very question our level of participation you know the assam election where the percentage of voter turn-out much lower four percent yeah to be exact  much lower   yeah  people have been saying uh what is the use of an election like that  whatever the voter turn-out actually may happen to be  i think it would be a mistake to overlook the fact that this voter turn-out would have occured inspite of the extensive fear of violence  in assam there was no such fear at all  a j p had not held out any threat  but people were not inclined to vote  they were not with the election and therefore the four percent voter turn- out was a clear indication of what their political opinion was  in the present case i would say that the low turn-out or not in my view be regarded as a rejection of the political process because there would be an element in it of fear of voting rather than a  an aversion to vote  would you agree on that assessment of the political weight of whatever the figure might turn-out to be i think it's suppose fear of voting  they don't want to be killed maimed for life  and the other things is i think there is i said earlier a touch of cynicism  what will happen people say now supposing an elec  an election takes place  uh attempts were made to form a government  where is it going to lead us ? what would the government pe people  think in those terms  and therefore as i said this element of despair the voter  potential voter is not sure whether this election is going to lead anywhere  that is the dominant mood today yeah but uh votes have not on the other hand become  if people were to free to vote  vote for that itself become a reason  while they would go out to vote to make sure that it does lead somewhere that it doesn't lead the electoral process and therefore the future of punjab hanging  if on the other hand it were cynicism without the enforcement of a boycott by fear then it would be a different picture kushwant ? well i think there is one thing which complicates the situation the punjab in which i think you must bear in mind because the problem of the punjab in very roughly put is the problem of the sikhs  and i think it's more important to bear in mind what proportion of sikh electorate go to the poll   what voters go  and the the may simple way of looking at it is the urban and the rural voting for the sikh is largely rural the hindu is largely urban uh and the there is no doubt that in cities ludhiana  jalandhar amritsar there is likely to be larger turn- out  because the hindu presence is there much larger  than probably we uh smaller turn-out in the rural   ar areas   rural areas  and uh we should watch and analyse that mood  to find out whether there is any substance whether the so called grievances of the sikhs which the akali's have been talking about the terrorist have been talking about  whether they've really gone down to the people themselves   one or two word uh since you are willing to speculate  i am glad you do  would you say that the greater disincentive to voter participation among the sikhs would you say that the greater disincentive is going to be cynicism disinterest or fear  well i expect it would be a combination of the three and i think the the situation will vary from area to area  uh you take the three old traditional divisions of the punjab  maza malwa and doab the largest group is in malwa where i think the turn-out will be there all because one or two words it's a prosperous area as a green belt uh area and we already had people like uh amandar singh being elected  one or two words  yeah yeah  and of course where the terrorist are more active the maza gu gurdaspur amritsar  kapurthala in the doab area uh there the turn-out will inevitably be less because the fear of the terrorist is much more there  giri uh since you came down to a very precise prediction  let's assume for the sake of argument that something like thirty percent plus voter turn-out takes place  taking into account that the voter turn-out is only thirty percent  taking into account if khuswant's fear turn-out fears turn out to be true that the voter turn out among the sikhs may be lower and only the total may be thirty percent  what you think should be the attitude of uh the rest of the country or government of india you might say ? to a government that would be formed as a result of that election would you regard it as a legitimate government ? you see this is this election   is an act of desperation uhm  the government of india has decided to go in for elections  because nothing else has worked  yes  the government of india knows that the law under situation is far from what it should be for elections to be held properly  we all know it  it is also obvious that the threat is much more acute in  dispersed rural areas than in large cities  yeah   it's much easier to protect people in cities than in rural areas  so the fear element will be much stronger in the countryside  than in the larger urban centres  the hindu-sikh problem is a fact which can not be disregarded  and if the sikh turn out i mean sikhs are concentrated in the rural areas and if their turn-out is smaller than in the cities  than to that election to that extent the election result will be  not so helpful  but there is no option now there is no option and  and the government that result from it should be regarded as legitimate  alright only i would add one thing that if the  that that government must be very sensitive to the reality of the situation in punjab  sure  i i want to suggest one yardstick for guessing  how much of the voter abstention is on account of fear ? and how much on account of aversion ? the very fact that there are threats being held out that  if you vote we'll kill you indicates that in the minds of those who are holding out the threats there is a recognition that in the absence of the threat people will vote  that it is not so if if they were convinced that people are so cynical that they will not go to vote any how it would not be necessary to prevent them with threats and i go back to the example of the a j p in assam  a j p held out no such threat of the kind   it's position was known that we do not like these elections they are not fair elections and we will boycott them  there after they left it to the judgement of the people because they knew that the people were with them  is it not the case than prem that the element of fear is the predominant deterrent and not either cynisism or uncertainity about what the elections will produce  uh i don't know whether if one can measure it in precise terms  but uh i would i would like to say that another element which comes from uh the present attitude that belong to the present attitude is one of sulk  uhm now i don't think that the population at large the sikhs  i mean you have put your finger on the pulse of the uh the temper of the state  among the sikhs even among the sikhs this sulking element  is not as large among the masses as among the leaders  the sikh population is not sulking  they are unhappy they are cynical to the extent that they don't think much is going to come out of it  but i think down in their hearts they think it's  worth trying  they are fed up with the negative state of things  and uh they don't go into the technicalities of uh  elections like you i do  but there is uh heaven's sake get us out of this mess yeah  and if this is the only way alright we would like to vote there is the element of fear  but then i think some of them turn back and say well what than is going to come out of it  so there are these two conflicts uh i as pran told at the last election we had the same threats   yeah and yet the turn out was over fifty-seven few words   yeah   yeah i think first of all  which last election ? both the parliamentary and the assembly yeah there was a large turn-out   one or two words   eighty-five eighty-nine both of them  eighty-five eighty-nine  they defied the threats just went to vote  no no i have eighty-nine parliamentary elections uhm and the uh eighty-five uh uh assembly election  uhm  at eighty-five the voters turn-out  at eighty-five it isn't but eighty-nine parliamentary elections  uhm the voter turn-out was sixty to present plus  uhm  i never do sixty-two point seven in nineteen eighty-nine you had the parliamentary in the assembly sixty-seven point five that was in eighty-five   that's right and it's never been   really al   are you are you   would you would you say that the same kind of eagerness to vote would surface if there was not the fear of the gun ? i somehow think that we are exaggerating the fear of the gun if they have done voted in the past uhm despite a fear of the gun   uhm  a bigger element is a kind of indifference it makes you know whether if this fellow gets or that fellow gets and we'll  get nothing out of them  uh and i think you have to also if there is a sort of disillusionment with the government there is probably a bigger disillusionment with the akali factions  yeah  and whether the akali's called for a boycott or not it doesn't matter  uh people are would i have got thoroughly fed up of there  in infighting and factionalism and therefore i have been different whether akali  this wins or akali that wins 
 india's too graphic population growth is like a subterranian under current  too many of the tensions that are surfacing in indian society today but not a chronic ailment that one learns to live with  the issue has ceased to be upfront in the national debate  and in fact because unless this is addressed uh much else that we do for our developmental efforts does not justify  uh welcome break therefore in today's  focus in the wake of the world population day  that brings together three veterans of the population game  into the studio for a discussion with us  uh we have here today dr karan singh who lead the indian delegation at the first world population conference in nineteen seventy-four  and gave the world the major of those one word development is the best contraceptive  although now i believe he is on record saying that contraception is a best form of develpoment but i'm sure you will hear more about that from him later  then there is dr bose a jawaharlal nehru fellow and an evergreen of commentator of the population in many other issues  and finally dr mathur who is the bureaucrat in the hot seat as a secretary with the department of family welfare  but first before we turn the floor over for a free  participation of everybody for a discussion on this issue for the last one year now a population policy has been on the anvil  the eighth plan which has been approved in may has given  priority to the population issue  but at the same time while giving priority it has  down-scaled birth rate target even though one positive scene in all this dismal scenario has been that of late birth rates are dropping  but the eighth plan has scaled down to birth rate of only twenty-six for the year nineteen ninety seven  why is this happening ? or perhaps i should stop at this point and ask dr karan singh who has spearheaded this programme with very critical  point in the programme  to give his comment on uh where we are ? and where do you think we are going where you see we can go ? well the uh theme we are about discussion  to discuss is uh population: whithered india  and i have uh two word response to that two word question  and the response is towards disaster  because uh what has happened in the last forty year   years uh the increase of five hundred million people  the population of india from the nineteen fifty-one to the nineteen ninety-one census is something which is absolutely staggering it has diluted to a very large extent the considerable uh economic development that took place  as a result of which we are going into the twenty-first century  with more people below the poverty line then when we became free in nineteen forty-seven  more people not a larger proportion of the population but in absolute term more people  our cities are exploding into slums they are like cancer growth eating into the countryside  uh the whole social structure and fabric is beginning to collapse  under the sheer pressure of number  there is urbanization there is deforestation there is uh  defoliation the environment is being destroyed  and i would say that we are in a disastrous situation  now what can be done about it ? i was very surprise to hear you say that uh a  the population policy is on the anvil  we must have a very hot anvil you know because in nineteen hundred and seventy-six i presented a national population policy to parliament which was accepted now that is sixteen years ago  if the anvil is still growing i think we should let the representatives of the government of india enlighten us that what exactly has happen happened  mr mathur right would you tell us why is it that it is necessary to tell the working on the population policy ? but also i would like you to comment on what is would you think feasible to be done in the near future within this decade ? and what are the strategies that you are forging and are you getting the support if you think you need ? well while i entirely agree with dr karan singh that it's  a disastrous uh situation  but whither india well whether we can save the disaster or not would depend what we do in the next ten years  and therefore we have very uh manfully taken the challenge  uh should say atleast in the de our department  to see how what we can do about it and in the last one year first of all we've made  uh concerted efforts  now again focus attention on the population problem through very close interaction between india's one word we have been i think uh instrumental in uh increasing the awareness about the whole problem we are finding a lot of interest now in ordinary people also to participate in the whole thing  then we have projected at least don't create  family welfare programme with the population control programme  when population control is a much larger concept  family welfare of course is a key aspect of it  for population control is dependent on female literacy  education rural devepolment uh age of marriage of girls  so for that you must have a micro-level coordinated policy  now i'm very glad that there was a policy as dr karan singh has had mentioned earlier a national population policy  but that all had to be uh made into implementation plan and there had to be a uh micro-level mechanism also to have a co-ordinated implementation action  now because of that now the n d c has appointed a committee of  n n d c on population which is going into the whole question on micro-level co-ordination  and as far as the a family welfare factor is concerned we have prepared a very result oriented and purpose one word plan  giving emphasis or improving of the quality or the self  family welfare services the health services constant one word  attention of the urban slums dr karan singh has spoke spoken about  improving the quality of contraceptive introducing new contraceptive  social marketing better information communication education  na uh ta strategies ivolvement of people n g o what specific measure that improve endeavoury of services which is your one or two words   that maternal  uh well you see on that a lot of it is going to be the advent state of input  and training will play a key role  now we have through very close interaction with the state government particularly the state government from these four mega states of north u p bihar madhya pradesh rajasthan and to an extent orissa and uh assam where the problem is uh aggrieving  we have brought home the need for improving the delivering system so we are having certain special projects one word  infrastructure great emphasis being made lead on the uh training programme filling up of portio these are the nitty gritty details of good administration which makes all the difference  and then of course we're having very close monitoring what they do ? yes greater enthusiasm  and then we have got this what you called uh ninety district strategy that is focussing on the ninety worst state of which eighty-three are in the four state  so i have a  one word taken up already  well the beginning have been made we are awaiting uh the micro-plan from the individual district  because we do not want to impose anything from above  so we have told the state government please involve your local people your collector your uh chief medical officer   and they from the local condition send us micro-plan which would indicate their special support is required from the center  so that uh the democracy profile improves in those states  and then of course i i was mentioning a very great emphasis  on maternal and child health area you see  we are just about to launch a very important  child survival and safe motherhood project which uh through an integrated have been to mention for child survival and for promotion of safe motherhood practices  it reduce infant mortality child mortality and maternal mortality  and people will then appreciate that uh if you   your their children are going to survive they need not have launched up  ashish i'm wondering what you have to say on all this i can al al almost see you it looks coining a new acronym no no right now  no no  i will make two brief comments at the outset  first what dr karan singh's relation to the national population policy  i think it is too late in the day now as nineteen ninety-two to  think of again formulating a national population policy  i've just done a preliminary analysis of the nineteen ninety-one census data  and one thing which emerges gre is a great diversity of india  and you can't put all these states and districts in one package  and therefore the national population policy tends to be a set of platitudes  and it has very little operational value  in any case we've miss the bus we should have done it right in the first five year plan  now dr karan singh the only snag uh you would forgive me for saying that only snag about the national population policy formulated by him  well this was emergency and it became highly unpopular  because there was one permissive clause  i don't remember the particular section or the dialogue  which saying that some state government wants to introduce compulsory sterilization then we do so  if they have the way they've resolve and that landed  the government in very serious trouble  and as you know the very next year the janata government withdrew that policy  the only thing common in their next year's policy was  this fielding of the electorate the parliamentary assembly seat in nineteen seventy-one upto two thousand one that is a very good step i suppose that in fact there was very serious severe setbacks to the a few words   a few words  so let's not get back into history the thing is as we are now if we are still waiting even after formulating the eighth five year plan for a national population policy  then i think we are lost  and we're heading towards disaster as he say  and it is time that we forget this sort of a generalizing  and comes out to grasp that another plan of action  now which brings me my second point  now there if i mentioned so my differenc to the ministry's  plan of action is those ninety districts which you have identified  they are truely backward  in fact in my analysis on nineteen ninety-one census i get one hundred and fifteen districts  any other noble mind you told me that you can also change uh  dedicated the act to that resolve  that's not my point my point is if you put more money on familiy palanning in those districts you will not succeed because there the birth rates are high precisely because infra-structure is not there  the roads are not there  these hospitals are not functioning sub-centre's are not fuctioning staff is not there  yeah  and there are number of other social indicators are in here backward whether it being marriage whether it is child labour whether it is  all the other one or two words  yeah therefore i would say high maternal mortality that you should not spread the butterfield  you should not waste your resources family planning's  limited resources on giving a backup in those districts where the infra-structure has to be laid first  so in my scheme of things in my my  strategy which i'm going to formulate shortly i would support the thickly populated densely populated advanced districts  we should give the lead to the country  for example the urban birth rate must be drastically cut down   i i it's a shame that  in the urban areas the birth rate is so very high  one of the reason of course is the large slum population to which dr karan singh referred  so but uh the strategy of putting your money in a backward districts for family planning back-up i really have reserves  but uh  but why you have a valid point about doing something about the urban slums definitely need the full pace  but seventy-five percent of india is in still in the rural areas and within that seventy-five percent of those really needing the services now are identified to be those that are religious with relation to two thousand population yes more settlement there is uh settlement yes yes that makes the task more difficult   so  so therefore the ninety district strategy either a few words we can have little discussion on this actually what you feel is that the two things are not mutually extreme yeah  we are focussing on urban slums  we realize that these are also neglected area and when you if you strengthen the infrastructure you put a little bit push you can have the results  so city by city we are making a plan to how to strengthen the infrastructure we have taken four cities including delhi calcutta  hyderabad and bangalore in the first phase  other uh municipal commissioners and the state  government's have been asked to have their own plans because you see unless the local authorities are involve in the planning process then they don't own the fact  and then we get a totally inattitude uh idea of what is to be done so we are awaiting that and i and yes will  definitely we will cover all the ninety cities in the first phase but ninety district uh strategies we have to go along otherwise those districts will be far behind  i'll come back on the ninety districts  one or two words can i say something one or two things i would like to say of this firstly uh if you are going to wait for micro-plans to be need and come up to you before you formulate your new policy  that reminds me of the famous verse by galib hum ne mana ke tagaful na karoge lekin khak ho jayenge hum tum ko khabar hone tak  by the time you uh you develop your laughter one or two words you will see these micro- plan you know the country is already uh uh virtually drowning in an ocean of of   of people so my submission would be that there must be a sense of urgency about it  and i do agree that having been in exile for fourteen years like shri ram from nineteen seventy-seven till nineteen ninety-one fourteen years family planning was in exile laughter  it became a dirty word they even change the name of the ministry  and mind you the alibis i've been two words i don't want to get into controversy  but just because in one of the eighteen paragraph there was a mention an enabling mention of the possibility of some state passing  laws which were never pass that is not an alibi for having dished the entire population policy which included uh contraceptive technology is included female literacy it included a lot of worthwhile including you increase the age of marriage 
a few weeks ago we didn't know about plague  now it's here  we don't know whether it's here to stay or going to vanish  what i learnt and most of us here today learnt that this was eradicated in nineteen fifty-six but it has resurfaced after twenty-eight years   most of most people of my generation today think that it had just occured way back in  at the end of the last century and over twelve point five million people had died  but now it is again here there is total confusion  it's spreading  there is panic   we've a panel of eminent doctors here today to discuss the cause and the cure to know whether it is going to stay or be controlled  now let me introduce the panel to you  to the extreme left is dr b chakravarty  he is medical suprintendent of the safdar jung hospital here  next to him is dr ashok rattan from the all india institute of medical sciences and just next to me is dr k k dutta director of the national institute of communicable diseases  now we'll like to know from dr dutta that  this disease we everybody thought that it has been eradicated how it has come back ? actually plague is is known to be associated uh with uh epidemic not only epidemic two word so the plague means epidemic plague means one word  it is not true that uh we've been able to eradicate plague  uh though the last human case of plague is in nineteen  in india is nineteen fifty-six  but what we've told that you know after nineteen fifty-six we we don't have a evidence i mean confirmed evidence of human plague but we've uh the evidence of uh rodent inflicting disease  to know that the rats were a few words  now one of the importance one word which covered safety  in andhra pradesh tamil nadu and karnataka a few words  because two words see adjoining areas anymore  another important focus is maharashtra another one word  himachal pradesh  you know we had focus site in in madhya pradesh uhm uhm and some other areas  but basically a few words is existing in india  it continues to live in india  and plague is known to come inside  and how what is the e one word period what is there you know it could be in decade it could be few years  and nobody knows exactly  and not only it resurfaced in india it has resurfaced in many other countries also  as i'm one word even in nineteen ninety-two was this organisation has reported plague human plague from nine countries so is it here to stay now ?  what do you what do the n i c   say ?  i'll not say that it is going to stay because the human plague uh would be definitely brought under control  and uh once the human plague is in district occurred  it was sympton that there is a need for a continous monitoring of the situation  we know that we've uh a plague surveillance in the national institute of communicable disease at bangalore which insisted there is some violence i don't know if they control measure for plague in the in the adjoining cities  we had another even if they uh uhm i mean uhm i a few words  one unit was working in maharashtra  uh but as that ceased to function after nineteen eighty-seven  though uh from the national institute of communicable disease we can see the focal point for uh plague uh monitoring   we've warned actually we've told them that the that the plague control is continue to policy of the power in india  it was also recomended the last uh inter-state co-ordination committee meeting which was held in nineteen ninety-three i strongly remember sell when it was sell that the plague  contrareversal contra repulsion of the a few words because if you said a few words we do not know what is happening in the  in the one word  because uh we don't have any picture uh uh what is happening uh but did we know that uh it has it can occur in india ? yes because the plague is known to occur in cycle  as we've been no because you see when we first heard from date that was on september fourteenth and four plague cases were detected in beed  it was dismissed  in the respective states government said it is not  even n i c d said there was nothing  and all of a sudden some four five days later we heard from surat that people are dying there  people are running away   that's not true  that's not one word communicable disease actually confirmed to the the organisation of plague in beed  actually the the first uh the the reported thing of of the clinical one word which occurred in one word that was on twenty-sixth of august  then they've you know the delegates of this planning of beed district then they approached the local medical college they came they saw even most of the doctors have not seen a case of plague  they saw the cases they collected some critical material a few words  they collected uh some rat also which was sent to the haffkin institute  and and the local medical college they declared it's  not a case of plague  but thesis continue to to uh to occur  and not only that the rat fall also continued to occur  then uh uhm they asked our help then they actually i got a telephonic message from from uhm uhm from joined director of two words on second of september that uh they want uh one assistant in where in understanding the problem and that they detected as early as september  so second september immedietly i requested them you send the  some of sample which you've collected they suspected four cases  they collected four set of samples and has been uh uh how did that one word  so that i kept the two words  we told them that the uh it is uh you send uh  we informed them that there is positive for plague on sixth  and immediately they started distributing the contraband  but in the beed one word what has happened they took very good anti-plague measure then uh then one word exchange house to house salvage so the situation was coming under control  but unfortunately there is something you know which occured you know first confirmation it came to us it was on twentieth of september  we've some couple of cases and i excuse me dr dutta yeah  can i ask you one question yeah  have you has the frequent relation with an earthquake  because it has occured about the earthquake  can you explain it whe whe whether   it has one or two words  actually you know when the last earthquake when this earthquake occured in latur our investigative team that's not it was only one team our team went there we can held the one word  and we made the a a forecast that forecast in the sense that we told them that because this particular their case is is unknown of one word focal there may be focal one word there idea struck like focus was there and now because of the earthquake because of echo disturbence that've occured this one word will start migrating in different directions  so keep a watch on this and i would we'll not be surprised that we gain certainly but that is not there is rodant uh uh plague and infections how could in few word domestic area and human being affected we made them  not only we told them in our report we also published in in the science section   accha  should i try to put it in one word   yeah doctor  see uhm plague is a disease of the rodant  and it is transmitted from rodant to another rodant through fleece  man is not required for it's transmission  and uh in the world you would find that fossil of plague are present uh in america and they are present in u s s r and they are present in other country  and uh it's also present in india so it's there that man is not required for the transmission   it's uh a disease of the rodant which is carried from one rodant to another rodant through the fleece and it's  been there are some disturbances when they fell over it's like uh the milk boiling over that the plague infects a man  to aap ke kahne ka matlab hai ke matlab jo khet ka chuha hai woh usse phailta hai it's not ke aadmi aadmi se plague phailta hai  what is it that we talk about bubonic plague ? so that's what i would like to tell about the  one or two words  yeah dr rattan so what dr has told about is very correct  it is basically a disease of rodant  man is an incidental bit  but suppose a variety of well uh this uh disease have all other one word a plague suppose a bubonic type of plague where the all the plague has occured uh which is uh  develop one word uh there is a fact it has larva  and it has develop demand at this time man can one word into the one word because by near about the drop in infection becomes rather sick so the bacteria are being stored as a support which it nearly get it is the beginning  matlab matlab aapke kahne ka matlab hai ke agar chuhe ke hi state se jo ke khet ka chuha hai aam chuha nahi  agar usi ke state se use rok diya jaye to  what we're facing today the bubonic plague which is the  worst among the three plagues we hear about  can can we prevent it ? yeah you see what happens is that from uh from the rodant  wild rodant they travel to liven rodant  rodant which are nearer to domestic  so as uh dr dutta was mentioning about one word plate   one word plate is in the wild uh from the wild to liven rodant which come in contact with human being domestic rodant gets infection  and from domestic rodant we get infection  once it starts it could stop only at debonic plague  that means we would in the envinal region there are swelling or in the one word they are swelling  and uh it stops there in ninety percent of cases  in about five to ten percent of cases it goes on to the blood so it becomes ceptic in it's one word  while only in about five percent of cases it becomes neumonic it goes to the lungs  then it is infectious to man  then it becomes a very dangerous plague and it is infectious from man to man  matlab jab chuha khe khet wale se aam chuhe ko hota hai aam chuha jo kat ta hai ya use jo fleece jo safed hote hai woh jo kat te hain nabbe pratishat cases mei woh niche wale hisse mei rah jate hai aur agar woh paanch pratishat uske baad agar woh chadta hai khoon mei ajata hai aur baki jo worst cases hai jo  neumonic plague hum kahte hain jo aaj kal dilli mei bhi hai jaise  cases jo do huve hain kuch cases main woh  lungs mei chala jata hai aur hum thook se matlab baatcheet karne mei ya usme phailta hai woh   a few words i would just tell   a few words  before we go into that we'll observe how was the clinical presentation of yeah doctor how does it produce  that's very important thing   yeah doctor  so that will we've to do one word as he has already told that uh actually it is it is this fleece which bites a rodant and that in this fleece have got the one or two word  out what and what to do a few words  so that when they'll bite they were when lies on the  uh ground or while walking in the leg area  so it was dependent area  so it is found that cough if fleece bite from there it infection grows and the one word period is there if there were two two one word  okay  if there're two two cases so the base uh whenever the first thing that this fleece sort of one word   and other thing and they doesn't doesn't divide your one word  group what is the is do you come to know when the fleece bites you  ?  it's well it's not very much noticed about it because it is uh it goes unnoticed  and uh one word three types of presentation we'll  find about it the neumonic neumonic one word but generally when the first of the rodant it comes with a fleece of band  generally it comes with the neumonic type of because whenever it it is bi biting and then by one word emphatic and the the lean note which is  leaning drip note that gives you even by the delayed they gone  lean note gone in the sense uhm uhm while we've  the a few words regular affected   uhm uhm  any worst one word so this is the way and the patient generally feels disordered belly hence within very short time within twenty-four hours he feels pain and the gland is swollen  enlarge and he becomes excruciating painful about it with all sign  about improvision and other signs also particularly one word  other things around it  what what are the other symptons through which a common can come to know of it because generally it's the it's a fever which  one word fever is very high rate of temperature and the patient becomes an extremly frustrated and one word and often there is a  one or two word dead i'm telling of neumonic death   one word becomes very tender acuted this much so that he doesn't want to move to a and this whole area about the gland is inflate red  and there is vegetal harmones also some sort of uh a few words 
so the the the movement in the new situation has to concentrate or adjust itself to many of this  uh issues or problem quite right  rasgotraji one uh issue i would like to raise which is that as a concept non-alignment is perhaps uh forty years old  if you takes take its birth with the famous speech of jawaharlal nehru in parliament nineteen forty-six nineteen forty-six  but as a movement it is uh thirty thirty-one years old now despite the fact that uh it has had criticism from all quarters that you are mentioning  there were critics even during the two words  would you say that in the present situation the concept is still valid ? that uh that is number one  number two has the non-align movement if it opens a  balance of say performance or achievement and i think do you think the ledger uh shows more credit or discredits  has it you got anything to be satisfied about in terms of the fact that it define for itself a certain agenda ? has it fulfilled at least any element of post agenda or some elements of those agenda ?  let's take the concept first  yes  i think the foreign policy uh the whole idea of  country having foreign policies have been evolving four thousand years let us say for a long time  originally the concept that controlled or conditioned the uh framing of foreign policy and its one word was the doctrine of the supremacy of power  take up your neighbour and the next and the next  so you are a dominant power might is right  then came a more uh rational concept in a world  which had many more state impending on one another  and this concept grew in the italian city-states of the medieval age  uh the back concept is balance of power but basically that was also very much rooted in the use of power now in nineteen forty-seven with the independance of india a whole new world emerged  and in the fiftees and the sixtees some hundred new countries joined the global panorama  and this called for the definition of a new concept  of our foreign policy and the conduct of foreign policies in the country that is india's contribution uh to the the evolution of the concept  now this i think is a very permanent sort of contribution to the whole idea what a foreign policy is ? how it should be conducted ? and so on and so forth  therefore this is something which is not going to become irrelevant  for a very very very long time  those earlier concepts have not become irrelevent today  the idea is to make them irrelevent  what is non-aligned uh concept basically they forget the name   it's a policy of peace independance co-operation among nations  i think these three concepts are redundant  now these are concepts which are not likely to become irrelevent to come to the second point uhm about the uh record or the ledger of this movement  look at the initial agenda uh of the movement  it was decolonization uh disarmament uh the disbandment of apartheid racialism  all those most of those items have been acomplished and i think in their accomplishment in decolonization for example  in dismantling of apartheid even in generating pressure for the  beginning of disarmament nuclear disarmament  non-alignment non-aligned movement has played a very very significant role which will be part of human history  now times have changed  mind you times have changed in a very limited sense i think it's wrong to take that there are no alliances today nato still exists   it's in search of a new role  what happened in the gulf recently is a good indicator uh for us to bear in mind  and it's the role of the non-align movement  while the last alliance block persist to oppose the concept of law  it is not uh the role of newly independent country uh to become a camp follower of one block because one block remains and the other has disappeared  and certainly for india that's not the role i visualised  well uh whatever scepticism about the movement is there it is mostly in non-official uh sources or quarters because governments which are subscribed to non-aligned concept and one word and movement are still committed to it  and this perhaps explains one reason  the reason why those movement started with only twenty-five members in belgrade  it is not as many as hundred and two or hundred and three members and more and more are at least want to come in either as guests or as obeservers or something so mani there must be something in the movement to attract them a and b they would also perhaps want to find out and assert  what non-align movement is going to do ? in which area is it is it going to operate ? because the areas of uh imperialism anti-imperialsim  anti-colonialism anti-racism all that  theatre is no more a rationing exhausted into it in what is a new theatre in which non-align movement can operate  one or two words  viswam scepticism yes is largely spoiled by ignorance and by destructiveness  and when you say use that rather gentle word non-official  we know that it's mostly people who have not spent time understanding the main spirits of not only indian foreign policy but the foreign policy of a hundred newly independent counrty  who would wonder whether non-alignment merely is a simplistic equation with not being involved in a world which is being divided up  into rival military camps  when you ask what is the new role of non-alignment ? i would prefer to take mr rasgotra's phrase and think what is the role of non-alignment in the new international context rather than seek a new role for non-align movement because the fundamental battle of non-align movement is against the quest for dominance  we shall alienate international relation for almost all of human history  the only reason i'm not able to say for all the human history is that ever since jawaharlal nehru became a major player on the international field and brought to bear on international relation  the better values that has been evolved by mahatma gandhi in the freedom movement there a new concept was thrown upon the chess board of international politics  that new chess board being that in the new uh concept being  that instead of the quest for dominance could there be a quest for co-operation  is it possible for countries which are uneq   unequal in their economic political or military endowments  to have a relationship of equality between themselves where we strive to attain a one word optimum a one word optimum being one where neither  that no one is better off by being at a different point of the equiliberium and everyone is better off by being attract particular point  yes  well in other words i mean what what  you're saying is inequality inequality still persist and yeah in order to remove those inequality  a few words   yes   that's right that's what i one or two words i want to revert if i may just for a second to what i opened with  so long as inequality persists non-alignment is required so long as oppression is there non-alignment is required and so long as equal respect is not accorded that the sovereignity of every single nation that long will non-alignment  one or two words   yes professor mishra  right right i was saying that uh one of the main reasons for misunderstanding in so far as the role and relevence of non-alignment is concerned has occured because the uh so called soft power is in the hands of the industrialized countries  journals books universities research institutions and so on and connected with this is the instrument of mass media  newspapers television this that and so on  this total situation has in a sense brainwashed uh elites in many countries and it is reflected in some of our newspaper  some of these uh people are writing  these are the people who have no appreciation of our hopes and aspirations for our needs and requirements  therefore you we come across  including newspapers in india some of the national newspapers  papers there they are writing articles on non-alignment  which which are absolutely out of phase  now this is one thing about uh i mean the the mass media and the so called soft power  the other thing which we must keep in mind is that when jawaharlal nehru pioneered this movement he was the real pioneer  he had two things in mind  one was that this country was economically poor  politically of not much consequence except that the leadership was trying to fail on  and at the same time the international situation was very one word  in fact the the clouds of the third world war uh on our horizon on the international horizon at that time  he tried to float the idea of non-alignment in order to subserve national interest of india in an international atmosphere of peace and harmony  so in his view the total picture of of the one word  was there in which the two systems national and international  were not antagonistic with each other but they were to function in harmony with each other quite right  mr rasgotra you want want to say something   may i  i just want to one word this kind of scepticism  i find much more evident here in our own country than i found it for example in europe i was there uh last month  i travelled around  uh in countries like germany and france there is a strong feeling that this movement needs to be strengthened  as if one word all kinds of new pressures uh are coming up there are new divisions arising among the developed world also there is uh new uh scramble for markets  uh economic pressures and other things now this movement has a role in these circumstances  in europe i found great sympathy with objectives of this movement its way of conducting itself  and i think that should we we need to uh rethink  we should not think of non-alignment or non-align movement as a thing between two other things russia soviet union united states of america communism or democracy  but as some an entity in itself with a positive role with a positive concept then this kind of scepticism misunderstanding will not arise mr rasgotra   one or two words  here is in if you permit me i will just say one sentence yes that it's a very one word  on account of cereberal deficiency and moral timidity  i say moral timidity because we are poor or by the by a certain power which has reversed most predominant and we are all very uh this mantra of uni polarism is unnecessarily amongst us quite right try to stress that non-alignment is basically an alternative moral power and the reason why the perception that mr rasgotra have visited europe  of people in europe thinking we're all relevent adjust the time when sceptics in our country are thinking that we're  perhaps less relevent  is that there is a type one word between the polarities of the global politics and the polarities of the global economy  in the global economy there are only two really resurgent players  there is germany and japan   japan  neither of them has a role in the global polity  and the global polity is now dominated by one power which is in the mist of the worst recession  this is as experienced in domestically right  a few words  and therefore everyone is searching for a new role and at that point in time everyone is looking for a new role specially those who used to be the dominant power  for us to say that there is now no role for us in the new  uh situation would be the biggest mistake we could do no i have we not heard about india's role   a few words   a few words  viswam i want to refined uh with mani's  permission his phrase a little he said alternative moral force  i think uh  moral force or no moral force obviously there is a force of some kind when hundred countries get together  i think it's a an alternative vision of the world not a world of power but a world of justice peace  co-operation equality among nations  so that everybody goes together  but the vision vision of one world and one world can come about only not on the basis of power but justice fair-play equality peace co-operation if you permit me i would say this one word to me to be a little idealistic   i i i remember a sentence which e h  kirk said in his famous book the conduct of foreign policy is not an exercise in sainthood in morality  therefore modern dimension is there but to to to  emphasis it too much in the context of either non-alignment or foreign policy i think uh will not cut much ice 
 we're assembled here this evening to  discuss the aftermath or perhaps the most reveting diplomatic engagement involving india and pakistan on over  that kashmir issue  this is a subject which has really engaged the entire  sub-continent's attention for almost uh six weeks i should think and uh towards the end it came to almost a nail biting finish with the fate of the resolution the pakistan sponsored resolution uh condemning india for alleged human rights violation in kashmir becoming a subject of international attention  and it has been uh sort of great satisfaction uh in this country that at the end of a day under uh international pressure  particularly pressure from other third world countries iran and china in particular that pakistan uh withdrew the resolution and uh it is it's not quite something that need necessarily be interpreted as a victory or defeat but it was question of uh larger third world solidarity that uh was established in geneva and the another major point that came out at the end of the geneva conference was that certain issues like this perhaps which will  be resolved uh through bi-lateral negotiations this gives a completely new opening and to discuss uh  the fallout of geneva how we move forward from here and what is being what is the reason why india was ultimately able to pursue other member countries of the united nations human rights commission uh to support that the indian position of this we have uh a very distinguished panel here today  uh mr salman khursheed the hero of geneva who has uh  almost uh i would say battled night and day to prevent the uh pakistani uh diplomatic victory in geneva  uh despite the fact that pakistan has uh in the past uh scored over us on occassion and in the diplomatic arena it's been uh very very one word achievement salman  and next to mr khursheed is mr s k singh former foreign secretary who has also dealt with pakistan for a very long time i think uh uh apart from having spent time in pakistan  itself uhm as  i started in fifty-nine  in fifty-nine  one or two words  a very long time  and we've also with us mr rasheed talib senior journalist with aligarh background who has also been uh a commentor  on national and international affairs   i'll start with salman  salman uh the question that has uh occured to me time and again is how did we do it ? from start till the end i think there was a scale  by we finish this eager expections on one one hand  on the other hand we were also kind of uh preparing ourselves for defeat  there was a sentiment that so what even if the resolution  target pass have its own fault  so we work absolutely short so could you tell us little background of this how is that we how was this achieved ? so i've my own amnesia laughter i uh i i was quite confident i think our whole team was quite confident that we had uh a margin  a clear margin right upto the last date  uh perhaps on the day of the voting the morning of the voting  uh we sleep a little bit a couple of people uh slipped perhaps due to last munute instruction but it was our margin that we maintained throughout uh which was significant and i think important in leading to the situation which finally led to uh withdrawl  uh but i think what is significant is the support that we had from the european union  uh largely because of the report that one word  ambassadors had had given them  and also the support we had in the o i c group where it became very clear after the first few rounds of of discussions we had that they were not going to take a unified single position  and certainly the resolution of the o i c karachi was not going to be uh the guiding sort of spirit of their decision  i think that broke the back really off uh the effort by pakistan to get the momentum uh that could convince uh people that they could win but you know there has been suggestion from the pakistani side  and i think there are people in this country too who uh feel that actually how we managed it was the deal  the so called deal that india was supposed to have struck with iran and china  uh and that's what really tilted uh the balance that pakistan was have was forced to withdraw  how far is that correct ? well i i'm not quite sure that i wouldn't have said the same thing if i was in their shoes going back to their country uhm i want to make it absolutely clear absolutely clear  that there was no deal no negotiation no settlement  we didn't meet iran or china any more than we met the other countries  we talked uh very openly and we talked about our position  all that iran did at the time when they ask for adjournment   one word pakistan said was adjournment being asked by uh  iran and iran said it was being asked by pakistan was they rang us and said want to make a statement to which there will be a response from pakistan and they will withdraw  we said uh lest you waste your breath there are a few point on which we will object  uh we don't allow anybody to say that about the situation in kashmir  for the rest if you have something with pakistan we'll  sit and listen to it but we're not repeat not part of any tripartite or bilateral agreement on this  and that was it they made a statement uh china picked it up  others spoke  clearly lot of them said was this is a bilateral matter it should remain in the bilateral plain  pakistan then said we agree uh we don't want any further actions on our motion  that was it  mr singh do you think that uh there could have been something more than what salman is saying ? no i don't uh i don't believe that i i from my experience  pakistan after the kind of efforts it made  let me remind you third committee resolution withdraw  after that end of the the session of the un general assembly  immediately forty-seven or forty-eight or fifty missions sent to all members uh capitals of all members  then the prime minister identified herself prime minister of pakistan identified herself with this dark project as completion of her father's work  and thereafter she goes there herself  then all this feverish statements being made all over pakistan  all over their media and her the pitch getting higher and higher  then they hoping that it would encourage the militants in the valley  and then what happens towards the end they withdraw their pivotal of sentence on which they had based their entire strategy  that is to send a self finding mission against  india's wishes into a good part of india  then that is withdrawn and then they one word  actually i think china and uh iran good very good friends of ours and much better friends of pakistan gave them and  totalling or to save their face  because i i came in here as a minister that uh that uh  pakistan would have lost this  now why it happened is something we must generalise  because internationalising this dispute has a kind of chain reaction  it took it to human rights then take it to the general assembly and then in the general assembly nudge it to the security council that was the game plan and i won't be surprised if it remains a game plan for future  not complacently we shouldn't become complacent as s k has rightly emphasised but the question that a lot of people ask i guess that whether in fact there was a withdrawl  taken into view a withdrawl on which i wish the minister would shed some light because some people say that at the very last minute the chairman of it was the dutch chairman who said what is being deferred that iranians made a short speech because we objected  and uh eventually he said it is not on the agenda  for this uh session  now what is that the we a few words  well you know uh what you do with a resolution is that the resolution is voted uh upon if the sponsor insist that there should be a vote uh it could be defeated it could be accepted  once a resolution is accepted then it gets on to the record and a resolution of the kind they wanted was self  serving resolution that automatically will repeat itself every year with a report but uh serving from a fact finding instruments on  what uh you can do to kill a resolution apart from defeating it is to bring a no-action motion  uh which is not the preferred instrument now lot of countries in the west preferring not to uh to block action as it works  through through indirect uh sort of method  so we've not uh thought of a no-action motion we wanted to be consistent without transparency uh attitude we wanted to be consistent with openness  and we said nothing to hide no blocks   let's face it in uh openly let the best man win what iran has said was specifically uh uh request the pakistan to withdraw  i had said then that the commission be treat this matter as closed after pakistan withdraw it  what the chairman did was to take the request to pakistan to be the operative part of the request to the commission  and therefore rule so  we immediately protested and i must give credit to iran and i think this is an act of courage  because actually what they could have said well we try to help but it was ambiguous you know it's no fault of ours   iran took courage instantly in his act the ambassador uh one or two word said look what i said sir was that this matter be treated as closed no  action no further action period  so obviously there was no choice  uh chairman said yes i agree if that is the case  then no-action period  everybody clapped and it was over  that if no any more in of resolution that can leave on after this to uh uh be back uh to haunt till next year but of course this week like anybody else we are going in for new resolution well one thing chandran  uh to this question that during this very session there was another resolution pssed by consensus that was anti-terrorist   ahn right and therefore in this particular session on this two aspects of our problem terrorism which is being injected inserted into india etcetera etcetera ex exported   into india on the one hand and the human rights question on the other hand  human rights question is wiped off  during the session terrorism thing stand as a decision of the commission  ahn right  rasheed would you agree that the human rights question has been wiped off ? well i think these are technicalities what the minister has just said may be right on it that's what happened  but i think we should  a few words  as we were saying earlier that we should not become complacent because it's likely to come up again at various other forum and if it does what is going to be our strategy in other words what was a strategy that worked here and what should we do in order to you know take care of it next time right  yes salman i i think one question as writer point of view commented that perhaps okay we've succeeded uh it has been a great achievement but uh this is not going to stop pakistan  from its attempt to internationalise uh kashmir that is that is the possession uh because uh having a democracy existing then we we double the effort  now do we've a game plan as to how we're  going to confront this in future ? well on two things i would like to say one uh which uh i would uh point you through s k's notice because he has far great experience of bilateral work uh which is that despite our confidence that we would win  there was a danger and there always is in a vote of anything happening  uh the important thing is that if we had had a vote uh ten or twelve people would have voted  but the margins would not have been great we would not necessarily have known how the others felt  they would abstain it  pakistan could have again said it they were abstaining but they were in our favour  we could have got one or two perhaps explanations of vote that could indicate what the mood was  but what happened in this uh event was that many country spoke  and expressively stated that this was a bilateral matter  that this should remain bilateral it should not come in two words of an atmosphere of a place like human rights commission  i think this was a significant victory and i think we've  to take a cue from this  uhm in terms of strategy not victory in terms of you know between india and pakistan  uhm the the second important think really is the transparency it was not just practical transparency to ward off a resolution it is a policy consistent policy which uh has has input at every level ministry of home ministry of defence decision at the highest level in our country the prime minister's level  that we must be open and we must be transparent  we must not hide if there is nothing to hide  and if there is something wrong the transparency will bring it to our notice as well  i think this was appreciated commented upon by the a few words ambassadors it was commented upon in a statement made by greece on behalf of eu and in our international bilateraly this was a crucial thing  which turned the mood in our favour and uh this is really something that we needed to 
good evening and welcome back to the election analysis programme this will be the last programme this evening and our last programme to re wind up will be tommorrow night at the same time nine fifty senior members of the congress parliamentary party have had just emerged actually from an informal meeting and we'll be going to the congress party head quarters to try and find out what exactly happened in those folk filled rooms but first the head lights head lines at ten o'clock tonight congress-i and allies are hurrying towards two hundred and thirty-five still twenty-five to thirty short of a majority  the bjp plus its allies are set forward for one-twenty  in andhra pradesh the congress-i is literally swamping the june vote  in the may vote we saw the telugu desam desam doing well but in june the congress-i is literally sweeping  h k l bhagat is defeated and george farnandis win   is karyakram ke mukhya samachar is prakar hain congress-i wa uske sahyogi dal do sau paintees seetein jeetne ki oor bhartiya janata party aur shivsena ko ek sau bees seetein pane ki ummeed  andhra pradesh mei june ke matdan mei congress bahut aage h k l bhagat chunau hare aur george fernandis chunau jeete prannoy well vinod let's go straight into the latest results position this is final mp's in the next lok sabha  and we have results now on three hundred and fifty-five or five hundred and eleven seats  the congress-i one seventy-nine out of three fifty-five  the bjp coming second on its own with eighty-one  the janata dal twenty-nine still  cpm nineteen  the aiadmk eleven and others thirty-six  but telugu desam still part of the national front with ten  the ja jmm five cpi five  all part of the national front  the bsp is fighting on its own with one seat now  rsp part of the national front and uh totalling thirty-six  let's look at the leading position these are the trends this includes results this is both leading and those results we've just seen because we get the overall picture here  so we got information now on four hundred and eighty-six out of five hundred and eleven seats  and the congress is leading now in two hundred and twenty   it's picked up uh three or four seats in u p at the movement  but doesn't seems to be going much further  bjp is coming second with hundred and seven  the janata dal fifty-five on its own  the cpm twenty-nine  the telugu desam thirteen these are all part of the nat national front janata uh national and left front combined  others sifty-two  cpi eleven  aiadmk eleven  the jmm six  rsp three  bahujan samaj party one  making a total of others sixty-two  now this projects into the tenth lok sabha  something like this  congress plus all its allies put together somewhere around two thirty-five take uhm uh plus or minus two three seats  the left front looks as though it's heading towards fifty and the national front eighty-five so together they form a nice little chunk of a hundred and thirty-five seats likely to form this is prediction   that's ahead actually of the bjp and its allies which is basically the shivsena which is now heading towards about a hundred and twenty  and other minor parties are about twenty-one  so that's the kind of look that we expect to see inside the next tenth lok sabha vinod  we've in our studios dr muralimanohar joshi of bharatiya janta party shri s r bommai of janata dal shri harkishan singh surjeet of communist party marxist and shri n k p salve of congress-i prannoy  mr salve let me start with you  what do you expect the president to do next ? uh well what i expect president to do next is what he did the last time  perhaps call for the party which is the highest number of members in lok sabha   that's the only alternative for him  call for the leader of the party good call for the leader of the party and who is that going to be ? uh well  there is no dearth of talents in our party and the congress parliamentary party is going to decide upon a leader who knows how honour ourselve how delicate is the task ahead of us  he will be a strong not dearth of talent are you talk heavy with leaders in fact no in fact we are reasonably balanced on all ends which is not top uh heavy nor is it uh top at the bottom but the question is we realize the responsiblity we have very delicate responsibility  we own this responsibility  and we'll if we do have to form minority government  then we do know that we have to form a durable government  and a durable government can not be run only on experience and gimmicks yes  where are you going to get the critical thirty seats from in order to form a government ? no as i said it's the minority government i'm  expecting at this juncture  if your prediction are correct   a few words  where am i going to get thirty seats is precisely from where mr joshijee might be expecting some other seats to come  i don't have any other source  other are the source which all four parties of all the four had but when i say the president would be sending for the  leader of a party with the largest number of uh members i do take it that even if your projections are correct perhaps the congress party will be the first one to be called  uh mr surjeet from your experience in this  these matters how long i mean the country is waiting now for things to settle down ?  it's been a long campaign  it's been uh people are pretty tired  they want a bit of uh uh certainty on the political front how long do you think this whole thing will take to settle down to some kind of uh stability ? it should not take much time because now situation is pretty bad in the country  it requires a government  there is no government at the moment  and salveji has rightly stated president has no other option but to call the leader of the biggest largest  party in the parliament  and then see that uh they take the responsibility so you're talking about a week or three days or   one or two word   no no not a week  week is too much too long that's it too long  too long  because the situation is critical in the country now you've we've mentioned about punjab problem what is happening inspite of the efforts of all the political parties they are going cough ahead of the one word  cough and all that  so many other problems are there situations is very complicated  please carry on i want to ask mr bommai what is uh you can actually authoritatively state as being the president of the janata dal the official position of the janata dal towards a coalition with the congress-i ? because they are looking for those thirty seats and you are going to have them  now firstly we respect the verdict of the people  and they've asked us to sit in the opposition and we will be playing a role of the constructive opposition so far talk of coalition is prematured in mind unless  it is for the congress-i to decide what they've  whether they want to have coalition whether they want to remain minority government  all those things have to be indicated by congress  and if there is any indication the national front and the left  combined we'll sit together and take a view on that  are you open to the idea of a coalition government of congress ? no i'm not uh open to that but if the situation demands we will give it a go to the situation  it'll in my view uh too early to answer it unless that they move   you're not ruling it out   you're not ruling it out no no it comes when you know the whole thing  because the country is passing to a very serious crisis  not financial law and order all things are there  and there should be a government  and that government should be able to give solutions  the when you talk of coalition it's very difficult to answer because there are issues on which we oppose and if the party which proposes is agreeable to those solutions  other than the common issues joshijee on which your party can extend critical suport or constructive support to congress-i ? uh i don't think so  uh we would be sitting in opposition  uh there is no reason and no occasion  so i think vinod said issues particular issues well you see that whenever there are issues uh  infringing upon national security say there is a war or there is a calamity of an unprecedented magnitude then certainly we extend co-operation and support to the government  but as of uh in day-to-day normal implementation of programmes and policy well certainly i don't find that there is any reason or occassion to extend any support  but for all measures of uh national welfare i mean certainly agreed to political parties i think we'll quickly go first to bombay  yeah murlidhar is waiting  yeah  murlidhar is waiting over there  the former chief minister of maharashtra who has been declared winner from colaba constituency  mr antulay you were one of the leading president  attempting to overthrow mr pawar  what made you suddenly uh one word  well i believe that this assumption unfortunately is not very correct  see there could be internal differences in any democratic set-up  which of course our party claims to have have  but when it comes to a national disaster or calamity all the local differences even national differences within the party gets under  what positive sense of insecurity that made you uh mend fences with mr pawar ? what what exactly do you mean by sense of insecurity  because you had the patron of mr rajeev gandhi  now the scenario is different  you mean to say that mr pawar didn't have the patronage of mr rajeev gandhi  i believe everybody has patronage  he was our leader  we all accepted him as our leader  the question of patronage if you use that word if you choose to use it is not is rather inappropriate but if you want to choose it you are welcome to do so  but then everybody has his patronage including mr pawar  so there is no question of antulay having patronage and not pawar  did mr pawar's campaigning uh really help you ? well mr pawar's campaigning did help dispell  the suspicions created by the bjp candidate who was my main rival  that he has the support of the chief minister which was not true  and mr pawar's presence there and campaign and canvassing was necessary  i mean to that effect and i think uh we succeeded i mean in that uh endevour  would you've lost had it not been for mr pawar's  campaigning ? no i don't think i would have lost  that nobody even mr pawar also doesn't think that i would have lost  even mr pawar won't say  in fact uh it was as i said only to dispell the doubts created in the minds of the people by uh against our own chief minister  because mr pawar is a congress-i chief minister and it's  my duty as congress man to see that he one or two words  thank you very much mr uh antulay we're running short of time thank you very much on that note this is h v muralidhara returning you to bombay  delhi  thank you very much murali  at the moment uh this is the first time actually vinod thanks to one word net this computer uh net-work that we using which is the planning commissioned uh infra-structure  that we have been able to actually ga  garner some information of votes all across the country normaly this takes uh the election commission and other sources at least week or ten days to sort out  so we we were very luky unto night we can actually review the situation today the about the votes of the different parties uh across the country  let's look at the all india vote share of all the different parties  now this is based so far on four hundred and fifty one lead  and the vote position is as follows  thirty-six percent for the congress-i  that's down to about two percent since last time  the bjp thirty-three percent coming seco   second doing extremely well  the janata dal twelve on its own  the cpm six and others which is the conglamuration of parties  twenty-three now if we compare this with nineteen eighty-nine and look at the vote change of swing in vote the congress as i said was down two percent  the bjp the biggest gainer almost doubling its vote to ten percent the janata dal suffering quite a set back now really in three states down by five percent  cpm about up point five to one percent and others down four percent 
 one or two words laid down their lives in the last twelve month  and since nineteen sixty-nine when six brave policemen patrolling in leh were ambushed and killed by the chinese  but such acts of courage have not really altered the public image of the police  ask any ordinary citizen of the country and a city dweller  or uh a peasant in a village or indeed women and they will tell you  that police have quite sincerely tried to enchained them at the level of interaction of the ordinary citizen and the police why this is so ? is change really possible ? is it impossible ? why things not changing ? who is at fault ? who is to blame ? to answer these and several other question we have a hand picked and distinguished panel mr m n jacob state home minister mr soli sorabjee eminent eminent supreme court advocate and former attorney general and mr t anantchari who is director general of the border security force  so you are two words we can start with you  you have been a consistant and unsaving critic of the government  and also of the police and you have said that there've been many human rights violation  why have you been saying this ? well uh human rights violation i would  concentrate upon specially the method and the procedure that the police employ in investigation at the time of crime  one of the things which we commonly find is the use of  third degree method  sometimes even the recourse to torture in extracting statements and extracting confessions   there're constitutional prohibition against it  when even the criminal procedure code has provisions against the use of such methods  but in actual practice these constitutional provisions are really  two words  then one of the reasons which i find because i've also friends in the police force  i know the one word we should understand their problems  their difficulties they have to cope with not ordinary criminals  but today these criminals are very well armed they have sophisticated technique  so one of the uhm excuses reasons to give forward is  it's not possible to deal with harden criminals   it's not practical to investigate these cases unless  we have recourse to these methods mr jackob is it possible or is it not possible to deal with hardened criminals without using third degree method ? i think it is a mixed reaction because it is not suppose to be a torturous method or a third degree method  but at the same time there do come across some instances  where uh unwanted methods are also adopted  and may be it has certain various reasons  we will have to find the solutions now   i i i will project it like this  that we have to have more of team trained well trained in this task of investigation or extracting the truth  modern methods will have to be used  then there will be more simplified one word  the coarse methods are rotten  sometimes as a hang-over of past when you were not having  any thing of that sort  but by and large it's it's a all not a general complaint it is an image that is projected outside  but i don't agree that totally it is true but there are cases but it is refreshing to have the government admit that uh  coarse methods are used by the police mr anantchari  well i think this problem you cannot uh discuss in isolation i would like to say first of all there can be no two opinion about the need to eradicate third degree method  police cannot adopt it as a method of that's the method or as a policy  having such reason i would like to say that police cannot function diverse from the cultural one word of the society  the legal system the restrictions that it imposes  first of all i would like to say when i say cultural one word  of society  there is uh that i am permitted to say we are having double standard in our society  they would say one thing in law  they expect something else to be done   e it depends on who is affected and who is wanting to police one word  i think that is the point we've got to understand we cannot run away a few words totally secondly in our country everybody seems to be in great hurry and want results  and when it when they want results from themselves they would like to adopt their own method  and then the police becomes uh important hand made  this is one aspect of it  secondly you want to run the society on modern basis on terms of modern terms of modern concept with a law which is totally hackneyed  i do not know if very many of us know that the institution called the fir this institution called the fir first information report is peculiar to the sub-continent  nowhere else in the world do you have it  once you write something in the fir it becomes impossible to  even the telling the truth to get out of it  so you will have to often to satisfy the courts add up  the evidence to see that what you said in the fir uh come through the investigation i think it is a very big  third is we must also when you think of police image  you think of police as part of the total criminal justice system  thus they have the criminal justice system improve has it uh soli  in fact i think that specially is relevent  improvement in the criminal justice system is nothing to do to  sanction tolerate mitigate and absolve the police from the use of methods which are not correct  i appreciate what mr anantachari has said about the double standard but what he meant by double standards and people want results is really the two words of the police  orders come from political bosses from people in authority to see there one of their cousins and one of their friends who is being investigated two words  policemen says baba kya karega order  ho gaya  there are exceptions  there are some bail source  another way the order comes when they want their political rivals to be arrested order goes to the police station and the orders are carried out so i entirely agree about the double standards and i think the real if i must say so one word of the police is the politicisation of the police  and that must stop  because many unconstitutional illegal commands are carried out  just in order not to get into trouble they may be transferred they may be suspended  but criminal justice system has not improved by means one or two words  the delays in the criminal justice system investigation as part of the criminal system justice system  and if the investigation is not covered the investigations is not  one word naturally we won't have a sucessful prosecution of the criminal yeah soli politicisation is there i was just trying to uh see through your word politicisation  because uh my experience i think that there is not politicisation as people imagine because every political party come to the police  everyone has a faith in police  and even in india the states and states differ in political systems seldom changes  so everyone come to uh power  one party or other  and the police had to follow a middle course  they are not pressurise by the politicians  even if the pressure goes police is not listening to a politician because it is the system  but i see the very fact that all the party people or politicians are relying on the police  irrespective of nature of the government i think though there is some truth sometimes someone may   one word it but it may not be a genuine case that there is the politicisation of the police force in india i beg to differ from one word   but  mr jacob what you're saying is that all political parties manipulate the police  as far as one or two words i am not picking out one political party what you are saying comes to these all politicians no no i am the i think they're well independent in their own investigation well i wish that was true  i don't blame the police mr anantachari why don't you one word  in fact in fact i thought i should appropriately get an opportunity to one word  you will have it right now   because because the whole thing arouse out of my statement which are in two parts one when i mentioned about the criminal justice system and second about double standard  this double standard i related to the cultural one word  in the society as a whole  it is if you ask me it is not merely the politicians  it is a neighbour if your house is burgled so long as his house is not burgled  the neighbour will keep quiet  when his house is burgled he does not mind the police using any method to get his things howsoever   correct  so i am only this this runs through our society  and i must say as a policeman as a well meaning policeman  as a policeman who would like to live within the system and reform it if there are reforms required with a high sense of motivation  uh i would like to say that this is uh i think which is a very important uh factor that hampers the police that is the one  and not this kind of effort would policeman change  second i must also clarify was the criminal justice system  today there is no point uh in saying that uh police role should change  i think the police have to change a lot there is no doubt about it  there are good people there are like any other organisation  institutions there are also bad people  but only thing supposed to be accountable to law  if the judiciary the judicial process has functioned properly and i am very sure we'll have very well behaved police  today there is so much of tolerance so much of one word  so much of uh looseness in the entire judicial process that you see when i say judicial process it started it is uh something you will form to find at all the levels of judiciary  whether it is prosecution whether it is defence whether it is uh administration of justice so therefore i feel that police is only one of the links of  one word system  and it is the one that is the cutting edge but mr anantachari before we loose track of politicians  would you say that politicians apply pressure on the police or don't they  ? you see politicians may or may not apply  but it is upto the police officer i i would like to say that i have this holding important charges as sp dig dig cid in the state various jobs  politicians have continued with this one word  they have tried to also put some pressure  but it did not do and explained to them most of the time they did not interfere  and if you kept your end clean i think very few politicians really try to interfere with you   it's a question of it's it's a double game that is what the politicians wants and what you want to play i think both have to one word   soli what is in your experience  i think we repeat itself of course if we say so the fact of the matter is pressure is a fact and money two words politician don't think even politician even the industrialist capitalist people wealthy people people who built ill-terms and power  they do trap  let me ask one question  why is it that despite of so called failure of the criminal justic system a citizen will certainly go with more confidence into a court of law before a magistrate than before a police ? why is it that no woman will dare to go to a police station alone  ? why is it that the landless labourers especially the schedule caste is directed he will not dream of going to a police station ?  i'm talking of rural areas  the reason is and i don't say that why do you why don't you let mr jacob   a few words  i i'll complete the question the reason is the perception  may be it is an exaggerated perception  but it is there that the police is not our friend and an ally  police is an instrument of the system and that system is oppressive as far as the landless as far as the deprived sections are concerned mr jacob would you say the police is for the rich  no i'm i'm i am afraid that i may not be able to agree with sorabji though i've i've  tremendous respect for him as a lawyer  but yes every police station in india is almost crowd of these all these people who are who are affected someway or other  the women the backward the weaker section  i don't think they are afraid of going to a police station  they don't go to the police station the first thing they will do is to go to the police station and report the crime whatever happened  then of course we have go to the court so i think by and large the police stations are crowded  and the policemen's workload is also very heavy  correct uhn  but mr jacob please ask the several ngo's  non-governemntal organizations who appear on behalf of landless labour one word workers you will get more precise information and statistics from them as to how they really fear entering a police station  may be you may be right in saying but there is no reason for the fear  but the whole impression that has been built up in some of the areas is landlords vested interest are in cohout with the police 
as most of you must be aware parliament conveyance tomorrow  for its first session in the new year  it will be a very important session not only because it will be a fairly long one stretching right into the middle of may but also because because it will be the budget session  and the most crucial among all the parliament sessions  the railway budget and the annual general budget will be presented during the session  there was a time when the budgets were just mere fiscal exercises  exercises in balancing the revenue account and the capital account but those days seem far away  the present day trend is that the budgets are regarded as  very strong and major indicators of the governments political ideology and its approach to the economic problems of the country  it has almost become a fashion with us media people to predict that every session of parliament will be a stormy one  well looking uh into the issues that have been  figuring in the newspapers there is enough of the element of controversy  in them to make this coming session of parliament perhaps a really stormy one  it has been my experience that although several issues  are identified as likely to dominate uh parliament sessions  invariably it so happens that some other issues come in and take not only the parliamentarians but also the people by surprise  but this time to my mind cough the issues are fairly  clear because i expect at least uh the issue to dominate the current session of parliament will be mostly economic  in nature  to identify some of the issues and to discuss them and analyse them with me tonight around this table you will see sukharamjee  and murali bhandarijee of the congress-i on my left shrimati sushama swaraj of the bharatiya janata party and shri gurupadswamy of the  janata dal and shri somanath chatterejee of the cpm  you might have uh read in the papers that the   national front and the left front  parties have decided to boycott the address of the president to the joint session of the two houses tomorrow morning  uh before uh we really begin to discuss the issues i would like uh the representatives of the two parties with us here today to enlighten us on the logic and rationale of this very very drastic step of uh deciding to boycott the president's address somanath would you like to begin set the ball rolling  yeah  yes i want to make it clear at the beginning that our decision to boycott the session is not any not a   reflection on the president personally  we have high respect for him as a as a person  but we feel that the president's joint address  address to the joint session as uh even the constitution uh provide for is not meant to be a ritual  and the president is expected to announce the government's  policies economic policies primarily as well as other policies  but so far as this government is concerned during in the inter-session period they have taken very important decisions on matters affecting the people affecting the economic situation in this country  and all those decisions have been taken without taking the parliament into the con uh confidence  bypassing the parliamnet behind the back of the parliament therefore we said  just to go and listen to what has already taken place will be a mere formality because the parliament has been has been reduced to irrelevence and this speech all this address to joint session will serve no purpose  therefore to register our protest to the governemnt's  way of functioning and taking the parliament for the granted  ignoring the parliament in vital issues we felt that we should register our protest in a more and a very democratic manner without showing any disrespect to the president's personell murali would you agree with this point of view or would you think that the stand taken by the opposition is the little uh little well i think they are fulfilling their role eminently yes that is to oppose oppose and oppose but propose nothing  there is no logic in this at all  because firstly in the last budget which was only in the month of july the whole policy was unfolded  steps were taken to implement that policy  there have been very important lengthy discussions on all aspects whether it is the industrial policy whether it is devaluation  whether it is free market economy whether it is the entry of the multinationals whether it is the export policy  we have had extensive debates not only in the last budget session but also in the winter session  now i cannot understand their saying that all this has been implemented behind the back of the parliament  i think they are merely finding an excuse because they are today without any substantial issue in the parliament   i think they are also conscious that after the punjab election and particularly if i may take the events of the  just last four weeks the excellent manner in which  particularly the prime minister p v narsimha rao has held the whole situation  look at the unfurling of the national flag on the twenty-sixth of january ending in the fiasco of the ekta ekta yatra  the determine manner in which we repelled any crossing into kashmir on the eleventh of february  the way in in which we have bro  brought democracy back on the race in punjab  and in the process we have achieved a position where there is little threat to the survival of the government  one word  well murali you have begun already talking about the achievements of the government where as i thought first we will identify the issues that are likely to come up what sukharamjee in view of your party are the main issues  that are likely to come up ? or what do you expect the major thrust to be on ?  mere khyalme teen kism ke jo samaseyein hai ya masle  parliament mei ayenge ek to arthik economic issue aur doosre defence of country  aur teesre socio- political issues jaise jharkand hai jammu kashmir hai doosre hain magar mai aisa samajta hoon ke sab se jyade jo debate ya parliament  mei jo uhm jyada samay lagega woh economic issues ke upar hai abhi jaise aap ko malum hai sare desh ko malum hai ke jab is  government ne karyabhar sambhala to hamare  one word position kya thi mushkil se hamare pas teen hafte se kum ka hamare pas ayat ka woh foreign exchange tha  aur uh phir external hamare pas jo foreign loan ka tha ek uhm uske liye bhi hamare paas badi samaseyein thi  to is baat se bade kuch harsh step lene pade waise  sare sansar mei itne democracys hain usme hamesha  democratic government jo hai woh sakht options  opt karti hain magar is sarkar ke samne hard options  ke siway koi uh chara nahi tha is baat se ye jyada taur par  financial problem jo hain yeh dominate  karengi yeh debates  gurupadswamy do you uh share this view that uh the  government had no option but to go in for hard decisions ? and the hard decisions taken have let to a kind of a reforming of this economic structure which in the view of the opposition  has not been on right lines  see let me uh answer your first question yes  why national front and  left front have decided to boycott the president's  address  you appreciate for last twenty years at no time  so many important decisions have been taken without reference to parliament  my friend bhandarajee said many of the issues have been already discussed in parliament  discussion on difference of issues is one thing  many issues are discussed in parliament  but i am talking of issues where the government takes decisions  i do not find in the annals of parliament so many important and vital decisions have been taken without the approval of parliament gurupadswamy will you identify one or two such decisions  when you are making a distinction between a policy implementation and a decision   you'll you'll uh you'll see  you will know that uh functions the agreement that has been reached on various issues in the international monitory fund  and world bank  duncan proposals and one word intellectual property rights and so on uhm  they have not been thoroughly discussed  and approval of parliament has not been obtained  their vital issues is affecting the economy of the country itself so after a good deal of thought we came to this conclusion  and uh i just say that president's address is a very important occasion  a unique event which comes once in every year  and the president has to tell parliament tell the country  the present situation shoud also say what agenda will be taken up by government ? what are the issues on which decisions are taken by the government ? so i do not want the address be a a dreary affair a dull affair a ritualistic affair  it should be it should be a very important document  and i think that one word has been destroyed well bharatiya janata party is the major opposition in the lok sabha  and the bjp as you see has not shared the perception of the national front parties and the  left front parties  and they are not boycotting the president's  address  does this mean sushmajee that bjp is  more or less in agreement with the congress government's  economic policies ? or is it because they think it is not wise to announce a boycott ?  in hindi   accha murali do you agree with this conclusion that the rise in prices and the growing growing graph of unemployment is a logical corollary of the structural reforms that you have carried out in the party in the last one year ? and secondly that uh parliament could have given its green signal to many of these policies and then you could have walked on them  their complaint basically is that the government has unilaterally more or less gone ahead with very very vital decisions in the economic field even though you had acquainted them with the broad orientation  well i won't agree with that because i think the most important issue is the price rise  because inflation is the cruelest form of taxation on the poorest of our people  and no government can afford to impose that taxation on our people  i think my party as well as my party's government  is conscious of this fact  undoubtedly we were placed in a as it has been explain by my  colleague sukharamjee  we were placed in a position where we had to do certain thing not uh willingly in a sense that we had to take very hard options  we didn't choose soft options  all of us had predicted including the treasury benches they had predicted that the budget would result in price rise  and the inflation has to be controlled  so i do not think that something new has happened   everybody's expectations in this case unfortunately have been found to be true  therefore that is one thing i don't think whatever has been done by the government is a sequence  now taking what my friend gurupadswamy says for example on the duncal proposal we have set up a high powered committee under the chairmanship of arjun singhjee  and he had been have been having  talks with all sections  all the leaders of the opposition parties all sections of the society  and no decision has yet been taken  i think these are all the excuses one must in a democracy not anticipate that the  presidential speech will be lacklustre or without substance  it will be full of substance there will be a motion of two words and the motion of thank would be voted upon   yes  that is true that is the convention usually but murali you made uh one or two points  the first point is that uh there was a uh in the  system itself there was an inbuilt provision or compulsion for the rise in prices and therefore the rise was anticipated but you must remember this government came into being on the basis of a manifesto which had promised that prices will be rolled back to the july uh nineteen ninety level that has not happened  on the contrary the criticism of the opposition as i see it is that the country does not only have inflation but it is also beset by  two words  now somanath uhm your party uh has had uh serious objections if i remember to the very idea of approaching the  imf  and all the oppositions parties have had reservations on the kind of conditionalities which the imf uh imposed  now the claim of the finaince minister has been that the the benifits of this reforms that have been introduce will be felt in the  only in the next three years and not before  meanwhile prices are going up  what is the perception of the opposition to this situation ?  uhm  you see all our apprehensions have proved to be correct ah unfortunately in the sense that the common people are suffering because of the policies of this government  it is very easy to say that for the next three years the prices will rise there will be inflation  but what is the government going to do to come to the rescue of the people common people  we have been uh stressing on strengthening the public distribution system making um essential commodities available to the common people at a vulnerable sections of the society at a a reasonable price  but instead of doing that we have had to find during the inter-session the government has increased the administered price of the commodities namely rice wheat etcetera which are distributed through public distribution system  therefore this government has not only not made an attempt to contain the price rise is well i think fuel to the fire  why administered price increased ? now this is very easy to say there will be prise rise because of so called structure and reform  we by structure and reform i mean we find that there is a complete surrender to the imf  we have never said one word one need not or one should not go to imf  we say we should not go there on bended knees  we should not accept conditional deeds which will be destructive of our economic one word  and which will mean abandonment of our national committment to self-reliance  and precisely that has happened in this country  today you find every section of the community is feeling the pinch of not only the pinch the weight of this inflation  and not only the poorest of the poor even the middle class today are talking of this  now apart from this the very economic dir   direction of this country has been altered totally  without the parliament being taken into confidence 
almost every country in the world today has to grapple with the challenge of population aging or the growth of the number of older persons in any society or population  death appears to be more or less a universal phenomenon and it is referred to as demographic transition  in the century to come this isssue of population aging  will raise many vital and new questions which need to be addressed urgently in india for example at present the number of people in our society in the sixty plus age group is some fifty-five million  in about thirty years the number could well be  two hundred million  the first international conference on aging is to be held and in fact being held in india at this time we have with us in our studios today two eminent experts in the field of aging  may we introduce them to you we have first on my far right dr sharadchandra gokhale who is the president of the international federation on aging  and then we have immediately to my right dr k b gangarade former vice pro-vice-chancellor delhi university and a united nation expert on aging i can't think of anything else to call your designation laughs  a few words  quite right i use that i for what uh uh many other  uh may we begin with you dr gokhale there is an international federation on aging which is the moving spirit behind this conference recently being held in bombay and pune would you tell us about this international federation ? yes this federation was established about twenty-five years ago   we've about hundred countries in membership of this organization  we have about twenty international agencies which are in membership of this organization  we are interested in programmes at the policy level which means we have conferences we have research programmes in medical as well as non-medical subjects  we have publications and the field programmes or the grass-root programmes are really developed at the country level  where we provide the necessary technical know-how and support  and we also act as a body which is consulted by the united nations on the subject of population aging  that is what is the broad description of this organization  dr gokhale there is also an indian federation of aging   yeah what about this organization ?  yeah  indian federation of aging was started about five years ago they are interested in developing old age homes  but old age home is a concept which is becoming out of date  so now they are developing day care centres  they also have their own publication called  kanchan-kalp  they also relate to a number of voluntary organizations in the country which are working in the field of aging they co-ordinate them  they are also in the area of development of policy and advocates  that is briefly the role of the indian federation of aging  and in addition to indian federation there are other five-member agencies such as lok-kalyan samitee in delhi and other which work in this particular area  dr gangarade uh you are an expert on aging again sudhir before you take over  as a expert but there is a global dimension to this demographic transition through which so many societies are passing   kyon ke jitni bhi samay jitne bhi samaj hai lagta hai ke jo bujurg umr ke loog hai unki sankhya badhti jarahi hai  what are the global dimensions of this issue ? let me tell you first by two thousand ad  eighty-six percent of the old people will be found only in the asian region  we can say dimension of the asian region  if you take the whole world as such about fifty-six percent of the people old in the whole world  from that particular point of view ninteen-eighty to two thousand the period will be that the population of the old people  will be much more than the young and the younger  in fact if you take third world as such there is a  somewhere there is a very good formula that's third age  plus third world and third is it equivalent to third class   laughs  well you see a and that means the kind of changes which were odd in the one word they are most the old people  after modernization has done not the time to do it  in fact modernization has been a kind of a curse to the old people  both in the western and industrial society as well as in  our society also  in the western society the young is accepted because he is a productive element  but the moment the one becomes old he  dis out of the you can say productive market  that he is not a productive market he is not respected  so whatever we hear it is true that whenever we talk of the old age let me slightly say here that the concept of aging must change in the sense there are some people who may have what i call the functional age  that even after the age of hundred years they are active  we can have a number of example that before eighty eighty-five  the one or two word may be more a active than on the fortieth  there may be some people who are not so much active  for it is it is not a chronological age that becomes important  but what is the age become important personal age  so to what extent you can one word functionally important  depends that is it possible youngster living the sixty year fifty year age the retirement age because what we call retired not the reason of old but he is retired because of the chronological age  so they all majo major problem is to what extent we can continue to make the old people as a productive agent of the society thereby they retained their status thereby they retained their spirit thereby also they become proud of themselves  dr gangarade may i interrupt at this stage  as far as i can see it there are two primary causes for this  global phenomenon of demographic transition about old people in society the first would be declining fertility rate and the second possibly increase in life expectency  that being so what are the repercussion on a country's  socio-economic structure of this phenomenon of aging ?  let's ask dr gangarade the most important point to remember let us identify three factors which are which are very important okay  one is let's say one word indian society itself at one time there was no occupational difference between the old and the young  whatever the father did the son did the same thing  now with the technological change there is a lot of occupational differences taken taking place  similarly with the migration some time old people remains in the village and the younger persons comes to the town  so that is the another problem  third is also our individualistic way of life is also gradually  taken place  to that extent the first socio-economic problem is what i call it if you take into four four kind of formula or criteria  if an old person is physically sound if the old person is also economically happy or healthier that is economically sound  socially and mentally if he is also alert then that old person becomes a wanted person  but if you minus each of these than becomes an unwanted person but what happens even a let us say in our society where still the relationships are certainly maintained  because even if you see sometime even though the uh younger may not like the older people but the older people wants to remain with their grand children  that kind of emotional tie is is remaining there  so but the kind of inflation which is taking place all-round when i use the word all-round prices see in a city the housing problem etcetera  so sometimes the younger people begin to feel either the old people should remain in the village or get out of the house as soon as possible  to give you a very concrete example in one of my surveys i found that even the father in delhi is welcome for three days  if after fourth day remains the both the in-laws that is daughter otherwise son-in-law begins to feel there is something wrong somewhere and he must get out  so even the father is not welcome to why ? because firstly the scarcity of the space in the in the house secondly also because now- a-days the rate prices are high  economically it is not possible  but what happens is why sometimes they are welcoming when they both are working wife and husband  sometime they feel to have the old people is good so that they can do baby-sitting job  so the yane most perhaps they begin to feel that old people are needed for a baby-sitting job  dr sharadchandra gokhale agala prashna apke liye hai  ji kahiye   kisi bhi samaj ki kisi bhi desh ki arthik vyavasta jo hai uspar kya prabhav padta hai is uh prashna ka  i i means mean i'm little reluctant to refer to it as a problem  but aging is not really a problem it's an issue  so wha wha what will be the impact on the economic health of the country ?  ahn  basically deepakjee uh once you have a large population of people of sixty plus age group or age bracket the dependency ratio starts increasing  many thereby should take the continue  continuation of life from zero to hundred  there are more people at the younger age who depend on the people who earn  similarly there is a larger group of people above the age of sixty  who're depending on the earnings of the fewer people  which means that more people are dependent on the earnings of fewer people  which is a basically economic problem  and countries like japan are really facing this problem very  serious seriously  the other issue is the issue of pension graduity or social security  social security presently is only for the organized sector of society uhm and not for the unorga  unorganized sectors like the landless labours or the small farmer  so how to provide security to these groups is another issue  and thirdly most of the countries in the west are finding  that pension is no more an answer to meet the needs of the people who are sixty plus  and therefore they are finding or searching for new ways  whereby pension could be replaced by some funding while they are earning also the other issue related to this uh uh by pension and provident fund etcetera is providing the third career to the people  now the uh most of the countries in the west are trying to encourage people to take up a new assignment at the age of forty they can change jobs  and lastly they are trying to prepare people for so called retirement  they start giving the person one day off at the age of fifty-five  so that he can develop some alternatives  at the age of fifty-six they will give him two days off like that  at the age of sitxy years he is totally ready to change job  uhm  in other words dr gokhale the time at which at the age at which the person withdraws from the labour force should this be after discussion of some agency like the government or of the individual himself it has got to be with the individual and not with any government  because whether you are able to work or not is something you can decide  in india for example a businessman doesn't retired   retire untill he himself feel that he has to retire  farmers doesn't retire and politicians you know they just don't retire  so point is if a person feels that he should retire certainly he should retire  but if he feels that he can work i i remember deepak mm mm  incident recently one of my collegues in the un retired uh and i was asking his wife how does she feels now when the husband is in the home ? and she said that previousely i had a full time salary and a part-time husband  and now i have a part-time salary and full time husband  which is a few words laughs  dr gangarade uh may we come to you for a movement now   kai aise sawal hai aaj hamare sansar mei jahan yeh dekha jara hai ke mahilaye jo hain woh purushon ki apeksha unka jo jeevan hai wo jyada lamba hota hai they can they live longer than man  ab iska kya asar padhta hai samaj par   ek jo abhi jo gokhale saheb ne kaha jo aap  economic sawal puchhe uspar mai kahna chahunga  dekhye jo young hota hai woh bhi karib karib chaar decade tak jyada saal tak kam karta hai  nahi usne kaam nahi kiya hai usne society ko  contribute kiya hai ab society ka ye jaroor hota hai response the reciprocation society must also reciprocate him   dekhye jo is wakht hamara jo khas sawal is prakar ka hai  ke jab life expectency bad rahi hai to world  a few words  it is not only the money which is important but what is important is the work or occupation is a therapy  without the work men feels lonely  without the work men feels some vaccum kind of it  as dr gokhale was saying i can give an example as i said again to repeat in my own study i found a person who retired from the government service  by ten o'clock he would put his shoes go in his study-room take all the files  whatever the files he had and look everyday upto five  laughs  he gets into a particular kind of routine whole organization get disturbed  yeah so so one of his routinisation like you said the wife will have no problem laughter a few words  dr gokhale now this conference that is going on right at this time uh really we should have talked about it a little earlier but then in the morning show we are different from the rest so  we have just a couple of minutes left  now what are issues that you are discussing in this conference ? you see there are uh major issues pertaining to aging that are being discussed such as disability and aging  you see out of the total disable population in the world sixty percent people are elder  so we would like to discuss that  we would like to discuss the issues regarding social security  for the elderly population  we would like to discuss indigenious health services such as  ayurveda acupuncture unani system what can they do for aging ?  that's another subject we are going to discuss  but more than that we are going to discuss the subject of the rights and the responsibilities of elderly  a charter that was discussed at the economic and social council of un which is being discussed in this informal sector and subsequently it will go to united nations  that is a very important subject that we have to discuss  and of course in addition to this there would be a number of  subjects number of lectures etcetra and finally dr gokhale uh the conference will  one or two words  what do you expect to emerge at the end of the conference ? we are really hoping  number one that the whole emphasis will change  you know presently people tend to think that aging is a problem or its a subject of charity  we want to change it to make that aging an elderly  they must be ready participated to participate  they must be productive  so the change of emphasis that's what we we want  secondly what we want is an acceptance of the charter of the rights of the elderly  and thirdly what we want is to prepare a kind of a blue print of action at the national level where we need not uproot the people from their family but make them live in their families and be productive well i would just like to add here sir most important point the conference will arrive at it  the care of the elderly is in the home that is in his own family  and in his own community  and unless the community and the family participates in the care of the old whether he is a disabled or not it will be very difficult for any other agencies to take care of it  i would also like to quote here that robert browning has very beautifully said grow old along with me the best thing yet to be  wonderfull  dr gokhale dr gangarade thank you very much for being with us in our studios and as you have heard that this vital issue of aging is going to be discussed at this conference there will be greater international awareness after it  and there is also hope for people like me in a couple of hundred years when i'm retired it's possible that i'll  not be considered as burden or a problem but uh still a productive force well thank you very much gentlemen for being with us thank you 
with the end of the cold war and the dismemberament of the soviet union there have been many dramatic changes in the international scenario  one of the healthy developments has been the change in the relations between india and britain  as they were our colonial past and after independence a number of issues had forward our relations  foremost amongst those was the question of kashmir  just next month two very significant results are going to take place  the british home secretary their home minister that is mr kenneth clerk will be coming in the first week of january  and this visit will be followed by that of the their prime minister mr john major  we have here with us dr l m singhavi our high commissioner to britain  he is here for pre-visit consultations  and we're going to take this opportunity of exchanging some views about the significance of the visit  dr singhavi how do you view this visit of what one word  ? these visits represents a remarkable new phase  of indo-british togetherness  as the british foreign secretary once said we no longer wrangle about problems  we sit together and resolved them  and i think these uh uh that the year and a half  that is there had experienced a progressive phase for a qualitative change in that relationship  we have been trying to resolve problems  we are trying to evolve that equation which is durable  and meaningful  and where we both share or uh view points and we care for each others concerns so what is the attitude now as one word in regard to the kashmir problem ? when i went there i found that the situation was considerably confused partly because i think in the labour party there was an inadequate appreciation of the historical background of the legal implications and of the ground situation  today we have a situation when the shadow foreign secretary  mr jack cunningham called on me some time ago at the high commission  held the press conference and made very positive clear-cut  unambiguous statements with regards to kashmir  there is no doubt that they are very much concerned about allegation of human rights violations  but there is also no doubt that they regard kashmir as an integral part of india  but this is very different to what the former shadow  foreign minister of the labour party said after his visit to india  he was rather critical about it uh well mr jerim cockson was very critical about us before he came here  but after he came he had made a considerable change in the position that he has taken earlier  but i must say in fairness that mr jerim cockson eventually came to a position  which is very much more favourable to india than it ever was  in fact when i went there he used the word occupying part for india  when i took exception to it yeah he was good enough  to say i am extremely sorry that i used that expression  on the whole during this period not only the labour party  not only the ruling part not only the liberal party but the people as a whole has come to understand our position better  they sympathise with our opposition much more and they share a lot of our perspective in these matters   yeah  to what extent uh would you attribute this uh to england itself now emerging more and more as a multi   multi ethnic community  because this was a common base to me that the british uh  government and people are also very concern of containing religious  racial and ethnics rights in england  and therefore they better understand uh the problems countries like india face  uh when uh forces for their own aim try to use religion  or language or race to try and divide and create conflict  but that's only one of the many dimensions  it is an input no doubt but i think the more direct input in this whole situation is their coming closer towards understanding of our position  therefore it's the question of terrorist  i decide in to put my case directly as a case has to be put we decided that they must have a full encounter with the evidence that we have of the involvement of our neighbouring country in the export of terrorrism in the funding and training of terrorist  and we share that openly with the british government yes this was an issue which was always rankling uh between us and the the signing of the expression treaty is an extremely significant and important one  and i am glad that they do realize the importance that we  attach to the type of systems perhaps perceived by us and not actually happening there  there assistants that was being given or at least the  nelson's eye being turned to the activities of terrorist in uh in britain  uh how do you uh evaluate this yourself ? no i put before the british government the perceptions that both india and britain are victim states of terrorist that both of us have to face the situation in a similar manner and that both of us us must collaborate in meeting terrorist  now britain came out clearly large and clear on the question of terrorism  the question was what do we do about it  when i reopened what was regarded as a close chapter on the extradition treaty  and what is more important the agreement on the confiscation of terrorist related and drug related ethics  i found for the first time when we had prepared the ground  and openess and there is activity in britain  and we have established a bi-lateral arrangement which may well pave the way for india to contribute to a global regime  against terrorism  this is very healthy very good  there are sir now also to the economic side i think that is yeah uh foremost in or mind   we'll have such old ancient economic links with  britain special ones  uh could you give us your own thoughts on this ? how do you see increase possibilities of increased  investments from uh british industries ? now i want to put them a little seperate to the nri  because the nri's have now become extremely important in england  and our nationals have really contributed very uh creditably to the development of britain's economy  and they're also greatly interested in india  perhaps uh some comments from you on both the sides  yeah  yes uh first let me speak about the nri and then the main stream investment potential from britain  uh to this acronym nri i've given i've  spelt it out as the national result of india  uh they are a tremendous resource for indian diplomacy  long ago when i was in parliament in nineteen sixty-two i took up this issue with the government  well the government did not regard it any part of their obligation to cultivate them or to regard them as indians now i felt that these children of mother india must be acknowledged because i found that in their heart there was very deep love and attachment to india  now nri's have done well  they would be a useful catalyst in our country  they would like to have a relationship which enables them to stay where they are and to do something for our country which they regard also as their mother country  now from that point of view they won't one word a nationality i have placed several proposals with regard to this whole concept to one word nationality and how it can be made operational i do hope that some decisions should be taken before long  but the nri's has a tremendous contribution to make both in terms of technology transfer in terms of investments in terms of contributing to the general climate for investments in our country  yeah  i would also say i would also say they have a very major role to play in improving indo-british relations in general   very much because they've become they've  become fairly active also on the  very much  yes yes  on the political side  and i think they're they are a group of people whether you call them nri's or people of indian origin i mean this what you call is debatable  but this group are ones which we should pay very much more attention to and i i'm glad that we are doing so  yes   that's true i made this my business to cultivate them  uh a very large significance uh eternal constituency of support  even if i take my job to be a credit to the people of great britain  they are a segment of that population  and in the modern world diplomacy has to relate to people and not only to the government  and they're a very important positive group for india  but that apart the nri have also one very important contribution to make and that is the constant positive projection of india among the people they live  and that is something which we cannot do on the same scale as they can  about the other hand the main stream investments here  about which i have great enthusiasm and great expectations or held that today because of a strong recessionary phase in the europian and the british economy  but had to understand that in this recessionary phase you cannot have received buoyancy  on the other hand for instance when it comes to nri  during the time when our foreign exchange reserves were at the rock bottom  ah britain the sterling area contributed in such an enoromous measure and such an unexpectedly large way that today from a reserve of one million or less which was very small we have a reserve of eight point eight million  this is the situation to which nri have made a very useful contribution  now the main stream investors the money managers the bankers or one word  but it takes a lot of time  britain is not only britain's financial market is a world financial market  and we have been able to make considerable impact on the city of london on the money managers on the potential investors to all thing that they cannot afford to miss the opportunity of investments in india  last year mr bhandari i've brought a very large group  of british investors uhm the top of the shares company  with their chairman their managing directors their financial advisors then attorney to all see india  and they went back with nothing but the most positive and optimistic reform  it had to take time  when this recessional the period of one word is much longer yeah but it's happening  uhm   yeah  well i would have thought may be because there is a recession  uh british industries and financial insitutions would be looking our for other markets and india yeah they are  india is the natural massive market and we have very weak advantage as far as britain is concerned that there is the uh the language is not a barrier we know each other  in fact we still adopt their own standard uh we have a one word their judiciary the one word administration therefore everything is there very conducive for uh increasing this yes we we and two countries relate very closely to each other and that is very important  this is tremendous awareness of the thing that the india is a natural ally india ia a natural country where to go for investments and this is a tremendous help  i think during the recessionary phase also the number of approvals applied for and granted or industries one word is very large  but so far as the economic one word is concerned  it would have to take a little more time and we will have to one word here a little more i have also hopes for relocations of industries from europe  into india  i am certain that joint ventures between britain and india would be a interesting reality in the world market  we will do very well if we established these joint ventures for the reasons you just now mentioned  but i think you cannot merely add up during a short period time play  the results of what we've already achieved  there is tremendous positiveness in the climate  it will take some time before we can uh harvest the crops  which will come out of this uh ma  massive efforts that we have made particularly in this  well the most important fact that is the question of the climate  if it is a climate of understanding and of co-operation of good-will of wanting to co-operate with each other   there'll be other exchanges follow automatically and i think it is in the interest of both britain and india  that we have a much closer understanding with each other  uh europe is going in uh for unification here there'll be problems  but the unification of europe uh with britain being a part of it will create uh both problems  and i think also opportunities  and uh relations with britain would play very major role not only on the bi-lateral side but also in regard to india's  co-operation and exchanges with europe  at the same time i think that greater understanding greater objectivity in the a few words these are the india and pakistan  is welcome and we see much greater objectivity now  this is welcome as such the visits of the home secretary and the prime minister are going to be extremely significant  uh it is also worth noting that even three years ago one would not have imagined that the british prime minister would be the guest of honour at the republic day  but he is going to be there in nineteen ninety-three  i have no doubt that he will receive a very warm welcome  and i also sincerely hope that uh these two uh very important visits would also pave the way for much greater and more intensive economic and other exchanges as also much better understanding between india and britain 
the accord took place under some very very special circumstances  to what extent was this this accession has the consent of people of the state  to what extent it has has the integration of the state into the union being possible ? and what have been the deficiency in this uh process of integration itself  and perhaps uh to examine these uh major question to which we must one word others if we are ever to find the solution to problems that faces us uh in the state  we could not have assembled a better panel of eminent expert  to my left is prof a r punjabi a well known law scholar  from kashmir university who is currently associated with uh the jnu uh in new delhi  to the left of him prof c p bhambri a well known constitutional expert and political scientist also from jnu  and to his left prof ravindra kumar historian and director of the nehru memorial museum and library new dehli   let's uh start at the beginning and go back to the whole issue of the accession itself before we come down to the problems of uh the present  at present it is it is uh the anniversary of uh the accession professor punjabi if i may put it to you this way to what extent do you think that the accession of jammu and kashmir to the indian union in october nineteen forty-seven to what extent did it have the consent of the people of the state  well you see this accession took place under various  special and typical circumstances  on fifteenth of august when two dominion came into existence that india and pakistan people of kashmir were too struggling to have  uh their own government  they wanted to end the autocratic rule of maharaja hari singh and uh they want wanted to speak with someone  and the struggle was going on  well in this independence act provided the opportunity to  the the prince state to accede to the either domain india or pakistan but the maharaj of kashmir was undecided on this issue he did not decide and uh he asked for time in the mean time he asked for a one word agreement  which was agreed to uh pakistan and india wanted some time and some clarifications  in the mean time when all these things were going on there was suddenly a tribal attack from the across the border of pakistan on kashmir  so this created a one word situation whereby some decision had to be taken and uh states defence was involved  but at the same time it was not the question of  maharaja alone  there was a very popular political party who had launched the struggle in the state for say since nineteen thirty-one  so therefore uh the accession took place under these circumstances  prof ravindrakumar if i may just uh get to you as a historian how do you uh visualize in this prospect the  struggle in jammu and kashmir of the national conference of uh sheikh abdullah ? i mean ho where is this placed in the history of our freedom struggle  in other words i mean is there a link between the struggle that was going on in jammu and kashmir and the struggle in rest rest of india for liberation from british rule of course there is a very close and integral link and i would like to add one or two observations by way of foot note to what my friend riaz has already said in this regard  i think the people of jammu and kashmir under the leadership of sheikh abdullah were fighting on two fronts  they were fighting the autocratic government of the ruling dynasty at the time and the same time they were fighting the british in kashmir as do the rest of south asia  so that it was this dual struggle which was carried on under the aegis of sheikh abdullah and the national conference party of those  particular days  i think it is important to remember that at the same time as  the state acceeded to the indian union a popular government under the leadership of sheikh abdullah was created in shrinagar the capital of the state of jammu and kashmir so that both the struggles in a way came to a successful conclusion  but uh it is also important to remember here that an assurance was given by the uh government in new delhi  as was true in the case of all sub-states say like junagadh  or hyderabad that the will that the decision of the ruler  would be backed at the later stage by an expression of will by the people of that state  and i think this in a way would make the accession truly  one word and truly firm as was done in subsequent years prof bhambri uh but don't you think i mean on the basis of what uh ravindra just said do you think that though something you see over and above distance uh accession in human history there were certain special circumstances which uh the other just explained and i think uhm perhaps you could throw some light on the fact that you see jammu and kashmir was treated on a seperate footing and the certain assurances that were given which were legal enshrined in a special status for jammu and kashmir in a sense give a very special status to the state  some argue that that is the root of the problem  i'll say that this is something which would serve as a model for the future  now where exactly do you think i mean what uh if uh was a special feature that were enshrined in the constitution were both of india as well as the constitution of the jammu and kashmir state which made the the special status or ensured the special status for jammu and kashmir  chander as ravindra riaz have very clear pointed out that instrument of accession was brought under special circumstances to provide first the one word foundations to confront the tribal raiders  at the same time even at that very critical juncture the historical developments of the content of struggle in a few words was ignored  they were always kept uppermost in mind  and once this raiders issue is resolved jammu and kashmir problem not special not particular but specifically in the context of historical development would be taken care of by the constitutional makers of india which were enshrined under article three hundred seventy  that is the provisions of accessions and with limited powers of the central government especially on the defence and foreign affairs would be taken of care of by central government and later on the democrate forces in jammu and kashmir as represented by the popular leaders under sheikh abdullah of national conference  would through their own democratic process form a constitution  and that constitution will provide them with the beginning of democratic involvement of kashmir society as far as the and a larger problems of indian polity of democracy  which was a construction of democratic technique as part of constitutional one or two word it was accomodation of special history  it was not a concession to call it even special  special means as a significant one word  it was not a concesssion it was a very legitimate one word  of the historically marked struggle  and aspiration of people to be satisfied democratically  and hence establishment of democratic polity in kashmir as a first step is under this constitution i see that riaz is getting impatient to one word also see i think uh we would like to push we should i think take note of two important things that one in nineteen fifty when the constitution of india was promolgated  now we have article one of the constitution of india which define the critical situation of india right  so by virtue of article one of indian constitution  jammu and kashmir state was placed in a part b state  because there were a b c d four categories of states  and jammu and kashmir fell in the category of part b state  uh that is those states which were not directly uh cannot have the impression of paramouncy but uh while the result of the process of integration  and in nineteen fifty-six of course in category b state were abolished so jammu and kashmir state fell in the category of part a state  that's one part of it  second part of it article three seventy which guarantee special status under the one word  now as far as article one and is concerned uhm  precisely because that article one was being debated in the constituent assembly  uh b r ambedkar said that there is one special feature about article one indian constitution that indian union is not a volantary union  secondly that no unit has the right to secede from the union so keeping you in mind that have article one whether this jammu kashmir state and the indian union one second is this what became perhaps the uh at the root of the tension between the state leaders and union leaders was the extent of other constitutional one word  because after determining the relationship constitutional relationship by means of article one of the indian constitution  uh then just as this is quantum relationship  but i think uh the quantum relationship was not fully defined to what was the problem i think there was some difference of perception as well  as for as the quantum relationship is concerned  you know because i i'm refering to article one because  very often that it is made important point of view often  and i think that it is perhaps in this context then george  corobel wrote the book uh danger in kashmir  he was member of uncip united nation commission india and pakistan  he said it is amazing that nobody ever raised this issue before security council either india or pakistan  that is perhaps the two words has report the article one one was recognised  sorry for minor interruption  the this question on article one in the constitution not only by dr ambedkar remaining others also showed awareness of some of this secessionist movement even healthy movement in other parts of the country also especially north-east india  so the assurance was given to everyone including jammu and kashmir the secessions are rejected  uhm yeah but it is not   yeah i i think i think this is an important point the one which you're making but i will also refer back to the  question of kashmir having a special status i don't think kashmir had any special status at all in the sense that one word state throughout the country there was an understanding by the national status who came to power in new delhi on the fifteenth of august nineteen forty-seven when the popular will of those who live in the princely state  would be affected in the case of kashmir uh article three seventy went as far as saying that in actual constituent assembly within the framework of article one to really define the precise nature of the relationship between kashmir and the rest of the indian union  finally i would think that when that constituent assembly made its announcement in nineteen fifty-two and fifty-three those announcement as has been suggested by riaz and one word shah but two words developing and changing uh announcement is not meant to be a static anouncement at all it was seen as a revolving situation  i'm transgressing my role as moderator but i can't do not quite agree what your observation on uh you know there have not been a special status because after all you see article three seventy  and you see from the things that are enshrined in it uh such as there being a separate uhm constitution for jammu and kashmir and some other some symbol of uh that that is there a separate emblem uh separate flag and uh of course no no i think you see these were uhm uh has was wasn't concession it as i said earlier see this could uh many people argue that this could serve as a model for for their for their future there have been demands from other parts of the country that article three seventy should be extended to other places  on the other hand there is other tendency which says that this  is three seventy is the root of this problem and because we had a special relationship with kashmir the integration of kashmir with the main stream of india was never uh complete chander uh uh how would you uh a few words   a few words  but i honestly want to say ke you're  misunderstanding my position what i'm saying is the communality lay in the declaration of the new delhi leaders  that the people's voice would be consulted throughout the region of princely states you know  of course the very fact that a constituent assembly was given to the people of jammu and kashmir means giving them uh a special status but that special status doesnot at all consent that the place  of kashmir and jammu and kashmir within the indian union or the  inter-media  of course certainly certainly not but uh what the focus of uh what we've brought perhaps i think you know is the time we suspect has come to see what  we've seen as uh happening in kashmir over the last few years actually i think uhm very very sad because in a sense that kashmir uh state have a special place in the heart of most indians and to see what's happened to the valley   it's something which you know pain all uh  those committed to democracy and federalism in this country  and considering that those indeed certain special provision made for jammu and kashmir  why ? why did this happen i mean what where  really we went wrong 
count down to the ayodhya climax is on  and if you will stand for a mixed metaphor the   everything is about to reach a crescendo in the next  four or five days and we have in this panel uh mr soli sorabjee a very well known lawyer and mr p upendra member of parliament i wish we to balance the panel we also had somebody  from the establishment and uh a member from the bjp that could have probably made for a more more meaningful discussion  but soli why don't we get down to the the basic point the legal aspect of it  uh the supreme court has set certain things uh just to  to clarify things for the viewers what is that the supreme court had said  and what are the implication of what it has said ? the supreme court has restrained any construction activity  on the site  be it of a permanent nature or a temporary nature  the supreme court has also directed that no construction material or construction machinery should be brought at the sight  at the same time having regard to the religious sentiments of the people  having regards to the fact the sculpture about the ram the supreme court has clarified that this restraint will not prevent  karseva in the form of singing of bhajan and certain religious versions  and that this part of the order the supreme court has emphasised should be publicised and made clear to the kar sevak  so that norm of the highest court of the land has prohibited and what it is two words  that is the net effect of the supreme court order as it is  today in force but even as you and i are talking uh there is a matter being before the supreme court now just now yes and   which is which which which is on what basically focussing on that issue  yes  well the petition is there i think you want to know what contengency plan the state government has  because assuming sincerity on the part of the state government  and assuming that they mean when they give an undertaking that they will see that the mosque is not damaged no construction activity takes place but the both thing they are out of hand  because after all all depends upon how many karsevak  gather  what sort of speeches are made by various leaders there ? suppose it leads to some kind of a frenzy or they result in a situation thereby the supreme court order cannot be comply  one word even despite the best efforts of the government  then what are the plans the government has i think that's  the application which is being argued at the movement   what're the plans they have ? how do they want to prevent any damage to the mosque what is your reading mr upendra because uh kalyan singh has said various things on this on this issue the chief minister of u p ? uh do you get a cacophony coming out of the bjp  camp ? or do you do you see a co-herent line of action being outlined ? no there doesn't appear to be very co-herent line of action  even among themselves  uh different tones are being heard  apparently there is a difference of opinion also among the  leaders of the bjp vishva hindu parishad bajrang dal  and others uh as it is that must be within the congress  camp also i mean there must be difference of opinion but more or less here the issue is very clear that  the mosque should be protected and the karseva should not be done in violation of the court's order  this was on this side the line of action is very clear uhm  but on the other side the matter has been complicated with the supreme courts effective intervention  and probably now the bjp the vishva hindu parishad the rss and the others involved in this are in a fix to decide what to do  they can't abandoned the karseva straight away and there has to be some action as announced by them  because by announcing the karseva even before the talks have ended even before the final round of talks are over on the november eight  i feel they have got themselve into trouble inavoidable trouble  had they waited for the final round probably this situation would have been avoided  and today a responsible particular leadership i have great respect for the leaders of the bjp who are no doubt patriots  they are very clear minded  and the bjp the major opposition party in the parliament running four state governments  for they can't turn down and say we don't uh accept the courts order so we'll defy the court orders   that's one predicament they are in  at the same time they have to keep up their own mandate of building the temple and going ahead with the construction  so they're in a dilemma yes just now  and two words  dilemma sorry one word go ahead yeah now it requires all the political sagacity on their part to get out of the situation and uh i must say appreciate the effective intervention of the supreme court   they've tried to save the situation both for the government and the the the other party  and one should take advantage of this position and wriggle out of this situation i don't know how they will do it in the next few days  do you agree with me that their intention now is to expand the  the the whole uh arena of uh shall we say contest and now mm mr advani is going to start from kashi kashi vishvanath  and i think dr murali manohar joshi is starting his rath yatra from mathura and they all converging converging in uhm  ayodhya on a certain date  is this do you think they're widening the area of contention or is this the only uh diversionary move that they have  ? no they they did a lot of explaining also both for the people and their cadres  uh in fact all they have to accept the supreme court orders and turn down the uh contest and uh turn down the action  they have to explain it to the people probably that is the part of is this part of their campaign probably these people have are going round the from the state  but uh if you analyse the situatiion in its entirety two years back when mr name government fell on this very same issue  the main issue was how to protect the mosque and today  the it has the problem has been extended outside the mosque  to the land acquired by the u p u p government on which they want to do the karseva  but the already problem has been now uh extended to outside the this  let's one word soli the other other area soli there is another case before the allahabad high court  on the acquisition of the land and the expectation was that a judgement should come before the dharam sansad of the force  uhm and therefore the one word  but apparently they i they have been uh now they are going to get the judgement only on the seventh   is is is that your is that your  understanding  uhm  well i don't know about fix case but in their acquisition proceeding the acquisition proceedings have been challenged on the ground that the land is not really acquired for a public purpose development of the tourism uhm uhm  it's challenged on the ground that it is for ulterior purpose but syeed what i want to a why did they arrange that the fact is that these orders are passed in interim nations  the allahabad high court has passed this order in it gives a decision  and they've been one word december but it may be soon thereafter  so i don't see there should be any difficulty on the part of any responsible political leader in complying with the supreme court orders which they do not construct till that time  and in the mean time as upendrajee said there is a dilemma created by their own uh uh doings and action which very well they were very respectable way of getting out of the dilemma by complying with the supreme court's order  because supreme court has announced us to its not its not complete this of the karseva  the karsevak's aspirations also can be fulfill they don't feel frustrated that they have it will  build up that they are going to karseva  okay have a karseva in a symbolic form  held in this particular manner  my uh problem is that why does i say we do not dump the sincerity of any of the person but suppose by their action or omissions they allow a situation to be created whereby the protection of the mosque may become very difficult  what i am trying to drive at is that there is still the responsibility on the part of the central government also to see that the mosque is protected lest any untoward incident may lead to unleashing of passions and argument   the state the state government in fact has complained that you've been rushing in forces without taking the state government into confidence what is the constitutional position of that one ? well that it is a debatable point formally there was a provision in the constitution i think it was article two fifty-seven a i may be mistaken i think it was that  which authorise the deployment of military or other arm forces in the state  now that has been deleted  but at the same time there is another constitutional provision which makes it the duty of the union to protect the state against the external aggression which is not here at all uhm uhm or internal disturbance that also one word will know internal distrurbance or to see that the government of the state is carried on in accordance with the provisions of the constitution  now one of the provisions of the constitution certainly is that the order of highest court has to be respected  if you do not respect the highest court's order if you flop the order of the supreme court then it is very arguable that you are not carrying on in accordance to the provisions of the constitution and that may enable the central government to take the forces but as i said i would not like to be dogmatic about it  but it's not a question if i can say so syeed on constitutional provision interpretation  uhm uhm  uhm uhm the whole question is to see that the whole things are very subject matter of the dispute if i may say so is not damage or destroyed when the decision is given  right no there is another point which i want to add here  on this very point today the home minister made a clarification in the rajya sabha  uhm uhm he said that the utter pradesh government was informed of the deployment of this additional forces in the state    that's why i don't think there is any scope for controversy no that mean it is a it's  consent was not taken as a consent is necessary as i've said but their one or two words really get great   but that a few words it's not uh two words  as far as that prior consent should be taken the state government must be informed central can move its forces wherever it want it wants  but deployment and usage must be with the consent of the state government   that's very clear  now the other question which you in fact did not answer  answer fully soli that this act interim order on the land acquisition now supposing this the high court says okay uh it it was a you did acquired the land for the right purposes and we agree with you  thereafter but the purpose for which the land was acquired was tourism and religious tourism and so on and so forth but if taking advantage of that you go ahead and do  karseva then are you violating a court order even so ? you know yeah the question is  depends on the terms of the court order  if the court order has restrained construction activity   uhm uhm till the decision is given then you violate the court order if you do construction activity  yeah   uhm uhm  uhm but syeed i think the crux of the matter is and  that's another thing which i think we should all apply our minds to  about why cannot the highest court either by way of a reference or under article one thirty-eight by enlarging jurisdiction uhm  decide that the basic issue  because now the controversy is narrowed  now the issue is a historical fact was there a temple on the site ?   uhm  uhm uhm was the temple destroyed ? and has the mosque been built on that site after detroying the temple ? because as far as i'm understood the muslim leadership has also accepted the position that if it is established   uhm uhm that there was a temple and it was destroyed then the mosque has no business to be on that place   uhm uhm  now that's an issue which is capable of judicial determination  i can't understand people saying court can't decide that that is something about religious  we are not here trying to ask to determine the birth place of rama or whether he was there or not there nothing of the kind just a historical fact which can be established one way or the other on the basis of evidence and   now if we go back on that point  i if last week i think it was that the whole debate started whether one point reference can be made to the supreme court ?
mr boris yeltsin of russia had an extremely successful visit to india last week  and such were the one word reception he got in the central hall of praliament when he addressed that august body that people were asking whether he is more popular in india than he is back in russia  during his visit he signed ten agreements  and it appeared that the old relationship between india and the soviet union which has collapsed with that counrty  now there appeared to be a new beginning with the new russia  now obviously russia is not the soviet union   india's relationship with russia has to be on a new basis uh completely different basis from that with the old soviet union  to discuss this we have with us two distinguished panelist  they are mr jagjeet singh who is the director of the institute for defence studies and analysis  we have mr vijay karan former director of the cbi  jagjeet tell us over all in the ter te   terms of structuring a new relationship between the two countries  in terms of the totality of the vision where do you think we stand with russia ? and how is this different from the old relationship with the soviet union ? well i think obviously as you mentioned very rightly   tha that there is something we also need to keep reminding ourselves that there is no soviet union  uh this is uh not totally a new country but substantively  new leadership new system new approaches have and which has  substantial amount of domestic problems the economic social political uh in the larger context of course it remains one of the  key uh great powers of the world much depends on how it's  own cohesiveness in all respects shapes up  uh but what what would have imagined uh swami that uh given the nature of the previous relationship and the fact that most of the people still are similar and the some fundemental uh geo-political realities  in fact this sort of visit should have taken place much earlier but still i think uh uhm coming as it does it is time does reflect hopes return to realism in moscow as well as a certain amount of  fresh thinking on both sides to to look at this relationship and try to build it up uh with the changed circumstances on the changed parametres  yes in fact i think the internal affairs ministry had made an official announcement about boris yeltsin coming almost one year ago  that's right and he never came and it was a matter of some embarassment  and i think a very large number of people had come to the conclusion look this is a terrible mistake mr boris yeltsin  no longer heads a super power he now head merely a poor country  and a one word of europe  that his main priority right now is to get as much aid and other systems as he can get from the usa from europe investment if he can from japan  and that he is now going to be in the struggle to re-establish himself with the west and japan and that he is no longer going to worry about old geo-political strategy which made india a national ally of the soviet union  and yes now that he has come in a sense people are once again  getting a whip of old nostalgia saying haan   that even if it's not quite the same love affair can we atleast hold hand  uh mr vijay karan how do you see this new affair developing  ?  haan  well i agree with you there were there was a state of uncertainty before he came because of the announcement that he will come earlier but he didn't come  at least that uncertainty has been re  removed and his visit has shown a certain degree of keenness on the part of the russian to continue good relations with india otherwise i doubt them first  the russians would have been so forth the russian president for instance so forth right on india's territorial integrity on  the kashmir on pakistan etcetera so i think also i would rather take the first step russia when you think in terms of uh may be uh another regional grouping in in the long term if it one word off the emerges of any other threat in islamic law emerging in the  one word in the horizon or the western powers again there are some problem so may be they wants want to keep india on the right side you know good relationship india a good relationship with india as as a long term measure  it is interesting point you're raising  alright suppose russia feels some kind of threat from an islamic block what role would it expect india to play then  well may be if let's say an islamic block emerges and it it becomes enemical to india because of say pakistan or bangladesh or together they otherwise i do not see an islamic block really posing a serious threat to india but because of pakistan and bangladesh if it poses a threat to india and if it also poses a threat to russia than there are there is we can do something one word  jagjeet do you think i mean there was an old  ge geo-political relationship based on the ussr as a global power yes actually russia is not a global power  and yet there is a point which vijay has just said about the potential of trouble in central asia  uh which is an area which so to speak divide russia from india  do you think this have a serious issue uh which has agitating minds in moscow and does it have anything to do with the new relationship ?  yes  uhm well yes and n n no   in the sense that yes there is a different sort of perception about central asia uh let's say about a year ago in moscow  uh but i don't think that's the reason for uh the  type of attempt to build up a new relationship it is perhaps just one more factor in that  uh the the fundamental has not really change  russia in fact they are not one or two words global power just any way except the united states from from their point of view especially particularly in that respect so  uh that way it is not too difficult to look at russia uh more in the nature of uhm another great country uh great power  whatever terms you want to use it which has not only its own interest but which needs to co-operate with the larger number of uh centres of powers and areas and regions uh then just japan uh north america and and west europe and that's realism i was talking of that there is a return to realism which then uh makes the whole thing possible to establish a new relationship  central asia is certainly an important point  but not that that that's the driving force i i won't say it's the driving force  well i said that because i think the russian president did mentioned that may be russia china and india could emerge as a force together and could work together that's what he mentioned in the press conference well much depend that one word certain significant  you'll know that the number of people who were very upset in india with the end of the cold war threat   we'll now be in a uni-polar world dominated by the usa alas rus the soviet union is no more  some of the thing to be getting excited about russia i think or perhaps we will no longer be a uni-polar world perhaps we'll be able to use russia or some other people  ally with them or with you're searching a broader  group along with china  but does it is is that realistic ? i mean is there any sense in which the uni-polarity of the world i mean i don't think the world is really uni-polar but clear   to the extent  right to the extent that the the usa is substantial  doc uh if not do not completely dominant power  do you think russia can be used by us in any sense  to break whatever dominancy usa may have ? well first of all uh uh as you've said i mean  i'm one of the people who believes that there was never this thing called a uni-polar world i one or two words  except the united states always always even during the cold war held the primacy amongst states and that primacy continues  and the question was soviet union has uh created a capability mostly military to countervail that that one so that's one that has disappeared  what he take the military power and the balance of power unfortunately was being seen in terms of military power once you take that factor away then you will start looking at the uh strategic and security economic political interest of states  uh i personally if i think which which we're which mean inclined to look at this issue from the point of view can we use a country of against different country i i think there are natural areas on which co-operation will take place whether the scope of co-operation is greater let us say between russia and india than it could be between aryo - russia and united states or india and the united states  uh if the the whole uh thing is there is in a way uh you know prosperity has become one of the new urgent necessity throughout the world in russia and india and in whole of asia and even in the united states for that matter  and that's been altering the the whole structure  i think that we need to look at the whole situation more in terms of areas on which co-operation will continue and areas on which   they there will be differences of opinion  our challenges are really how best to strengthen the areas of co-operation whether it is united states or with russia or china or japan or whatever  and to ensure that the areas of differences or divergences   do not are not allowed to become uh sources of controversial matter that's that's the only way of i look at it yes fine i mean as it's very very clear that there is no sense in which india can aligned itself with russia against the usa i mean jagjeet has gone out of his way to say any friendship  we've is not you can not be aimed against anybody else  haan  okay lets get to some nuts and bolt of the agreement signed here and of the specific policy statements made by yelstin here the obvious one is kashmir  earlier there was considerable uncertainty as to what was going to be russia's new position  we had even indicated if i'm not mistaken sometime ago  are don't expect that we shall continue what the soviet union use to do  and yet it would appear during his visit here unambiguously came out with support to the indian position  two questions first does it make any difference ? in other words given that the usa has given one word  to india's position various other all security council were driven to india's position  does it really make much of a difference that mr yelstin has  one word around to one word  question question number two uh since this is clearly a message in trying to get through to us  what is their willingness which take the climate which we can capitalize on ? mr vijay karan yeah i think that the first question that is about uh doesn't matter uhm the fact matter because you can't uh wish away i mean the soviet union is not irrelevent i mean it's one mustn't obtained that after the break up of the soviet union russia has become irrelevent as you mentioned it's still a strong military power  because as member of the united uh security council that does count in the world it might be weak economically  a few words it's own problem  a few words  and uh apart from the russian the american the american question is there on what they want from pakistan for instance pakistan has i mean u usa  has sent a signal to pakis a clear signal to pakistan on terrorism if a similar signal can go from the sovi  from russia to pakistan  that's a few words  yes it is good uh i think we need to move on to  one word somewhere to centre pace of the visit  this should be the resolution of the rupee   rubel dispute between the two countries  and i think if this had not been resolved co-operation and trade co-operation military measures would have been held up  and this is such a complex affair that it might be a mistake to get too deeply into it  but as i understand this extremely complex affair roughly twenty percent uh of the increase in the rupee value which should have taken place after december thirty first nineteen ninety-one has not taken place  to that extent there is a kind of rise of thirty percent of the debt which nobody is talking about   one word were given not talked about  of the debt that remains roughly one third has been  reschedule on extremly softer terms  where our debt servicing liability comes down by about two third  this has been held as an arrangement that is fair to all and  will arrange will enable our bilateral relations now to go ahead on the trade side on the credit side on the defence side 
another budget another hike  the railway budget for next year has proposed a ten percent increase in both passenger fares and freight rate  the railways of course justify this increase on the ground  that their input cost in the last one year have gone up  and despite the fact and despite their efforts to improve their productivity over last year they contend that an increase has become necessary  and unless they do this they will not be able to maintain their  operations as also provide resources for fresh investment  not many of course would share this perception  there would be usual criticism that the great hike will be inflationary  the cost of production will go up  there will be more burden on the consumer as prices of essential commodities will go up  and of course the rail traveller would have to shell out  at least ten percent more for travelling  the budget of course raises a number of issues whether  the hike is justified ? whether the railways can actually reduce the the  that prices in tariff ? can they accomodate by improving their effeciency ? are they using their resources efficiently ? are they deploying deploying their funds in the manner  which suits the priorities of the railway and the country at large ? are the railways investing enough to take care of the growing needs of the economy ? these and similar related issues we will look at in this discussion today  we have a distinguished panel  and on my right is member traffic of the railway board  mr shrivasan mr a n shukla chairman railway board  on my le on my left is  mr k n thakur former secretary planning commission and advisor  a principal advisor to the planning commission and mr p s anand  who is the financial commission for the railways  uh mr shukla may i may i begin this discussion with you   that considering the fact that the rate of inflation in the last one year has gone down  how do you actually justify the increase in freight rate ? particularly freight rate because last year when the rate of price rise was much higher you had increased rate by seven point five percent  this year when the rate of inflation has come down the freight has gone up by ten percent  surely your input cost the must have gone up by a much lower percentage  then how do you explain it ? mr bharati the railway finances have traditionally  been met from two basic sources  one is the budgetory support which the railways have been getting from the government  and the other is internal resource generation  over the last four or five years we have added a third force  and that is the uh sail of bond of the indian railway finance corporation  so basically these are the three sources that we have available to us  now you might be aware of the fact that the budgetory support  in the fifth five year plan was of the order of seventy-five percent this slowly went down to about sixty percent in the sixth plan and it has been steadly diminishing  we did come up with this new source that is the railway bond but unfortunately because of the you know the the unusual market conditions which have prevailed over the last one year or so  it was not being possible to sell these bonds although we have increased the the uh the interest rate of the bond from nine percent that which we used to sell them earlier to ten and a half percent  but there are just one word to this particular movement therefore when the budgetory support is diminishing it was uh thirty-four percent in ninety-two ninety-three  and it is going to fall to just fourteen point seven percent in ninety-three ninety-four  we have no option  but to raise internal resources if we are going to provide the necessary infrastructure for transport for the country the industry of the country as a whole to develop  there are no soft option  mr shukla you are you are suggesting that uh indirectly suggesting that uh the increase in freight rate and passenger fares  is more linked to the fact that budgetory support has gone down  rather rather than to the fact that your input cost has gone up  are you saying that there is no link between the cost of operations and the rate in passenger fare increased ? no there is a direct link  and i'll give you a very brief account of how our input cost have gone up over the last one year  that is in this this very financial year  the general increase in prices for materials and fuel  has been up the other for ten percent  the electric tariff that we've been paying has gone up as much as sixteen percent  and staff cost that the da uh uh the da component of the staff salary has gone up by twenty percent  and of course we have to make the usual three percent provision for increments  now if you add all this together  and add to it the fact that we are planning to to increase  the traffic output both in terms of passengers as well as goods by something like six percent  it would amount to an additional requirement of funds of the order of something like sixteen to seventeen percent really  now if you give a look at the figures last this this  year's already working expenses and the proposed ordinary working expenses for ninety-three ninety-four you'll find that there is just a thirteen percent increase  which means that we have a short some three to four percent  of the additional cost by higher productivity by cost cutting  and by various means there is another efficiency factor which i would like to mention at this very point of time that is the operating issue  the operating the issue of the the input cost divided by the income  in ninety ninety-one this was ninety-two percent and ninety-one ninety-two it came down to eighty-nine point five percent  in ninety-two ninety-three we expect to get eighty-seven percent though we had budgeted for eighty-seven point seven percent  and our planning for ninety-three ninety-four is going to be  eighty-three percent  so it is a combination of cost cutting and resource mobilization whereby we intend to generate the funds that we'll  need for investing into the transport infrastructure   mm mm mr thapar would you do you buy this argument that the railways have done enough to  cut down their cost  uh the economic survey of for this year  in fact mentioned that labour productivity in the railways is very low  and considering that it accounts for over fifty percent of their cost of operation  do you think there is hope for making more improvements and containing the increase in trade and passenger hike  i think mr bharati the fundamental question is what mr shukla was mentioning  this particular budget to my perception marks a water-shed so far as the role of the state is concerned in the development of the infrastructure  it also marks a water-shed so far as the pricing policy is concerned  it appears that the state has forsaken its role for the development of transport infrastructure and that of the railways  the figures which mr shukla mentioned they tell a story  which is very important and which gives a message that hitherto  what was funded by the state will now has have   to be funded by an organization  this raises the basic issue whether the distortions in the past whether the railways as an instrument of the government will be able to absorb that and at what cost   can we can we separate these two issues  i mean on the one hand you can emphasis the let us say the extra budgetary constraint on the railways that is the role of the state  and the link of the central budget and the railway budget  and second the equally important point of efficiency  now coming to the efficiency uhm uh it appears that the rate that the transport output has been increasing  but the productivity percent has not been increasing to mention it  there is a scope for the improvement  there is always the scope for the improvement in what manner it will take place over there that is one or two words   uhm   could you could you give some specific suggestion  the railways have to make sure that the technological  upgradation the pace of upgradation has to be accelerated  unfortunately we have hithereto all along concentrated on  uh calling a particular path and that is we send around the teams we we have a laborous process of uh acquisition of technology now the technology cycle are shrinking all over the world  by the time we wake up to take up a particular equipment  it's quite likely it has become an one word  but uh you know the fact that you are linking efficiency with modernization it actually poses a dilemma  you cannot modernize unless you get more resources the railways will turn around and say okay we have to raise the passsenger price and we have to raise freight price if we want us to modernize   one word i started at the begining mr bharti that when i mentioned that the state seems to be observing its role  of development of infrastructure you mean the railway should be continu   should continue to be subsidised by the central budget   it's not a question of subsidise  it is a question of state participating in the developmental activities  after all the railways are there to serve the national purpose we also know that there are historical distortions for instance  the uni gauge which we're talking of it is a multigauge of the past  which was built over there  we also know that the railway system was developed basically in the uh uh pre-nineteen forty-seven period for the export of the goods by the britishers from the ports  if you see the sweep of the railway net-hold it is largely oriented towards the ports  there are no connectors in between  now at the same time the railways have a dilemma they are passing through a phase of technological change   you're changing from steam to diesel diesel to electric now in this particular period if the state can  say that they are withdrawing themselves and leaving it to the  totally at the mercy of the organization itself to fend  and i'm afraid it will be very short sighted policy  and the important thing is what will be the one word  effect of the of this policy on the organization that's a very important point and i think we need to be able to talk about it the impact of that  what is the the railways point of view ? would they like to eliminate all this subsidies ? would they argue that the centre should bear all the subsidies ? how is it affecting their cost of operation ? how is it hindering their ability to contain the increase in  uh trade and passenger fare ? you see it is in this context that uh we have been able to persue the government to agree to uh withdrawing subsidies  on some of the commodities on which we have been traditionally giving subsidies for the last several years  there were there was sixteen commodities in which the subsidies were being given  and this year we are withdrawing the subsidies on four such commodities  i think that as mr thapar just said unless various means can be found to centrally fund the development of the railways  we will have no option but to resort to reducing the subsidies  and to plan to generating funds on our own  of course it is very correctly said that our efficiency factors have to be looked at very closely  we are looking at them very firstly  we are trying to improve the effiiciency i will give you one example our productivity of man power  in terms of one word which was at around two hundred and forty-four traffic unit per employee in eighty eighty-one today stands at three hundred and sixty-seven traffic units per employees that is just one of the efficiency indicated and this is the result of continuous efforts to upgrade the quality of the man power  and to to to to increase the proportion of the output versus the input  likewise that it is a fact that equipments arrears have been a major work of our not being able to achieve as much as we would have like to achieve  and we are tackling this on a on a i would say on a mission basis  could you could you tell our viewers that what would be the impact on the price of essentials uh as a result of the withdrawl of these subsidies ? because you have withdrawn subsidies on uh essential items like food grains pulses sugar oil uh what should be the price infact it has these measures it is it is not as why should the common man have to pay more for these i i'll give you a few examples  for a litre of kerosene oil for for a litre he'll  have to pay three point to seven paisa more per litre that that's total impact  for uh cement it is two rupees and twelve paisa per sack of fifty kilogram pack  for uh coal the increase is three three point three seven paisa per kilogram  uh tea eleven paisa per kilogram  the the the heaviest impose has been on sugar which is twenty-one paisa per kilogram  now that is the order of impact that this is going to have  but isn't twenty one paisa  pretty substantial  anything that rate should be a very more element per kilogram   on  no but the fact is that sugar has been very heavily subsidised in terms of transport  whereas i do not think that who is good as far as the total compensation is concerned to the consumer  and i do not think that the railway should be called upon to bear more than their share of subsidising the product  we have been bearing our share  what is the what is the centre's argument  against uh compensating for these subsidies ? no in fact the centre the centre is looking at it very closely  and i'm hoping that that is the discussion which we have had with the centre there might be a certain amount of relief forthcoming for some of these essential commodities but that we have to wait and see as to what they are able to do for us  mr anand don't you think that  you see we have we have got caught in very vicious circle  you increase frieght rates that pushes up the price of steel and coal and petroleum  and prices when prices of these goods go up you have  you're compel to increase uh your prices of weight  and this keeps on happening year after year  and we have actually witness them in last two in last two years this inter linkage between administered prices that when one price is increased everything else goes up and a chain reaction follow  so don't you think by actually pushing up your freight rate by ten percent you are not harming the cause of the economy ?  that could you not have made some effort to really restrain these price increase ? actually the freight increase contribute very little to the price rise 
 there're over fifteen thousand primary health centres and sub-centres in the country   there're over one hundred thousand sub-centres  located scattered throughout the country  life expectancy has gone up from thirty-six to around fifty-six today health care is available in urban and rural areas  plague and small-pox have been eradicated  malaria tuberculosis and cholera controlled  the general death rate has come down from twenty-seven per thousand  to eleven per thousand  infant mortality has declined sharply  much has been done  much more remains to be done  how far are we from our national goal of health for all  by the year two thousand a d  what new programmes are being evolved ? what is the present state of public health care in india ? these are some of the questions that we would like to put to our distinguished guest the union health secretary sri r srinivasan who is with us in the studio right now  we've also said to you a little while ago that we were expecting the presence of dr g k vishvakarma director general of health services unfortunately dr vishvakarma has not been able to join us he has possibly been held up somewhere  mr srinivasan thank you very much for joining us yeah  on the morning show  we're honoured and delighted to have you with us  so first of all may i on behalf of the family of the morning show congratulate you on your election as chairman of the executive board of the world health organisation  this is a tribute to you personally and to the country that  you represent   yeah   first the country especially thank you very much sir  mr secretary are you satisfied with the present state of health care in india ?  that's a very large question and uh  you know let's get this in perspective  i think you know every sixth human being is an indian  uhm uhm  so if you're going to get our health of india alright we're going to do an enormous of might of work for the health of the world  and uh in forty years something fantastic has been done as far as health care facilities are concerned   that's been an area of development  as you said earlier you know we certainly made a tremendous impact in death rates  infant mortality has certainly reduced much more today  death rates have also tended to decline but not to the extent we wanted  but of the sight of disease  our diseases are broadly diseases due to infection  diseases due to malnutrition and life-style   we've made a good bit of dent into that two diseases have been touched  diseases relatable to malnutrition is part of general economic development  as far as life-style is concerned like cancer sex diseases and so on  but this is an urban phenomenon largely  if you ask me what are the brighter parts so far  i mean certainly we've done well in leprosy  every fourth leprosy patient in the world is an indian  and every fifth leprosy patient in india is a child   it's very enormous burden  and by the year two thousand it may not may  be possible to eradicate it   it's certainly it would be possible to have a tremendous dent because of the multi drug therapy  which gurantees you complete freedom from leprosy in about two and half years  mr secretary you've talked about the brighter spots on the health being kamiyan kaun kaun si hai ?  kamiyan to saheb thi hai ek to hai  malaria ke bare mein  malaria ko hamne hataya  ab kafi door tak chalagaya sirf ek wapas agayi do teen karan  ek karan hai jo daviyaan pesticides thi unki resistance ho gayi uhm  doosra hai ke water bodies development se chalti bahut  one word hote jarahe  aur infected log to itne migration  hota hai labour population ka  infection ek jagah se doosri jagah parasite chala jata hai  as you probably know malaria is different from mosquito available  uhm  yeah  there may be mosquitoes with no malaria  but when the mosquito carries the parasite and injects it into the blood system then the man becomes infected  and there is another aspect i think people who understand and want to discuss about public health issues in india must remember this  that for the poor people health is not a priority  priority is illness  and how to get out of sickness as soon as possible  so if you don't have the full regimen of medicine you get back incompletely cured  malaria comes back then you raised this question of about the poorer sections of society now in every developing country i presume there is a certain dicotomy between the level of health care available in the rural areas  gramin kshetra mein jis prakar ke haspatal hain ye health care hai aur jo urban areas milte hai  why does one have the impression that it is particularly acute in india ?  nahi saheb  dekhye we're confusing two issues   there's the issue of rural health infrastructure and rural health needs versus urban health need  though the poor in both areas deserves the same  this question has been tackled in our planning   we've done well not enough   we're going to do more   yeh nai government ki niti hai ke jyada se jyada rural areas mein resources banao   health to state subject hai aur  state ki planning mein minimum needs programme mein public health programmes mein  jyada se jyada rural infrastructure badate jayen  but you see you should not refuse the creation of rural health infrastructure  but what is has come to be known all over the world as the primary health care approach  what is the difference ? in one case we create infrastructure to reach people dispensaries haspatals sub-centre nurse midwife doctor  but in the case of primary health care approach woh kaheta hai ke jyada se jyada jage de  let people get access to medical aid from the simplest sources   kahene ka matlab hai you must be able to get eighty-five percent of the normal illnesses treated at the nearest health centre you don't have to go to a hospital uhm  you also don't require a specialist  you must understand that there are three issues here  one is the issue everybody must take care of his health government can't take care of his health  second is a community by itself can do a lot of self-help  it has been done  the third is everybody do not be taken care of by a specialist ordinary doctors ordinary para-medicals the health system  can render a tremendous amount of care as near as possible  now primary health care approach involves rural in   infrastructure  but it is not only rural infrastructure uhm it is a philosophy that you can take care of your health  community can have a lot of self-help in health and government can supplement by making available health facilities  now one important facility there is health education  so people can't take care of the health unless they know what to do about it  uhm  right  ek iske saath sambandhit sawal yeh hai ke hum ne aksar dekha hai jo hamare doctor hai chikitsak jo hain woh gramin shetra mein jakar kam nahi karte infact i think jee saheb  was complaning about this jee saheb   deepakji aap bilkul sahi kar rahe hain balke main to yahan tak kahoonga ke dilli mein bade haspatalon mein jo doctor hain agar unme se kisi ki kisi ka tabadla dilli ke kisi gaon mein hojaye to uski ek hi koshish hoti hai ke kis tarah mil milakar apna apni transfer jo hai woh shaher mein   karwa le   how how would you tackle this problem ? no of course not let me say it is not true  first of all i've been on behalf of the doctors well i think mind you there can't be any public health programme in this country without the leadership and complete involvement of doctors  how can that absolutely   absolutely absolutely  the doctor has to be the leader of public health  and he must provide the linkages in public health  after having said that i would say a very large number of rural areas are serviced by doctors  circumstances differ from state to state  if you went to a state like madras or maharashtra or even bengal a large number of people work in rural areas uhm   magar sawal yeh hai ye doctor jo hai kafi bade acche kisam ki education ke prapt karnewale hain no we've the best doctors in the world i mean everbody accept that   and they've been trained i think in conditions which require certain amount of infrastructure for them to function   they've a family to live   they've some kind of education of children and so on  since they're exceptionally gifted uh professionals  been given a good course of education there is some reluctance in a part of them to go to rural areas  a large number of things have been done by government we have allowances we've incentives we've  created houses quarters and so on as part of the pri  primary health infrastructure scheme  i think gradually as development increases excess increase of his own system increased doctors are in fact available  mind you may i also say this that as against about four lakhs of doctors three and a half lakhs doctors of the allopathic system  there're about four lakhs of wise render hakims  and so on  they are already available in the rural areas  so it's not as if the rural areas is totally without any medical help  but allopathic modern system of medicine with a backup of dispensaries and drug etcetera is spreading perhaps somewhat slowly mr srinivasan one other question this is regarding the availability of medicines   hum ne dekha hai ke nakli dawayiaan bazaar mein bahut bikti hai  now what is the position what you're doing to control this ?  saheb you see you know it's  very difficult question to answer  first of all prescription vary  there are cases where nakli dawayiaan asal mein  definite asal mei hai if i may say so  but bahut si jagah pe what you say is  nakli dawayee is in fact dawayee which tested by efficacy test does not measure up  tested by bio availability test is not measured up  it is not uh totally uh a kind of uh it's it's  misleading in it's effect it claims more than it does  the reason for that is the quality of good manufacturing  that have to go into this is improving slowly  but again please don't lose the perspective  we produce about three thousand crores worth of medicine   two words i think a good part of it comes from large industries  good part of it comes from well run small industry  i would say that there that medicine is as good as anybody else but yeah there are black sheep and the only way to do it is to have drug regulatory action  now drug regulatory action has to be within the law  so we must have drug inspectors more laboratory facilities  what is more important or more acute consumer consciousness you mentioned a little while ago that the present emphasis  the present priorities on health care in rural areas   what're the new concepts and technologies and this will be my last question ? yeah but you see technology wise certainly the early detection has an approach uhm  take cancer for instance  cancer of the breast cancer of the cervic for women oral cancer for men  i think it's possible to have lot more of education given  to people to school teachers  so that they can detect either by the help of a friend or by themselves  what is it that requires treatment ? and it's now clear for instance in cancer if you detect early you can get it completely cured  take for instance oral health and dental health  as a country we wash a lot  inspite of that our oral health is declining it's  possible for us uh to get so technology is going to be not tremendously different from what is known but health education  involvement of people getting people to look after the health is part of the primary health approach would be the main issue mr secretary will we have health for all by two thousand  ?  it's very broad question and what do we mean  certainly we'll have much creative control over disease some diseases definitely   we'll have much creative effective immunization of children against preventable diseases  we would have i hope much greater positive awareness of health  and my own personal feeling is i hope that people would be encouraged to take care of their own health and medicine would stand  somewhat demystified thank you very much sir for joining us on the morning show and sharing with us your views and perspectives about health care in india past present and future we appreciate your presence thank you very much indeed 
 recording broken  he was born to a wealthy landlord  he got good education and got well-paid cosy job with the planning commission  but he soon realised that the fruits of planning and development did not really reach the needy  he was disillusioned  his restless soul drove him to the solitary solitude of the himalayas  but even the life of sanyasi disillusioned him  so he decided to go back to andhra pradesh to write a book on the tribals  but what he saw shocked him  he saw woman being yoked instead of oxen  enough was enough he decided  he gave up the idea of writing the book and decided to work for the welfare of the tribals  he became their liberator  he is p k s madhavan   let's meet him   let's hear more about him his experience and the voluntary organisation he set up from him  mr madhavan could you tell us about this volantary organisation  aware which you set up ? in nineteen seventy-five when i moved into andhra pradesh  with the interest of writing a book on tribals  i did a small research in one block where about five thousand tribals were given about ten million rupees in a government programme  and once our former prime minister was telling only twelve percent of the money reached people  my research in that particular block i found only two percent reached people  and ten years we made all efforts to see that these people come up but i found that why this is happening ? millions of rupees were put in  why people are not responding ? and i discovered people are not part of planning not part of implementation not part of evaluation  so i thought writing a book is an intellectual exploitation  i get my name i get my doctorate but people are not going to benefit out of it  so i said i'm not going to write a book   i'll create awareness among the people so that they will decide their future  so with that intention i started this organisation aware how did you realise that only two percent of the planning and development really reached the people ? you see when i tracked the money where it has gone i found out sixty-two percent has gone to maintain the administration bureaucracy and other things  and about thirty percent of the money has gone by middle man  corruption and commission etcetera  seven percent of this money reached poor people  so i felt atleast seven percent reached  when i investigated five percent of this money was misused by the people themselves  so only two percent reached people  so this is the fate of our planning and implementation  then what will happen to our country ? so i said why this is happening ? people must be able to know what they wanted ? where they live ? what their future ? so people's participation is a fundamental necessity  for any development how did you make people participate in your ventures ? how did you draw out the meek tribals into your work ? in the beginning people did not trust me because i'm a new person and i'm talking a different language and they did not believe me at all in some place there was an opposition  people thrown threw stone at me  in one village they want wanted to shoot at me as with the arrows  but persuasion continuous meeting and explaining them and motivation has helped me after six months eight months to people to understand there is a man who is talking about them and trying to help them  so that is how i just tempted and also i used telling the stories to the children meeting the women talking to the elderly people  slowly i became friend of them and they started accepting  how do you communicate with the tribals ? in the beginning i was talking a a with the  help of a interpreter a local man  normally a vested interest their opinion maker  slowly slowly when i was able to observe the their problems i started directly talking to them  childrens were first my media  when elderly people i used to talk to them  ramayana i used to talk to  mahabharata  some of the stories of tribal culture that is how i became friend with them  and i never expected anything from them  i never asked them to do anything  simply discussing becoming friend  so slowly they took me as a friend and then they started telling their problems  what was your first impression of tribals when you really met them in nineteen seventy-five and what is your impression of them now ? you see my expe my assessment of this poverty in our country is poverty is a conspiracy  and always people think by giving money poverty can be removed it is not true  to remove the poverty what we need is courage psychological make up people must prepare themselves  and among the tribals they are meek they are afraid of the new people they don't understand what exactly happening and they are very traditional they are away from the communication  and even the small communicators were exploiters  so as a result they did not respond to the real development of our country and what is their state now ? now after fifteen years of my entry and my one word work perhaps what i can say is that what we have done is to explain to the people what government is doing for them  what government infrastructure  infact in the whole of the world our country has got an excellent legislation  always in favour of poor  our constitution our legislations always in favour of poor  but this has to be translated into action  and we have an excellent infrastructure meant for the poor  but it has to be implemented  so may be the aware's role is to explain to the people to utilise the infrastructure to make use of the law for their own social transformation and economic betterment  do you mean to say that the infrastructure that the government has created for the welfare of the backwards and the tribals your organisation plays a key role into passing the benefits to the  tribals and backwards ?  yeah  the motivation explanation bringing the people near to the government infrastructure asking them to fight for their rights  asking them to utilise the existing infrastructure  i will give an example there is a rural back in a village and uh government has got four percent differential rate of interest  nowhere in the world we've got such a infrastructure but people goes go to a landlord and take money for six and forty percent interest  why institution is there why people are not able to utilise it because people must know that institution is meant for them  they have right to utilise that institution  i ask these people i organise them to the bank educated them  asked the bank to help them and i brought bank and people together  landlord or the moneylender disappeared  what can be the role of a voluntary organisation vis-a- vis the government institutions ? see nobody should ever come to a conclusion that voluntary organisation is going to replace government it is it is meaningless  the voluntary organisations are always the forerunners the pilots  who can experiment who build innovative programmes  we can bring the people and government together  so the role of voluntary organisation is a complementary and supplimentary efforts of the government welfare programmes  that should be the spirit of voluntary organisations  educate the people create awareness ask to utilise government infrastructure  ask the government also to understand people  so they must be catalyst between the people and government  your organisation aware in how  many states do you operate and how many villages are you covering ?  we were work we started our work   in andhra pradesh  so we are now in covering about two thousand three hundred villages in andra pradesh  about eight hundred villages in the neighbouring orissa these are the two uh states where aware  is concentrating  but we've got pilot projects in kerala tamil nadu  karnataka and uttar pradesh  may be shortly next year we may be starting our programme in manipur also  but how do you decide that which village needs your attention and where do you need to go to help the people ? in the present area we're working in a particular area  so we're expanding literally like this because  now aware is a known organisation hundreds of villages are coming asking us to adopt  but we don't work in an area more than eight years  we withdraw make people themselves be free and indepenent of aware  they have their own future they must've their own plan and they should not depend upon aware  once we withdraw from thousand villages we expand to another thousand villages  like that we're spreading  in a place like kerala and tamil nadu and other places  where there are tribals because my organisation is working for the tribal welfare and we are also including harijans  also harijans and tribals are two communities whom with whom we're working  so wherever there is such people like in uttar pradesh  there is a lot of child labour bounded labour   mirjapur district where we are working  similarly in vainad in in kerala where tribals are there so wherever the tribals are there where there condition is very bad our organisation is trying to set up a project there  which one has been your singular achievement ? when were you really touched by the apathy shown towards the tribals and which you feel has been your achievement in the last fifteen years ? in nineteen seventy-five i have seen tribals are  yoked to the tribals are tied to the tree and beaten black and blue  and no law enforcing agency has two words  one thing which i cannot forget is once when i was going  i've seen two women yoked like a oxen and made to draw the water from the well  and i reach landlord and asked them why this is happening ?  it's a cultural oppression he didn't had any feeling for it  he said yes  and that among them one is a pregnant woman  i thought if it is my mother and it is my sister what would have  been happened ? if landlord's mother and sister can he yoke like that  ? so that was a a very disturbing fact in my life  then i said no this cannot continue this is our independent india and i what i thought is  the poor people loss their dignity they are meek  there is a conspiracy to keep them always poor by giving the alcohol and other things  so now let them discover their dignity  let them feel that they are equal citizens in this country  that is where my motivation awareness creation training camps mahasabhas all those thinkers made them to realise  they are equal citizens of this country  today a tribal fifteen years ago a tribal used to run away when he see saw me today he can reach the gates of the chief minister and knock his door and ask him to hear his problems  that's the greatest satisfaction for me do you feel a sense of pride when you realise that you have been you've been able to give them this kind of sense of dignity i i do not say pride but i feel so happy so content in my life perhaps i would have never achieved anything more than this  today a bonded labour who was beaten in my presence is the president of mandal praja parishad what more i  wanted want ? for two years you led the life of a sanyasi   why did you give that up ? see i thought i must find out some meaning in my life  i thought spiritualism is one of the main  so i became a monk and i was uh with monks  i met a number of great people great mahatmas  but what i found is they do not have any solution for poverty and sufferings of the poor people  they have some solutions which for your next life nobody has seen it  and i also thought many of these people are expression of capitalist system  the rich peoples agents  i said no my precious life should not be wasted in these debates i must do something action  that action must remove the suffering of the people  that is what swami vivekananda said it  perhaps what swami vivekananda did i said i tried to translate in action  uh what role what is the role of women when uh uh  they are the receiving and when they are trying to get the fruits of development ? see always in the in the development woman was kept as a second rate citizen   it's very unfortunate  but i learnt many things from the women themselves in my own project area  to be very frank in aware women are the  leaders of programme   i'll give one example  always government is giving some money   aware is also giving some money  banks are giving some money  so i spoke to uh a few women i told how long you are going to recieve the money can't you create money among yourselves  the discussion went on for two hours  and they came out with a small programme which was very very encouraging  they call it as chitanya nidhi's  programme  each one of them pay five rupees in a week  and fifteen must become one unit  and then two hundred and fifty they collect i give two fifty out of five hundred rupees four fifty is given to one woman as a loan which she pay back next week  like that in thirty seven weeks the so called poor woman  could collect one crore forty seven lakhs rupees   so you can see the poor is only our term  poor is potential and they could keep such a money and then it is revolved among them  thirty-seven five hundred women are beneficiary of this programme today  india is rich in human resources   we've so much of talent amongst ourselves  now having worked for fifteen years what do you think should be done so that more and more villages are drawn into this kind of  development process it is my emotional feeling always india cannot be a poor country  with eight hundred and twenty million people we must be richest people  what is happening is the human resource is not planned  developed and utilised  we are always thinking of the economics money material  matter  but this so called rich resource we've got has to be utilised so perhaps my next to ten years work is i'm  going to plan in one block or one samiti where all human resource will be planned utilised and developed so that that block must be self-sufficient  so budgeting human resource is one of the important thing we must take uh into notice in the our planning  if somebody wants to join your voluntary organisation how does one do that ? welcome  we we always like people there are a number of people who support aware   friends of aware members of aware   and we've an ideology like this where through awareness development is brought and unless development is a  people's movement development has no relevance  or if the development is meant for the people or poor and poor must be the captains of the development  these are all our expectations  in another thing in aware uh we always think this alcohol is a conspiracy to keep the poor people always poor what is the full meaning of aware ?  aware stands for action for welfare and awakening in rural environment  do you want to confine yourself only to the rural areas or work for the poor in the urban areas as well ? for last fifteen years we worked only in rural areas  now we thought it is also necessary to get solidarity of the urban poor to support you see today our country is passing through a transition   the already for last twenty years ten percent of the rural population migrated to the urban areas  and urban areas is not our culture  rural civilisation is our culture  so in order to prevent urbanisation slums and other problems  we want to take care of the people in urban area itself developing the rural people so next year we may perhaps move into little bit into urban area where poor people comes and migrates and struggle for their life  what is your dream regarding these people what do they  you really want them to become ? what do you want to see ? in my life i would like to see the whole of this caste system which is conspiring to the society's underdevelopment to be removed  where a tribal a harijan or a  brahmin or anybody are equal equally share the responsibility of governance of this country  and my dream is mahatma gandhi's dream a  gram swaraj  village that stands on its own leg and its own self- sufficiency  i believe in mahatma's per  perfect theory of making a village a gram swaraj  that was my dream well mr madhavan's dream is also that of a  gram swaraj the same as mahatma gandhi's  we wish him all luck in his endeavours  thank you for being with us thank you 
mrs jamuna is a congress-i member of parliament representing rajamundri east godavari of andhra pradesh in the lok sabha   this is her first term as a member of parliament  but her talent is multifaceted  long before she face the people she was facing life  studio life  yes she is a famous film personality of andhra  but she is known beyond andhra as well  those of us who remember the film milan   cannot forget her award winning performance as gauri  but apart from occasional stories into the hindi cinema she has largely restricted herself to telugu cinema  although she has also acted in tamil and kannada films as well  jamunajee considering how many films and how films have been  making politicians in the south it must have been smooth sailing for you isn't it ? yes of course because uh being a cine artist uh we use to are more accustomed to public  because uh as a cinema artist we use to go into the masses and uh for shooting and for for public meeting as a social workers also we have a lot of contact with uh public in cine life  so naturally when we have become a uh politician i think uh it's not much difficult to uh do our service as  one or two word our politician when did you actually entered films ? i was so young i think uh nineteen fifty-two i was just fourteen years may be  so i entered into the film fray as a heroine in the first picture itself  one one word uh  one word i'm sorry  uh my first picture was the name  foottillu that means in hindi you can say  maike  in nineteen fifty-two one mr uh late raja rao he introduced me to the film  he hails from uh rajamundri constituency which i'm   now presenting as a public servant  so he introduced me to the film as a heroine first  we know that you have for thirty years played a leading role in cinema  especially that you have always played a leading actress  how many hindi films have you made ? so far i have acted uh nearly twenty twenty films  in hindi  my first hindi film was uh naya aadmi  and that was superhit film in those days  and then second picture miss mary   third was uh humrahi  fourth milan  fifth rishte-nate beti-bete   and then dulhan uh so many films and rajtilak recently i acted with uh sanjeev kumar in yadgar   and uh naukar bibi ka  like that so many films i acted  yeah the song that was picturised on you bol gori bol tera kaun piya that was a very famous song  laughs yes of course  that was uh milan picture  i received a filmfare award from for   milan best actress award in those days  i think i'm the first south indian star to receive a filmfare award as a best actress in milan    now that you've become a member of parliament is it true that people are now wanting to see more of your old films  yes especially uh become mp all our mp's  collegues are uh very much interested to see my films old films they are asking me uh jamunajee kahan milte hai apke  films apto bahot purani kalakar hai  how can we get your hamarahi milan   ? i said i will try to bring some old films for you i will give it as a presentation to everybody  i was trying to get hold of my old films   one or two words you know that old films are very precious to get yeah  we also know that you have been active on theatre front  uh you're also the president of the andhra pradesh professional theatre group  what are your activities there ? you see as a artist also i acted more than two hundred films  we have acted such a wonderful characters unforgetable roles  uh even as a old lady uh and then uh sufferring lady just like mother india  i did mother india character in telugu version which nargis did in hindi version  so it's a very beautiful motherly character  so such a types of characters i acted  and then after that i thought of to   do some uh work for uplift of these old indigent  theatre artist  because cinema is uh fundamentally we should act in uh dramas only from dramas only we have become a very famous actors in films you see  so one should not forget theatre at all  we came from theatre we hail from theatre  we have learnt acting on theatre  so i want to do service to theatre artist i become a uh president of ap professional artist theatre federation  it is uh uhm state level body   i have we have got more than ten thousand members all over the state andhra pradesh  and the president for that for the last fifteen years while acting also i was so busy as a artist even then i used to uh give lot of service to the especially this old indigent artist giving pensions and then getting house one word for them  and uh to improve their art to use to give a lot of encouragement  still i am continuing as a president of professional artist theatre federation   i'm returning to the subject of films  why did you discontinued uh your film career  yeah   film career   laughs  naturally after uh becoming a politician i want to give full uh justice to my uh profession  i i don't like to put one leg this side one leg in film field and one leg in politician as a politician  i think we can't do any justice to our performance so i want to give up my film career due to uh po  politics  but your family compulsion as well  no not much  because my husband is a very co-operative man  and then sm smoothly going my family life also  i have married to my uh my husband is a professor of zoology at osmania university  i got uh one son and daughter  so life is going smoothly  they must also be very fond of your old films i am sure  laughs  there is one question about film i wanted to ask you  do your fans feel still as the screen image that they have of you ? or do they know that you only act perform roles ? how do they react to you when they see you in person ? naturally they are uh very much excited to see as a person because uh being a veteran artist for thirty years uh uhm for example i can say at my rajmundari constituency i used to go to to very rural places  so there they were just like uh they are worshipping as a goddess  so after seeing me naturally they will get lot of uh excitement some people especially uh lady character  i have got lady fans more than uh gents i think so  so they used to embrace me and kiss me they said oh jamunajee we never thought we'll see you  uh like this  so we are very happy we'll vote for you and then you must do good work for those our uh you should solve our problems i said i had given a promise  so that excitement will be will be there  not on uh cinema has been contributing uh to very large extent  in the south especially it has been throwing up some very interesting  uh politicians  why do you think more and more politicians in the south take to  uh sorry more and more film personalities in south take to politics ? i think as a citizen of india every citizen has  a right to become a politician  politician means not only a uhm getting some money or getting fame  we can do service to the public  as a democratic country we have got uh every right to every man and the woman and every citizen of india they got a right to enter into the politics there is no restrictions for that  but does their screen image really help them ? sometimes in this that is image is there  that glamour will add our political   in this  does it make your canvassing easier ? not easier  just like other a few words canvass because now-a-days  uh uh political situation and especially rural masses also there public has uh got uh political awareness  now they are not uh so easily there now we can't attract them with glamour all those things  the glamour will be there but one should not work one word  very hardly then only we will win  otherwise not possible in this modern world where we have television we have news magazines where they keep telling us that an actor the role that he performs is just a role he is in fact a simple man like us there are still these images that people have  how do they maintain how does a man maintain his image ? the film ? yes  you see the film uh maintaining the image one should have certain principles in personal life also  and then he should uh take good characters representing  some social problems economic problems with a rural character representing poor family's character  then if uh act uh if he acts like this he can maintain his uh good image in film field also long long standing image like me i had so many variety characters  what kind of screen image did you have ? i had uh very good image otherwise i think i should not say myself it shows uh little bit embarassment  even then i have to say to public that i am i think i am the first lady to act in two hundred not two hundred films as a heroine  thirty years as a leading lady of south indian screen i can say so like that i got that image in public how many of your films have won awards ? out of two hundreds may be nearly hundred films state awards and then national awards  while national awards one word to come to delhi very often  and mrs gandhi was there information and broadcasting minister  a few words  and then state awards for so many films  which is the highest award that you have got ? i think in hindi film milan   is uh highest filmfare filmfare award is there for me  and of course in andhra pradesh if we state awards and best actress award in telugu films i am the first lady continously nine times i have been elected as a best actress award  welcome to the studio and thank you for being with us  first of all when we talk about parallel processing and super-computers what are these things ? super-computers really the amount of data number it contains  the good old days about thirty years ago big two garages will contain things with small capability now it comes it control about ten crore of operations ten crores the hundred mega flops you see  in one second that's type of that is super computing why do we need it in india ? we require it for weather modelling pollution monitering  variety of things where ever you need too fast too big these things if you want to look at you have to now crunch the numbers very fast  do it and then see what it means  it has a lot of uh uses in these  lekin super computer ko banane mei kharcha bahut hota hai rajan saheb  is this expenditure justified ?  jyada nahi haan yeh jo sidhaant mei jo development hoti hai uski  thirty-six crore ki cheez hai aur uska jo usse  benefit jo hota hai ke agriculture model  ho water modelling ho seismic modelling ho aur reactor ki safety  ho dam ki safety ho  so itne hain ke woh fed-up ho jayega  iske upar bahut sare uh computer software se karne hai woh itne hojayenge ke pura society mei hona chahiye  abhi kuch das saal ke uh agle jee saheb ke liye bahut sare  robot bhi ho sakte hain jo translate  karenge laughter hopefully so knowledge ko itni tarakki jo data process karne uhm  the computer parallel process ki bauchhar hogi   uhm  we we don't want him to be replaced by oh no no no not remove him not him  jee saheb has to   jee saheb to bahut sare ka use  karenge accha aur thoda haan tum karo abhi yeh tamil mei baat karo nahi to doosre mei baat karo woh kar sakte hain woh to future generation  accha  and you know since we you know jee saheb  and i are a bit ignorant about technical terms   yeh parallel processing would you like to explain in in simple uh terms   okay  the computer for past thirty years has been doing do one uh competition put it in a memory do one competition put it in a memory it does it very fast but that has a limit  when we are thinking in terms of tons and crore   that is hundred million two hundred million five hundred million type of operations per second then this slows down the process so you do it in a different multiple persons many brains using in harmony  so actually some computer people say tyranny of the central memory will be gone  many many places they all do it in parallel  so you can handle large amount of data that is parallel processing  it is essential to advance super computer in later stage mr rajan you're closely involved in monitoring the development of uh this technology in india how far away is india from its own super computer ? not very far  these works which are taking place in c dot c tac then there are the number of parallel processing of course in n a l indian institute of science d r d o barc c m c l they are all doing very well  i would not like to see in terms of number of years of first and second two or three  but in terms of one using the software for various uses weather forcasting modelling etcetera  as well as for these  they are quite in contemporary to the needs of our country we should be able to meet most of it in the coming years how far developed how developed is india's  technology in this field compare to other countries ? contemporary i would say not more than in fact this technology is itself only four five years or seven eight years old  so we are very close to those things some of it's developments  and once we've the super computers how will you  mr rajan use it ? oh there are number of possibilities say my job is technology forecasting  there are so many things which can be done whether it is pollution monitering even heart stimulation  do anything which you want to look at before designing a car  before designing an aircraft you want to see  do the design there let it crash and see  so you can one word build a dam you want to look at safety anything can be done in the computer without spending any money  then you look at it then you perfect the design  many of these things though i myself would not be uh using it in that form  there are many hundreds of young men and women in the country  who will use it and then they will export even the software  mr rajan one last question  gaze into your crystal bowl after the super computer in india  what next ? artificial inte intelligence   fifth generation computer   that's what i meant jee saheb he can have hundreds of them  how many other that's right  you're obviously excited about the developments taking place  thank you  and we certainly have shared the excitement jee saheb jinhone bataya super computer ke bare mein   haan deepakji bas mei itna chahata hoon ke  science technology super computer ka labh hum tak hum aam logon tak chhoti tabiyat ke logon tak jald se jald pahoonch jaye  yehi rajan saheb aap ko bata rahe the  our guest this morning was mr y s rajan adviser in department of science and technology   we've been talking to him about the exciting break through in the field of parallel processing and super computer development in india 
newly elected a i a d m k member of parliament from dharmapuri in tamil nadu mr shekhar is an advocate by profession and  he's a party's district secretary  mr shekhar welcome to our studio  thank you  tell us mr shekhar ah how do you  attribute the right of regional po parties   in india's body politics   ah  you see in india there is uh plenty of languages  and uh plenty of uh re regional   i just like that  even though in this uh type of uh our nation because we  are having many differences and many communal individual parties we refuse to save integration and to our india  then this is you see many peoples are there peoples living or having many languages and uh many cultures like that  this way the only regional parties which are reflecting the  regional peoples culture and their uh uh cultures and their  views through that regional parties only gain  and so the regional party is having just a close relationship which is basically with that uh people the regional peoples  you know now-a-days you see that only the congress have  such much of approach to the uh uh throughout national vein  no other party is rather having that much of approach  anyhow our a i a d m k anna d m k which is led by our  puratchithalaivi ms jayalalitha or madam  uh is having the party in uh yes and many states in andhra  karnataka in pondicherry as well as now in uh our capital new delhi itself  so that not only the regional parties are developing in other states our other regions  uh they're also having the confidence of the regional   pe peoples that uh they're  reflecting that uh views and angles  so only the regional parties can built the uh views and the imagines or anything you've to take of the peoples opinion  uh so uh the regional parties are in our country just like our country democratical country we're giving the freedoms to regional parties in one way  in from another angle the regional parties are uh uhm uh united itself and give a democratical set-up to our nation but do you think that regional parties have the same vision  as the national party ? certainly because they're having the same interest of uh uh national uh national parties interest  you know that our m g r our beloved leader in the time of war war time of china he donated he's the first it was the  man who donated such a huge amount just like a thing it was more than a  lakh uh to our late prime minister pandit  jawaharlal nehru  he donated a huge amount nobody under at that time nobody  donated such amount   whereas he was in the regional party under this he donated uh too much of high amount to our prime minister for integration but do you think that the regional party is they you know integrate the federal structure certainly because regional party is having the same view on one word there reflecting there mo their culture their mother tongue such like that but they want integration of the india   they've definitely work for it they've definitely  uh stood in front for their integration of the country our nation  but do you think that the rise of regional parties is a temporary phenomenon or it is a permanent feature of our politics  it's permanent uh feature because nobody can uh uh divert our divert the  regional culture or regional languages you see  so uh this is because this is biggest uh our nation  have many languages and many regions  so this is the permanent one nobody can uh uh that's why nobody can uh close this angle  this is the only thing only angle the permanent unity  because whenever the regional parties have developed  then uh the national development no doubt at all  mr shekhar you were i believe totally associated with the late m g r who was a very charismatic leader yeah tell us something more about him m g r is uh uncomparable leader  he has fight fought for the poor people and down downtrodden peoples  uh in not only his cine his film not only come through cine  cine or such one word yes because he was a big donor  uh uh even though he was asked this he donated uh uh a huge amount by his hard work  whatever he earned he donated all the money to the people and after his death he donated the uh his wealth to his people now-a-days it is said he donated his house and uh our properties to the poor peoples  just when you see and that uh our madam our puratchi  jayalalitha uhm is true follower or the true leader after m g r how is she carrying on the legacy of m g r  yes uh even those in the life life of m g r m g r chose  that only ms jayalalitha she'll give the she'll  be the future uh in your leader  he uh put to our madam in our propoganda secretary at a propoganda secretary  after m g r she's the true heir to m g r uh uh to the party and had a beloved leader  she placed uh now she's the only biggest leader  from tamil nadu  uh  but how is she ? i mean how's she carrying on what m g r had done ? in all political policies and political activities uh see even though in m g r's life there is uh like this you see  she was trained and she she was has come through only by m g r and m g r choose she'll be the successor for the party and now uh uh that he is going has gone   she is doing you see all problems of uh by-elections and all other things  she is always with the poor people just like m g r  she's fighting for the poor people for downtrodden people  uh as in by election manifesto she has declared all things to the favour and one word but without any other parties uhm see in the election manifesto she gave one word sort of manifesto it is prepared only for the poor people i can see that you've pinned photograph of ms jayalalitha yes any particular reason for that ?  yes  yes she is our lea she is the only leader after m g r  right  she is a true follower right   we're proud of having her as our leader  right   right  uhm  uhn she's fighting for uh not only the poor people but also the women women's also  she's the only leader women leader  uh she's actually she's uh such a brilliant such a uh i want to mention that she is a brilliant and uh  she is very capable to do power to the poor and welfare to the poor uhm uhm just like m g r  yeah   uhm uhm  tell us mr shekharan something you attempt   you've been naturally involved in students politics also  yes yes  uh do you think there has been a criminalisation of students politics in the country over the years ?  yes yes  no no no  student activities not a criminal in politics not a criminal activity because in studies this you know uh in student activities in our dravidian movement uh in tamil nadu like our annavar periyar just like m g r all are in the dravidian movement that trains the students not only in political activities  they must be after aw awareness of the political that is our uh political situation in tamil nadu or as well as in india international  uh to save their culture and their uh language itself  so it's a necessary training in political life  that's all yes not a criminalisation  yes  right  uh what is the specific problem in your constituency in dharmapuri  ? dharmapuri you know is in now a days the cauvery water dispute is the major problem  our madam also recommended our base  there is our recommended facts to send it to a tribunal  uh now it's a promise going that way  assuming that this problem is solved amicably how will it affect your constituency and tamil nadu as a whole ? i i want to solve this for all welfare of all states now karnataka maharashtra pondicherry benifitted but the tamil nadu people those uh are are utilised its water majority uh must have their proper right because it's  a long day to have a fight with even uh not a fight yeah  there is what if you want to store this  you obstruct and everybody sharing the water  our madam is also uh a very very interested in now a days  ke uh she also have a report about this   we're expecting the tribunal judgement that's  all   you know i want government about the parliamentary constituency they want you please kindly follow yes that cauvery is well actually they gained a gateway only through my parliamentary constituency  a few words   yes   yes   that is end of this but even in my parliamentary constituency even though cauvery enters we never got a drop of water for drinking facilities or irrigation facilities  just as it enters and go to some other areas but there're there is an hydel project where they must uh our m g r and devrajan the chief minister of karnataka have discussed about putting a hydel project in one word a very big tourist centre  uh if that will happened happen  there'll be in future definitely the power will uh will be placed for all states is a major project right and another development major master project of drinking water problem  that's a it was a it is having the well the aided   it was the stone was laided laid  by our m g r that m g r there is a pro   project is there master project for one word drinking water project  if it will happen then the our people in the drought area backward area they'll fully fully satisfied with this project  with this project  mr shekhar what are your very shortly your views on centre state relationship ? uh state centre relation regarding this uh the state and centre relations we our our you see our late m g r has told about the state and centre relationship  uh state and centre should have equal powers and uh equal  one word  our madam puratchia jayalalitha also about that is also following that states relations  that's all we wanted  you're in opposition in both your home state as well as in national politics how do you reconcile it as a truth we don't worry about in opposition or ruling   we're always a i d m k led by our puratchia  jayalalitha is fighting for the poor people  it don't bother whether we're in uh opposition or ruling  we're fighting for the poor people   we're uh reflecting or we're uh uhm showing the poor people's view and angles to the ruling party whether in a state or centre   that's all one last final question mr shekhar you're an advocate yes by profession yes  so how do you reconcile your role as an advocate and a politician ?  yes   yes  yes from the beginning as a student we've say i was in uh politicians  uh not yet fully in involved in politics that is professional made professional  in this way i was in the political activity  so there is no nothing more to mention about the that  advocate profession because it's a high profession  anyhow i got this chance uh  thank you mr shekhar it was pleasure having you and we wish you well in your political career  thank you  thank you  miss n n haralu's home nagaland  she was ambassador of india in many countries and is currently the chairman of the social welfare advisory board government of nagaland  kohima  this is a profile of a lady from a distant part of our country  who has contributed to the nations development and provides inspiration to her sisters across the land  miss haralu it is such a pleasure visiting you and your  beautiful home here in kohima  i have been looking forward to it for a very long time  uh tell me that after retirement uh are you staying here in in kohima or you your home you keep a home somewhere else also ? uh after retirement i was settled down i settled down in himapur uhm uhm it is uh plain area of nagaland  uhm uhm  ah ha but since i was took over as chairman of the social welfare advisory board yeah i had to come to kohima and stay here  so i'm now staying here in kohima  yeah  so it is wonderful you can spend time in two places as have two homes  uh before you retired what was and where was  were you posted last ? my last posting was in panama uhm uhm i was as ambassador of india to panama and a few words to costa rica and nicaragua   uhm uhm  how were our relations then uh with these countries  and what was uh publics reaction there vis a vis india ? when when i was in there the people in panama were  very friendly ah ha and uh they actually always remember nehru gandhi yes and mrs gandhi  and they had they had great respect for our leaders and also ravindranath tagore they always remembered him uhm uhm and also uh as per the political relations they were always supporting us in the united nations also usually  ah ha   yes   uhm uhm  do uh uhm did you feel that uh uh enough or at least some people from panama costa rica etcetera are also uh visiting india as tourists or were they uh uh were they keen to acquire  knowledge or information about india our country our culture ? yes actually after my uh turn there as ambassador  panama also sent a woman ambassador to india   also during my time there was some uh uh there were two ladies they were sent to india in this uh to be trained in the institute of tute of mass communication  one word  i see i see  also i was enjoying my time  uh is it uh uh correct presumption that you were the first uh person from naga to have served in the indian foreign service ? and to have been an ambassador representing our country ? yes in uh in nagaland uh as far as naga  nagaland is concerned i was the first one uh still i am the first one from the nagaland to join the indian foreign service and how many years did you serve there ? i think about twenty years oh then do you believe now that your years in the foreign service have been rewarding for you ? well it was very interesting wherever i went i made friends and specially for india  and only that uh when i had gone to brussels ah ha  eh uh rome and washington d c and shri lanka   ah ha  i believe miss haralu that uh your board has a varied activities  uh we would like to hear from you about some of your activities projects initiatives in different areas  you see we have a welfare extension projects  and this projects have this projects have five centres and you know in nagaland we've seven districts  and in six districts we have got these projects centres and these are in border areas of nagaland state and for these areas you know because it has rural and remote areas  so in in those centres we have a maternity and child welfare centres we have put up  and in these centres we have a dai and a  gramsevika and one word instructor  what are the activities you are engaged on these days  ? uh we are mainly implementing the schemes of the centre  central social welfare board and these are uh social uh social social economic programme  there are for uh in that programme we extend uh financial assistance to the some registered societies for piggery which is very popular and weaving and knitting and dairy  and uh we've other programmes like holiday home camps for children for the tribal from the age of nine to fourteen years and this is very also very popular  usually these are conducted in winter and uh the children are encouraged in this uh in this those are mainly for four children or four people you know and then uh the purpose is to give them a chance to uh see places and also conducting the camps for that to uh to develop  leadership training like that  and then uh we've one word course for those women  this mainly for the women who are the dropped  drop outs uh from schools then we give them stipend for years year course or two years course then we have vocational training for women for uh one or two word of women and this is for to train them in tailoring uh knitting or even typing and other vocational training so that they will be able to get a self self-employment or a get some employment also now tell me uh something about uh uhm the status of women in uh nagaland uh particularly uh vis a vis men and your interface with society  and do do you think that uh the naga women have progressed a lot ? and what are your hopes for the future ? i think the when you uh think of in term of the literacy rate the female literacy rate is very high  uh i think one of the highest one of the highest in think in india also and in nagaland the women are given the girls are given equal opportunity uh equal appoi appointment  employment and also few of girls have almost reached it if i consider top uh we have a couple of ias officers  and also in addition uh uh all the departments we have directors like that but still our rural women are in majority and i must say that i am glad to say that this panchayat teer rajasthani  and i think that they were </-. give a a real opportunity to women because a women has two things we have not still achieved that is inheritance and then women have no place in the   municipality or in the assembly  so i think that the panchayati raj will give them a opportunity to come up in that because the deci decision  making is they are not they are not involved in that and i think that  to have a society uh uh a progressive society or developed society we need a participation of cipation of the women also  uh what is your day like ? would you like to tell us  well first of all to tell you honestly i do begin with a two cups of tea  and then i start going to the garden because i love gardening  then gardening uh most of one word is done in the morning after tea and then uh i come in and may be i watch tv uh the the news  and after that may be sometime i cook  then i rush to get ready to go to the office  and i go to the central welfare board  i mean our our office uh in the town  then the whole day i'm there  but most of the time i also travel uh to all the districts  then in the evening of course no one in the evening i come back and i read or sometime may be i watch uh tv and sometime i read holmes and then in evening i watch one word after the news i go to bed uh miss haralu do you mind if i ask a personal question uh i was wondering how come an attractive like  lady like you is still single  uh thank you  but you know i'm always uh very interested in career and i wanted to do so many things and i still want to do so many things so i had no time to laugh 
good morning  professor savitri laxmanan is a congress-i member of parliament representing mukundapuram of kerala in the lok sabha  this is her first term as a member of parliament  her entry to into politics have  has been fairly recent  infact she joined politics less than three years ago  professor laxmanan is basically a teacher by profession and continues to be so  she is professor and head of department of malyalam   at the st joseph's college at eranjilakuda in mukundapuram  she is also an accomplished playwright and a dramatist  she has written two books one of which is a collection of one act plays  professor laxmanan has also been associated with all india radio for almost sixteen years now  professor laxmanan can you describe mukundapuram to us your constituency  why not mr hemant  mukundapuram is a place so nice  it may attract so many people  uh i think it's outside appearance is uh extra beautiful in all senses  there is uhm one place called one word  which can be converted into a best tourist centre   one word includes my constituency  and and there is another place called malaytoor and  malaytoor attracts so many pilgrims  and one irykod near the famous kudvillur devi  temple  uh and it is supposed that st thomas came first to this place  in india  he landed at irykod says so the history  and irykod is very near to that devi  temple kudvillur and uh kudvillur devi is supposed to came from that kannagi   you've heard the story of kannagi ? not really ? uh kannagi also is related to south india  that may be the reason you've not heard or to  she is a powerful goddess uhm uhm  and uh about my own place in srinelkuda there is a famous temple kudmadikum shree kudmadikum temple  in which lord bharda is the deity and lord bharda uh  and no other places in india there is lord bharda  only at yetinedkuda people says so  but beyond all this mukundapuram is very poor and in  it's living uh people are very poor there  uh or probably too old or to meet the both ends meet  uh so many are labourers and they find it very difficult to earn their livelihood  but they are trying somehow or other and they expect me to help them  and uh though even though it is very beautiful with lakes rivers paddy fields trees etcetra etcetra we've to uh supply some food to them   that's right you were saying before uh we to me here that there is no such place as mukundapuram on the map is it true ? uh there's is a small village it is it is known as mukundapuram but uh no notable place in this mean mukundapuram uhm uhm but constituency is named liked that mukundapuram  uh it is connected uh with an old story that lord mukunda  this vishnu had great place in some good old days  uhm uhm and the place is named after lord mukunda  mukundapuram puram means town town of mukunda  uhm uhm  uhm uhm  in your five year term here uhm what you really plan to do for your constituency ?  uhm  i want to do a lot for my people  but i don't know whether all my hopes will be fulfilled or not  and i know very well that uh all the needs of the people can not be fulfilled by my by me alone  but i want to do something for the ordinary people  by helping in some way or other   i'll do my best to  one or two words  uhm uhm  the teaching community and also that of students they must also be looking forward to you to help from you of many kinds  then i'll help and allow them  what can you do for them as as an m p ?  and  to my all students i think uh i lost my students  this is the only grief i have now  i lost the good field of teaching uhm uhm  it was so nice in my college with my students and my colleague  but i do i love one word  do you uh want to go back to teaching full time ?  that's a que a very difficult question to answer i don't know exactly  uh people in my party ask me you you are not contesting this election   that's why i came into politics and uh truly speaking i love all the topics in between sky and earth  and i love politics too  and i take it as a challenge  and for the first time i was facing an election  fortunately or unfortunately i won  and now uh i take my constituency as my institution to which i'm so fond of  i think uhm now mukundapuram constituency is my st joseph college  one thing uh now that you've become member of parliament uhm has the attitude of your students or that of your collegues changed towards you ?  uhm  uhm i think no  do they notice a change in you ? i don't know  uh i want to be with them uh in the what i want to say   i'm the old savitri laxmanan among them  i see  certainly  and i'm sure that they'll consider me as their old savitri laxmanan uhm uhm   you've written two books one of which is the collection of short one act plays  uhm  tell us a little more about these books that you've  written   uhm  uh act one of it uh one of them is a collection of short stories uh sorry exclusively one act plays uhm uhm  and other is full fledged drama  uhm uhm  uhm uhm  uh and uh drama is published by national book store  uhm uhm   it's a reputed firm in kerala uhm uhm  it is published some fifteen or sixteen years back  and i got some prizes for the script uhm uhm  from kerala sangeet natak academy   uhm um and it is broadcasted through all india radio  to one word is one from trivandrum  uhm uhm   uhm uhm  uhm uhm and i took the female part uhm in my own drama   uhm  i think it's a rare oppurtunity for a woman artist   i'm sure it must be  how long has been your association with all india radio  ? uh i too may for the past fifteen or sixteen years i was participating in radio plays uhm uhm   i'm approved as a staff artist there in  all india radio trichur  they used to take i used to participate in some of the plays uhm uhm   you've also done discussions for them  haan some discussions some talks   uhm uhm some speeches etcetera   uhm uhm   you're a teacher by profession  one thing i would like to definitely ask you is about your  opinion on the education policy do you think there should be a uniform education policy for the whole nation ? what i know of course mr hemant the education must be uniform  but it it's not practical i think  why do you think so ? there are so many who seek higher education  but i think ours is a poor country  for that uh we're unable to fulfill the hopes of the  rising students  so private schools must be encouraged in my opinion uhm uhm  i say so because in my state there are some who says that all must be uhm government oriented education  private school must be abolished from the field  but i don't think so because in our state private school and private colleges are doing a lot for the students  they're not making second rate citizens sort but that uh when that is some round about now a days our school rise people say these schools are creating second rate citizens  i feel that is what i think do you also think the medium of instruction ah  should be uniform or that uh the three tier system that now exist  is all right ?  ah  uhm we've to give due importance to the both language english one or two word  in my case too i bid farewell to this uh international language from one word back because i'm a professor of my original language malyalam  and i used to talk and write always in malyalam and now i almost forgot english but when i became an m p english is the only force through which i can communicate my ideas uhm  so also with the other m p's   uhm  some of them knew very well hindi because hindi is their mother tongue  but they are unaware of the fact that happens in in the south the sole reason is that they are not uh uh trying to  learn or write this english so english could be the link language in my opinion and then hindi our national language  that must be also given due importance  and i'm trying to learn hindi  now uh you are also based in delhi uhm  and when the ses when the parliament is in session you've  to be hear ah  how how difficult or how easy is it for you to communicate here  ? when you are here  uhm   ah  i always depend upon my little english  are you also comfortable   and i uh i've said i'm  trying to learn hindi  have you started   i've a servant who only spoke  hindi uhm uhm  and uh i too learn uh thoda thoda  hindi from her  that's very nice uhm   i'm sure she will be   uhm   i know uh from this kuch nahi malum to kya to kya that's all  i'm sure one day  and i uh bought my uhm little daughters book she is doing studying in fifth standard  and in my state fifth standard onwards hindi starts  and i bought her books and i read and write  uh yeh kalam hai yeh kitab hai laughs   that's very nice  now you've spoken of your daughter  it must be uh a fairly uh tough task for you to manage your school college your family and now this uh new thing of being a member of parliament  how do you manage it ?  it's i can't extend very difficult for me to part with my family  uhm but i've to  during uh lok sabha sessions is going on   i'll be here at delhi and i'll be back at my constituency whenever i i'm needed there  and of course if there is no meeting is going on here at delhi i can be at srinelkuda back with my people and with my family and somehow or other they're managing  they rise upto the moment i think uh i am sure  my husband will look after all such things in my absence i think  that's very nice   i'm sure you consider the entire student and teaching community as one family  as a family that uh is really closely knit   i'm very glad that you could come here and share some experiences with us  thank you very much for being with us thank you mr hemant 
today we've prof h k das in the studios  and we will uh enter into discussion with prof h k das on various aspects of uh modern research which is going on in the biology prof das is director of genetic engineering unit in jawaharlal nehru university  and currently he is the chairman of uh centre for biotechnology in the same university that is jawaharlal nehru university prof das i would like to ask you what is uh the background or the history of genetic engineering research in india  ? yes uh bb i think it will be interesting to trace back the history  uhm you see somewhere around nineteen eighty-two uh prof m g k menon had called some of the biologists of the country  uh for a meeting at baroda  trying to discuss as to what are the areas that should receive thrust for research in india  and that's where uh people like us uh had emphasised  that uh we are running out of time and we should initiate genetic engineering research in india you see prior to that uh the science administrators had always felt that genetic engineering is too sophisticated and uh it cannot be done in india  it can be done only in the highly developed countries  but we we could convince prof menon that there is nothing  nothing so sophisticated in genetic engineering or recombinant in technology  and it can very well be done uh in our country uh and he didn't take long to understand the point  and uh it was decided that the department of science and technology uh should start some core research units uh to to initiate genetic engineering research in india uh applications were invited and uh that's how   a three units were established one in the indian institute of science bangalore uhm another in bose institute calcutta and the third one in jawaharlal nehru university in delhi  later another unit was added and uh that was uh in madurai  kamraj university uh the purpose was that they should serve as a focal point so that people from the nearby area could come and learn the techniques and genetic engineering research can spread in the country uh you know this has worked very well now almost in all good biological laboratories in the country genetic engineering is being used  but that's how the whole thing was started  uh coming to the next one  in fact i wanted to ask you after this brief background which is not a very long history for genetic engineering to start in india  eighty-two is not far off  what is the current status of genetic engineering research uh in india or in it's labs of india ? uh uh the current status uh is is a very encouraging i must say and uh uhm if i may go back again uhm to what i was saying uh each of these centres three units of genetic engineering uh  was uh entrusted with the job of doing a particular kind of genetic engineering research in the country uhm uhm the unit in jawaharlal nehru university was supposed to work on uh the molecular genetic of nitrogen fixation  you have mentioned that your unit of which you are the director is endowed with the responsibility of uh carrying out research on nitrogen fixation  that's right  so uh will you elaborate a little bit what is nitrogen fixation ? because we keep hearing about nitrogen fixing yes  microbe yes and perhaps they have some other  yes   yes  yes the the meaning of nitrogen fixation chemically uh is reduction of a molecular nitrogen  and uh when i was a student or you were a student we've  heard about the hoberbosh process yeah of uh  industrially reducing nitrogen uh but uh you know there are micro-organisms who can also reduce nitrogen on that reduce nitrogen at ordinary temperature and pressure you don't have to go very high uh in the temperature or pressure  and this micro-organisms uh reduce nitrogen and form amonia and its derivatives  and that's what is biological nitrogen fixation  and i don't have to uh overemphasis the importance of this because uh uh this is the only source of all nitrogenous compounds in the living world  like the meat or fish we consume today though uh the the animals or the fish cannot fix nitrogen they live on plants  right and and the plants cannot fix nitrogen so they get the nitrogen fixed from the microbes  so so bb this fixed nitrogen is is the only biological source in addition to of course the industrially fixed nitrogen  yeah   right  fixed nitrogen yes  so these nitrogen fixtures as you say are microbes and your work is also related to them yes  so uh there may be many types of uh nitrogen fixing or of many types   sure there are many there are many types uh uhm  if i may classify them  uh generally speaking wa you  could uh uh group them in a classes like symbiotic nitrogen fixation  uh which means that the micro-organisms by themselves  cannot fix nitrogen but they must uh enter into a symbiotic arrangement  with a particular plant  uh uhm and the genous risobium yeah and uh  i'm sure this is a very familiar name uh is is the one which does it  yeah  so uh the genous the various species of risobium would enter into symbiotic relationship with various leguminous plants  except for one or two plants   for one or two plants  by legu excuse me by leguminous plants you mean  the pulses  that's right uh uh leguminous plants uh uh are are the pulses  one word yeah and uh since india is uh a a big vegetarian uh  diet consuming uh country the pulses are very important source of  uh nitrogen  one word  nitrogen or protein  even if one is a non-vegetarian because the cost of non-vegetarian food is very high so the general mass of the country would live on vegetarian dishes  and the pulses are very important suppliers of nitrogen  so these risobia they uh enter into an association  with these leguminous plants  that's right  and then the what have what is the benefit of that association i will tell you the form what you call nodules which can be very small or slightly big in the roots of these plants and some stray instances of shoot or stem nodules also but generally speaking root nodules  and as a result uh a lot of fix nitrogen would be given to the plant  so that the legumes uh would fo form  the crop  uh fixing atmospheric nitrogen uh by using these bacterial species  uh this is one kind uh there is another kind which we call associative nitrogen fixation where the plant uh would associate themselves with  micros micro-organisms but there is no uh uh rigid symbiotic arrangement  and that uh kind of syn uh uh fixation of nitrogen  is very important for nonlegumes  the cereal plants for example like uh we rice  rice etcetera  right  uhm uhm and as a spirillum this is one important genus uh which enters into association with cereal plants  there could be a third class where there is no association  the micro organisms can fix nitrogen in a free living state doesn't need any plant nothing and as agrobactor is an example of the third class and today in india both as a spirillum species and as agrobactor species are used in the fields for cereal plants to augument the crop production and there is absolutely no doubt that both these uh impart beneficial affect to cereal crop production  prof das you are working on uh a agrobactor  uh on ndie uhm uhm uh which is a free living nitrogen fixture  so why have you uh selected this field to work out its genetics or bio fixing ?  uhm uhm  you see uh uh i i'm i'm basically a bio-chemist and uh i i had been uh quite attracted by a agrobactor uh because of uh mainly two reasons  one is that though in general this nitrogen fixation a machinery inside a cell is very sensitive to oxygen  in agrobactor the fixatiion goes on in air in the  presence of oxygen   yeah yeah  so it has its own mechanism by which it protects the nitrogen fixation machinery which is not there in other organisms uh uh some organisms can protect but only when some specialised structures are formed but in agrobactor the the cell by itself does it this was one very interesting point for us to get interest in agrobactor  the other point was of course that uh we wanted to work with something that would be useful for cereal crops  uh because that's by far uh the uh the more important crop in india uhm and of course slowly we have learnt that there are many other interesting points in agrobactor as we have worked with agrobactor like it has some alternative pathways of nitrogen fixation  which uh possibly is not there in the other conventional  uh bacterial species so besides uh this alternative pathway for nitrogen fixation  uh what are the other uh unique findings that have uh uh been done in your lab ? uhm or in under in your directorship ? sure uh uhm  or you can elaborate that this is the only thing which contains everything itself   yes if i can tell everything itself  yes  agrobactor we have learnt the has another unique character  uh and that is it has a huge amount of dna in it  dna as you know is the is the genetic material and uh  uh for a bacteria uh it is really huge uh the standard in bacteria is considered to be the micro organism one word which all of us have in the in organs  it's friendly bacteria which synthesises vitamins in us and agrobactor has as much as forty times more dna in in its single cell  and that's what has attracted our attention  might have one word  and we have recently uh uh established that agrobactor  one word has as many as eighty chromosomes in it  which are almost the size uh of an one word  chromosome  but uh altogether eighty chromosomes uh looks like all of them are similar  and nobody knows why they are there and what they are doing and this is what is of interest to us at this present moment so in addition to the nitrogen fixation uh interest that we have first agrobactor this is also another interesting point uh  that needs attention in agrobactor  uh these microbes that you have talked about are also doing another job that is they are economising on the fertilizer requirement of the crop that means it has some application in agriculture  that's right  very much so very much  so uh can you please elaborate on on those aspects   that's   you see uh uh you see the most effective  the biological fertilizer is of course risobium  the effect that you get is is a much more striking in case of risobium  uh but the problem with risobium is that uh you can use it only for legumes or the or the pulses uhm uhm  uh dals that we take uh and there's absolutely no doubt that it it brings up yield several wholes high  but in the case of one word agrobactor it's  not as good as as risobium but again uh risobium cannot do anything for your cereal crops yeah and for cereal crops uh it has been established that  uh again it's in the field  not not just in the lab that uh uh it it it gives an yield somewhere could be anywhere between ten to forty percent more  haan  and for some fodder crops the yield could be even double  and specifically only for fodder crops  using uhm agrobactor  so you simply uh inoculate the seed with these bacteria  and then sow the seed   uhm uhm  and there the micro organisms multiply and then supply the nitrogen  and the other point is that it not only uhm has the good effect on that crop the crop that comes next also gets the benefit because some of the fix nitrogen stay on in the soil  and the next crop also getting gets the benefit  of this inoculation   gets the benefit  uh since you are uh heading such a good and dedicated scientists team of genetic engineering unit uh there previously there was a euphoria of genetic engineering  now we hear quite often of biotechnology  uh since you are an expert in this area can you uh tell us  uh is there any distinction between the two or do they overlap or they are one and the same thing no uh let me put it this way uh genetic engineering is included in biotechnology  uh the the so much that you hear about biotechnology today i dare say is because of genetic engineering because biotechnology was there like like the wine that was there from the time immemorial yeah you you you could consider it as a biotechnological  uh uh phenomenon yeah preparing a wine   yeah  or even the gober gas that you hear so much about is biotechnology uh but it's the genetic engineering uh development of genetic engineering that has given a real boost to biotechnology   a few words  uh genetic engineering is included in biotechnology but biotechnology uh could deal with other things also like tissue culture which is also very important today  like certain certain plants have been propogated by tissue culture and those are disease free plants  and there there is no genetic engineering but thats included in biotechnology  or or even this conventional vaccine making is is biotechnology but i am sure you heard that now you you have better vaccines which have been uh constructed using genetic engineering tools or one word tools  that means biotechnology was already there very much but genetic engineering provided uh tools which has hasten the process of  very much   that's that's the way i i i would look at biotechnology today  prof das do you think that whatever you are doing or your group or genetic engineers are doing in india or all over do they have any relevance to the people or masses ? like your organism for example has uh the direct benefit  in agriculture  what are the other areas where we can uhm make best use of this  uh genetic engineering unit or genetic engineering researches or researches in modern biology there can be many examples and some of these have been tried abroad  i i i will start with an example which i always give and  that's the example of human insulin  you know the uh all diabetics must take insulin  now insulin is naturally made in the pancreas of animals including us  so when we fail to make our own insulin we have to take insulin from outside  and that insulin used to come only from animal pancreas  so animals would have to be slaughtered and the insulin would have to be isolated and then processed and we take injection  uh so that's what they have done is they had projected the need of insulin  and they have found that they would soon come when you just would not able to kill as many animals to supply the uh insulin this is point number one 
 recording broken  a legend in his lifetime known as the greatest gentleman tennis player of the world certainly india's greatest tennis player ever and right now he is with us in our studios mr ramanathan krishnan mr krishnan welcome to our studios and thank you very much for  being with us thank you deepak  uh we would like to take you down memory lanes yeah  we would like to travel into the past  yeah  tell us about how you got involved in tennis ? yes uhm see i come from a tennis playing family  it all my father started the whole thing  and he used to be a good player in his playing days that was before the war time  and he used them  he was the best player in the south and he was one of the top ranking indian player  so he he put me into tennis  and then infact he put ramesh also to into  tennis  who coached you in your earliest days ? my father has been my main my main coach  uh he started coaching me when i was about ten years old  that was used to be you know that you people used to consider quite younger that time but today they start as early as five or six know  i started when i was about ten years old  and uh my father went to for some rigorous programmes for me lot of training and lot of practice sessions and uh it was hard work  uhm now the emphasis appears to be on physical fitness as much as on proficiency in the game  and at the time when you were being coached ? well deepak it has been the same  i mean if you take tennis for last forty fifty years  and in fact people ask me how do you compare a champion of a nineteen twenties or thirties ? you know i've not seen them but you know i talked to people and uh champions of todays i think that one common factor that is physical fitness  they all had to be phy physically   very fit and uh it is only athletes who can play this game well  what kind of equipment and facilities did you have when you started playing tennis ? well uh you can't compare it with todays  facilities are much more today  but in my playing days for instance we used to play with wooden rackets  now you see no rackets of graphite and aluminium and uh  there're so many varieties of rackets now   it's an improvement because with uh less effort  you're able to get more pace  the pace is an advantage for the modern players we didn't had that  but then we're good players of the time like take rod laver uh i mean he played with the wooden rackets and lu hoad or jack kramer they hit the ball as hard because  they had a very good timing  so it's a question of i mean i do agree that the equipment is better  but you know once you you know as an athlete who is very talented i mean you you give my him  broomstick he can play tennis well  was it possible to make a living out of tennis i'm  sorry to put such a material no no question to you was it possible to do that ?  no no  very interesting question very good question  and it used to be amateur sports those days  like i was an amateur player and rod laver in his earlier days and lu hoad they're  all amateurs  then they turn professional later on  and uh it was a mainly an amateur sports  in fact those days unfortunately they used to look down on the professionals you know so they were very few in number  they used to be under group under jack kramer  and uh in nineteen sixty things have changed and the status of the game has changed now  now it's a professional sport  a full time job and uh luc lucrative  career for the top players  mr krishnan there is one question that is lot of people have always wanted to ask you  forgive me for this question but having reached the peak   yeah all of a sudden ramanathan krishnan just sort of went away hang out his racket and he went away  uh you you didn't get interested in coaching you didn't want to take an active part in the management of tennis in this country  yeah  well uh i didn't hang up my racket quickly i mean i had a pretty long innings  i mean i played for quiet a long time you know i had a long innings you know  laughs  i played nearly yeah twenty-five to thirty years   yeah  in fact i had three life's in tennis  first i was playing you know my best playing days is in the fifties and the sixties  then i quit for sometime  and uh when ramesh started improving his tennis i thought  it's a good idea to you know compete with him and uh you know practice with him which would help him which it did  so i came back in the seventies seventy-four or seventy-five around that time and ramesh was coming up  then ramesh was on his own feet improved and went you know went the circuit i quit again  and finally in the early eighties around eighty-two they introduced a new event called the grand masters meant for ex-tennis players  you know who've done well in the earlier years  but they're too old to compete in regular competition they call it a grand masters events  it was the assembly of ex-champions ex-tennis players  so i was invited to take part in that in the main in united states and a few tournaments in europe  so i competed again again against people like rod laver kanross wall all big legendary names you know  i enjoyed it and uh it was lot of fun and that's also finished now because you know the reason  new forty-fives are now coming in laughter  you know when i was forty-five  i'm fifty-four now played for nearly nine ten years and i we had lot of fun and we had good competition  and now the new forty-fives you know for event like that you always need some new blood ah  so the new forty-fives are now coming you know the reason   ah  they are already professionals in the rally  we're not professional yes but the new persons are coming in so that event is going on now  yes  well this this senior collegue of mine here is nine hundred and ninety-five years old and he is going to learn tennis  in a little while  ah ha  ah ha but there is the question that that i i want to repeat it again mr krishnan yeah  why has uh mr krishnan never been available for coaching ?  yeah  yeah you asked me that question  you see as i said that i kept playing uh the lesson important like i played the grand masters for eight nine years  then in between i was travelling with ramesh trying to help him for a few years when he need when he needed it  and i firmly believe that in this game you know  it's uh it's a long process  this coaching everything is not a quick process you know it takes years  if i take up two or three boys or four boys and i've  to live with them be with them right through and i couldn't do anything else  and it's a long process  i couldn't afford the time and i didn't want to you know takes stuck take up something half-heartedly and leave it in the middle  so this is one of the main reason  and uh in this country we've good coaches who teach the fundamentals of the game alright  where we're lagging behind is when they improve the tennis they're a bit directionless  we here a little dicky bird a little rumour that's  ramanathan krishnan is now going to go in for coaching  is there any truth in this ? well uh yes i'm in the capital for two reasons one is to watch the davis cup match that's going on between india and korea which is at a very interesting stage in which in which your son played brilliantly  my son played very well   he's been good yesterday  and uh i'm here also for another important reason  i met again dynamic man called bobby singh  who is uh in organising a tennis academy  uh tennis for tennis academy i believe he's going to have it in the capital in this area  and uh object is to unearth talents tennis talents  and then give them all the opportunities and uh you know give them the coaching and training facilities  so that you know take a group of some thirty forty boys and girls  so that out of the quantity a few good quality player may be three or four will come out in three years time  it's a very good idea  so he asked me when i was here last month passing through delhi he asked me whether i could help them or give them a little  few few tips and all  so i thought it's a good idea and uh you know  i've did away lot pressure out of game lot of things out of this game  so i said why not give that to game in some small way  so i said i agreed and uh right after the davis cup match i think around the nineth or tenth or a week i'm  going to be working with this uh young children oh wonderful   jee saheb ab krishnan saheb training de rahen hain naujawan bacchon ko ek hafta das din ke liye desh ki rajdhani mei rahenge aur yahan par ek tennis coaching camp lag raha hai  agar aap chahen to aap ke liye recommendation  mai de sakta hoon   deepakji pehli baat to yeh hai ke mere pas itni fursat nahin ah mai dekhye mai match dekhta hoon aur mujhe maza ajata hai aur mai gum hojata hoon   ah   usi liye itna wakht lag jata hai aur ab khelne ke liye after all agar panch hazar saal purani haddiyan hain to  kahin satak hi na jayen   laughs   i'm sorry i said he was nine hundred and something he says he's five thousand years old  you'll have to be very young to one word  this game and play this game you know which is very young laughs he's five thousand very young   laughs  mr krishnan what do you consider which match do you consider your greatest match ever ? well as stated earlier i had a long inning yeah so i had to mention two or three of them you know  alright  i think uh i would always i mean all the listeners would expect me to say this laughter  the match against thomas coss which i played inter-zonal final against brazilian davis cup competition nineteen sixty-six  that is very important because i was playing the fifth match it was two match for i was playing the fifth match and of course out on grass court which tend out to be a a marathon match a deciding match which i happen to win   that's very important because that took the country to the final position they used to call it a challenge you know  the challenge for the davis cup was there for the first time  you know first time is always very important  and i always take pride in that that i broke that ice  and you know we've got to the finals it was a thrilling moments for other players thomas coss  and uh well uh that's about thirty years ago  nearly laughter twenty-five years ago  laughs  yeah then you're going to mention one or two other matches that this is the main one because you know it's a davis cup match  another one is uh i always remembered my matches against roy emerson the quarter final at wimbledon we played on the central court  i was seeded number seven he was number four  he was a favourite  i played exceptionally well on that day and i managed to be in great state uh which took me to the semi-final of wimbledon for the second time  that was a very important match uh quality wise i played good tennis  and another one which i always remember is as against rod laver in the opening round the opening match of the davis cup competition inter-zone finals between india and australia  we played the match in the united states  you know those days the rules of the games the rules of the davis cup competition were such that you know the nation that was holding the cup you know today it's not like that today everybody plays no ? yeah but those days the nation which was holding the cup the holders they played only one match they played winners of the rest of the world  so on that that year i mean united states was holding the cup which meant we had to play the earlier matches like the inter-zone finals yeah in the united states   yeah  i played that match in boston and beat laver i mean i must confess that rod laver was that great he played afterwards with everybody  but even then he was the wimbledon finalist and uh  that gave me lot of pressure breathing in because i realise how talented he was and uh i won in four serve  i always remember that match  when you reached the semi-finals of the wimbledon for the first time yeah before went to play that match   yeah what did you do ? and after you played it what did you do ?  you knew that you've beaten   yeah   yeah   ah yeah i'll tell you something looking back well i know certain things which i shouldn't have done  it's too late  thats what happened in happens you know  in all walks of life you make some mistakes i did make a mistake  somewhere on i was over awed at that occasion  but i got in the semi-finals at wimbledon i was over awed  you know it's only two matches to win to win the title i was very close to it  and the people who i'm playing i had beaten them here and there  you know it's not that they had always beaten me but uh i've one occasion i lost to neil fraser neat serve uh another occasion rod laver second level rod laver in sixty-one  and you know it's interesting to know that i've  not lost to lord laver until then  but on that occasion i was over awed and they were two two of the best out pass two of the left that left handed again its known  it so happened i had to play them on fast grass court this i wouldn't play well and uh they were the better players but i think if uh i should have been little more you know it is one word a little more ambitious and you know i played normally i should have done something extra bit you know on an occasion like that you can't afford to play just normal tennis and get away  you've to do something extra which i didn't do   deepekji hamesha ki tarah aap meri baat mehmen tak pahuncha dijiye  dekhye morning show ke lakho dost jo bharat ke puri abadi ke pratinidhi hai mai un sab ki taraf se mehman ka shukriya ada karta hoon  mehman ni bhartiya tennis ke liye jo kuch kiya hai woh nai khiladiyon ko hamesha rasta dikhata rahega  meri aur morning show ke doston ki ek chhoti si khwaish hai ho sakta hai woh mehman ki koshish se unki saakh se  ya unki sifarish se puri ho jaye  is mahan desh ke kisi bhi ek saher main ek shandar  tennis stadium ban jaye to hamari woh hasrat puri ho jaye jo australian open french open ya  wimbledon ko dekh kar hamare dil mei paida hoti hai  what ? do you wish to respond to what he has said ? uh i understood him ahn  well as far as i'm concerned i'll be   rewarded and rewarded and very happy  if we produce you know large country like india  if we get two or three or four good players and good tennis stadium yeah tennis court and everything   ahn   yes yes   and good tennis stadium  that would be nice because you know we've  worked very hard in this game  i would like somebody to keep up this game and you know keep the flag flying and uh i would like to again grow that's my ambition  uh mr krishnan coming back to your reputation as a gentleman tennis player now you don't have to answer this question if you don't want to but i've heard again from your comtemporaries yeah  that if there was ever a line called which the empire awarded in your favour but you thought that it belong to the to your opponent  then the next point you would deliberately return the ball into the net  is that true ? that you would you would you know equalise  yeah  well i will tell you the truth now i can afford to tell you the truth now laughter that  i've close my tennis year 
this morning we have with us mahasveta devi the eminent bengali writer visiting delhi  mahasveta devi was born in dhaka which is now in bangladesh and pursued her academic career in vishwabharati shantiniketan  and also later in the calcutta university interestingly she did her m a in english literature  mahasveta devi is a social activist a journalist and a vibrant creative writer she has taught at school and college level english literature also she has been a roving reporter of two bengali dailies   vartuman and yugantur mainly reporting on the matters related to villages  she is also a person who has a store house of varied experiences because she has garner them from the different areas of life  it is interesting to know for us that she has also worked in the telegraph and postal department of india  she has been working clears throat with the  adivasis of india working with them and they are in orissa bihar and bengal  presently she is concentrating more in bengal  and she draws her inspiration and authentic power that comes from empathy and deep sustained identification and concern for the deprived and the neglected  she has to her credit forty-two novels sixteen books of collected short stories  a book of plays amongst which we can very happily name the  uh hazar chaurasia's maa  five books for children  she has also received several medals and it is a big list to go through but let me mention the  amrita puraskaar jagataruni medal  nikhil bharat bang sahitya puraskaar bhuvan mohini medal  and also padmashree in nineteen eighty-six for her excellent work with the  adivasis of india  her works have been translated in malyali gujarati  hindi telugu tamil and certainly in english  and i'm very happy to tell you as far as i know  her books are used in several universities in australia and the united states  mahasveta devi it is great pleasure to have this opportunity to meet you face to face because we have always enjoyed that excellent creative vibrant writing of yours and we all welcome you in  delhi and to our studio  thank you  uhm the question that comes to mind right away and which  i've read in the introduction of that excellent book of collection uh apni godko is it the transformation in society for survival of the least and the downtrodden  is a mm major concern of yours ? but you do not believe as i understand in the change of political  methods or cha change of the system by political methods  what would be your solution for this very pressing problem in our country this transformation of society ? would you suggest it can be done through literary writing ? i think it would be more correct to say that i don't think any political system as we see in india would bring  any revolutionary change for the downtrodden and the oppressed  and it i it would be very what shall i say wishful thinking to say that only literary writing could bring some changes  of course it will have some effect on the  litery literary section of the society  but to bring any transformation efforts should try should be tried  you know from the grass root level not from the upper level and the process will be slow process will be gradual and there must be concerted efforts to better the condition of the downtrodden the oppressed  i don't mean always by government methods  by voluntary organisations or other dedicated people  only thus slowly uh better society can emerge  and this work must be done along with those who have suffered this work not only must be done along with those who have suffered but the initiative also must come from them  they will work for their own betterment  uh how much have you been impressed by your  shantiniketan experience in this uh thought for the  downtrodden the deprived the neglected ? i wouldn't say that shantiniketan  upbringing made me very conscious for the downtrodden and the oppressed  i was in shantiniketan in my childhood when tagore was alive   i'm very thankful for those childhood days   shantiniketan taught me a great love of nature love for humanity in general  but the later phase which is me now it has come after many changes and ups and downs in my life and you have had a varied experience in your life  please tell us you often use in your writing my people  and that's the phrase that has really struck me because i have come across it several times  i would like to know what exactly do you mean when you say  my people you do you use this phrase in a very particular way or as queens and kings use my people no the for the queens and kings it would be my subject  but for me the suffering bonded labourers of paramu they are my people   the times of india report regarding a woman  three months ago in madhya pradesh who was tubercular and who sold her daughter for as a child labour for hundred  rupees   she's one of my people  you see my india consists of such people who for whom still drinking water or right over their land and forest a hut  two meals a day remains a luxury  they are my people  where i say people i mean they  and this is your sustained deep identification with this particular group yes  uhm i was wondering when you say that you are  sensitive about the judgement on the writers you have also said that they are answerable the writers  i was going to ask you is a writer responsible for the state of a negative uh situation in our country in society the immoral unethical values ? uhm are do you really think it is the job of the writer to reflect the society ? because we have been saying for ages literature is the mirror of society  or do you think it is the duty of these writer to present the  picture truthfully but also work for the solution ? i mean is it one of the work of the writer and if he or she fails there that she should be ready for judgement ? what i wanted to say i put it to you as a counter   it's not question some thing else  a writer is a person who lives in the society she does a writer receives so much from society but he is also accountable to the society  he has also give given that so a  writer's writing should not lead the society astray  or a writer's vary todays writings of the indian writers from all over india does it reflect the true india ? the india is passing through many phases passing through many changes  so uh d d do it lit the indian literature until and unless becomes the mirror of the indian changing indian society i wouldn't say that the writers have been very successful  also i believe in activism  i believe in active work  so i think this these writers also should be conscious of their res social responsibilities  try to alleviate the misery of the poor and the suffering as much as they can  i think this should give him better identification with his reading public this is a very very excellent point because very few i think feel  not only the writers but let's say citizens of india  that we have received so much from society therefore we are bound to  them to give back in whatever way we can and what you are saying as a writer it is one of your duties that you consider is to get back as much as you can yes since you are a writer  so that some wrong impression that we have that because she is an activist therefore she is always bringing in these subjects is not such a true picture as the moral and ethical value have as a writer that a writer as a citizen writer as a taker of social good  must give back not wait for any one to ask it yes i think uh uh mahasveta devi this is very excellent point and i am happy that you are sharing this with us  the other thing i wanted to say in this regard would you say then the readers who read your work really owe it to you because many of us are your admirers that they also do something actual work  what would you suggest for them ? whoever is uh aware  wherever one is he must consider it as his or her battlefield jo jidher hai wohi unke liye unaka ranakshetra hai   one must think of oneself as a soldier  you see our india is a very poor mother  she has so many children  the advanced amongst them should not be totally oblivious of the misery of her poorer children  everyone should try to do whatever one can uhm i'm sure we'll remember that  mahasveta devi i wanted to ask you please share with us and i see in not uh far away future those who you are working for the  adivasis the neglected the uh forgotten will come into the mainstream of life  i can't prophecy when but they will  but when they come how do you visualise the quality of life changing atleast beginning to change ? hitherto what has happened that uh oppressed as a class the tribals amongst us have been totally bypassed by the  mainstre mainstream society  especially the tribals  great injustice has been done to them absolutely  indian history of uh freed indian freedom history does not include the tribal anti-imperialist uh struggle as part of indian history  thus the tribals have always been bypassed  i do not want them to come forward because of mercy from the main stream  they must know where they are they must struggle for their own good and they must  advance themselves  only thus whatever they are that will be his or her own earning that is she will be able to retain  if you give someone something yes one may not value it so much   yes  ah this is a very excellent point i wanted to say that i have noticed that you have a  expression of happiness when you are talking about your readers who are non- bengali readers  and i know that you are very well known amongst the  non-bengali readers through translations  i wanted to ask you to what do you owe this  gratification and love from them  one or two words  that is one of the turning phases of my life  because by the time i had written hazar chourasia ki maa i had written jungle  ke jahagirdar  but those books were not yet translated into hindi  hindi in hindi plenty bengali literature was being translated and published  but not my books  different kind of literature  arvind kumar now the director of l b t then he had  radhakrishna prakashan  he not only published my books by going forward travelling to calcutta but introduced me to a people unknown to me hi hi hitherto  hindi writers poets patrakars so many people i met in delhi  it was like a mela  whenever i came i met them  it was like a festive occasion  on one occasion there was really a mela like festival around me in triveni  arvind one word and had i not known hindi  readers had i not known the hindi world of literature i would not have known greater india  hindi introduced me to greater india  i agree this i'm no longer i do no longer feel  i'm a bengali writer i feel i am a indian writer and i belong to the rest of india amongst the indian writers i have so many friends  for all these things i am very very indebted to the hindi literature very very indebted to arvind kumar so we now see the great value of translation  there is just probably a little time for you to share any particular thought that is dear to your heart with your audience  i will just tell you a very small incident which is very important to me  in a remote tribal area of bengal twenty years ago there was no school  and because there was no land available to build a hut for the school a tribal woman karmisuren she had very little land she induced interest upon her son and daughter-in-law to part with whatever land they had  this poorest woman in the village gave her all  an illiterate woman so that a school could could be built  for others to get education   karmisuren's instance till date is a great one a pioneering effect to me  and i always say that school i think it will be it will be government sanctioned very soon i do not know  we are trying hard  my state government is also trying trying hard  but karmisuren is a great woman whose life should be written  and should reach other parts of india and i would add let us also act like karmisuren and mahasveta devi thank you for spending this beautiful time with us  thank you so much 
in all good ever hope to be  that then what they conventional wisdom  until beginning nineteen eighty-seven all india radio undertook a series of broadcast in india a new experiment in integrated social broadcasting of a style magnitude and complexity unprecedented anywhere in the world  these broadcasts have been a spectacular success  the credit for this goes to the vision the dedication the committment and the leadership of one man  his name amrit rao shinde  his job director general of all india radio and right now as you can see he is with us in our studio  mr shinde sir thank you very much for joining us in the studios of the morning show  now you began with the series on social forestry in nineteen eighty-seven  then you moved on to method of science to jeevan saurabh  to radio date and so on what is the origin of this idea ? how did you decide that radio should now play some kind of a more active role in social broadcasting ? after the introduction of colour television in india  uh in fact we in broadcasting the professionals were little disturbed because the listening has shifted to television  and because one factor was dominating  the programme pattern of radio was not very attractive to the listeners  secondly the television the new media which was progressing in this country and expanding uh with a great speed was able to provide a lot of entertainment good entertainment quiet good entertainment  so we were worried that how we can shift our programme pattern in such a way where we can attract the listeners and keep our uh uh listening to the optimum  in search of this we have arranged many seminars and workshop at different places  i have moved from places to places i have discussed uh the problems with professionals  and uh we come came to the conclusion especially in the light of success of radio form  forum especially programmes for the rural audiences that if we go in for subjects and programmes which are directly concerned to a listener and where they are in need of some information or where they are in need of some guidance and where they are uh looking for more kind of education  i think that area if we adopt and feel what the listeners see in that programming i'm sure this uh we can achieve the success desired  and the first experiment we started at a i r bangalore in nineteen eighty-seven  the programme series was known as nisarg sampada  social forestry  and this programme was planned in collaboration and cooperation with this uh one word forest department of karnataka government  and we worked out thirteen episodes  and uh those thirteen episodes were evolved after discussing with various communicators experts and at taking a tryst in the field  total of programmes we took in the field and uh we assessed the success of the and impact of the programme on the listeners  and then we made some changes in the formats  and we thought we should use two-way communication system  to be more effective  and that is what we adopted and it proved very successful  this particular programme was subsequently introduced on all india basis in fifteen languages  and for that purpose we invited applications from our listeners to register forest one word  so response was our plan was to register about one  lakh listeners throughout the country  but the response was so tremendous as we got hundred and forty thousand and we felt that it is important for us to one word  we requested the listeners the register has stop  so that was the uh response in the beginning  then after the completion of the series  duri come series we got number of letters and it was  unmanageble for us  and we conducted open book examination to just assess  how much our programme has been successful  how much information the listener has retained  it is not only that it they listen it  but whether have they have acquired this and retained it that is very important factor  and through these open examinations we observed that more than seventy-five persons percent of the  registered listeners appeared for the open book examination  and their degree of infor knowledge was about seventy-three percent correct  and large number of of exa the prizes were given to the first and that was the how we got into the new format uhm uh sir did you face any kind of scepticism laughs  when you decided to launch this revolutionary series of broadcast  ? yes of course because uh among we professionals  there is always a tendency that we always uh want to glorify the past  and uh there is always a resistence for new ideas new experiments  and it was there  and people thought but who is going to attain and suggest after all people know about it  they are for years together they know about forest what new things you are going to impart  and it is a very cumbersome thing with no achievement about it  but i said let us try and do it  let us see how we get this one because unless we try  we will never know whether we are going correctly or not correctly or whether we should pursue this particular format or not  and after the efforts were done the series was introduced and concluded  we found it was the most successful format that's good  to a listeners beyond our expectations   pichhle sal all india radio ne ye abhiyan kiya jisse jis karyakram ko aap ne radio date ka nam diya hai date standing for uh what what's the actual name for  uh radio date date drug alcohol tobacco  education right now you did this in thirty episode which is the largest radio series of its kind anywhere in the world right  uh what prompted you to go in for this ? what have been your experiences ? what were the shortcomings if any that you noticed ? and what is your assessment of this experiment ?  right  see uh as a broadcaster we always lookout for some area and subjects  and any problem we come across we always want to see from the angle of whether we can use this subject for programming and we can  use our uh technique of communication for the wider uh  information and acceptance  uh it is actually i myself was a chain smoker  for ten years i was smoking fifty cigars per day  and nineteen sixty-two i left it once for all for one or two words  one day i was coming from uh malaysia via singapore at the airport i saw a very good looking charming one word  air-hostess was sitting there  and within two minutes i found she started smoking and the whole  her uh uh facial expression that whole thing has changed  and that struck me whether this particular subject we should take in  because uh tobacco as you know there is no control  you can sell tobacco anywhere and talk to anybody  there is no control of smoking  any person from child five years to ninety years smokes no control over it  no restriction on the place of smoking  there is restriction for the drinking  there are dry areas but for tobacco consumption there is no restriction no law at all uhm  so i thought this is area which is common so commonly  spread over this ha ha habit or what can say addiction so radio can play very important role because the reach of radio is very much high and interior area especially  and uh among the underprevileged classes so we thought we should work out on these bases  but how to work out how to go about it  so we actually uh approached the i c c m r uh to whether they can help us with this research and uh information whether we can uh work out and then in collaboration with this  we evolved this series like radio date  because they adviced that that we should also include drugs and uh  uhm alchohol also as a part of the whole series and that's how we started the series  and we involved number of experts who have done lot of research work in tobbaco areas and it was found that the every druggist or alcoholic person has graduated from smoking   uhm  uhm he initially smoking smoked and then he has gone to that level  so everybody was con uh convinced that this series must be taken very seriously and we should do uh something  and contribute something substantial for the improvement of this one word health and over all atmosphere  and thats how this we started working on it  and then thereafter we worked out the format  and same methodology adopted  first we we conducted a workshop in fifteen languages  we prepared prototypes  took the one word in the field tested them and came back and whatever the deficiencies we found out  during the testing they were removed  and then final programme was gone mass production  and the same technique was adopted we invited application called the registrations  because we wanted that our listeners should be the same listener throughout the series and he should be seriously involved  and we were happy to know that everybody were listener  who registered himself was communicating with us  and the impact was so tremendous that there number of people who wrote to us that they've given up smoking  uhm  yes now i c m r is conducting a post broadcast research at bangalore and calcutta  that those people who wrote to us and they gave up the smoking or drug addiction thing  what is happening to them thereafter ? uhm  so that was the impact of this particular series  as a television person uh my heart is with television  laughs  you will appreciate that  my mind agrees with what you were saying sir  but now this experience that you've gained from this earlier series on methods of science jeevan sourabh jo aapane kiya aur ab radio date ka aapane jikar kiya to jo aapko tajurba huwa anubhav huwa hain uske aadhar par ab aap kya karne lage hain ?  ab hamne ek naya serial uh kiya hain  human evolution manushya ka vikas  ye serial ek kaafi lamba serial  hoga abhi tak mere khayalse kisi dunya mei aise vishay par itna lamba serial banaya nahin gaya aur manushka  vikas ka jo hissa hain we were one word much of the  one word isme bhi hamane bahutse institution  ko liya hai tata fundamental research bhi isme  involve hain aur uh this national council of science and technology also been involved  some eminent scientists are involved dr s r rao and some persons  and we have worked out the one word now doing last one and half year we were working on this project   aur ab ye saara complete ho chuka hain do june se hum ye shure kar rahe hain  aur is serial ka bhi technique wohi hain  ke registration of the listeners   aur uske baad listener se  communication  two-way communication technique wohi tarika hoga  aur uske baad in between we are going to have survey conducted  to see the impact of the series  the whole object appears our object is to generate a scientific temper   ki log har cheej ko vaigyanik drishti se dekhe  ek aadat ban jaaye ki har cheej ko ye aisa aisa kyo hota hain ? kaise hota hain ? manushya kin kin awastha se kyo gujara hain ? uska behaviour mein ye parivartan kaisa aaya  ? why that one word changing ? and we have come from where to this stage ? and what is next ? where are you going ahead ? so this kind of the different of facets of the human evolution  are going to be discussed in this series  within a particular series like this one on human uh evolution the sub-subject how do you decide then ? that subject we discussed with various uh experts  and also we conducted surveys and we try we to assess ke which are the areas where the information is required more  and where are the areas where the information is very less available or the common listener has no access for that information  at his level in the villages or interior areas or in uh rural areas  so that kind of information we want to see it is vital information  and without that information the further information which we are going to give to them will not be relevant  so so that we have to link up those areas and see that there is no gap of information  as well as information which is needed to the listeners is given  uhm  let me be the devil's advocate for a moment  yeah   ye ye your experience obviously has demonstrated beyond the shadow of doubt that radio is still a very effective medium for social education and social change  then what about uh family welfare family planning   yeah  that is another aspect i'm telling you because family planning i think we are putting out more than six thousand programmes every month  and there also the success is so great that the latest surveys all the surveys which have been conducted for different places  have been uh uhn shown that the first source of information on family welfare was radio  uhm all right now on the table in front of us mr director general there are  these little kits lying would you like to tell us what they are ? so this was the kits which were one or two words  method of science  so these kits were where you find the one word is there let me it is on do you it yourselves i can just show you this this  now these are the lenses which were supplied  because there was some certain uh lessons were there and certain experiments were shown to the listener the kits were provide provided to one lakh forty thousand uh people all the registered  and this is the stone covering that particular experiment  so that the listener can himself try this experiment at home how the things work  ah  and we also provided a chart a big huge chart was shown to them  this type which one is it ? is it the chart ? yeah  this is it  you can see this is a chart of uh mega of science  see here here  so every thing was available in advance with the listeners i see and that before the days programme was started they had to read this particular portion and also the questions were raised what kind of uh uh questions they can raise it  and when they listen the programme and then write to us and experiment with this kit  uhm this is obviously a new concept in distance education yes yes uh sir ek sawal aur uthta hain ki jo baaki antarashtriya radio sansthaye hain  jo aapne abhiyan kiya hain aur shandaar aapko safalta mili hain un hone isme kuchh dilchaspi prakat ki ?  ye iske baareme hamne baat ki thi pichhle dino  asia basic broadcasting organisation ki meeting  hui thi singapore mein  wahan par iske upar kafi charcha hui thi aur khaas taur se jo vikas sheel desh hain jo uske sadsya hain unhone hamse iske baareme kafi material manga hain aur usse uh doosara  experiment jo hamne pahle kiya tha uske liye hamare paas bhi   ghana se log aaye the yaha dekh neke liye ki hum kis tarahse  one word kar rahe hain kaise ja rahe hain aur communal broadcasting uh association ki jo meeting hui thi usmein bhi ispar kafi charcha hui  aur woh log hairat me hain ke radio can do so much  and uh how it is possible without the visual aids ? merely if it's a stromg medium we are able to go ahead well the director general gave us a peep into the future what comes after the serial on human evolution ? see uh we are thinking on some social uh areas  and we are conducting some surveys to find out which are the areas where because without the input from the research we do not want  to going go ahead  because we want to be very sure ke this particular area needs the radio has to play a role  and then we identify the subjects and then we work on this basis but our aim will be only to take up the social issues  well sir thank you very much for having been with us on the morning show as uh they say more power to your lungs  as you do this on radio and we in television will be watching carefully somewhat enviously but we will be watching nevertheless thank you very much mr director general for having been with us our guest this morning was shri amritrao shinde director general of all india radio and we have been talking to him about this spectacular unprecedented experiment in terms of social integrated social broadcasting that have been carried out by all india radio for the first time  in the world 
hello viewers  nearly all aspects of journalism have been undergoing a metamorphisis in recent times  wide ranging changes have gripped the media some for the better some for the worse  the glossies as they are called have come to stay  and even seem to be thriving  uh there has been a wave of investigative journalism uh which has brought along controversies of its own today we have with us mr dileep padgaonkar the editor of  the times of india who will speak to us on the modern trends in journalism today  mr padgaonkar has a ph d in philosophy from sourgone  paris  he has been a correspondent of the times of india  in paris and has worked in several capacities  with the unesco  uh today he'll dwell on the principal influences  a acting on journalism  uh diplomacy in diplomatic actions and the polarisating within the media itself  mr padgaonkar apart from the technological advancements in what way does present day journalism differ from that in the immediate post independence period  there have been differences i think at three levels  clearing his throat  the first is that the market for the built medium has become very much more competitive than it was in the years immediately after independence yes and this is has brought into its wake coughs several trends some encouraging some not so  among encouraging trends i think is the much greater  emphasis on the professionalism on presentation on packaging so on so forth clears his throat  the discouraging trend is of course that the very competition has given rise to a great deal of uh one word journalism sensationlism and i refer in particular to film journalism though it is not restricted merely to film journalism you find much of uh this kind of personality bashing even in poliltical journalism and lately imperative journalism  so this is the the first uh change that i i can see the other change has been brought about by technology itself i think the uh revolution has been witnessed in the field of  uh print technology in particular the question of gathering data storing it retrieving it processing it and so on has made uh it possible for news papers now to have a cleaner look of brighter look to meet their deadlines of course there are  teething problem as everywhere else  but this is the second factor which has uh gone long way i think to bring about several changes in journalism thirdly clears his throat it has uh also brought into play a degree of specialisation which you did not have in the immediate uh uhm years after independence today you have uh journals specialised in sports in motoring in yatching uh in architecture and so on so forth and what this is meant that is a greater degree of  uh pluralism  discipline-wise uh in the one word fashion and these three trends taken together is meant that today's  journalism is uh quite unlike anything that was witnessed by our parents and our grandparents   uh  what about the editorial content which which is  they had this identity ferver then you know but today they are tended to go towards through profit oriented  you know i'm not one of those who believes that what the parents and grandparents did evident flo   flows from idealism and what is happening today is entirely  uh gripped by mercantilents  i think mercantilents were present then  they are present today  those idealisms then and there is considerable idealism today i say this because i i deal with a great many uh then  journalists  i take an active interest in the training of journalism in my own newspaper  and uh then i feel that atleast in the initial years they aren't corroded by cynicism which you find among those who have  been in the business for ten or twelve years  uh but where you are probably right is that the manner in which market forces are shaping uh the field today   it's something which is which the older generation  is not really accustomed to  this is happening everywhere in all countries where you have  the free market and a free press but in our country it's relatively new  the fact that uh today newspaper editors are supposed to be conversant atleast with what market trends are being yet what the trends are and the area of production in the area of circulation and so on so forth it means that uh you cannot the pictures will have of the editor who sits in his close cabin and concentrates all day and produces his handling editorials that picture i think is part of the myth of which is uh  now dead and gone  uh these days we've seen you've seen uh  a peculiar phenomenon  uh industrial houses have taken a keen interest in starting a newspaper of their own you know  uh what do you feel of it yes there again you know you should take a look at the major uh newspapers uh in the english language your faculty were always controlled by industrial houses but what happens   but you had something to do with journalism they were not purely industrial houses as such no you had certain newspapers clears his throat which were  those only whose own sole interest was in the field of publication of magazines and newspapers you see if you take a look at the clears his throat   anand bazar patrika group in calcutta or the hindu group in madras clears his throat  you always had some of them whose sole business was this  what you're probably trying to hint at is that  uh industrialists with interests in several industries are adding  newspapers to their clears his throat uh to their table sources uh and then your coyright  with there are two reasons for it  it might not really be for money that is i can tell you that newspapers though form of uh profitable today then they ever were  some of them atleast clears his throat   it's still not the most profitable among the business ventures uhm in the country  uh probably many of them want to gain political clout  by starting newspapers clears his throat  i have my own reservations for this so the powers can be misused you say so the powers can be used but i i had my own doubts about how much clout a newspaper must be really enjoying i mean you know being addressed to by the your first name by the power of the woman if that is clouting may be this  but if you see the manner in which the official media are handled my own feeling is that the shrewdest among the political lot  gear up doubles for what the print media writes so even this business of clout write is some what exaggerated but then this is in contradiction to the what happens to to  an industrialist recently he had to give up his shares in a particular newspaper of course it does  but much depends also on how much that particular industry  industrialist is able to uh stands  stand off a pressure on him i know another industrialist who has been uh facing the wrath of government for the greater part of the past ten ten years and uh while the scoop of the particular industrialist  doesn't have other interests anymore clears his throat  the fact is he's short of the great deal of grit and comes to me in in defending these matters i think it's part of you know periodically  there're fashions in the in the medium and media as there's  fashion elsewhere and the current fad is that let's me let me have a magazine let me have a daily newspaper and so on so forth my own view is this will this too record will fade away fast to what do you attribute the plori plorify plori  proliferation of a glossy magazines as they call and uh the they're quite successful at that  even though they are very few and less at times no they are successful because no editing i think ten percent now and on packaging on presentation use of uh colour  uh this is all a part of growing competitive environment  and uh today you have a supplement on blazed paper  uh you even have suppliments on art paper and i won`t be surprised if you in due course you have supplements uh with perfume in them uhu and may be even a musical note  uhu  you mean to say a readers can be carried away by its  one word   i think readers are in one word  certainly that that one little difference uh which makes it possible for attractive packaging to to get rid of this  this is of other areas if you see what happens for detergents or soaps or uh shampoos  you see that it's a really aggressive form of marketing the advertising uh the packaging this is really what  what sets  so newspaper has become like any other product i think generally you ca  you can say that more and more people own newspapers regard newspapers uh in terms of products then in terms of the public service  uh that's things you sh should change naturally it is exactly but you know it's not something to be romantic it has to come sooner or later  if you feel that people are putting in their money investing  naturally and so on uh uhm for purely idealistic uh reasons then i think uh one is really not up to the mark increasing you'll find that with massive investments  uh they there will have to be a closer interaction between the editorial side of a newspaper and the managing sides of newspaper yes  uh in recent times newspapers some of them uh major  one's atleast are being one word that either belonging to the opposition or which are very pro-government what do you have to say? i think the observation is especially in the objectivity point of view yes you your observation is is at once true and sad  because i think some newspapers have taken it upon themselves  to play politics through journals  like some others have sought to use newspapers for their  economic or business for example  uh the polarisation you talk of is radio reflection of polarisation on the national field  and to that extend it is inevitable  but do newspapers contribute to the polarisation i feel yes alas they do  whereas uh the functions of a newspapers i've seen are ready to take a stand issue by issue  partly because ideological has come between we no longer have  the certainties of this or that ideology things are from there  and in its place in that vacuum that has been created what you have clears his throat is not another ideology but self interest and self interest understood in an absolutely mundane  petty vulgar sort of it so that extend i think you are right there is a polarisation i deplore it  uh i try to resist it but unless the country itself becomes less polarised  and until the country learns to accept that there is no  not one truth with the capital t but many truths which have to one word  uh it is then that you can see their involvement  and then the involvement of the of the journalists and the newspapers uh i deplore the fact for example the news columns are used more and more for partisans interests  i think uh the reporters ought to be allowed to write  exactly what they feel like and such comment as you want to make should be confined to the  editorials   that's a  editorials  but uh there has been uh as you see among  theorists mass media theorist say that especially in a country like in india which is still in a developing stage  there has ought to be some agency which takes which moulds public opinion or which guides people  and at times peoples might have to take the role of the opposition  because as you know our opposition is pretty weak in the country  but some people don't agree to this what is what is your opinion ? no no  the that you see it is it is true that you know because institutions have tumbleded whether it is parliament whether it is judiciary uh and much of their business is now readily been given to the press  uh it's a daunting task and it doesn't  happen in in developed countries  and once you do that you got to be the saviour of the institutions  you've got to be promoting causes  you've got be doing things which earlier you  didn't  for example even ten years ago i think that the press reported the going on in the parliament  today it's going from the parliament are determined by what it is the press  and it's a complete switch over and it's a dangerous switch over because the press is accountable of course  but certainly it is not as accountable or as immediately accountable or as determinately accountable as the elected representatives of people  and to try and substitute yourself in the press for them  can lead to all kinds of problems  so do you think that certain code of conduct should be  the immediate code of conduct because now we have a very loose i don't think either a rigid code or a flexible codes could work because partly as you rightly point out there is this polarisation  so on what basis can you have uh a two words  my feeling is there is very little concensus in the newspaper world for what newspaper ought to be  uh all of us stood together when the definition bill was brought together we managed to beat that back  we also stood together when recently the jammu and kashmir government brought a fresh bill  but this kind of solidarity remains very fragile  uh otherwise there is uh uh clear polarisation in the newspaper world and i don't think it dissolved very easily  for a code of conduct even a flexible one you need a measure of consensus and that consensus mind you does not exist at the moment 
chairman sir when we go through the budget apparently  it will exceed to just the budget with the duties set upto four thousand five hundred twenty-two crores rupees capitals and excise and no further taxes levied  the central plan outlay have been increased by thirty-two percent when we show all these things and expecting our one word  be close by four point five percent  it seems to be kept bold and imaginative budget  but what is the real scenario of the budget we have to go through little bit deeper they are speaking thousand one hundred million man-days of the employment that can be created what they feel  but for nineteen ninety-two ninety-three when we go through the reality the first six months where we are able to create only two hundred forty-three million man-days of employment interruption  outside  that means now what we envisage to create only twenty-five percent of that man-days we are able to create in the last last year last six months of the budget year  i want to know from the government what infrastructure has been created to fulfill this year's target  sir while we say that for central plan outlay has been increased by thirty-two percent we must also go through with the subsidy issue  sir according to subsidy whatever finance is assigned  i want to quote financial resource if i have gone to create the i c o if i have gone the same way as the last year the fertiliser subsidy alone would have gone up to rupees eleven thousand crores  because of the action taken in the last two years the fertiliser subsidy could be only rupees three thousand five hundred crores  from this you can find out sir more than seven thousand five hundred crores has been put on the farmer's  shoulder already  when we say that the subsidy keeps speaking that subsidy is something wrong policy no what is called subsidy ? subsidy is nothing but the transfer of income from one section of the society to another section of the society  suppose for example if i tell if you want to stop the entire subsidy for fertilizers and if you wanted to take up all the concessions that what they are giving on the per tariff the electricity tariff  then suppose the production of the agriculture comes down  then we may have to take the grants from the foreign countries like  states or european countries  for example what it pays about three hundred and fifty it is approximately i'm telling for three hundred and fifty  rupees what it pays to our indian farmer the same rate we may have to import from the american farmers as five hundred and fifty  rupees  two hundred rupees we have to pay more  instead of that what i say is instead of paying to the american farmer why should not we give to our own indian farmers  what is wrong in giving subsidy ? sir regarding the subsidies i wanted to tell that share of the subsidies to the non-plan expenditure during the seventh plan period  approximately this is sixteen percent  now this side share of the subsidies in the non-plan expenditure during this year it is reduced eight point seven percent they think that subsequent reduce in the subsidy they are actually pleasing the one word a body of the world bank  this is not good for the common people in the india  sir regarding the interest payment i want to tell sir the interest payment is now forty-two percent of the total non-plan expenditure  now it accounts forty-two percent of the total non-plan expenditure  but in the seventh plan average it was only twenty-seven percent sir  then personal income tax exemption  the income tax exemption till nineteen eighty-one it was fifty  rupees fifteen thousand  in nineteen eighty-five it was eighteen thousand in nineteen ninety it was twenty-two thousand nineteen ninety-two twenty-eight thousand  sir the nineteen eighty-one well what they say fifteen thousand  rupees exemption into that system sir  now it is the value of that fifteen thousand rupees  now it is said about forty thousand rupees  what i wanted to emphasize through you sir in australia different method is applied  in australia what they did australia one word according to australian one word first they fixed the base or base amount  that is their triparty two words that government employers employees all together they have come to one conclusion and it is taken as a base year  from that base year when one's accepted exemption amount that every year what is actually inflation takes place in australia they have according to that percentage the exempted limit also keep being enhanced sir through you what i wanted to emphasize to the government of india that please atleast now you replace that nineteen eighty-one you please take it as a base year fifteen thousand  rupees  after that every year how much deflation takes place in india  so far taken in india you please translate it that this inflation  after hopeless that inflation it enhance the amount then it will be one scientific way sir regarding unique system of india the investment is so far  it attracts the eight to eighty of one word so far but now it has been given up  our honourable finance minister says we have today equal treatment with other financial institution we are dealing  but for this one gentlemen what the economy they have given the proper replace for that objectively the finance minister has taken this step so as to put the u t i or bond with other mutual fund however if that was the only reason surely his left technical method would have been the extensive a few words  benefits to other mutual funds  instead of taking the benefits what people are enjoying in the u t i they would have experienced the same benefit the other mutual funds  then sir when you object actually enhance the prices   you're doing not only the interest one word   not only in the tax one word but the administrative prices for example i tell you before announcing the budget  pre-budget you can say pre-budget announcement you have enhanced the price for sugar  you have enhanced the price for actually the rice's  price increased  the actual price increased gold price increased that the prices of the coal prices of the sugar price of rice price of the  then increased automatically it all the product put on the floor therefore what i request the government that government should what they they have shown what they have printed what they have said is totally different from what they are doing  what is their real intention ? therefore i wanted to i want i request you truly sir  that please bring in practice that the one word be the government  with these words i conclude thank you   one or two words  from the last two years we successfully withdrew money from the  one word   a few words  and thereby about thirty-two thousand crores  of rupees has been withdrawn from the market   and thirty-two thousand crores of rupees  has been invested in the financial market in the share market   a few words   a few words  therefore within last year shivaji when we proposed the budget and uh due to the a few words lot more concessions were announced for the industrial set-up than the capital market shivaji  then we we then the entire nation witnessed the goings  in regards to the scam scandal  the hopes were raised among many people including the rural folk to invest in the industrial sector and thereby lot more money has been diverted from agriculture to manufacturing sector and from rural area to urban area  i will also budget when we budget at the budget there was no hike in the tax component and uh additional component was not enhanced nor the custom duties  but at the same time they gave certain relief to other sectors and he said that everything is going to be cosy but he can't lend us we analyse the figures  here they purposefully and calculatively transferred about thirty thousand crores of rupees from capital account to revenue account  and so then once money is transferred from capital account to revenue account all your balance expenditure will be cut and all your  development developmental activities will be affected  and we are witnessing in this in this country that every developmental activities is cancelled  no construction of roads no construction of bridges for industry and no allocation or any land allocation in this country  as the finance minister day-in and day-out he talks much about the so called liberalisation and the so called delicensing policy  but this delicensing policy is yet to touch the agricultural sector  and several manufactured goods and several consumer goods  includes the motor cars refrigerators as well as the one word  and washing machines are under the delicensing policy  as far as exemption is concerned than the so called delicensing proposal and so called liberalisation it is hardly that it is changing the attitude a few words in the agriculture sector  for example you take the example of the sugar industry  then all of our industries are related to sugar industry is kept with the ministry of industry  in andra pradesh about ninety-two applications were received by the government  and the application was forwarded to the union government to the minister of sugar factories in andhra pradesh with an install capacity of twenty-five hundred metric tons per day and with an investment of not less than forty crores on each unit and the larger units are allowed four thousand crores  of investment has been pumped into circulation as far as the sugar-cane industry is concerned  then you take the example of the dairy industry  when the government in their own one word they have given us into dairy industry also  so there are about six fifty people applied for to go for dairy industry  many people like both domestic as well as the multinational they came forward to go for the dairy industry as there is potential in this country also  but i was made to understand that mr balram jakhar he came in the way and he wanted to bring same other narad   through back door  so mr balram jakhar announced through his animal husbundry department of the ministry of agriculture an offer by then milk and milk products are to the n f n f d o  so if anybody wants to go for dairy with an install capacity of more than ten thousand litres per day then entirely he has to get his name registered and we get registering form from the agriculture department  it is challenged in the court of law  so for the last two years instead of the liberalisation in the dairy industry two words applications are pending with the union government for want of the registration with delay ministry of agriculture headed by mr balram jakhar  i take another example  for example the second biggest monopoly in the world the r k reynolds company they approached this government to allow them to produce cigerettes in this country and they ensured the nation to  to the extent that they would consume about twenty-eight thousand metric tons of sugar metric tons of tobacco in this country  and not only that they ensured to export about one forty crores of cigarettes to the other countries and they also ensured that about six hundred crores  of revenue they will contribute in the form of excise on this cigerette  but their proposal was was also turned down  i visited one word to the minister of commerce and the minister told me that as the deputy chairman of the planning commission he vetoed it  since the last forty-five years this is the only year when there is no hike and the excise component on the cigarette  but the answer to this the cigarette manufacturers in their own wisdom during last january february as they rotate they enhanced the prices of the cigarette then anticipating some enhancement some hike in the excise components on the cigarette in the budget proposal  but to their fortune there was no increase in the excise component  thereby the cigarette manufacturers drawn an opportunity  to garner three hundred crores of rupees   which did not circulate to the government in the form of the revenue  and nor to the tobacco grower for in the form of the price of the tobacco  add to this two words the prices of the tobacco are going down when compared to the last two three years so we suggested to the government to impose a levy of one percent on the sale of the cigarette and which money which amount  can be utilised as a market stabilising fund for the tobacco  and i hope the government will come out and the finance minister will come out while answering these by answering  the finance bill and see that the one percent is imposed on the sale of the cigarette and that money can be utilised as a market stabilising fund so i hope that the finance minister will come out with the proposal while answering these fi financing  it thank you 
 prof sarin  then now the discussion that we are having really become  ritually a few words  in the other house already the budget has got through  that is the ruling party has won  won means inspite of their minority with their contrast majority only because the total of the opposition was unable to found hard on that contrast majority to break it through  i just have known that one or two words be long to come but let us take the fact as they are kept at the moment  it is because they are still there  we have discussed their budget  it is their budget  it is not the budget of the country  it is the budget of the congress party  but the very truly i feel with that party is this  party's culture spins us around personality cult  only one speaker whether i i can agree with him or not  talks on the one or two words but all others have  finished their speech with one or two words and through the prime minister and finance minister in the bracket  in that one or two words with that of one or two words  during the entire speech and i think what is more revealing in this house such self-analysis that introspectable vioable that in this country for the last forty years we have been groping in the dark through a known path  and now a doctor has appeared with a magic lantern  with the blessings of the prime minister who hails from the region of tirupathy or one or two words at least in that stage today he is a one or two words self one or two words  this is certain thing that party is supposed to stand before  for which that they one or two words and from which they draw sustenance  from the name of gandhiji from the name of nehru from the name of sardar patel and all other freedom fighters  the rajiv gandhi of of whom they will now talk so much  so within these forty years forty or as in free  this ninety-one period  so all at one or two words i don't know what will happen at amethi  that is their internal affair  but is such bretheren is the idealogical foundation of the ruling party of the great country   that's a woe unto the total population of the country it is nice to break one or two words almost by the dual one or two words it has no right  and now by inheriting that if demolishing it even on which  on the foundation on which they stand  then the question is mr vice chairman what for we should be thankful to the new mens era  either dr manmohan singh or p v narasimha rao if the budget that has been presented what is that what that ensure  that ensures that our foriegn exchange which we didn't afford i m f loan or world bank loan or a g b loan or net loan through other syndicates  in the history of the world perhaps such shameless  acknowledgement of the building up of foriegn reserves and things like that and showing it to be a strength of the economy what do we found  ? that these and of late our finance minister went  in the one pack jumborie in order to ensure three hundred   crores of dollor one or two words for what  one or two words our all one or two words  and what else could he do ? he went a few words policy only involved that you know  under the pressure of u s a one or two words  under the threat of this super three hundred one regarding which some  a few words takes place now and then  in order to one or two words the duncan proposal  in order to steal ourselves for that one or two words  where duncan proposals will be finalised  what you mean then ? our import duties had been reduced one or two words  and services have been reduced or totally done away with in order to make import from advanced countries to developed countries  to capture our market to victimise of our indigenous industry  therefore from whatever point of view it may be looked into  it enlarge unqualified proposition and unequivocal condemnation i shall oppose oppose this budget tooth and nail  v narayanswamy  yes madam please  one or two words honourable finance minister  a few words but he was not using while referring to the present day birth situation on the economic scenario made very clear and categorical assertion in his majesty which i like to put only two or three sentences to  enlight your enlighten the honourable members who are on the other side  a few words  madam he says the a few words very rapidly  becoming more integrated at northern place and also more complicated other developing countries are successfully transforming themselves  to meet these challenges  we cannot afford afford to stay out of this problem which appear to be awkward  this a few words  therefore madam the finance minister was very clear in his mind that with the with the birth the economic situation is changing  changing changing rapidly  liberation is taking place even in the communist country  and not only that they one or two words should become competitive in the field of production of various items including the infrastructure industry consumer industry and india should be in a position to export to other countries various items in the international field india also should become competent and also competitive to get not the foriegn exchange to balance our economic situation  therefore madam several liberal liberal measures for  to sort out on one or two words and which has been taken by the present government for the last two years  but that is the the the new schemes and steps that has been taken by the government for the purpose of recouping the economy  that was established in the year nineteen ninety-one beginning  started yielding good results   ma madam the balance of payments position which was left at two thousand crores   by the previous government now it has come up to the level of  eighty-eight thousand eight hundred to eight hundred twenty-eight  crores  on borrowed money  no it is not borrowed money the borrowed money goes to investment which which one has to accept  madam it is also a fact that the the our our limit of five point nine million as our foriegn exchange reserve  we have not achieve one has i have to admit on that point and that aspect  therefore madam the government has taken various measures  for the purpose of improving the economy  and the finance minister who has taken a bold decision to bring reform in in the in the agriculture side  madam the thrust has been given for agriculture in the in the present budget by the finance minister  and the outlay for the one or two words agriculture  si side has been increased  considerably  the reason is that madam the agriculture is the poor sector  which is the vital for the purpose of development of any country especially our country india  madam then the government brought liberalisation as far as the  the bringing the industries in the rural areas the agro-based industries  the agriculture to be given all the emphasis and also support by the by the budget  therefore madam that the name new agriculture policy that has been proposed by the government is going to give a thrust to it  and the it will pay therefore lot of agro-based industries to come into this country in the rural areas for the purpose of creating  employment to the rural persons who are living in this country  madam the industrial recession was there in the last year  in this country  and not only the industrial recession in this country it has been throughout the world  the both the consumer items and also the infrastructure industries the production was less  even in the other country but the there is recession total recession and therefore the goods could not be marketed  anywhere in our country and also abroad  therefore madam some changes have been brought by this government for the purpose of investment and also especially in the infrastructure side so that to give boost to the infrastructure industry  madam in the banking sector which i would like to say only  a few lines  uh the it is a one word the nation  now several lakhs of rupees have been in the security scam  several banks have been involved  several the executives of the banks have been  one or two words and also some of the officers have been arrested and c b i is one or two words investigating into the matter and not only that our parliamentary committee is also  going into the security scam  madam though it was initially felt it is about five thousand  two hundred crores  madam this this security scam has only shaken the the banking system in this country  and that the banks have indiscriminately invested in the in that say scam one word without the approval of the government and also bring the one or two words and thereby the finance minister has to undertake ten thousand crores  for the purpose of the giving the manufacturing bank  madam the honourable the minister for banking is also sitting here  then who is affected today ? it is the farmer who is affected  it is the farm industrial products who are affected not the  one or two words not the stock brokers it is only the people who are genuinely working for the development of this country they are affected  and the loan are loans are not being given to them  even madam see when the previously when congress government there there was a scheme for the purpose of giving loan to the people loans one word scheme was there  and it was giving benefit to the small people agriculturist  and also schedule caste and schedule tribe people  and and also from labourers  today what is happening they are not in a position to go to the bank they are not able to enter into the bank today  the reason is that that the b j p government came here  they have completely closed the door  thereafter one or two words security scam after security scam the banking officials they are not allowing the agriculturists to enter into the bank  this is a very serious matter mr minister  the indira gandhi our honourable former prime minister has taken up  nationalisation of the bank is only for the purpose of giving benefit to the poor people downtrodden schedule caste and schedule tribe agriculture a few words agriculturists  and madam i feel there is a one or two words method in the banking division we don't one or two words  people there honestly repay the amount  it is the big industrialist who have siphoned out ten thousand  crores of rupees who have not paid that money  but it is only the agriculturists who are paying the money and those people a few words  and not only that for only capital small-scale industrialists who are who are suffering today the reason is that the banks banks have completely closed down they have not allowed the small scale industries also to come for the working capital  they say one or two words the security scam is being investigated they have not received any direction from the government  therefore they will not give you the loan  therefore madam the production in the small-scale sec  sector is going down  madam small scale sector is contributing twenty-two percent of the export in this conutry  it is not the big industry it is not the middle middle industry it is only small scale industry that is contributing for large export in this country that is going to be killed by the banking sector  because they are not providing loans to them  therefore the honourable minister venkatrajan minister who is sitting here i request him to deal with seriously call all the  bank banking officers give a direction to them  normal banking activity should start otherwise our production in this country will go down  and also the people who are in the agriculture sector they will be suffering  the another area there honourable finance minister has to concentrate is black money  more than eighty thousand crores of  rupees is in the form of black money interruption  madam that black money has to be brought down  which should be brought out which is now hidden  that is to be done various schemes have been brought then they bringing fund from madras the government will not ask the account now where was scheme that we brought ? what is the total amount if you have recovered if you have brought out of it ? it is not even more than seven percent out of eighty thousand crores not even seven percent of the money has come out  what is the scheme you have to bring the black money out ? so that the inflation will not be there and there will be a balance economy and and and the people and the budget which you have been presenting in the country is imperfect  madam the only madam the novel provision is for the small scale industry especially the people who are who'll  be having small industry have been given the benefit and it is a laudable measure that has been taken  and madam in our state though it is small state having more than only ten lakh population  in in our town limit alone we have more than four hundred small units which are manufacturing one word which are to be sold one rupee and even a common man goes and gets it and he is using it  and there are madam it's a big lobby is working in this country to curtail that industry for the simple reason that these giants and multinationals they are trying to see that these industries are closed  madam the the one word government has taken a decision low duty duty will be imposed on this item and the turnover has been increased to thirty lakhs  it is a right decision has been taken by the government on the representation given by those people  but madam the lobby that is working the multinational who who are in this country they are trying to kill those industry  and madam that is giving in a small place it is giving employment to more than ten thousand people  the the people who are involved in the production people who are involved in the marketing ten thousand people are getting the benefit not only that the people who are using it are a few words therefore madam this budget i feel that it is a growth oriented budget it is a common man's budget 
 a) jaracharan m  the past much sounded programme of bringing uh bringing the gap between the developed and backward regions in the country this budget does not hold on to the hope for backward state like assam for bringing the region at par with the rest of the country  one or two words  yeah every region should be considered   one or two words industry  communication before three we should finish  assam and bodo one or two words land the entire north eastern region is full of untapped natural resources and mineral  there are no provisions in the budget to combat the waste to find out for the purpose of finding out  and tapping the natural resources for the beneficial  benefit of the people   as to a few words   no no finance a few words your party time is sixty-two minutes  and bringing material welfare to them  assam is a state where eighty percent of the people live on agriculture   assam perhaps was the first state where ceiling on land holding act was passed in the mid fifties   a few words  the maximum amount of land which an agriculturist can hold  is fifty bighas  in the presence of decay and natural division of family the areas in possession of farmers are diminishing making the land with farmers progressively uneconomic making more and more farmers marginal and landless  general provision in the budget for improvement of agriculture  will not help uh ah will not help the farmers of the state and special provisions uh for making industrial planning has to be made special agriculture in the field in the state it is the team  one or two words  there are no provisions of mechanical agriculture no provisions for irrigation and other two word to make agriculture  one word economically viable  in the field of industry my state is the most backward the industries in the state has not taste its exploitative character  the british uh colonial exploited the natural resources in the state to their best and the indian which is that has taken over  only saves exploitative assault  local enterpreneur are being discouraged in their attempt to enter the field and there are one or two words  incentives to them not to try healthy one or two words  industrialists operating in assam exploit the natural wealth  resources all profit take this out of the state without contributing to the welfare of the people  the industries also do not help in the solution of the unemployment programme as they are reluctant to employ local people they one or two words for industries in the north eastern region would not confirm anybody with to the people of the state and the region  one or two words provisions are made to encourage  local entrepreneur as part of industries by offering special concession and in one or two words for encouraging them to enter the field  there are no provisions in the budget for rehabilitation of the non-employed and one or two words by starting  agro-based heavy industry  they are uh no provisions for meeting to the  progressive unemployment programme and number of announcement being in medium and it is uh increasing by last every year the problem is a real one and a serious one  the use of the state discoverings on are straight away emerging out of uh deep sense of deprivation  large numbers of youth have taken up arms others have taken recourse to extortion one word as national a few words  we are going to lose an entire generation  militancy and militarian para military forces have been a permanent picture in the state and large numbers of people are behind the bars under tada  development was uh kept to a standstill for years  the government has to realise that strong arm tactics is not going to help  there should be special provision for removal of the terrorist and the development of the state and special measure to ensure economic development should be started    b) v m jadhav  you know and everybody knows that in june nineteen ninety-one when our government has come into power that time  economy was totally paralysed  unprecedent balance of payment crisis was there  international confiderate has been total collapse and industrial production was falling and inflation was on right thing and then honourable narasimha rao taken up the leadership of this country as a prime minister  and mr manmohan singh when he became the finance minister of this country then whatever economically beneficial for such largest populated country of the world he has sort out properly and he has brought out the reforms  and we are today we are getting the fruits of for  those reforms  madam you know and i also know we talked on the state to state you know that our maharashtra is most agriculturally and economically advance state  it is not only due to bombay  we are running about one hundred and ten co- operatives sugar factories more successfully  we are producing forty percent of the national sugarcane  we are producing the forty percent total of the national cotton  and then most of the cotton mills and textile mills are concentrated in bombay  and if something goes wrong in bombay if war started somebody  from bombay so total economy will be collapsed  this is the wrong policy please for the one state you adopt this policy of the decentralisation of the industries to the rural and economically backward areas of this country  unless you do that our countrymen our people they will never excuse you either bjp will be one or two words or any other party will be one or two words has no meaning it is totally insignificant  but the main significant thing is that then important thing is that the people of this country must get equal benefit of our economic policies that is the main concern  that should be main concern about the country  i was reading in todays one of the press about the duncan agreement government is going to accept the duncan agreement  i don't know i have not fully studied the duncan agreement  but government how they discuss about the duncan agreement  what is the duncan agreement ? what it is going to do harm to the farmers ? how it will be beneficial to the farmers ? farmers are against madam for taxing the agriculturists but the thing is that you please see first what is their economic situation  how much he is getting in his farm ? or how much output he is getting ? we have categorically demanded in this house this agriculture commodity should be given the regulatory prices  you one or two words industry you allow us to increase the prices of agriculture commodity by the standard move when you you you you just gather sympathy to pretend but do not hike but at one at one side you are not allowing to increase the agriculture  pro prices of agriculture commodity  madam about the modernisation of the industry  so about the modernisation of industry much help needed  but i must say that as i have stated yesterday also   wh while discussing about the ntc the national textile corporation  see modernisation process is a continous process and any industry is coming out any licence is given licence are delicenced but it must be made compulsory that they must have their own research laboratory  they must find out their own technology and they must try to modernise their industry as and when required that is very essential our budget should not be the deficit budget it must be the surplus budget  our export must be much more greater than the import  we are given several concession for the import  we are giving several concession for the export also  but we must do all this at the same time we must see that what we are exporting  and we must push the export of agriculture commodity  because in maharashtra we are trying our level best to export the mangoes to export the grapes to export the we are demanding that you can give us the concession to export five to fifteen lakhs of cattle milk  and if we export something and we get this foreign exchange  then we can give better prices to the farmers also  so now the time has come we are not to think twice that  we have to give this top priorities for the export of the agricultural commodity  madam i did not i will not go uh in the detail but i wanted to demand in this house as the discussion is going on on the budget  so that special financial provisions have to be made for the  development of economically backward region for marathwada vidarbha and parts of konkan in maharashtra  in this very house i'm in this very house we have several time demanded that uh category development board should be created for the backward regions of maharashtra marathwada vidharba and parts of konkan  government has never agreed  but at least you must make this situation higher than provision  what is backlog of those region ? others is if then when you have to mention this special financial assistance is given for the development of the economically backward regions of this country  another important thing is that industrialisation of sugar factory spinning mills food processing industries horticulture development programme  whatever demands are from maharashtra they should be solved within no time  creation of proper road communication conversion of state highways into national highways they are demanding this from maharashtra for the last so many years  special financial assitance for irrigation  as the krishna and godavari valley projects are not completed  if we could not complete those projects by two thousand ad our plan will go and whole maharashtra will not get any water  so the special financial assistance should be given for the irrigation project which are to come up in krishna and godavari valley  and laying out a special pipeline now in this house we have this is the last discussion i am taking madam the uhm while discussing the one or two words  questions and some other uh items in this house i have said that i did not take down the lpg pipe line which is co  coming from bombay high to the jagdishpur and even your enquiry a few words said on the same line we demanded in this house that we must have some a pipe line which can carry the bombay high gas from maharashtra to southern india  it must go from the maharashtra vidarbha marathwada then karnataka then andhra then tamil nadu so like this the several pipelines which can carry the bombay high surplus gas inspite of clearing up the gas worth upto fourteen hundred crores  per year you please have the another pipeline and carry out the gas in the southern india so that the farmers there two words  so that our farmers of the southern india will be benefitted with this few lines i i suppose this so one or two words  and thank you very much for one word 
 ( 1) inderjeet kumar  uh our finance minister whom i respect a great deal  noise but one thing on which he has not been able to persuade me to agree with him that we are not ready getting into debt  or we have not even now what to one word  now it would as it is if you look at the budget  already you see a very interesting figure noises uh a few words and uh budget came have even graphically  a few words the break up of the rupee as to how a rupee come and how a rupee goes  and when the break up you see you find that twenty-seven  paisa in a rupee go towards the debt service charges  now these twenty-seven should be very telling when you realise  that our defence budget which is of course more than anything else is thirteen paisa in a rupee   that is your debt service charges are already more than twice of your defence expenditure  now i must compliment the finance minister because his persuasion in washington always gets him more loans  and since for everytime he comes back he comes back with a bag full  and then bagfull ultimately has to be paid  we have created an impression in the country that it is a day of jubilation when we get more debts  as it is one word even in families when we start celebrations as such  when more debts are required various things just out  when the truth comes home and things become very difficult the learned finance minister would have seen the latest report of the u n d t which i had a had a time to glance over  now the whole system of international monitory system is so manipulated that the more we give the more we want  you won't do it and if you look at the logic of debt trap of any society that is what is happening  because devaluation is manipulated  ever since we have launched on this tryst with  globalisation the indian rupee has been constantly devalued  about some times formally many times and more times informally  and today i think if i have mentioned somewhere in my article recently which is gone down by forty-two percent  uh i hope i'm saying the right figure  the end result is that you find that you go on pay  there is not a single country as much a few words  and this is the irony of the whole thing that the more you pay the more you owe  and this will go on happening in our case also  we will be happy for a while but i don't think we can be happy  for a long time  everytime uh the new one word policy if i may  quote myself in the article that i have just written the use of this policy has been uh reversing many sound economic policies  that we have followed in the past  what was our past ? our past was primarily based on self-reliance  our past was on import substitution  and for number of years following the nehruvian outlook  this society has built itself  it is not as if we are a new country like any african african country in dark continents  we are a country who have built in last uh uhm so many years after freedon to come to occupy a very respectable position so far as industrialisation goes so far as our economy goes  we are in a mess because of the debt that we took  who took the debts ? how debts were taken ? how debts were squander ? i will not enter into that area because i know who did it and i know on what we spent  but the main difficutly is different now  let me see we make this country believe as if self-reliance and  and import substitution were dirty words and we must get out of that and launch launch on the new era  then we go on doing this one word  so therefore you see that increasingly now we are getting into  more and more debts and even the experts have said by the end of the eighth plan if we continue doing what we are doing our our debt service charges will be approximately thirty-two percent of the revenue earnings  well it is for the learned minister to decide whether that will be a good day for india or that will be a day for celebration for india  that is for him to decide i don't know i hope i will not live enough long enough to see that day i don't want to see that day  because i come from that generation which participated in freedom struggle  i also belong that to that generation  which took pride in the policies that nehru followed  and we still continue to take pride in that  and if those next generation which thinks they are wiser now than nehru of course they are welcome to it  i will not question their wisdom  but i will also say at the same time that what we are doing  needs caution and needs understanding  the new budget that we have seen is gradually shrinking the nations building prospects  the honourable finance minister can get up and say that well  this year i have given more money for education than he gave last year  that is no comparison because last year it was worst so it is slightly better than the worst that is not the issue  the issue basically is that everything that builds the nation ultimately is shrinking  and everything that doesn't build the nation is expanding  so therefore this is the policy that we are following  i if i get timing sir i would have spoken at length about other dimensions of the of the policies that india is following  my young friend mr minister of state for foreign affairs is sitting here  i would have discussed the foreign policy also and i would have discussed the various things that are causing us anxiety  and i think it is not him a few words but one or two points i want to make  and one point basically is about the kashmir today  i think this is something which you must think over is everything happening there alright  have we not reached a stage when i think as a nation not as a party whether we sit on that side or this side  as a nation we have to sit up and uh see what we can do look at the entire situation sir that police was involved  the para military sector of police which have gone out there some times cause us anxiety  and the prime minister of india does not think it good enough  to call even a meeting of the all party to discuss this kashmir situation  kashmir has been one word from one situation to another  and if there is any area where we should be axious today i think something has to be done  a few days ago i have mentioned also about i o c conference unfortunately yesterday i was out of town so i could not come to the constituency committee meeting  but what i see from the reporting i i spoke to the government of india on that  i think the policy that we are following regarding i o c needs to be to be redoubled  i think i o c is a platform which is converting itself into a into sort of a follow on organisation of what pakistan says  we have several countries in the one word organisation who are very friendly to us most of them who are they  and i think that is uh we should definitely who are they pardon who are they  oh i beg your pardon i i beg you pardon i accept that but mean the same thing a few words   uh whether you put organisation first or islam first it doesn't make much difference  it is so typical to us  it comes to the same thing  the main point that i am trying to say is that in recent time and i hope my young friend will kindly help us in that and help the country in that  that redoubling of the effort is very much called for  and i think on a on a bilateral basis particularly we must make these friends feel and rewrite that friendship in india has always been very profitable and will continue to be profitable for each one of them  be the africa be the asia or be the arab world   india's history has been that in every crisis of this region india has upheld their cause  i think it's not that india's got in danger today i don't see so  but definitely they their diplomacies must see through the type of propaganda that we are being subjected to  and i think that is where our wh  whole effort has to be concentrated on   already   a few words   who are they   who are they   who are they   a few words    ( 2) manmohan singh  sir i am very grateful to all the honourable members  who have taken part in this debate on the budget for nineteen  ninety-three ninety-four  as i scan through the record of the debate i could  defer a couple of issues which have educated the mind  of the members  and i thought the best use i can make of this reply to the debate is to clarify some of those issues  i sincerely believe that many of these issues which have been raised in the debate they are taken care of adequately in the budget that i presented in one word  before i reply to the various points that have been raised in the debate i would like madam to draw the attention of this august house to the basic objectives of the budget as outlined in my budget speech  i will state six basic objectives  the first one to bring about a greater sense of fiscal deficit and to that extent and fiscal deficit has to be reduced  two the rooms for many facilities made possible by insistance consolidation of last twenty-two months has to be used to step up investments and expenditure particularly on anti-poverty  programmes and on social services  three we should plan for a strong industrial recovery in ninety-three ninety-four leading to a great boom in succeeding years of the eighth five year plan  four we must set the pace with steps to form towards a simpler tax system with moderate rate and greater purpose on voluntary complaint  five full force must be given to agriculture agro pertaining activities because agriculture after all is the foundation of our economic growth  six we must devise a policy in one which gives export  the highest possible emphasis making it truly international endeavour  it is against this background that i would like this house  to judge whether the budget meets the challenge uh of the time or not as i mentioned madam there has been concern about inflation  i heard the concern of the members of this house with regards to inflation  but we must also look at the improvement that has come about  in the inflation situation  mr balanandan referred to various statistics  i don't want to go into various statistical squibble but i challenge everybody that by any yardstick whether if you mention the average rate of inflation or twice the rate of inflation whether you mention the whether you take the consumers' price index for industrial workers or consumers price index for agricultural workers or wholesale price index on every considerable index in this last year  there has been a distinct very credible improvement on the inflation front  we are today on a point to point basis with inflation rate of no more than six point four percent which is a trend rate of growth  if you look at the past forty years of indian economy  i am not satisfied with this performance  i believe in the next two years india must gain hike today the rest of the world uh do does not tolerate an inflation rate of more than three to four percent you must therefore have the ambition to bring our inflation rate further down and that means there must be greater fiscal discipline  we must press ahead with the task of fiscal consolidation and this year fiscal deficit will be about four point seven percent of g d p  next year we must reduce it to four or even below  that is the only way we can bring down inflation  the experience of last one year clearly brings out two things first of all if you want to control inflation we must have a strong sense of fiscal discipline  second the supplying side of the economy must be well managed  and last year we clearly saw despite administering one word and prices of fertilisers despite increasing in prices of  one word commodities and steel and coal and petroleum products inflation rate was brought down  and that brings infact to the supreme necessity of keeping the fiscal system in good shape  the central government has made the sincere effort in the last twenty-two months to bring the fiscal house in order  i i urge that the state government need to do the same thing because there are today in the state sector several public sector enterprises particularly state electricity board state road transport corporation irrigation department which are a next burden on the exchequer of the state  several honourable members referred to a need to increase investment in agriculture  i hear that concern but agriculture basically is a state subject and you cannot increase investment in agriculture if state finances remain in such shambles as they are if we lose roughly six thousand crores on electricity generation in our country the national goal is a minimum rate of return of three percent on fixed investment in the power sector but as again three percent goes last year we had combined rate of return in the country was a negative figure of over twenty-one percent  launches of state electricity board amount to six thousand  crores per annum we need power  without power there can be no meaningful economic development and yet how is this country going to find the sources for the generation of power if the power sector is being sore on it and to have year after year losses as high as six thousand  crores per annum so i urge members honourable members that we must evolve a viable national consensus for sound fiscal management of our economy 
question number one twenty-one ( c) m v v s murthy   shri murthy please   shri bolabuli ramaiah ( a) when the government have signed any contracts with the private companies for development of small oil and gas fields  ( b) if so the details there of  ( c) whether the process of privatisation of hydro-carbon sector has been considered  ( d) if so the contracts being initiated at present and ( e) the total contracts signed between the government and private sector  first ( a) to ( e) the statement is laid on the table of the house sir  speaker sir i would like to know from the honourable minister when the government is supposed to open all those areas which are exposition for not early one word open to the security reasons  if so how many such are likely to be opened at the earliest area ? and another thing i would like to know the wealth which have been not properly or defeated whether they are able to plan any  new systems that will enable to increase the fertility in order to increase the requirements of the crude in this country  the honourable minister has made a statement saying within three years they have increased to upto sixty percent of the last   pre previous production  and i would like to know how you will able to achieve that results  and if you can be able to give some information i would be happy  the security clearance is required for opening up uh  the areas before that uh we have to get the security uh clearance required and normally after we get the security clearance those areas are opened up for either explanation or production  specially where they are outside investors foreign companies involved  uh the second part of the question uh uh on what steps are being taken to enhance the production  sir there are various steps which are being undertaken right from bombay high which is the largest field there is a what you call the e o r uh enhance oil recovery uh proposal which is being evaluated there are five companies who have uh bid for this proposal  which will improve our production from the bombay high that is being considered because there will be substantial improvement from the existing  besides that also of other fields we are looking at uh geo-techniques and other technology to come in  like the horizontal drilling in all other method to see how we can augment the all production  and as far as the third third part of the question is concerned the sixty percent production rise  yes sir they are very much in place  this year the production is going up by five million tonnes  that means from the lower of twenty-seven millions last year  this year the production goes upto thirty-two next year thirty-eight and in the year ninety-seven i am glad to inform the house the oil production in the country will go upto forty-four point five sir   that's what the situation is  speaker sir as per the eighth plan what the honourable minister says it should go upto forty-four point four five million  and if we achieve those it will be happy  but whether they are going to do all the things within our own country or in the boundaries of surrounding countries also where it is possible ? whether the o n g c's make any new survey in andra pradesh tamil nadu kerala and gujarat for new areas for new development ? whether they are able to make in order to as   requirements are going up by two thousand years what is the total demand ? how much we have to import ? how much you can produce within the country ? and other important item is the driving technicians which is required in this country are terribly shortage and we are depending more from outside  whether we will have a training school that we can develop them within the country i would like to know from the honourable minister ? sir the strategy for oil explosion explosion in production is to get india its share in the global oil that means india must have its equity in the global oil  hence we are looking for oil within the country and outside the country  we are going to be exploring and getting trying to explore opportunities for producing oil outside  vietnam is the classical example where o n g c videsh  started looking for oil in the vietnam borders  and i am glad to inform the honourable members that in vietnam we have found gas natural gas the commercial study is right now under way  similarly we have taken a block in egypt  we are negotiating with yemen  and there are various other places we are seeing besides looking for oil and gas within the country  so that we don't miss the bus  all this company this is a global phenomenon  you look at all the majors whether it is british petroleum  british gas all the major one word in the world  they are not only looking in their territory they are also looking globally  so the idea is india should be self-sufficient in oil and gas in the quickest quickest possible time frame and that is the strategy we are following  regarding the survey in andra pradesh other areas has not made any reply sir thank you very much  v k bhat  a new o n g c has found a struck a new biggest field in terambulam village in the ramnagaram district of south southern tamil nadu  if so will the ministry beg the o n g c to drill more wells so that the gas field could be consolidated sir sir i would like to convey to the honourable members in the house that wherever and whenever we find presence of hydrocarbon  whether it is in the form of gas or crude the logical next step is  more wells are drilled to de-alianate the fields to find out what is the quantity of the gas and oil which is there so that process definitely wherever it happens it is  automatically that project is taken up more wells are drilled only then we come to a conclusion as to what is the size of the reservoir what is the size of the one word reserves we have so that will be worked again a few words  sir is this a fact that terambulam has been has been cut short mr rao please  mr speaker sir though taking the involving the foreign companies in the oil exploratiion is unavoidable to some extent i would like to know from the honourable minister in view of the fact that o n g c have invested and spend thousands of crores  of rupees and after great great deal of efforts  after very long years some oil fields and gas fields have been identified my question to the honourable minister is why not the government of india his ministry to allocate new fields which are not yet explored to the foreign companies and take up oil exploration and drilling operations by o n g c and our indian oil companies ? various companies are there and by giving issuing shares to the public and raising one word into the ratio in the ratio of one is to four definitely the o n g c and other oil companies  will be in a position to explore the oil which has been formed with our efforts and kindly one word why not the government reconsider its special policy offer giving on platter to this m l c's the precious oil resources and confine only to the new fields which are yet unexplored i would like to have a categorical answer from the honourable minister  sir i think the honourable member is referring to the discovered oil fields which were found out to the indian and international companies in the past  sir i would like to convey to the honourable member  that when this decision was taken which was in ninety-two our foreign exchange reserves our foreign exchange the resource crunch was so severe  that we had some of these fields which we had found which we had discovered ten to twelve years ago so for years they were lying dormant oil was in place but they were not being exploited because of the resource crunch on one hand and the other that o n g c was fully committed with whatever funds and  one word it had for other which they considered more important projects  so to bring the oil on stream in the earliest possible time frame because of the severe oil crunch with which   the country was facing to save the foreign exchange on the import bill we decided to give some of these fields after ensuring that ( a) o n g c is  one word to the partner to the extent of forty percent ( b) that we get the right technology that the production costs are lower than even what o n g c uh would have spent so after taking all these factors into consideration we negotiated in the best interest of o n g c and country sir  but we have to purchase at international market prices  it still comes to uh commercially speaking uh to give an idea a uh that for a given field where the o n g c is a partner like the panno mukhta tapti rava the kind of investments which were required then or even now when they start operating the fields is over a billion dollars and what are we giving them  we are giving them in a range of only ten percent to eighteen percent that they return the rest ninety percent in some cases a little less than  the other cases is all coming back to the company in the country so it is in the best interest sir india is not the only country which is doing it this is being done as a regular programme in argentina in russia in china all over   it's a part of the thing to attract these companies who will get into this crude oil fields and then going to as you are saying the future exploration project and it has already happened  some of these companies like enron and kaman petroleum and indian companies like videocon or uh uh the reliance they have moved now from the discovered all these programmes and they are investing into exploration which is the key area reserve exploration is the biggest challenge from within the country we have to have domestic company we have to have international companies  this the discovered oil fields is very limited its only five percent of the total reserve  what is more important is to get this investment into extension area so that we can find new oil for the country another bombay high reserve efficience goes up that's  the biggest challenge for the country and this will bring bring about this mr shahabuddin  mr speaker sir in his reply the honourable minister  has referred to fourteen fields  now if i recall sir in the seven international rounds of bids that we had offered i believe that around fifty or sixty  different blocks or fields are involved  now i would like to know from the honourable minister the reason for the delay in response in respect of the large number of blocks that we had offered ? and for this the minister has not told anything  and secondly i would like to know he has said that the first five fields are going under a production sharing uh contract  but about the other eight more small fields he has not mentioned the type of contract  so i would like to know whether that is also in the nature of production sharing agreement or not merely a service contract  so first is the un the fields that we have offered to which we have received no response and the reason therefore  and then these fields that have been now put under contract are going to come on a stream  sir the honourable member referred to the fifth fifth round and the sixth round that was the continuous continuous round of bidding for explanation  the subject matter which is being discussed right now does not relate to explanation is mainly focused on discovered oil fields  as far as the other the second part of the question which refers to the small fields and the type of contract we have got into  for the small fields unlike the discovered oil fields where i said that the discovered oil oil fields five fields the investment is over a billion dollars  here the small fields are so small that they are actually not economically viable for a company like o n g c and one word to handle that's why they were bound out and we have gujarat uh uh  government company public sector company and some other companies which have got to gather on their own  in these small fields unlike the medium size fields  here there is no joint sharing these are very small uh the risk will be taken uh by those companies who will be producing the small amounts of gas and uh uh crude wherever it is in the small small one word  see it's not a joint venture unlike the medium  size fields which are mention which are joint ventures where o n g c and the other companies are partners 
question number one forty-three shri chitto basu  ( a) whether exports are expected to register a twenty percent growth rate during the current year ? ( b) whether exports growth rate has declined below the targeted growth rate during the current financial year ? ( c) if so the details of monthly growth legal rates of export during the current year in comparison to the corresponding period for the last year  ( d) the reasons for poor growth rate of exports and ( e)  the steps taken to remedy the situation  sir question one four three the statement is laid on the table of the house  sir uh from the statement it appears uh that there has been wide fluctuations in the percentage growth rate of exports  uh during the months april ninety-four to august ninety uh august ninety-four  sir it was uh sometimes it declined to six percent in august uh not in july it declined to six percent and the next month it shoot up or it rose to twenty-four point six percent  sir it to me this phenomenon seems to be unusual  and that also indicates that there has been some fundamentally wrong and defective method in in this uh in the effort of the governemnt to step up the exports  may i know from the honourable minister what are those fundamentally wrong and defective uh uh defects in the system ? uh if those systems have been id uh this if those wrong fundamentally wrong defects have been identified and if identified growth in the export in the month of april  april it was twelve percent uhn  may june july these three months it was single digit  and thereafter it has started picking up august september and october it has been more than twenty-four twenty-five twenty-seven percent one or two words if you compare with the figure of ninety-two ninety-three and this ninety-three recording broken   uhn   one or two words  two twenty-nine percent plans  therefore sometimes it happens  one of the reason why it happen during this time mainly because the engineering exports where one incentive scheme was available to them we replaced it because the gatt subsidy which they wish to have to meet the differences between the international price and domestic price that was withdrawn from first of april  so it had some impact and the contribution of engineering  goods to the overall market is about twelve percent  because of local levy our rice became less competitive so the agricultural product particularly rice that also uh rice export came down  because of shortage of cotton we had to reduce the exports of cotton  therefore there has been some reasons one word analysis we are making  but corn case also it happened like that  therefore i do hope that at the end of the year  there could be two one word if i take the average of the first seven months the exports goods may not be fourteen fifteen percent  but in this range from the august onwards it continues and one good point that impact of plague which was thought that it would have some adverse impact but from the figure of september october it indicates that it is not so  so if this trend continues then we may end with eighteen nineteen percent growth but there is nothing basically fundamentally wrong in the system sir may i know from the honourable minister whether  one or two words whether it is a fact that the government of late has decided to slash down the export target for the year  may i also further know from the honourable minister uh if not  what is the target for the current year and uh whether it is also a fact that uh the uh the tariff was on other forms of resistances are being increased in our tradition of export market  particularly in the united states of america  if that is so how does the government propose to remedy that and attain the target for the current year ? sir so far the target is concerned it is for the period of the full five years that is to co-terminate with the one word  from ninety-two ninety-seven the target was fixed in terms of percentage that thirteen point six percent should be the enhancement of export in volume terms in us dollar terms it should be around fifteen to twenty percent  and in absolute terms at the end of the terminal year our exports should be thirty-three point five billion us dollar at the price level of ninety-one ninety-two  in order to achieve that target first year we could not reach  ninety-two ninety-three our performance was little more than eighteen billion us dollars  ninety-three ninety-four it is about twenty-two billion us dollars  therefore informally i suggested that if we could reach a target of twenty-five twenty-six billion us dollars in the year ninety-four ninety-five perhaps with fifteen twenty percent step up we may reach the target at the terminal year of the 8th plan thirty-three point five billion  that is the target we have in regard to the question of having some uh restrictions of export of some of the indian products to us market one item is  one word  they have raised some issues which we are contesting but in the first five months the overall trade of our exports to usa is encouraging there has been of the total share of us market in our total exports upto april to october is about twenty-two percent  question number one forty-four  ( a) the number of proposals received and cleared during nineteen ninety-three ninety-four for direct foreign investment in india ( b) the terms and conditions for the foreign investment  ( c) whether foreign investment proposals have the potential of export earnings and ( d) if so the anticipated export earnings from foreign investment during the current five year plan  ( a) and ( b) during the calender year nineteen ninety-three and the first ten months of nineteen ninety-four upto october one thousand six hundred and fifty proposals for foreign direct investment have been received and cleared and receiving foreign direct investment of  rupees nineteen thousand six hundred and four point  three six crores  proposals are cleared in terms of the new industrial policy nineteen ninety-one  ( c) and ( d) sir yes sir however the date on amount of export earnings anticipated from these projects is not centrally maintained  mr speaker sir i have specica  specifically asked for the terms and conditions  the minister has given a short reply that there are for the industrial policy of nineteen ninety-one  speaker sir it is good sign that about twenty thousand crores of foreign investment is coming in one year  but at the si same time it appears that there are bad side effects also because this industry this investment there is a tendency to cluster around  the metropolitan cities  and because of that if we take the example of bombay itself the prices of local flats have increased from eight hundred per square feet to five thousand rupees per square feet because of foreign investors and foreign people coming it is for their executives  on the one hand and on the other hand because of lot   of lot of labour employment there will be growth of uh   zhuggis   what is your question mr ? sir i would like to know from the honourable minister  whether this foreign investors are being encouraged are being asked to  set up their industries in the newly uh decided growth centres of countries which are in remote areas  so what is the incentive being given to them and what  is are the guidelines for that ? mr speaker sir in one word industrial policy  statement of july nineteen ninety-one government had explicitly stated  that environmental protection measures will be taken to ensure that there is no concentration of industries in the metropolitan cities and that act is kept in view while sanctioning approval  so i cannot agree with this opposition that bombay is uh suffering because too much of invest foreign direct investment is coming it is certainly true that bombay's attractiveness as a financial centre has increased that certainly has put pressure on land prices  i think there is a way to deal with that we have existing uh restrictions uh on land transactions which in my view i think are having bad adverse effects well the answer to that is not that we should uh prevent the growth of bombay as one of the worlds' leading financial centre  mr speaker sir i had also asked about the quantum of  export earnings that may be obtained after the full investement  but it has been answered that such data is not being maintained  my specific query was because there is a general apprehension  that the foreign investors are coming to invest in india  looking mainly towards the local domestic market and that's  why after the domestic market is flooded with uh the industrial goods of the for foreign  investors the local industries will also suffer  that is the apprehension and that's why what measures are being taken i would like to know for uh keeping this foreign investors in line with others and for asking them to export certain  quota of goods produced in their industry sir eighty percents of the approvals of foreign direct investment since the introduction of the new policy uptil october nineteen ninety-four have been in the priority sector which are  mentioned in the annexe three of the industrial policy statement of july  ninety-one  these apparel oil refineries electronics chemical and food processing telecommunication transportation industrial  machinery so the assumption that large segment of this investment is going to consumer goods or nonessential goods is simply not correct even where in certain cases we ha  have allowed uh foreign investement in consumer goods  we have ensured that there will be an obligation on the part of those investors to ensure that their export earnings will match  the dividends outflow for the period of one word  also i would uh further like to mention it is not possible to uh mention or to calculate at this stage what will be  the foreign ex foreign exchange earnings  i preside over the empowered committee  my own feeling is that is very large part of proposals are directly export oriented and in years to come you will see the beneficial effects of this on the countries exports even in terms of employment uh here of course i am mentioning all the industrial enterpreneurs memoranda  this includes the foreign investors and domestic investors  filed with the secretariat of industrial approvals uptil august nineteen  uh uptil sep october nineteen ninety-four  they show that the total planned investment is three  lakhs twenty-five thousand five hundred eighty crores   and when these projects are completed there would be a minimum addition of over three million jobs to the manufacturing sector so the assumption that these investments are going to take away jobs is not correct in fact they are going to add to the amount of employment in  indias' manufacturing sector  sir i am grateful to you because you have allowed me sir this is a very important question and according to government new industrial policy one thousand six hundred and fifty uh proposal have been received and cleared directly from the central government  sir may i know from the honourable minister minister has admitted that there are some regional imbalances  sir specially for the eastern region sir the bihar orissa west bengal and other parts of the country where the foreign investment flow is very poor  will the minister see the matter seriously so that the n r i can ivest more and more money this is uh this is replied to sir just two minutes back  sir  sir sir bihar orrissa and west bengal whether the minister will take up the matter with the state government and the foreign investors so that they can invest more and more money and specially i will ask for the agro-based industry sir  yes will you persuade the state government one word   sir i interact with the honourable chief ministers of many states  i find today uh there is much greater awareness among the state governments to create the requisite climate in which investments will flow and i believe for examples uh take the case of the west bengal  itself west bengal has put out an industrial policy statement which i think is a forward looking documents today i think west bengal is aggressively seeking foreign investment honourable somnath chatterjee is not here he had been to australia he had been to singapore and when he was asked the questions about the new industrial policy he had stated this is a a few words noise  mr finance minister mr finance minister your your praise of his should not create problem for this house noise  a few words  yes mr chavan   aap sunlein to pata chal jata hai  mr speaker sir  is ka jawab mil gaya  the foreign investors commercial board has cleared sixteen fifty proposals with twenty thousands co-investments  but sir i complaint that very few projects have started functioning and there are no ground taking ceremonies  the foreign investors are complaining that there is still too much of red tape  i would like to ask the minister if there is a machinery within the government to monitor the progress of these units  sir the honourable member is right there have been gap in monitoring but in the last few months we have ensured that the secretariat of industrial approval in the ministry of industry will monitor these proposals  with regards to the actual in flow as against the approval  which my colleague had mentioned in the last three and a half years the actual disbursement has exceeded five thousand crores so it is not entirely correct that these proposals are being implemented  total amount of disbursement as of now as a proportion of approval are about twenty-three percent which is not bad considering that this policy has been in operations only for nearly three years question hour is over 
 dr vasant pawar  emerging optimism and this optimism is basically because of the policies of the government  a response by the people of our country  the indian community has a great sense of patriotism and tolerance  and we have to struggle hard  our late prime minister our leader smt  indiraji gandhi has said i quote strength never comes from the comfort of smooth path but from the most sterness of the efforts  unquote  honourable president in his address there are sixth state situation in jammu and kashmir i think that is quite sufficient a warning to the pakistan and the  united states of america not to fear interfere in the matters of jammu and kashmir  and not to teach us the human rights  it is that i must say that a minor national minorities finance development corporation has been set up and five hundred  crores are kept for the development of minorities  and a new wakf bill nineteen ninety-three will definitely help in deciding the matters of wakf  with this the development of the poor by way of   jawahar rozgar yojna for i r d p employment assurance scheme mahila samrudhi yojna  safai karmacharya they are the main milestones in the development of our poor and down-trodden people  let us be proud of all the men and women who are doing their best in building our nation  we are approaching twenty-first century and twenty-first century will be of the honesty the integrity the accountability the productivity and the quality also  and we intend to pursue all our efforts to produce more oil  more electricity more fertilisers more foodgrains and more of the basic needs of our people  our government and our political system are strong enough  technologically and otherwise not to allow our self- reliance to be mortgaged outside by an outside funds  so friends we must come together we should march ahead for the self-reliance  we should call little operation forward faster and forward  shri pawan kumar bansal  sir in an ambience of widely present chaos and lack of self-confidence that permeated the national thought when the present government took over the responsibility  it was a doubting task particularly as a minority government  to rebuild brick by brick in situations that least settled rejuvenate the economy that was in a shamble and regain  practice in the comedy of nations that was its lowest at its lowest ebb then  in june nineteen ninety-one there was a frightening question mark mocking at us about the future of india  a resolute endeavour was steadly transforming that into a ray of hope when suddenly a cataclysmic event on sixth of december nineteen ninety-two threw the nation in the throes of  communal two words  with the fall of the mosque dangers of equating democracy  with the tyranny of group ascerting or claiming to act on behalf of the majority religious communities became real  this cast a telling impacts not only on india's  honour but also our economy  clouds of uncertainity started hovering for the economic reforms initiated one word by the present government  the foreign investors grew doubtful about the disability  of investing in a country which was in the whirlpool of  communal unrest  it was with this uncertain and unpleasant prospect  that we entered the year under review  the deliberate and concerted effect from forces from within and across the borders to destabilise the country only strengthen the resolve of the prime minister to fight that with greater vigour the people also extended support in ample measure  sir today with congress attaining majority in this house these reckless moves which we have witnessed over the last two and a half years and which gave a friend on the other side some false hopes have been given a fitting burial  and the subsequent event has started getting results  the prime minister's recent visit to germany and about the switzerland was a resounding success  with the brightening up of the investment climate in our country offers for economic tie-up are pouring in faster than never before  the government on its part has made it a two words   but the changes under way do not and will not tinkle with the basic postulates of a mixed economy and that none in the country  would be adversely affected thereby noise  fears and strength on behalf of the workers a few words two words seem to be only stimulated for critical purposes  all ventures are rather intended to create greater  opportunities for the people to improve their living conditions  sir a natural outcome of the sober and mature leadership provided to the country by shri p v narasimha rao has dealt that our stock has risen in the international community  a position that kashmir is an integral part of india is once again appreciated by a very large number of countries and  pakistans' efforts to rake up the matter in the international meet  have been tactfully one word and defeaed  so the president has unequivocally expressed the feeling of the issue as also a determination to safeguard the integrity of the nation and our preparedness to meet two words  when we take over we at the same time do wish to express a feeling of most cordial relations with the people of pakistan with whom we have much in common  we hold our ground firmly on issues like kashmir non- proliferation treaty as a need to face the united nation security council  terrorism and tenets of the factionalism has been met remarkably in punjab and the government is determined to fight it  resolutely in any part of the country  donning the robes of a prosecutor shri jaswant singhji  charged the government and he was uncredible using the word charge again and again sir  he charged the government for not raising hazrat bal shrine so that the tact and patience with which the government dealt with the issue has been applauded all over the world  and who can deny the perceptible improvement in the situation thereafter  sir but it causes agony to our friend there because it has deprived them of an opportunity to bake the political cake  on the fire of communal frenzy  sir we have today charted a boat which would intends to take india to the forefront of international community  and our confidence our faith in doing so eminent from our  one word to change with continuity  we are proud of our past and have duplicit faith in the future we believe in honouring difference of opinion  we believe that national issues should be addressed to  in a spirit of understanding and co-operation  sir if it is narrow political considerations which dominate our thinking on every score i am afraid certain goals which we wish to achieve may not become unachievable but our struggle in achieving those would become a little adverse one and if it becomes adverse the government headed by shri narasimha raoji  would remain undeterred  he would remain unflinching in his determination to achieve those goals   a few words  indrajit gupta  we were discussing the budget just now  with the great uh uh incentives which have been provided by the finance minister for the uh unrestricted growth of of the private sector both domestic private sector as well as foreign investors i am afraid this growth of black money will be further accelerated leading to more and more corruption  this is a sort of encouragement to what we should call financial criminality  corruption is too mild term  in some countries it is referred to it as financial criminality  that is what is being fostered now in our country  the president's address madam has consciously  consciously or unconsciously i don't know whoever prepared the address  obviously did it consciously has blacked out all reference to this  spreading cancer and has given no indication of the type of people who are indulging or who are in the position to indulge in this kind of financial criminality  so on the twenty-nineth of january a front page news item  has appeared in one of our leading dailies namely the statesman  giving a list of forty-two people belonging to different parties who are alleged to have been funded  i the same people the same group of people who had uh  been used by the isi to fund the  hizbul mujahideen and the accused in the bombay bomblasts i don't know what is the political connection i can't uh  easily find it out  but anyway this is a case there in the supreme court now pending  their names are given in this news item along with the amounts of money which they are alleged to have received  among that uh major number of people come from the  congress party than uh from also from the  bjp also from the janata dal   also from the janata dal samajwadi fewer fewer  the bulk of the names are from the congress party  sir these are all honourable gentlemen  most of them are members of parliament some have been ministers some are presently minister and uh i think that a paper which  publishes this kind of serious type of allegation should either be proceeded against by way of defamation proceedings in the court which has not been done  or atleast the people who are named among these forty-two  should have come out publicly with some denial or some contradiction  which has not been done  i neither know whether this allegations are correct or can be correct or not  but what is surprising me is you see a news report like this  had created quite a lot of uh sensation and pendomonium among the public who read these papers  but no contradictions denials or defamation case or anything is coming  so this is very curious it seems to me  and i want to draw the attention to this house that the honourable members concerned should really be more serious about this and take uh whatever necessary action they feel they should take  but nothing has been done  so my point is interruption that these these cases will go on multiplying  not because of any individuals proclamities because of what i said there is a economic and social forces are operating  black money is at the root of it and black money is leading to proliferation of this type of corruption  and the more that spreads people are thinking that well so many people two words whether mps or ministers or anybody else  must have got also got something to do with this corruption is that good for the future of our country ? so i am saying that this is a matter which everybody should take seriously  the president's address doesn't say anything about these things it doesn't say anything it doesn't even mention a big event which took place in  last year in ninety-three a very big event which was the scam  the banking scam  is it just a small trivial matter ? is there no mention about it ? you could say that such a thing happened we set-up a joint parliamentary committee the joint parliamentry committee two words  do it they have uh submitted their report and the uh prime minister has assured parliament that a follow up action will be taken against people who are guilty and all that  there is no mention of the fact that eight thousand  crores or may be more twelve thousand crores  some people say  the bofors is chicken feed compare to this  bofors was only some sixty sixty-five crores  eight thousand to twelve thousand crores  which was public's money deposited in the banks  why do public put money in the banks ? because they believe that it is in safe custody when it is in the banks  in small people also pensioners small people put money in the banks  but if thousands of crores of rupees  you see is goes away from the back door the  banks' one word virtue of a nexus between brokers  bankers the businessmen and so many types of people who are in nexus with each other that money is funnelled out siphoned out from the bank  in order to go and put money in the hands of these speculators on the stock market stock exchange  is it a small matter ? such a thing never happened in our country before and it   is has affected mainly the public sector banking system  the nationalised banks about which indira gandhi has spoken at the time of nationalisation that these are going to be the real commanding heights of the economy  now what what is happening ? so there is no mention in the president's  address so how can i thank him for this address i don't know which completely avoids any mention of these things  and what fate will other committees have ? if the j p c is report is dealt with like this  when the debate took place here in this house some people were doing their best to denigrate such a report to dilute it and to say which is not of much consequence  so what will be the fate of other committees ? what will be the fate of these uh uh standing committees which are now operating which are also formed on an all-party basis  what will happen to their reports and their recommends  recommendations  no body will bother about  see it's part of our system isn't it ?  it's part of our parliamentary system  it all depends how you look at it how much you respect those  institutions and how far you are prepared to carry out what they say or not  we are in a parliamentary form of government if you want to have some other form of government of course it is different matter  but so long as this country has been commited to the parliamentary democracy form of government multi-party system based on adult franchise  so long you cannot escape what is called parliamentary accountability   thats' the big biggest and only surviving super power in the world today is deliberately trying to fish in troubled waters in kashmir and their spokesman have been coming out with so many statements which are patently anti-indian anti-indian sovereignity  i believe mr chavan has said something quite was  right about this yesterday if i'm correct then i congratulate him for that  and uh it would have been better if the president's  address had also you see included something about this  because i want to point out one thing it is not correct that will be wrong to think that what they what the americans are raking up is only a question of human rights violation of human rights   that's only one aspect of it  they are talking about a civil war they say civil war is going on in kashmir  in his addressed address to the general assembly of the united nations the president clinton has said it that conditions of civil war are developing in kashmir  civil war is a term which has a specific meaning 
 ( a) whether it is a fact that twenty-four odd doctors who had been on plague control duty at the indira gandhi international airport since october first nineteen ninety-four were on duty till twenty-ninth november nineteen ninety-four more than a month after the  world health organization declared that plague was no more a threat in the country and ( b)   if so the details and reason for retaining the team at the airport for such a long period  sir question number two zero two ( a) and ( b) i have check at the airport they were continue even after plague was fully contained to alliviate the apprehension of the other countries as per as the recommendation of world health organisation  uh next  it is good thing that the government has extended the stay of doctors at the international airport on the advice of the   world health organization  but the main point is why this dreadful disease or epidemic  has suddenly appeared in our country  whether the government have necessary impact of the origin and impact of the plague why it came suddenly ? and what steps government has taken in order to assess the  epidemic and uh the loss of life and property and also  what steps have been taken on the uh recommendations for uh  memorandum submitted by the municipal union of uh surat which said  in the wake of floods in tapti river and the wake of large amount of garbage piling up there they advised the municipal authorities and the government to appoint number of uh extra staff to clear the garbage  but the government did not take what steps the government had taken to review the causes for this disease and its eradication ? thank you honourable minister  sir as soon as we got the report of the plague occurance in the beed district of maharashtra and subsequently in surat sir the government of india has taken all possible help sending expert and medicine and all support to the uh respective state government to control plague sir  sir about the occurrence of plague in our country sir we have  appointed a committee under a renowned sci medical scientist dr ramaswamy lingam sir uh ra interruption ramalingam swamy and they they are requested to give their have a detailed study and give report report within six months sir about about the uh memorandum submitted by surat i i don't have any information about that sir at at present  second supplementary please  the main cause for the occurrence of plague and we recently we had recurrence of malaria also in some parts of the country  so the health of the country is going down like this and the government has not taken any steps but the main point i would like to ask the minister is  this piling up of garbage in municipality though it was cleared up in the first days after the occurrence of plague  but subsequently it was stopped  it is due to lack of financial resources with municipalities  and government has taken up evolved a plan to provide finances to clean up this garbage so that such diseases do not occur in future any plan of action is being contemplated by the government  sir the garbage problem all over the country specially the municipal corporation are all over the country sir and this municipal corporation administration come under the state governemnt sir we are in contact with the state government to take appropriate action to clean up clean up their keep clean their city sir and and that part we have informed the state government sir not only the plague there are ot  other it is a very unhealthy scene to have one word in any city or in any municipal uh uh area sir and and it is directly under the state government but we have uh uh told the state government to take appropriate action so that there should not be any one word but  it is upto the state government sir  mr das shri guru das gupta  sir the cause for plague is piling up garbage one of the causes  and there is piling of garbage everywhere  now the honourable minister says that it has advised the municipal corporations to clean the garbage  but the point is import important   point is they are all all the diseases are reappearing  plague malaria cholera they all reappeared  but right to health is a normal human right  without passing on the path i could i let me ask me  the honourable minister whether the government health ministry of union government shall make available additional funds for the use  of the municipalities to take emergency measures for cleaning of the garbage  of course political garbage cannot be cleaned  that is different but the other garbage is to be cleaned  and for this the honourable minister let him say whether he is in a position to make allocation for additional funds so that plague and malaria can be eradicated nowhere in the world it is coming up  but in india again we are getting what about the funds ? will you make available funds to the municipality  will you make available will you make available additional funds for this particular purpose to the municipalities and the state governments without just issuing a circular  uh mr chairman sir i can appreciate the honourable  member's concern for health to the people of this country  as the house is aware that the health is a state subject  the states have to provide necessary funds for the maintenance of the public health facilities in eradication of the diseases which affect the common man  now the question question two words put the question about providing funds to the municipalities on emergent basis  to help them to remove this garbage which is lying there  almost in all the municipalities of the country  sir as i said earlier we have been in constant touch with the state governments  we have requested the state chief secretary then the health ministers to take necessary steps in this regard  basically the municipalities or the local health authorities local self governments  they are the local authorities  they have their own powers they have their own funds  and it is necessary they have to make necessary provisions that but by saying that we will not avoid our responsibility to come into the aid of the maintenance of the health of people  the honourable member had said that its nowhere in the world but information in the house i can quote where plague is taking the toll of the people in the other country interruption   i don't think i don't think i will be able to pacify the honourable member but i am have given the information for the  benefit of the house  sir uh in other countries in africa madagascar  uganda zaire in south africa peru in united states of america in the united states of america i don't a few words  in united states of america interruption in asia turkistan mongolia myanmar and some other countries in the world have deliberately not shown that it has though there is plague  so it's not that only in india plague is there  interruption  please minister is answering completing his answer  sir there would not be any  please  there would not be any more permanent conclusion then the honourable member is a few words  sir interruption  please please please tell the answer the point so that i can go to another question sir but one thing which he has spoken about me personally  yeah i would like to inform the member not to the house in  a few words  yeah  that i won successively seven times parliament lok sabha elections noise on public one word  let him not teach me the lessons of integrity  a few words and it has caused much to all our concerns in a country  but what a havoc more is sir the publicity alone in publicity in one word improfessional magnitude  so that it caused havoc in the economy of the country  most of the foreigners refused to come to this country  because of that our tourism income has also come down  yes in so many ways the ma the process has caused  much the pre-media has caused much havoc to the economy of the country  under these conditions we should make the foreigners know that the actual epidemic is not in the magnitude which is published for that what has the government to do to contained the press to go publishing like uh this alarming magnitude and also in future also such thing should not happen for that what interruption you see the question is what steps the government has taken to contain the press and also in future to guard interruption  yeah thank you thank you sir  unfortunately the media overplayed the plague situation in the country  even when the world health authorities came here to certify that the quick actions and very effective actions have been taken by the government to control and contained this disease the media didn't support unfortunately   it's not that we have not done the job we have done the job one word world over we are being praised for effective control of this plague in very quick way mr swaminathan  recently i had occasion to meet the two words the world renowned  they had a conference in the india at about during the time of plague  and in that conference they have concluded it was not plague at all  the disease was not plague at all it was a disease just stimulating plague and originally because these people have found out and report to the press it was plague they have been consistently saying it is the plague he had also also given me a paper  for want of time i couldn't go through it completely  well the minister is aware that there is another idea that the disease is not a plague but a disease which has stimulated plague and because originally it was said by some authorities it was plague they have been consistently saying that is plague  sir uh it is confirmed by the n i c the national  uh our communicative diseases sir uh one word they said it is plague and it is clarified by the or supported by our scientist  medical scientist also have supported i k gujral  the honourable minister is right just a second just a second i am two words just after this in addition to what my colleague said sir yeah  the honourable member wants to know about the terms of reference of this committee i think a few words interruption yes yes yes   a few words financial matters will he look because not because primarily that is the agency to do something that is why i want that there is nothing like that in the sense of the interruption you can help sir uh i can repeat two words the house  that the terms of reference records is to elucidate factors responsible for the current outbreak of plague plague and infact perhaps it includes what it say interruption  i say will they will the committee whether whether whether it is for want of financial fund that also the committee can look into it alright then your you make it so clear and you write to the committee that you can go into it  i will be happy shree guj i k gujral sir uh the honourable minister has tried to  underplay the situation   it's not a question of propaganda  it's not a question whether it is so many cases more or less issue basically is and i hope my honourable friend knows that not once not twice not three times in last forty or fifty years  there are any number of reports available and you do not need one more expert to make it to tell you that that is no municipal committee in the country except the n d m c which is financially viable okay  now the point is sir if our you are going by the plan and if the planning is to be made obviously government i assume i hope is a is a corporate body works together   and therefore may i ask him , has he thought and approached , , the the planning commission or something , that the structure the municipality has to be increased no.(1) no.(2) sir, has the honourable one word thought in terms of improving the sanitation methodology and technology because it doesn't need a who report to tell us that our seat is updating it doesn't need any health organization that we see filth around they will first collect garbage on the road side and then we remove it and therefore all along disease is one word this incident of plague whatever dimension i am not discussing has brought up and despare at home may i ask him if he is believed to undertake apart from the committee one word to avoid the situation has the cabinet i wrote to cabinet myself the prime one word  wrote back to me that the one word and the ministry of urban development have the ministry of urban development and ministry of health set together to evolve the comprehensive scheme to see that our health and sanitation improves? swaminathan sir the honourable member is right one word what he said about the maintenance of sanitic conditions in the limits of municipality it doesd need atleast throught and a coordinative approach to solve this problem not only the health ministry this is by the ministry of urban development, local ministry, the state ministry and the local authorities concerned as far as the one word necessarily we have to find a way and in that direction we have to consult the the planning commission and for that one word suggestion one word 
sir at the outset i wish to bring to the attention of this house the dignity of the two institutions the institution  of rashtrapati and the institution the governor of the state sir rashtrapati's address is an address of the policy of the government that it will follow and also the achievements of the government  sir political and economic stability are the two sides of the same coin  we cannot for one without the other  sir this government which came to power two and a half years back was facing a political turmoil in the country  what is this government even though a single party with the largest members in this house was a minority government  and we know the difficulties of running a minority government which has to take a number of bold economic decision  but within two and half years we have proved that this government taken taking bold political decisions and economic decisions could attain majority  sir this is two and half years there is a political  polarisation taking place in this country  it is this political polarisation  it is this political polarisation where anti communal  forces and democratic forces coming together under the leadership of the congress party that has given  a new political stability to the nation  sir this government has taken decisions on all subjects  whether the government was in a majority or whether the government was in a minority  and for the mandal issue we could find a solution in a very democratic manner and all the backward communities in this country are happy because they have got their due share in the governmental machinery  for about this congress party has taken a stand from the time of pandit either this issue has to be settled amicably by discussion between both the parties or the course of law has to take its verdict and that verdict has to be deeply seen  sir coming to the economic front we have taken very bold decisions  and you know when it came when it came to power two and half years back what was the economic situation  the inflation was at its highest up about seventeen percent   the if the foreign exchange reserves was kept  four thousand crores in two and half years back  now it has grown eight times more  it is all around twenty-two thousand crores  so situation the over all situation is very comfortable this comfortable situation could be achieved because of the drastic measures congress has taken  sir in the seventy-nine prelinary session of the inter-national conference at tirupati narsimharao has explained in detail about the one word  an important one or two words speech  since the beginning of the era of plan development the indian national congress has been inspired and guided by the vision of jawaharlal nehru  he has strong sense of wisdom and deep understanding of the  distinctive of the indian resource let him to one or two words  all topman approaches and evolved india all synthesis  for the diverse influence which was inherently just humane  pragmatic and uniquely indian the use of developed development planning was an instrument to achieve this stand and ensure the material well being of the masses and the dignity of the indian  so sir we have never deviated from two words  and sir when our farmers are taking up this current  we obliged in this house on one hand we have been  one word what the political parties have been demanding that the farmers should be given a regularising price  there is no party in this house which has not demanded that  every party is demanding that the one or two words  and when we give regularising price naturally it has to be  passed on to the consumers  in four one or two words exports enable to march ninety-two ninety-three the growth of three point six percent april to december ninety-two it was only three point five percent  april to december ninety-three it has gone to nineteen point  nine percent  now sir coming to the employment we have taken a number of steps during last two and a half years  the jawahar rozgar yojana  the nehru rozgar yojana  then other programmes other employment oriented programmes  yet there is the unemployment in the country  sir the achievement of scientists the achievement of in the in our research field sir the the the the launching of the  agni is something which is tough and fearless   it's an achievement of a group of a community of scientists who have been denied a number of facilities foreign facilities foreign technology  but within themselves they could they could find out ways and means solutions so that today we are proud that agni  has been launched  just like the agni has been launched in the space  and i'm sure sir sir this government will be able to give a new thrust to our one word a new thrust to our economic structure a new thrust to our industrial strength so that there is economic prosperity in this country then the peaceful the political situation in this country only request is that all democratic forces should help us  should support us this is my request  i listened with care sir to the speech of my honourable friend d s p mathur as also the second of professor thomas  i also read sir with great care the text of the speech  which is really a not so much speech of the head of the republic as it is in articulation of the governments view point  also what they have done in the year gone by and what they intent doing in the year that is facing us now  so i could not help but carry an impression that the  that the that its a its a tired and a desperated emotions  a tired and desperated address  it was it was uninspiring in content and i was struck by the fact of the recourse that government could take of loading this speech with the a great deal of anti-statistical assertions  i found the address somewhat self-satisfied and  one word  the great deficiency that i find is the disharmony between the assertions of government and uh what i have observed as a crippling citizen that has one word many parts of national endeavour  and national life  there is an impression being different and impression that is attempted  an impression that was attempted to be created in the speech itself  has been one word all to do as if some kind of an imaginary  hump has been crossed  let me put it to the treasury bench if now through an immorality through a performing of the participatory system of government is through one word of defaction  if through creating splits within one party after another you have rearranged the arithmatic  if you had simply rearranged the arithmatic let me division not  in variety of thoughts that you have crossed some kind of an imaginary hump and now rosy pastures upon the green pasture lie ahead of you  these are the first assertions that made by the head of the republic and by the government is about the north-east  these are his first assertions sir to create the situations with regard to insurgency in the north-east has shown improvement i do not know sir to what i should attribute such an assertion  that insurgency in the north-east is improving when the governor of manipur and nagaland has himself without going into all the quotation from his report to the president it might be again be repeated the governor of manipur and nagaland has said but clearly amongst other things that the above state of intense insurgency  and internal disorder and you would observe mr speaker sir that he is not talking in the past tense  he is talking of position as it exist in that part of the country in the month of august to october of ninety-three  the above state of intense insurgency and internal disorder is due to lack of political stability and will lack of an overall perception and monitoring of the worsening situation by the governmental security forces over after long period  you must have heard in the one word of government  cannot be made by agency of government itself  and if you want to argue sir that this civil citizen his observation is limited to manipur and nagaland then at all i am not convinced that the words that have been put into the mouth of the  head of the republic by the government  i do not know to what i should attribute them  is it a step by the government to mislead the nation ? is it an attempt by the government to draw one word over the reality in the wake of the situation that prevails in the north-east  ? or is it is it an attempt to to denigrate the institution of parliament and to treat the entire exercise of the  address to the joint session of the parliament as a perfunctory exercise of little importance fairly to a one word sir that the situation that we face in the north-east is of extreme one word  and the most extreme serious  i one word in totality the assertion of the government  that the situation in entire north-east is improving  it has not improved  and the sense of complacency about improving that the government seems to be putting across is a very mislead sense and it will be extremely challenging to the republic  thanks oh thanks to very briefly mention just two or three aspects of the current situation of jammu and kashmir  there is an assertion made in the president's address  and an assertion which suggests that it was the strength displayed by the government in the unfortunate in incident at hazratbal which restrained the demonstrative itself through success we have not yet sir not yet not till today the parliament has not authoritatively been told as to what actually happened in hazratbal  the government has not yet come forward to tell  i repeat that demand we must come to know what actually transpired in hazaratbal during that period  how did the situation come about that the army was obliged to take seige to that uh shrine ? and what transpired when the siege was subsequently attempted ? what was the arrangement that the government made with the seventy or eighty those who were in those that were inside the shrine  ? and how is it that when those that were inside the shrine  when they surrendered whom did they surrender to ? what was the role of the army ? and how thereafter sir that out of those seventy or eighty that surrender we do not yet authoritatively know what the correct figure is there is not a single one now sir is in prison  not a single one is today charged as a serious terrorist  meriting those serious try  we were told that there are three or four or five  i don't know how many foreign terrorists of foreign nationality where are they now ? and these are not small issues that the nation can just take lightly  i put it to you sir that in hazratbal it was india's  great good fortune which saved us  that this government made every possible mistake in the handling of the situation that it could have made and that is in hazratbal the siege finally got lifted and with those that were inside  surrendered  they did not surrender sir because of the so called  patience shown by the government they surrender because of certain chances which are entirely of  recording broken  it was incapacity incapacity to think incapacity to act  miserable failure uh serious challenge to the nation as such  i demand sir that unless the prospects of hazratbal  incident are shared with this house we will continue to hold i certainly will continue to hold that in hazratbal this government in charge is making every possible mistake that it could have every possible wrong that it could have for the nation  and if the nation still survives it was not on account of anything that the government did  it was despite what the government did  it is not a question sir of this disarray simply at the level of hazratbal  it is a disarray that start from the top here  that is disarray in decision making in the union home ministry itself  it is opened up we do not know dealing with kashmir  the honourable the home minister for home makes one statement with certain assertion is definitely the honourable minister for state makes an other assertion  his excellency the governor of kashmir makes a third assertion the army is left out on its one word they make certain suggestions  the security forces are left on the limp they make another suggestion  that disarray this total lack of coordinate arises not simply in the metalistic sense  it arises principally sir from the conceptual or a  what is it that we are one or two words what is it this government is trying to do in kashmir ? where are we heading do you know sir ? and i'll be happy if i'm proven wrong  and i will i would demand of the government to share with us the figures and to explain to us that if these are government one word then how was such incident take place  i demand of government to share with the house the reality of what is taking place today in the district of toda in one word  in one word i demand of the government share with us  what is taking place today by the raising of the head of insurgency  in the district of jammu in udhampur  i demand sir that this the government owes not just to the parliament this the government owes to the nation  unless the government share all this with us in this house  the government stand charged of neglect a very great neglect of a very great national priority  and finally what about those three hundred thousand  kahsmiri pundit who in their own homeland so many years after the raising of insurgency in their own homeland are homeless no one can disappoint for them  this government does not have time to even visit the camp the pathetic plight of this three hundred thousand pundit  for the last three to four years  i charge this government for the most inhuman neglect of its own citizen  this is the most telling example of the blindness of this government in the face of human misery  sir we have this yesterday celebration of presentation of the budget  i accept that this uh his address to the uh joint session of the parliament is not a debate on the budget  i am not going to even attempt that  but because the speech of the president makes a reference  to economic reform programme and suggests to the joint-session that the economic reform programme of this government is really their answer  to all the ill one or two words reflects the country therefore very briefly i consider it my uh obligation to put to you my perception of where the government has brought the country  just look at four or five simple assertions that i will take which are not assertions that i make uh one or two words they call it a very one or two words  these are the assertions that the honourable union finance minister has himself did 
sir may i know from the honourable minister the government exchange rate and the market exchange rate in the market itself in delhi itself whatever the intelligence report you may be receiving  but actually sir the market exchange the market is seeing all  the hawala market is going on  but if black money which is being created in this country is being siphoned out and uh the hawala market they are having their own fare  so therfore may i know from the honourable minister last after the convertability how many cases you have really identified or seen how many uh uhm cases have been registered and how much foreign currency you have recovered from this dealer ? sir the government has undertaken various schemes like legally legal import of gold legal import of silver and some security convertability  and with this we have to take this decision the  hawala fares was really flourishing and the period from march nineteen ninety-one to march nineteen ninety-two it was raised between twenty-five to thirty percent sir  but also the government has taken so many measures  the premium during this period raised between twelve to fifteen percent after the introduction of several economic measures sir and the number of cases and also these once they marketed and  hawala rate existed difference  uh in ninety-one ninety-two ninety-one to ninety-two and ninety-two uh earlier ninety-two to march ninety-three as we have said sir  if you want to lay it on the table i'm prepared to do it sir  sir in nineteen ninety the number of searches conducted it was two thousand one hundred and fourteen  in nineteen ninety-one two thousand three hundred and ninety nineteen ninety-two it was one thousand two hundred and fifty upto march nineteen ninety-three it was three sixty-five cases sir  foreign currency you see enlarged sir  in nineteen ninety it was one point one thirty-six point three  three nine lakhs sir  in nineteen ninety-one it was three hundred and

market exchange rate also yes i can tell you  upto twenty seven three uh ninety-three sir  right we have booked fourteen cases sir   right  and if you want me each case individually and each amount involved i can tell you sir   no no don't want that is enough and also sir the market exchange rate sir in  in february ninety-two upto february ninety-three the market exchange rate upto the date was in february ninety-three it was twenty-six point two zero sir  in february ninety-two the march ninety-two it was twenty-five point eight nine sir actually and also the bombay hawala  market rate sir as we could uh collect the information it was  only thirty-four thirty-four rupees in the  february ninety-three sir  just it's premium in percentage it's only twelve percent sir and in march nineteen ninety-three sir the percentage of premium in hawala rate it has come down to ten point seven  in april it has come down to ten point four and against  it's a big rise slight rise in eighth of april it is eleven point four  now on sixteenth april it is eleven point six sir relevance yes  sir if within that the actual market rate is now eleven point some eleven point six no it is the percentage of premium market it is the percentage that's the gap that's  there and that's the gap that attracts the no no the the black marketists to go to the hawala market instead of going coming to the open market   no no  that is the speculative  so that's why all these schemes of liberalisation whatever you have announced that has no impact the impact is yes in the gold field that has that is some impact  but actually the hawala market as is being reported everyday in the newspaper that hawala market is going on and going on in a full speed  and the the objectives whatever you have announced during this kind of liberalisation and all this things has no meaning at all  and number two sir the fera act of section eight and section section nine the custom officers have said it contradicts against the specifications contradict the fera act itself and that also gives the handle for hawala  market to operate  may i know from the honourable minister that whether it has  brought to his notice by the custom officials that this fera act section eight and section nine of the fera act is being contradicted by the notification of r b i for which the hawala market is a negotiator sir i don't agree with the honourable member the  hawala rate is on the increase sir  it has certainly come down and with the government measures even the these administrative measures it has kept smuggling and it has made smuggling under one word  and the second objective of these measures to prevent the all transactions  i don't say it is totally wiped out  it is there  but the government is making sincere efforts to put an end to such clandestine operation interruption  mr moghe but about this sir fera act sir as we are aware sir  the fera act or the amendment we have recently uh been introduced very recently sir and it would be very prematured to assess the impact on  hawala trade sir   a few words in hindi  sir and the present act under the fera the persons who are involved in such transactions they are detained under fera  and a two words and even then there a few words  yes there is a provision sir yes yes mr moghe please   a few words in hindi  sir as i have already pointed out hawala  case being a clandestine operation it's very difficult to amo estimate the amount quantum of hawala  trade and it's very difficult to decide on the revenue collections and other uh monitory item   shree nirmal kanthji  a few words in hindi  he is entirely right that it is a clandestine operation from which uh uh for the people will reap all the benefit  uh the question is that uh you had you had you had a committee to estimate black income which was entirely clandestine  interruption  why don't you have another body to enquire legal estimate of how much transactions take place in the hawala market   number one  number two you have you say that the ra   rate of return is ten per cent or eleven per cent on these transactions  imagine the rate that is being given here it is an astronomical rate  does it means that the real value of the rupee   is that that much weak so that we can derive such a high rate of returns  and a few words there we will be no  hawala market  if there is full convertibility which the i m f is desiring of dr manmohan singh  just now it is convertability on the trade account only  you say it is a full flaw and there we have no hawala  market at all  is there any proposal in the mind of dr manmohan singh to go into that so that at one stroke the hawala case  is completely eliminated  and a whole structure in it that these illegalities in the foreign exchange trade are taking place not only to the unorganised sector of hawala trade  and you have indulge you have not made any cbi enquiry to find out who were the people who are connected who are connected with those who are arrested directly  many important people in bombay and others are involved  but apart from that your foreign exchange bank foreign bank  we are their hope so and not to account  through which as we have discovered it mr nirmal kanthji it is not violating it is going out  mr nirmal kanthji  its becoming a long speech  i am not giving a speech sir yes it is becoming hope to account then not to account also to that also how much money is going out yes cons constitution  of the country to access the uh hawala trade   it's a suggestion and at present the government has no set proposal sir  and regarding the as i already said the government is making very sincere efforts putting down such transaction by making some administrative by taking some administrative measures  and strictly enforcing all existing clause fera forty-four a tada and other uh like uh under the   co conva covered under the uh transaction sir  and as i have already pointed out sir  but it is a little too much  he has pointed out interruption how many percent  we have taken action in bombay  we have taken in action on several persons in bombay madras bangalore and even in delhi who have violated this and hyderabad  and and even who have violated operated most of accounts also sir  and this hawala transaction as i pointed out earlier sir was mainly operated through earlier and gold smuggling number two is silver smuggling and third is underinviting and overinviting sir  as the government has taken very serious view of situation we are making very sincere efforts to put down this  ama how many cases you have one or two words   you will get the find out this i have already said

i extend a very happy welcome to dr rajni badlani  the english studies officer the british council division bombay  i am also very happy to welcome to dr shastri  whom we have been missing for quite sometime  uh may i request honourable chairman to offer a bouquet to dr badlani as a sign of welcome and request honourable chairman to offer a bouquet to dr shastri who has come after such a long time claps  and now that dr shastri is back and dr badlani is here i hope that they continue to be with us for quite sometime  when we want the british council help and we want dr  shastri's guidance  so with these words i conclude my welcome speech and well i here request honourable chairman to say a few words a few words  it gives me a great pleasure uh to welcome dr badlani  and our beloved dr shastri once again to join us  we were really missing him for the last so many months  now with the god's grace he is back and hope he will be with us for many years to come  with his guidance and assistance of british council  the board of studies i think has come up with the nice  text book of standard nine  and they are also planning to have that the same book  of the same type  as i understand this is a this book has a new approach  it is a quite a good blend of structural approach  and uh  communicative communicative skills  in fact i don't know what is exactly structural approach and communications  but as you are mentioning it again and again i am getting to it  any good change is always welcome  but as you know dr badlani no change is accepted properly  or whole heartedly unless it is properly delivered or  people are made to understand it in the right direction yes  so it should be our endeavour it should be our  one word it includes board of studies state board  teachers and students  we must prepare them to accept this change  and unless we prepare them to accept this change unless we convince them what is good in this we'll have  very difficult great difficulty to drive home  it is not only true for this english this will be true for whole syllabus since our approach to the new syllabus is also changed  we have included many new topics in the syllabus  the board is thinking to have orientation of all teachers  in all subjects  it may be not may not be a exhaustive one  but at least two-three days orientation to all teachers  and particularly for this english language we require more orientation because it being a foreign language it's not our mother tongue it is altogether different and difficult one  to understand and learn  and as we all know the condition of english in rural areas in particular   we'll have to have more efforts on this one   it's of high syllabus exercise it's a communication skill and here only we lack in communication  teachers themselves lack in communication  they can only read and ask students to hear listen  and repeat the same thing  but they hardly speak  so we will have to inculcate them inculcate into them  skill of speaking  if they speak then only the students can be able to  speak something  so in order to prepare them this board of studies has envisaged a programme  and for that programme atleast we will again request  british council and particularly mrs badlani who has extended  help  we intend to in the initial stages we are  have thought of preparing cassettes  am i correct ? video cassettes video cassettes  but somehow dr shastri was not feeling well that scheme has also not come up very well  nevertheless we have not dropped that we have modified the scheme  we will modify it  instead of having a video cassettes we'll have audio cassettes   we'll have audio cassettes  and uh i think sixty percent work of the audio cassettes has been already completed  even if fifty percent has to be completed we will complete it and after the completion of recording we will have  efforts we will make efforts to supply at least two cassettes  per school so that each school will have a cassette to listen  listen in a proper intonation listen correct english  and if they listen correct english they may speak correct  for that also we may request british council state board and other voluntary organisations to help us  secondly we're also planning to have master trainers course  nearly there are sixteen thousand secondary schools  if we take one teacher per school we'll have to train minimum fifteen thousand secondary school teachers in english for english  to train fifteen thousand secondary school whether   two words itself  for that also we'll have to have first resource persons  to train the resource person we have to have some master trainers to train the master trainers we'll have to have the help of board of studies then teachers what you call them  uh experts then book writers and british council  for you also madam we request your organisation to have  uh your help  we will also request central institute of english to extend their help  because if we can if we can train good master trainers  then we can have the good resource persons and then only  there can be percu good percolation to the teachers there  if master trainers are not good the resource persons will not be good  and if resource persons are not good very few will be very less will be percolated to the teachers themselves  uh in that way let's have straight way from the  original resource only that is english british council  we will have master trainers from there only  so that is also one request  and these master trainers or these workshops here we'll  prepare or we intend to prepare teachers handbook or teachers guide  atleast then we'll have something to fall back  in the school they will have nothing to fall back  in big villages or big cities teachers have got  what you call that seminars workshops but in isolated  villages they hardly get any or guidance  so our teachers' handbook of particular subject  will be very handy for them  so one good teachers' handbook will definitely help them for that also we will have the assistance  i will request for them as for dr shastri i'll get an assistance  i think it is worth  i request representative of british council to extend their fullest possible cooperation to our endeavour and make this project a successful one  if uh with dis discussion   any finer points will come up uh i'll not spell out each and everything  uh they have still some scope for the discussion otherwise  laughter  what will be the use of this meeting  thank you very much  now dr shastri is here  we have regained our all hope  he is our hope he is our moral support   and he is our guide   right   right  we were really missing him for last nearly six seven months  now he is here but even then we don't worry trouble him much  sure  he must relax rest and work only when he enjoys it  you must work as long as you enjoy it otherwise you should not you should take rest   yes yes  with these words i conclude my opening talk and we'll  have one word occasion  thank you very much  uhm i   may i request mrs badlani  at first i like to thank you all very much for giving me such a warm welcome  and uh i must say that uh professionally i have been english studies officer of the british council  i have been extremely pleased with the work that the maharashtra board has been doing and uh with whatever little support we have been able to extend through what ever limited funds we have  when i compare it to this uh extremely new project in the central board of secondary education  i find that uh we have definitely not got even one tenth of the facilities and one which they have got because they have been funded by another agency the o b a  ah but nevertheless with whatever limited funds we have had at the council in bombay i have kept maharashtra board my top most priority in my budgeting claps  thank you and uh i will continue to do so  i am going to now put in a request for you know the other uh help that you have asked for which might mean uh may be more than one specialist  so far we have only been managing to get one specialist and uh for her also it has not been very easy to be working on three or four different books a centre  and now with the teaching training uh module i think we will definitely need more than one person  so uh i'll like to uh reiterate the fact that i am going to continue my support as much as i can for the board and it's very heartening to see that you know the books have actually been produced and are supposed to be out from the press in may  ah in this context could i make a request of support uh since our funding also is very strictly evaluated and monitored it would be very helpful for me if i have i am given even if it is the rough draft of the book  so that i can say okay this we have produced  this is the output of our input  and now for the further output we need this much input it will strengthen my uh case where my asking for fund is concerned  because here i can show concrete evidence  it is no good saying that the thing is taking place you know  it's in the press etcetera  so uh and why i am asking it now and not when the final printout is out because uh i'll be asking for funds in april or may  so it's at the time of asking the funds that i would like to show some concrete evidence of whatever input we have made so far  uhm i think i will not say much about uh what i want to at this stage because we it'll a lot of points will come up in the discussion  uhm but from our experience with the c b s e project  uh we have learnt a couple of lessons  and that is it is important that whenever such uh  project is on to have a committee of people with of course one convener or whatever to monitor the progress of the project so that if for any reason some one member is not able to  come the other members can continue the course and in this way i hope  that what happened in you know when professor shastri who as you were very rightly said has been the guiding light and in fact he is the one who approached us the british council  and i think the board is very fortunate in having a person of professor shastri's experience knowledge and qualification to be the convener because he is so well versed in e l t  he has had lots of experience  so he was able to pitch everything at the right level  uh ask me for what kind of suitable help i could extend  uh he i know put in a lot of effort  i think too much efforts which uh took its toll and  and i i also would now think that it is unfair that all the stress should be only on one individual so that we   that's what kadepurkar said  sir again it will be one individual  i would suggest that if we have atleast a member of a committee of three or four members  because even harsh might at some points say okay now i have my  son's exams or my something i cannot come  so i think it is better to have a committee and not then again pressurise harsh uh as much  so it will and all sudden done three or four heads together is better than one and also the stress which is on one person will not be there  so i would strongly recommend that for the project you form a committee and let that committee uh work together so that if one or two people cannot come atleast the remaining two continue the thing  because this was a big gap you know i was waiting in the council office for some information  and of course i knew about professor shastri's illness  i we did correspond over new year when he was he was much better than stuff like that  but then we lost out on quite a lot of our you know  activities here which is in much one can always catch up  there is no i mean nothing has really gone uh uh array but i think i would recommend that you formulate a committee  rather than just keep it on one or two people  for the teacher training project  for the whole project not only the teacher training project for the whole project of division of classes nine ten  eleven twelve  we have now come to uh we've finished nine and eleven we are now at the stage of uh looking for identifying texts and selection of texts for ten and twelve   looking  so uh you of course spoke only about the teachers'  awareness programme  am i to assume that you are also expecting uh rightly i hope uh some uh input into these two text books as were given for the nineth and the eleventh yes we should include  that's it i have included so that is what so it is not only teacher awareness programmes i would prefer to look at it as the whole project uh which is the textbook revision and because the syllabus was already made we couldn't change the syllabus but we have tried to put in as much communicative skills as possible within the constraints of the syllabus  and teacher training and somewhere i also read that you are looking forward to some kind of evaluation of question paper as well yes it should be part of the whole thing so in a way it is  it covers everything  so i i would not just say for the teacher training programme but for the whole project  and we depend of course on everybody's views that is just my suggestion  and for our looking at past experience i would say that uh  it will be beneficial to the project  do you think the committee to plan or to execute  uh plan mainly plan  mainly plan  the committee cannot execute  committee cannot uh really take up the whole thing they will plan for the execution naturally  the three or four people will then the work of the committee will be only the policy nature  not necessarily only  it is not necessary only depending on uh the persons own uh  inclination his own expertise his own willingness  like harsh i'm sure he as a member of the committee would still like to be actively involved in uh the teacher training programme  in the execution  so it is not either or you don't have water tight compartment it depends like professor shastri might just be there to give us overall advice because he has so much experience  he can tell us what he thinks about it  so he even he is very actively involved he might just oversee everything  so that again is very open ended   it's not either or  but for example if uh uh uh a specialist has to come and say if two people on the committee are not available for discussions atleast two other people will be available 
in the absence of dr shastri for some time who had been the guiding spirit for the preparation of text books  from nineth to twelfth  during his absence we have done our best to select some passages  i now welcomes him i we we welcome him to  to take the reins in his hand  so just to take a review of what we've done i would like to request professor patil-kulkarni and  principal krishnamurthy to make us rather available  the list of the articles or the passages that have been  selected  i request patil-kulkarni to give the brief  according to the plan evolved by the board of studies in english of said board of secondary and higher secondary  english pune  uh we have in all seven units of which the first unit is called informative writing  the second one is note-making  third unit is distance communication  but the final decision is not yet taken regarding this one  the fourth unit is reading and responding to advertisements workshop is to be done in this next week  and the fifth one is reading newspaper  almost complete selection has been made as far as this particular unit is concerned  and i may speak a few words regarding the selection that has been made and the contents of various items that have appeared under this unit reading the newspaper  as we all know newspaper forms an essential part of  civilized society  without newspaper people will be in dark of what has happened been happening all over the world and around their own village or town  and so we thought it essential to intr  introduced introduce this one unit for the benefit of  the students studying in twelfth standard  we have selected a various articles  according to their sections  the sections may be alright interruption  one short news another letters to the editor  other forms a report  and one form uh the editorial section of the newspaper  and then another spot news all these are relevant to the understanding of what has been happening around us  the first one of these is about an accident which took place in bengal and about forty-one people were killed in the coal mine it might have been due to the fire that broke out and also  due to carbon monoxide which they breathe and then they died   cough  several bodies have been recovered where the final report is not yet available  but then every one has said that about forty-one miners were killed  second one is from one word to the letters to the editor  one writes it about highway development  taking into consideration all development that have been made  recent years  the writer opines that we are lagging far behind  perhaps generations behind the other countries our asian countries particularly singapore indonesia malaysia etcetera  they have forged far ahead of us in the maintenance of the highways  so here presented a few developments that have been taken by the government of india in maintaining the highways the last two of it is consist spot news giving information regarding what's happening at the centre for the budget session was opened on the last day of the session  the information is given earlier and what items could be included into the session into the small views mentioned  we shall come back to it  that's about unit five  unit six deals with persuading for which others will speak and seventh unit narrating would be at spoken about by some other person  and then we come to imaginative writing section two  and which contains poems and other imaginative things  and the last section is rapid reading which particularly full of short short stories  and in the earlier section imaginative writing we have selected a number of poems  out of ten i will present only three poems only two or three poems  and in this another one pulley by george herbert which many of the people already know about it  it tells about the human being generation and regeneration  and the humanisation or whatever it is in this world   they're known to each and everyone i don't think  i'll spent much time on this   you can pass pass over pass over  and the next one is uh by a black poet oleghe  i feel a sudden storm the environmental situation presented in this poem is almost similar to indian environment  before storm comes rain comes there is a lull lull before the storm  and children gather in that lull and the coming sign of storm people are worried they go in search of their children  they are calling them of but the children don't listen to them for children love the storm and it is about to rain  and suddenly when all the winds are cleared people are there in their houses  storm raises thunder takes over lightning is there and suddenly it starts pouring down  and children enjoy themselves playing out in the rain that is a poem by a black poet which is also very relevant of indian one word  after this we go to the rapid reading section uh   i'll speak on only two or three fine  uh haan  yeah  uh selected stories  one is the well known story the cop and the anthem by o henry  this is typical henrian uh short story having a twist in the tale  you know how that is  here a one word convict soapy he is now facing an ordeal  as the winter was approaching he wanted to find a shelter  warm shelter from that interruption  the best idea was to go back to prison so that he would get some warm corner there  but unfortunately all his efforts in trying to go back to the prison failed  sincere efforts at that but then when all these things failed he comes near a church where prayer was going on  and he felt certain trasformation  so he decided to live a honest life put an end to  his stop this stealing business  but the moment this transformation came next came the hand of a cop on his shoulder one word what are you doing here  he says nothing   one word  and the last one that i'm discussing on is  the nightingale   nightingale again brings to to our memories various feelings that we pines for nightingale and  story viewers also have written on nightingale  this one is by hans anderson  this a lengthy story telling about a bird nightingale bird who sings sweetly in some remote corner on the shores there was an emperor chinese emperor who has all the greatest things in the world in his empire in his court  and then somehow he comes to know casually there is a wonderful bird singing a very melodious song day and night  he likes to hear that  ultimately the girl who had heard it first persuade this bird  to comes come to king's court and then the bird sings to the satisfaction of the great emperor  and this emperor makes a golden cage for it with all the amenities and a place a designation in the court honour  as a court singer  the bird everyday goes on singing  but this she cannot continue for a long time the bird is also mortal being  and so to immortalise the song of a bird a genius was there  scientist who made a machine which would reproduce the song  exactly as nightingale  when the button was on it will go on singing like nightingale and the people appreciated him  and then everyone neglected this bird original bird  and the bird felt very sad  and it flew away from  and then once this machine is uh that gets out of order  though it was repaired it could not produce the melodious song as before  then the emperor felt that he was missing this music  and on account of this he fell ill  people went in search of the bird they could not find  ultimately the emperor thinks of nightingale bird  prays the bird to come back to emperor the emperor was on his death bed so he is only saved by the song of the bird  the bird comes two words from one word of the window and then sings  the emperor very much one word he started recovering  he only said that we can talk again the whole one word  but it'll come sometimes say once in a day  once in a week to sing to the emperor one word  so this is the story of nightingale  with these few one word i think i've spoken  uh within the specified time that was given to me to review the items that have been selected for this particular book for standard english text book which commence from ninety-five june thank you  thank you sir  infact i'm divided between recording broken  these are i should compliment you or offer my thanks  i began that uh you are going to give a kind of report and it was rather a kind of prosiac begining i think  and now i think when i heard your review of the  units that you have selected i rather feel that i've   travelled through the realms of gold  thank you thank you now thank you mr kaned for this opportunity given to me  to review a few of the lessons selected by us for uh the twelfth class english text  i begin with uh rapid reading section  we have selected about uh ten stories  and i feel the main considerations behind the selection of these stories are number one the sustained interest  two suitability for the age group  three the moral orientation the story may have  and lastly the variety  of these stories i take first fate a woman  and a ruby  it is a detective story from the files of cecil bishop  c i d scotland yard  the story narrates in a very gripping manner  how bishop was able to find out the lost ruby  in this he makes several efforts  and a woman came to his uh age aid  but even after uh very long search almost he gave up hope at that moment fate came to his uh aid  and with the help of the fate he was able in the end  to detect this uh lost ruby   it's a very fine absorbing detective story but second story that i've selected is the accursed house by emile gaboriau  it is a story on human psychology  vicomte reduces the rents of the buildings with very good intention of helping the tenants  but unfortunately this intention was misunderstood  and the people began to smell something foul  and they thought that there must be some other motive  behind it  and then one after the other all the tenants desert the uh house  and thus the house becomes an accursed house  the third story the fortune tellers  which is a folk tale it tells about story of uh scholars  who out of their greediness ruined themselves  the fourth story is uh foolish friends   by premchand one of the famous indian short short story writer he describes how sometimes even good friends  with good intention may become embarrassing to the extent of even ruining the people whom they want to help  here it is about few boys i mean two boys i mean one boy and the girl who out of their curiosity and also out of their intention to help them  uh eggs in the nest ultimately ruin it  and the the next story once upon a christmas  by pearl buck  he is very absorbing absorbingly narrated story of a boy  who comes to the writer on the eve of uh christmas  and she adopts him she becomes grownup  and he becomes a doctor  and afterwards there were troubles in china china splits  and uh pearl buck wanted to return home  she wanted the boy also to accompany her  but he refused  and he wants to stay back in china doing self-less service to the people  she tells him that the communist may not allow him to do the type of uh service  but he says he is determined to stay whatever may happen to him  ultimately he is uh shot dead  and uh after these few stories i want to take up one or two poems that i've uh the opportunity of selecting  one is the poem what kind of a place    what kind of place this is by uma parmeshwaran  this is a satire on uh modern life  now we find all the windows and the doors of the house  shut  and the curtains withdrawn the curtains and no breeze comes in  we don't have the opportunity of seeing uh the natural uh beauty  and uh even our way of life is so changed that there is no distinction between man and uh woman as far as social life is concerned they move they move together they mix with each other  which for an old father looks very odd  and even cooking is done once for uh in a month  and he expresses his displeasure for this life  and uh he wants his son to open the windows and the door so that he can have the opportunity to breathe fresh air and see  nature in all its splendour  and the next poem is the whiner's plaint  in search of identity  this poem is about an indian who is not known as indian in his uh country but known as a madrasi or a brahmin or a hindu or a muslim  and uh he doesn't feel happy with these labels that are attached to that persons  and he wants to be known only as an indian  and these are the two poems on which i wanted to  say a few words  and thank you very much for this opportunity given two words  in fact story has been the first love of every generation  and uh with so much visualisation and uh rather so much pain staking labour we have selected the stories with variety of subjects  and we feel no doubt that these would be very interesting  in fact the stories are interesting but the story telling was also interesting  and therefore for a moment we thought that the time  had stopped  when you switched to poetry and as i know  that it is your first love and the way you said something about the poem that you have selected has aroused curiosity in our mind  and it would be appreciated by the students at large  i am reminded again of the one word seed  that may sprout and flower when the text books comes into light thank you very much thank you

called him he said initial years uh i don't know what is the response  so let me start by paying you two thousand five hundred and from next year uh we will see how whether we can pay more so it is uh or we have agreed and the classes have started and uh parents uh some twenty thirty parents have already registered the classes are run on saturday and sunday without affecting uh working of the school  then uh initially we have made the enquiry  but we have not uh uh still taken action and in due course we will take action  and uh uh i would i would suggest uhm one attitude uh in fort area uhm there is one sardarji he is a good assembler and uh good service also uhm uhm  atleast last twenty years in our whole building most of us are using that assembled one uhm uhm  actually he makes the whole thing uhm for your voltas also have he has given yeah to them and voltas only puts their level endowing  so therefore you can also consult krishnan yeah  for the price and other thing one word and only thing is known devil is better than the unknown devil that's   uhm   uhm   uhm uhm   uhm uhm   uhm   yeah   yeah   yeah  no here we have got quotations for about twenty thousand known people  known uh both the both parties are known and voltas is charging uh twenty-eight thousand plus taxes and that's a lot the discussion was to find out from these uh  assembled persons whether during the service which is free one year guarantee is there  parts are also free or whether we have to pay somehow i had not been able to ask them  it is free service minus the part   include the part  that confirmation we wanted committee wanted and that i have not been able to do  uh so that is and this uh you see uh we decided to open the account uh for computer education  now little bit of background is necessary for some members office bearers are fully aware  now last year we had agreed uh according to the contract  to collect the fees ourselves and uh then uh transfer their share to the party  somehow we were not able to because bank didn't agree and the the one word collected the fees  then uh we our contribution uh actually came back to us after lot of correspondence and then uh we wrote finally a letter in may asking the party to see us along with the  cheque cheque and uh that day all the office bearers were here and h m was there he brought the cheque according to the cal   calculation it was about twenty four thousand or twenty-five thousand it is reflected in the account statement which is declared  cheque

degree uh one is submitted by shri s l jadhav now he has submitted a dissertation on the  congress party and the peasant movements in maharashtra from nineteen thirty to nineteen fifty  and the other dissertation has which has   been submitted that is by s d pawar on social and political thought of acharya jawadekar  now we have to appoint referees as far as the  external referees are concerned  uh i'd like uh the guide of the research dr s chousalkar to just shed some light on the work done and uh  then we'll discuss the excerpts  then we may appoint the three three experts on each of these  dissertation i think six of the  six six six experts on each of the dissertations  and as the rule goes the names will be submitted to  the vice-chancellor and the vice-chancellor will prepare a list  of the preferences to whom they will be referred  now i shall i request dr chousalkar to just throw some light on the work done by his two students  sir two synopses submitted the first is by mr s d pawar on social and political thought of acharya jawadekar   in his thesis he has studied uh social and political thought of acharya jawadekar uh to historical perspective  and in his thesis he has tried to throw light on contributions that are made by acharya jawadekar  uh as far as understanding modern indian political uh history is concerned as far understanding socialism is concerned as far as uh understanding of uh democracy is concerned  so and he has expounded his own concept of satyagraha  in socialism  so acharya jawadekar's contribution uh to political science is uh discussed in this book in this thesis and i think uh uh persons who are specialised in this subject should be appointed  so we have to recommend six names sir  the first name i suggest is uh dr rajendra vohra  you prepare a rough list rough list yeah  rajendra vohra  dr rajendra vohra  number one  dr k raghavendra rao  dr k raghavendra rao  now raghavendra rao yes  dharwad he is there in dharwad or he is in shimla now  that i don't know  first we will have to look into it yeah yeah he has got that fellowship fellowship in shimla we can also suggest some uh names in political theory they are related to political theory but if they have to no this is for m k   accha  ranade r v ranade  and shashi one word  political theory  political theory cough  i think rana ranade would be better  uh one or two words in marathi  g p deshpande will also be  so where is dr g p deshpande from   j n u  centre for international studies  j n u  g what's the initial ? g p dr g p deshpande  g p deshpande   deshpande from j n u  next dr vallabh  he may be expert but but whether will he agree accept the request  yes does he know acharya jawadekar yes sir  uhn  any any more any more names ? only we can suggest one more name  i think  uhm raghvendra rao raghvendra rao  raghvendra hey dr dr can we have dr raghvendra   i'll be seconding that  okay seconded   one word he should uh one word he should be that  a few words in marathi  that will be  dr mor more  look dr one word  now go to the second second  the second thesis is uh related to the congress party and peasant movement in maharashtra from nineteen hundred and  thirty to nineteen hundred and fifty  uh in this thesis mr jadhav has studied the interaction between the congress party and the different peasant movements  that were launched in maharashtra from nineteen thirty to nineteen fifty  uh there was a very close connection between the growth of congress party and different political movements that were launched by peasants  so the peasants played peasant leaders played a very important role important in maharashtra after nineteen thirty  uh the leaders of bahujan samaj joined congress in nineteen thirty  in nineteen thirty-seven thirty-eight keshav rao jede become the became the president of maharashtra pradesh congress committee so there was a close interaction between the peasant leaders and the congress party  and there was a conflict between the peasant leaders  and uh congress party bosses like shankar rao dev vallabh bhai patel  and balasaheb kher  in this thesis uh mr jadhav discusses the performance of  first and second kher ministry the first ministry was formed in nineteen thirty-seven  under the leadership of balasaheb kher from nineteen thirty-seven to nineteen thirty-nine the kher ministry uh passed many uh legislations regarding the abolition of rural indebtedness or implementation of certain land reforms  the second kher ministry took over in nineteen forty-six  the performance of kher ministry from nineteen forty-six to nineteen fifty is also discussed  during that period the kher minis kher government has passed this important uh the legislation that uh the land reforms legislation that is land to the tiller  and uh there was a close competition between the rural congress leader and the congress bosses  and because of that there was a conflict between mr kher  and mr keshav rao jede and because of that conflict ultimately there was a split in the congress party in nineteen forty-eight and a shetkari kamgar party was established so all these things are discussed by uh mr jadhav in his thesis now we can recommend certain names as related to  so r v one word can be  one minute   two words   two words   two words  mohe  how about two words ?  haan that is two words  you know that   one or two words   one or two words  he is always one word out of contact he has retired  he can contact  a r shinde  what are the next ? what you think  dileep   i think you are very fond of him   actually one or two words included in that uhm  his name was also excluded in that list   diwakar one word  dole  dole is there  hukkeri college  now we should be  we'll add this   one or two words cough  which which place working working not working  so you can add jangam here and can it be rajshekharaiah uh rajshekharaiah  rajshekharaiah  uhn doc   haan  jangam  jangam it will be good for this  congress party uhn congress party and rajshekharaiah will be good for  this theory  haan theory  so then another  these three uh  there addreses we'll have to bring  no one word no problem no problem  the next uh thing is that this one  one student has submitted synopsis for one or two two students have submitted   submitted synopsis for the registration of ph d  now one is dinkar patil the other is n r patil  both the patils again  uh now patil dinkar patil wants to do on political leadership of shri vasantdada patil special reference to his role as chief minister of maharashtra from seventy-seven to eighty-nine  now the guide is guidance of rasam madam uhm  first one reserve it  n r patil  n r patil one word  so it is forwarded by you uhm so that is why you have signed  uhm  uhn yes yes laughs   one word we have to know whether  how far the guide has taken into consideration the various works done jamadar has submitted dissertation  uh previous works have been concentrated on uh the cooperative movement not on vasant dada patil  as a chief minister's work has not been done  he wants he wants to purely concentrate on  as a role of a chief minister   as of chief minister accha  but then you have but that i think he uh  included a chapter on vasant dada patil  but that  vasant dada's role in pre-independent period nineteen seventeen to forty-six  vasant dada's political activity involvement in forty-six to fifty-one so this is all before becoming the chief minister  vasant dada's role as an m l a in nineteen fifty to seventy-one  then comes that is  that everybody know that he was a chief minister vasant dada's role as an immigration   irrigation minister  that has to be done  chapter two vasant dada's patil uh role as  chief minister  that is alright  chapter three vasant dada patil's role as chief minister no the title concerned with political leadership no    that is in consideration  with special reference to chief minister's role affair but the content is  which also as a backdrop you want to tell it as a  want to pass  as a historical background background  background  in the introductory chapter  introductory chapter he should uh he should vasant dada's  introduction  so all the chapters are or based on vasant  dada's patil role as chief minister and the period that is different periods are given specific  dates have been given actually   chief minister   different periods  seventy-seven to eighty five eighty-six eighty-five  eighty-five   eighty-five  then the last chapter you concentrate on that only seventy-seven to eighty-five lot of materials are there  haan  ten years is enough  ten years is enough  and if and if if chief as chief minister  yes  we will record that also  see the problem would you have be  language again whether you will be able to do in english or not  laughs  then afterwards you may again sub require to   submit a an application asking that all materials are kept in marathi and so he would submit it in marathi and all  actually it is going to be very difficult uhn  most of the students are writing in marathi   uhn   marathi  so i think tentatively in principle we accept it  that he may be allowed for registration uhm  but the first chapter has to undergo as we feel that  uhm   we'll put it in the introductory part  no no again how one or two words  look men don't even mention vasant dada's role as pre-independence you can just give a biography  finish  up to uh this one word sixth chapter is not necessary uhm  sixth chapter  from seventy-seven to eighty-five  uhn you just put the title instead of eighty-nine there should be eighty-five  political leadership of shri vasant dada patil with special reference to his role as a chief minister of maharashtra from seventy-seven to wait nineteen eighty-five  nineteen eighty-five and uh there are only uh there are breaks  it's alright  but then the changed synopsis making certain changes in chapter one  to this we'll have the p g section to write to him accordingly yeah   we'll refer to the synopsis again  the changes recommended  now what will be the changes recommended  changes that is from period from seventy nineteen seventy-seven to eighty-five  i think he has included in chapter one all those things   no which you recommended   no  pre-independence to a period vasant dada's  political activities and involvement in nineteen forty-six  his role other than as a chief minister  sir we'll conclude   everything has been included in the introduction  so i don't think there is a need of recommendation no you change the this   we'll change only the last chapter  say introduction delete the last chapter  no let the chapter one be there  let it be vasant dada a biography itself  uh bio  biographical profile profile profile and you want them to include but don't mention these  subtitles uhn  historical biography whatever it might be  biographical  biographical profile profile haan  uhm the last two chapters ommited  now we go to another synopsis which has been submitted by n r patil  n r patil on  hindustan latex limited kanagala district belgaum  a government of india undertaking a case study of one word  what exactly he wants to do ? laxminarayan as a guide you better tell us  hindustan latex limited is a   if you write out  one one synopsis  if he reads i will write it out later on don't worry  okay  tell us  hindustan latex limited  if you read out   i'll read out the synopsis of the student  with uh some omissions and commissions  the title is hindustan latex limited kanagala  district belgaum a government of india undertaking within its parenthesis a case study of the one word organisation is working  so the title indicates that the candidate is studying  admitted to an organised outside of this undertaking public undertaking in his in his synopsis he mentions that there were just five  public undertakings with a total investment of rupees  twenty-nine crores in nineteen fifty-one which has risen to one hundred and eighty-six undertakings with a total investment of worth twenty thousand crores by nineteen eighty  this indicates that public sector undertakings are getting momentum in india  but uh as a guide i should say that number of public  sector undertakings in the country some are no profit no loss basis  some are only dealing profit making  and this actually this undertaking this hindustan latex limited kanagala was established by central health and family welfare ministry on march nineteen eighty-seven  so till today it is hardly some eight years old eight or less than that  this factory is now producing condom mala-d mala-n etcetra and transporting such goods to madras bombay calcutta surat delhi objective of the study the candidate argues that to study the organisation in administrative problems of the hindustan latex limited kanagala it is very essential to understand this study from its perspective of growth of public sector undertakings in india in general  and karnataka in particular  in this context the study tries to understand the origin and growth of this public sector with reference to the public undertakings in india  the major coordination administration the personnel and financial problem as well as problems concerning labourers will be studied  it also studies the production capacity cost of production and transporting goods to outside the country as well as within india  is has also undertaken  for this purpose he has mention his one methodology  it it says that the study based on empirical research  the primary data will be collected by using photo one word  techniques such as interview and questionnaire method  and candidate also argue that he intend to use questionnaire and interview technique for official one word as well as the workers to obtain as clear a view as possible we try to include the governmental official about the problem of raw materials for factory  cost and transportation in relative problems  minutes of the meetings will be used for the purpose of understanding crucial problems concerning this public sector  apart from this primary data secondary data will be collected by using annual report journals periodicals and other published materials relevant to the subject so the data and matter are the subject undertaken by the candidate he feels that he can manage the subject within uh  two words three years or four years which is required for ph d degree and the continuous chapterisation given by the candidate one is introduction second is the profile of the factory third is administrative organisation fourth is production and finance fifth is personnel administration sixth is conclusion and recommendation  so it seems that the candidate wants to comprehend the organisation working of the this public undertaking with reference to  certain broad areas like administrative organisation personnel administration finance production etcetera  i think the candidate can manage the work in the prescribed time limit in parts 
so now uh we start uh departmental committee meeting this committee is held before the commencement of the new academic year  the second meeting which we are going to have   we'll talk certain things which we have not decided in the uh last meeting was the thing is that uh now the students election you see i don't know how we are going to conduct it  but nevertheless as far as uh the decision of having a class representative of part one and part two no that has to be  taken  this how we are going to select part one representative and part two representative for the timing is less  uh for the time being atleast because uh we have much as we are celebrating this twenty fifth year of departmental day  uh we'll need some student participation in it also so how are we going to uh have to decide upon all this these things and involvement of the student in the whole programme which we are likely to have uh in the  academic year  this academic year especially  now i would like to like the teachers to say a few words in this context as how we are going to be a whether we are going to have a depart a committee or you are going to decide upon class representatives  what about the guidelines ? uh we have not received any guidelines  there will be a student council that much is said in the new act but until elections are conducted and all  but the elections are there nominations are there the first candidate who has studies number marks  lead on the basis of merit uh students should be nominated that is the on the on the basis of merit  if that is in the guidelines all okay uhn  i think two words  so we'll talk of that now in that case there will be one one student you see from part one and one student from part two  but uh should we have a committee for this uh our uhm uhm we can have  uh for this uh silver jubilee function and uh  the one word students participating in concern we can have have like this  around we are having we will be having hundred students na  from part one say and part second let us say hundred students  silver jubilee function  oh yeah more or less we can divide this hundred student into team and each team should be held by a student leader team leader  he will be having in each team some responsibility  and atleast two team should be one word by a teacher  for example if they are not going in a proper direction or if they are not in having some problem that a teacher can  guide them  two team should be given to one teacher  that of a ten ten student and each ten ten have should have within ten one leader one word leader  so two group having two leaders and that will be under the control of one teacher  and these these students could do other certain duties as volunteers for uh for the function  from that way we can use the students in that case we will be involving the whole hundred lot in it there is nothing wrong in it for example if the function is for example three days or four days   no no there is some confusion you see what exactly do you think you are going to do ? no what you expect from the students ?  students yes so are they don't be so sir to help the after this for example you know we may ask them to uh uh distribute paper for example if you have seminar you can use that or we can ask them to you know uh uh some arrangements to be made they can do that for example all the certificates have to be given by the university so for purchase varchase they should be shifted up so many thing should be done  the for each one word we can first check out the activities check out the activities then on the basis of activities we can calculate how many students will uh actually require there will be uh some sort of arrangement be should be  there for example a a student may fall sick and uh do you mean that uh whatever we have decided yes  for the uh   yes  silver jubilee silver jubilee one one year haan  that would be separate from what the students will be doing they they should be involved in that uh that programme in that programme yes uh so a every for example it will be done throughout the year okay but one group for this month also   so you cannot involve all hundred students  you you should make a committee and the committee will be responsible of  organising  see okay but at the same time the committee without the help of manpower it cannot do anything at the same time for example burden are there burden of the students will also be less for example if you give to one uh student for one committee or one month one batch for one month arrange that for since they fallen into uh settle for one full year  so we can use ten by the turn or each each one each month one we'll get a new batch  so that they will get relaxation also like that  they will manage committee will manage  no but we have already made committee no that would be involved in the sense  no  okay these committee should be with the students we can say  see look here there are ten batches let the each committee handle it there will be no responsibility involved in what the committee is doing as the students are doing   but then  let the committee men for for example if there is uh let us say we have got five committees let uh one person in in the committee hand one batch or two batch like that  for example we are having uh this chemistry seminars we are having uhm  then we are having quiz and uh uh like uh  uhm so we are going to organise it organise it  we just one assistant that is what i'm telling for the assistants only what what type of assistant   no lakshminarayan how are you going to involve all students in it   all students cannot  not  it's same you see uh  not not at a time let us say for example this batch work work for only for ten  ten but how how they will come and report now dr chausalkar is going to have uh he's going to assist out for him uhn uhn  his work now what will they do   they won't uh no whether  no  what we'll do is we'll do is one word we are having different committees yes  each committee will have a student student group that is what i say ten student yes that is what i'm telling  my idea is that could be done each group for example it won't uh burden the students for example if you don't involve all the students what happens  only a few students will be always over burden no on the same line we are having one uh souvenir committee attached to the souvenir committee we'll have  souvenir committee   yeah   you can have one group in one yes they can do whatever suggested   we are thinking that one word  souvenir committee i i don't think it's  no i'm giving you example na  example na like any other committee actually actually debate committee for that  debate committee who has got quiz also whatever it is they will help you  so each one this month this is the group it will be there  you see another committee is what  three to five students may be involved in it  uhn it depends upon the workload  it may be have three or five or ten or it might be more now okay we've already involved them   we've started it i i feel you have five students and the one who goes as  as per the new act you see number one who is going to the students council on the basis of merit he'll be the chairman uhn  one part one committee and part two committee some five students uh four students and one one word  one would be chairman so four from part one four from part two  this is how decide you make two committees as far as part one part two is concerned  now my my basic idea is my important issue is that we can give them some books  we are going to collect funds you see  uhn   haan to collect money like that uhn uhn see i want to use them in that context  so if you all put into a very business like uh uh contract  cough that's how uh  uh we can do like that also no actually for that purpose all hundred coming laugh should be involved yes what is wrong in it let it be four involve five  do i work lot of work  see those  those teachers responsibility of involving all the students yeah  otherwise you'll not get the money if you if you involve all the hundred  uhn you'll make it compulsory in the part you will be there you need to get atleast five each student should get five  uhn  five what ? whatever other students are uh donation so you you'll form two committees part one and part two yes  and uh the man who is going as a the student who is going as a representative of the students council he'll  let him chairman okay  chairman of the committee  first year committee second year committee  for collection of money it's enough   two words some students laugh but what about other activity ? other activities means one word   we should require uh students for quiz programme  haan this arranging will be there  so many things  essay competition  and for seminar i don't think  uhn even for quiz competition you require some arrangement should be there na  seminar also we can have a committee   one word everyday you have to uh look see that you can involve all the students in that business you see why have committees and create problems to the well they have a another kind of feelings  already  already there are groups and fights yeah why i'm not included in that committee i'm  not getting two division yeah so why should i go there  laughs   yeah  instead of doing that let all get involved whenever there are seminars or quiz competitions  okay next any other thing that has as nanivadekar says he wanted to speak something no before that uhn we are going to organise  shivaji university political science forum from next month almost  uhn  yeah  what uh arrangement we are going to make because atleast seventy to seventy-five uh delegates are going to attend  yeah there is lot of so we have to think about that  well as a day we will have to organise   a few words   we'll have to one word afterwards  afterwards  so there are catering arrangements are there  accommodation arrangements are there vehicles and many other things are there i think we'll have to uhn first discuss  that first two words   uhn  uhm  you have send the letters  accomodation can we ask uh university to provide for   no have one word  have you mentioned about the  two days for three days uhn  papers  they a few words   we'll need i think we'll need i think  there's one only which i'm trying to say that i don't think that the halls are occupied the one word  hostel one word one you must contact the warden  means the halls are vacant seventy-five beds and all we should hey don't one word people may one word  ah twenty to twenty-five two words i think  either  inside inside kolhapur out of these twenty-five also some good people may be  kept in the guest houses guest house that is like some we can arrange in the hostel also  hostel and one word uhn ladies hostel is another  uhn  no ladies hostel we may not need at all  quarter one word  quarter one is vacant i think one is vacant autade autade autade's  quarter so we immediately write to book that patil first  two words  patil then guest house here  guest house  if this one word is well and good they are not going to a few words  quarters how many people can we accomodate in a quarter  yeah  fifteen  also yeah  fifteen to twenty not less than ten  more than twenty not less than ten  quarter sir no no it's very big yeah ten minutes are there  two words atleast there are parents who   two words  and even three one word  eleven to fourteen  haan  fifteen to twenty twenty-five twenty-one it becomes one word congested minimum fifteen to twenty nevertheless people coming from solapur district may require accomodation yeah definitely they they require our full one word karad may not be there satara district satara they will go back satara one word haan they have  haan  no barsi  anyhow either we decide for the catering and accomodation uh either we get the guest house or not this is we book the quarters first no it is not correct   we'll use it either for accomodation or for catering purposes the teachers quarter is no not bad  no of course for accomoding accomodating  no i know 
uh i must initially say that i am really grateful to  saraswati for having accepted this invitation and uh agreed to visit our department  i think she is first uh let's say who has come from such a long distance cough  saraswati from madras  uh she is a distinguished scholar and i'm happy that she is here with us this afternoon  now according to the official speaking the requirements of the open defence the candidate has to sum up the argument of his thesis in about twenty minutes about whether it should be convenient officially you can take an hour laughs but i'm  sure you won't like him laughter  so for about twenty minutes you speak and sum up  the main arguments of thesis and findings accentuating the findings  so i request him uh to summarise it  and then after that uh when he receives uh sir then after that  questions questions from from the external experts  other than the referees these questions should be treated two words  and then questions raised by the referees both the referees  cough and then if necessary those who are present here they will also raise their questions if required sometime from the candidate so i now request uh mr karande to sum up his thesis  thank you sir  the studying two words uh some features of educated indian english speech an one word study uh has five chapters besides introduction  in the introduction uh some background has been explained  as what led me to pick up the study  so some small work that i did in a partial fulfillment of  m phil degree so that led me to uh switch on to these topics  even though the focus of the one word study was  uh an articulate in phonetics  but here the focus is shifted to one word  phonetics  so again two things one is uh collection of data  that is elicited data and corpus data  so elicited data has been rather you know not paid much attention for one or two reasons  and corpus data has been uh preferred over here  for two reasons mainly and the one reason is in elicited data if the data happens to be the words are word-strings or sentences then this sentences and words you know most of the time they are cough isolated from the context  and so they are likely to loose some phonetic features  and so corpus data which is uh a continous speech may be or discussion or news particularly here the news reading  so it being a connected speech plus rapid speech you know  so all the required features that is one word features  of the strings and words required they were all intact or they were got all intact in this data  and so this corpus data it was preferred to the elicited data  cough  so the the limiting why this uh chapter or why this area  was chosen that is uh media news that is news broadcast on t v and uh radio  so one reason uh main reason for choosing this area was  uh that now-a-days the media in particular t v it has been a common feature over  so for collecting data or choosing news or the news readers  or the news that we get atleast thrice a day so it has been invariably permanent feature on t v and this uh radio  plus the news reader chosen uh to read news either on t v or on radio you know they normally represent all the linguistic communities uh that exist in india  and so this representation of the linguistic communities  they have been rather you know collected over years so these are the two reasons  so one more reason behind choosing this area and the topic is so normally we look up to this media news as a kind of english that might be followed by the listeners of t v and radio so  sometime you know it is regarded as norm from the listeners point of view  and uh standard from uh say t v or radio point of view so for these reasons you know this area was chosen by me  here over here interruption  chapter number three is about uh spectrography  so spectrography i it has been given a due importance in the study only because without  spectrographic analysis or the one word analysis the study would have been uh simply impossible  so this sophisticated device or this gadget you know it has all the uh facilities you know that gives uh over here the visual representation of all the one word features  so once we feed a sound or any sound segment to the machine it gives us uh the visual impression of the sound on the monitor  and that monitor gives us that sound in a one word  feature  so it records uh frequency it records amplitude it records du duration it records  one word it records a one word you know  so all this features they decide what sound is produced or what sound is pronounced by a speaker over here  and so this again you know place of the articulation of a sound segment or the manner of the articulation of a particular segment you know that can be to a great extent is decided by looking at or studying or interpreting these spectrographs and so spectograph has its own place in linguistic study  the next chapter is analysis of the data  in analysis of the data these three areas chosen for the study so the first is the duration and the four pairs of uh  pure vowels particularly long and short pairs  these four pairs have been chosen so the purpose behind choosing this four pairs was because it has been assumed or it has been uh talked of much by the scholars  all the people in this area that is indian speakers of english  that is educated indian speakers of english cough they hardly maintain the short long distinction in their speech you know  and so for these reasons these four pairs they were selected or these were they were chosen as one of the topics over here  so here while deciding the boundaries of the vocalic  segments over here some difficulties were there but to get over the difficulties certain strategies were to be thought out  and here the strategy is uh spectrograph machine or this device came to uh my assistance here because here the spectrograph  spectrograph machine it shows you which is a vowel and which is a consonant  so these features or the certain features on the basis of those features it was possible to catch or it was possible to decide the segment boundaries  so with the help of this segment boundaries this pure vowels or the vocalic segments they were detected or they were located and their duration it was ultimately again you know decided upon  so in this uh chapter or in this analysis it has been found out that is the distinction between short and long even though it is not very clear at the level of section but it is still there  there is uh some other reason why it is not that clear  but the distinction a short and long it is there in the speech of educated indian english  of course you know if we compare uh this phenomenon with the english spoken by the native speaker of english then it is very clear  that is length of any voc uh vocalic   item or the length of any vocalic uh segment you know is not as much as the length of the particular or the same vocalic segment pronounced by the native speaker  and there is obvious reason  but within the system used by any educated indian english  uh speaker you know he does maintain a particular kind of uh relationship or does maintain a particular kind of system  and where he distinguishes a short counterpart from its  long one  so this is one finding over there the second area or the second topic chosen so it is a dipthong  so on the dipthong three dipthongs again you know even uh professor bansal so he treats just  one dipthong that is a or ou which is there he says in uh educated indian uh english speaker and others too which i deal with over here so they are a and another is ae so these two so my findings in this study they are very much confirmed with uh dr  bansal's and uh that bansal's conclusions or his findings and findings by uh may be professor kachru and nihalani   two words these people also but here it was an attempt to verify it with the help of uh   one word study of one word means over here so one thing uh the one way to verify dipthongs it was a spectrograph  so in spectrograph one one word feature that is a  one word and these one word were decided whether a particular vowel uh pronounced by a speaker was a pure vowel or  a dipthong  there was a second one word or the f two what we say or the hub theory  so these hub theory or the f two second one word it gives a clear cut picture of the dipthong as well as of a pure vowel if it happens to be a pure vowel then f two or the second  one word it is straight it is in a straight position and when it is a dipthong  then there is uh uh frequency shift or there is a f two transition and these f two transition it is in terms of frequency over there so it can be seen very clearly with the help of a spectrogram which sound or which vocalic sound is a pure vowel and which is not or which is a dipthong  so the finding are these that is most of the indian educated indian speakers you know so some of them you know there are certain news readers that is educated indian uh speakers you know  of english that who do maintain this dipthongs who do pronounce a dipthong but the second element is not as stressed it is as boldly pronounced as it should have been and so the shift or the transition shift or f two shift f two transition it is not very much bold over there and so at the level of perception uh even though there is a transition shift even though there is f two transition that f two transition is not very much felt by the listeners  the third topic or the third area chosen for the study it is stress  even in case of stress uh it is said uh that indian speakers of english educated indian speakers of english they do not confirm with the native speakers of english as far as stress is concerned  but there is a some pattern  but which pattern in the present study it has been found out  i particularly neglected monosyllabic disyllabic and even trisyllabic words which form again the great part of anybodys speech  so multisyllabic words that is words with more than three syllables  so they are called the multisyllable in the present study  and these words you know they have been studied uh for the purpose of stress  over here it is found there is a word with prefixes and words without prefixes  so words without prefixes as far as stress pattern is concerned  they give a very chaotic picture  there is no pattern as such emerges when these words are studied but the word with prefixes you know they uh they maintain a kind of uh stress pattern you know  of course there are three divisions under this  the first division in the first division uh the prefix doesn't receive any stress as such  but the remaining syllable one of them does receive a primary stress  the second category or the second division of words that is multi syllabic words with prefixes there uh this prefixes receive primary stress and secondary stress falls on some other  uh syllable  and the third division is uh where the prefix receive the secondary stress  and the primary stress again falls on some other syllable you know so the third type there is a variant the prefix receive the primary stress you know it emerges as a pattern in the speech of educated indian english speech a speakers you know  and here this pattern it comes out or it can be regarded as  or the particular stress pattern used by educated indian english speakers so this is the analysis so naturally the conclusions drawn  conclusions reached at so as far as duration is concerned  so the study says uh this distinction between short and long it is there  the one reason why it is not very dominant or dominantly  one word at the level of again we can say listening  and the one reason is it is uh due to the mother tongue or it is due to uh the way we speak english because whenever the speech tempo goes up or it increases so our habit that is the marathi speakers or even indians you know they pronounced most of the words equally bold  and because of this you know when the tempo increases or goes up all the segments including vocalic and again we can say consonants they get compressed  and because of this this vocalic parts or the vocalic segments you know and their duration it is not felt very much  but in other languages where weak form feature exists  over there when uh this tempo increases or it again we can say  the speaker speeds up himself then he counters these weak forms  but he does not uh or his vocalic uh parts of the vocalic segments and particularly stress are stretched stressed uh  you see vowels they are not affected to that extent  and so their duration remains uh rather unaffected you know on the other hand these vowels that receive primary stress  they are affected as far as duration is concerned  uh the next is uh a dipthong this area and here the conclusions  the problem dipthong taken up for the study so it is said that it is true that these all the three dipthongs most of the time they are pronounced as pure vowels and not as dipthongs  there are news reader or some news reader who do pronounce dipthongs as dipthongs but their number is very low  and since it is very low you know and again the f two transition that is not very much felt  so this percentage which is upto fifteen percent or twenty percent you know so it can't have the central place in the conclusion  and the third is the stress  so according to me the stress the secondary stress or the primary stress and the tertiary stress  the tertiary stress this feature is not at all found in  educated indian english speech  and the secondary stress and the primary stress there is a  again a kind of confusion but some pattern does emerge  whenever it is a multisyllabic word and that too again you know   which a which is which has the prefix  so another category of words which is not multisyllable  most of the time but which has the functional stress in it  so the words with a functional stress so the same word  with a same one word shape which is used either or not or a verb you know so they receive a stress at different places when they change their grammatical categories  so over here all the news reader that is educated indian english speakers you know they very well maintained this distinction such as now two words and so on  here you know they emerges again we can say very successful speakers of educated indian english speech 
so the last meeting which perhaps was the first  special meeting requisition was held on nineteenth april nineteen ninety-four at three pm in the physics auditorium to discuss  non issuance of convocation invitations to non one word  teachers of this university  in the meeting after the relevant documents were presented  and after much of discussion about the issue involved it was resolved

uposhan to be staged in front of his office in april nineteen ninety-four  so these were the resolutions adopted in the previous general body meeting  and we have already uh men mentioned  the resolution adopted in the last general body meeting that is special general body meeting  i hope the members approve  now about the secretaries report  after this report uh relates to the period after the previous general body meeting  uh about teachers problems which are pending so far we'll  come to that issue at a later stage  but what has been done during this intervening period i think can be stated in a very brief manner in the following words  the president the secretary and the member of the executive council of supta attended national executive council meeting of a i one word on eighth march nineteen ninety-four in delhi  at the same time they participated in a morcha  and dharna organised by the one word  where the major demands were number one pay revision that is appointment of a panel for pay revision  number two uh earlier demands which have been pending for a long time with the u g c and the government of india regarding inclusion of uh teaching experience as demonstrators and tutors in the total length of service for placement purposes  number three promotion of readers to professors in the universities and uh some minor things  but these were the three important major demands uh which were presented by the one word morcha on the parliament  and i am very happy to uh report that uh subsequently  immediately at the same time uh the minister for human resources development was very generous enough to invite a select uh you know group of people representing one word  they had a discussion  subsequently the u g c chairman also invited a larger contingent  uh for discussion where again most of the pending problems of the teachers were discussed  and uh as you might all be knowing recently uh the most important demand that is appointment of a pay panel uh has been considered by the u g c and uh a committee for pay revision of college and university teachers has been appointed uh under the chairmanship of professor rastogi  uh as a result of which incidently the thirty-first uh july  uh sorry august demonstrations were cancelled by one word   subsequent to that uh of course in a very casual manner i would say i will have to uh recall to you the two days  where perhaps for the first time supta organised some cultural activities after a long gap  uh one was that uh article show by uh laxman deshpande  from marathwada and another by vishubai bapat uh kutumba  rangale kavyat  then uh comes the mention regarding the efforts made by  supta with the authorities of the university for installing or instituting rather a prize for a good teacher every year to be awarded on the day of the university foundation  incidently the whole affair began with the announcement by the authorities that a prize of this nature will be instituted for only non-teaching employees of the university  not only that uh the sons and daughters and ward of non-teaching employees of the university they were to be given some prizes for their excellent performances in the various examination  when that circular uh was raised by some of the office bearers of supta we immediately rushed to the university authorities discussed the matter with them and then subsequently a written demand was placed that the teachers are also employees of the university and they also must be considered for this kind of treatment and fortunately in the subsequent executive council meetings of the university the demand of the teachers was considered and i hope on the first uh that is coming eighteenth november nineteen ninety-four first of such awards will be issued uh awarded  and uh let us hope uh some of you is going to bag that award then this womens' well  women's cell committee conducted two meeting  a report has been prepared by that committee  the report will be presented to the body subsequently  then as you all remember we organised a discussion on the  maharashtra universities act nineteen ninety-four  we have also submitted a demand to the university authorities regarding uh issue of laminated i-cards  uh they have been issued to the non-teaching employees and again we were perhaps forgotten  and only after we approached the authorities and uh brought it to their notice that they have agreed in principle that similar laminated i-cards will be issued to the teachers also  then we have submitted another representation to the university authorities regarding uh some particular problems of the  adult and continuing education department number one and one word  their problems relate mainly to some cofusion regarding new facilities whether these people that is academic non-vacational employees of the university  they are entitled to some kind of earned leave in lieu  of the period for which they work during vacation  that kind of a demand has been placed and uh enquiries are being made with the u g c as well as the state government  recently just three days back uh according to the suggestion made in the meeting of the supta members  very recently held to discuss maharashtra universities act nineteen ninety-four   the some very important deficiencies in the act were discussed at that time and it was suggested that a committee be constituted uh tandurkar myself uh mr kalme  uh we were supposed to prepare a draft  i had been keeping in touch with these people  making request again and again  uh may be because of their other preoccupations they were not in a position to submit their uh notes or comments to me  ultimately i had to prepare my own uh note and i have sent a note to the government of maharashtra uh more particularly to the secretary uh department of law  uh of course if you want the contents of the letter i can read them out  of course this is a very important uh aspects of that act  so everybody should be aware of that uh reads the letter  to honourable pratima one word secretary law and judiciary department government of maharashtra mantralaya bombay  maharashtra universities act nineteen ninety-four that is the subject  madam uh at the unanimous suggestion of the members of  supta i in the capacity of secretary seek your permission to submit following modifications for your kind consideration and necessary action under section one one six of the act maharashtra act number thirty-five of nineteen ninety-four  number one uh section twelve one a i should be deleted  as it will lead to awkward situations in the actual working of the university  because secretary higher education and technical education  becomes ex-officio member of management council of the university  it would be more appropriate to allow the senate of the university to nominate this person  i hope you remember that in the selection committee for the  vice-chancellor's posting the new act provides for a committee of five persons one nominee of the academic council the other nominee of the management council the third would be the nominee of the univesity grants commission the fourth is the secretary in-charge of higher and technical education and the fifth is the nominee of the govern uh governor  uh very interestingly the position of the secretary for higher and technical education is secondary to the position of a vice-chancellor and in the actual conduct or operation of this particular act the secretary will be a member of the selection committee and subsequently he will come to the executive council of this university and be a member of the management council under the chairmanship of the the same vice-chancellor whom he appoints  so both for him and for the vice-chancellor perhaps the things would be very awkward and everybody has agreed to this even uh in a recently conducted meeting of supta uh sorry  suta this point was raised and they have also  agreed that something will have to be done regarding this particular point  uh let me clarify u g c has to nominate one member  the academic council of the state university will have to nominate another member  the management council of the same university nominated one more member the governor also has nominated the third fourth member that is one uh mr b g deshmukh the chairman of the rest of maharashtra  what you call vaidhanik vikas mandal or something like that  and uh the secretary in-charge of higher and technical education is not to be nominated  he is automatically by his position a member of the selection committee ex- official

issue but normally in some institutions what they do they go page by page  page number one page number two any suggestions ? page number three page number four five six  seven eight nine ten eleven twelve thirteen  fourteen fifteen sixteen seventeen eighteen  nineteen twenty twenty-one twenty-two twenty-three  twenty-four twenty-five twenty-six twenty-seven  twenty-eight twenty-nine thirty thirty-one  thirty-two page thirty-three thirty-four thirty-five  thirty-six thirty-seven anybody wants any clarification please come  yeah interruption  let me tell you   one word donation of one word  anybody giving donation we are giving receipt that's  the one thing   a few words  no let me make it very clear  we are not taking any donation from the parents for admission of the children to the school  we are taking the donation from anybody parents  students well wishers uh connected unconnected anybody  whenever we take any donation we issue the receipt   one or two words  every donor is given a receipt  see we continously collect uh donations irrespective of their status  and then we issue the receipts  now uh we have uh always tried to maintain cordial relations with the parents and uh often uh our english medium parents they are more alert and active than uh the parents of the kannada school because they come from the economically higher strata in the society  and uh they are also often give us suggestions and ideas to improve the working of the school  and we always accept their suggestions if they are uh uh academically sound and financially feasible to implement uh these ideas and suggestions  now sometime of course the uh the parents may say that we need  uh more time for childrens to play and uh badminton court and such suggestions are also made  but they are not within uh uh you see our abilities for the time being but the point is that we too uh meet and we had recently about uh three we weeks   back in the month of november we had a meeting uh of the junior uh k g k g section and primary and subsequently after a week on the twenty uh seventh of november we had a meeting with the uh parents of english secondary school  uh we have tried in the past six years though not this year  to have a meeting of the parents of kannada uh teach kannada school but uh response has been very limited and therefore we didn't try but next year we will also have the meeting uh of the kannada parents  now mr chairman i had received a letter addressed by keshavrao of fourteen points  this is within his right because he is a member he is a member and we had printed if you have any question on report you should raise it in writing three days before he has sent the letter and i had prepared the answers but he is not uh present   i'll ask the secretary to hurriedly uh uh mean inform the members what were the questions and we may give the reply that is understood  now he had pointed out uh two mistakes in the report and uh these mistakes are uh accepted that uh  printed mistake printers mistake  the notice says nineteen ninety two ninety-four  it should be read as uh ninety-three ninety-four   two   ninety-three  budget and uh wherever we are told appears in the   i'm sorry wherever english school appears it should be read as  b r one word english high school we've not mentioned some places b r one word he wanted us to be specific  and uh he wanted to know why there are only three uh school committee meetings uh from uh in the english medium while there are six school committee meetings in kannada medium  my reply to that is uh initiative to call the meetings entirely lies with the headmistress head mistresses of the respective school and uh possibly the h m of english school has uh uh felt that uh many meetings were not required however we've already told the h m of english medium school to call the meetings more often   headmistress  then uh there were suggestions to hold the continous uh meetings of the school committee on the same day so that there will be equal uh number of uh meetings  uh my reply to that is that it is not possible because  the most of the members of the committee from the management side are honorary and they can't spend uh three four hours at a stretch in the school  so meetings have to be on different uh days  then there was a question why there is a separate uh uh   head ma head mistress for english primary  and why there is no separate head mistress for uh kannada primary my reply to that uh uh as you know kannada primary has a very small strength and english primary has more than four hundred  under the rules we cannot have uh separate head mistress for uh  kannada primary and therefore kannada primary is looked after by the  secondary head mas head mistress without any extra remuneration  he has also asked why uh junior college uh is also looked after by the head mistress of kannada high school  answer to that is very simple that uh the junior college is the extension of the kannada high school and under the rules we cannot appoint a separate person to the junior college the head mistresses had to look after that also and under the rule she is uh given by the government not by the management uh an additional honorarium of hundred  rupees which she has been getting  now he wanted to know how often the various sub- committees are met uh my answer to that is maintenance committee has  meant uh met number of times to maintain the building  health committee ha has  attended to all the health problems arising in the schools  they uh fund raising committee has raised the funds uh in the last six years at different times  and therefore the sub-committees are doing uh their functions properly  uh how many life members were enrolled that is uh the question  the report is very clear that we have not mentioned any life member because we have uh stopped enrolling life members since nineteen seventy-four  and that is uh reason why we've brought the amendments in the extra ordinary general uh meeting  now he wanted to know uh the forty-seven children studying in kannada uh studying kannada in english medium school whether they are outsiders or uh insiders they are our own children studying in kannada in english medium but because their parents are from karnatak they want kannada to be taught and we've made voluntary provision for teaching of uh kannada in the english medium school there is no compulsion  similarly we've also uh introduced uh on a voluntary basis computer education for which uh separate fees are charged  and uh this is provided by on a voluntary basis uh they pay and  one word automation company is providing the education and therefore the mandal is not directly involved in the  uh uh computer education except providing room for computers to be placed 
for the introduction very kind of you  a lot of work has uh gone on for long distance and particularly uh  as we noticed in the infield area but uh there is a a little scope left for improvement in the outfield because that wasn't quite uh a part of football occasion uhm the toss  not immediately clear who won but uh the two captains mohammad azharuddin leading the indian eleven and amir malik  the wicket keeper one of the few experienced boys in the pakistani eleven  yeah   it's unfortunate that we haven't uh had the pleasure of the to be say final of the pakistan eleven  for this match  but there are a number of other matches coming in india and of course in sharjah later so that uh a lot of people are keeping things in reserve can't blame them for that  this after all is primarily a benefit one-day match and the two beneficiaries former ranjit trophy stars from hyderabad  jyotiprasad and habib khan for whom of course this must be a very big occasion ravi yeah  true there is a lot of very good cricket coming up in sharjah back in india and of course down under for a few month  the indian eleven led by mohammad azharuddin ravi shastri shrikant will be seen back dilip vengasarkar kapil dev who  has  such a scintillating performance in the past five days everybody must be looking forward to see him perform again  manjrekar and tendulkar the dynamic duo from maharashtra manoj prabhakar kirmani is back but unfortunately he doesn't find a place in the indian twenty-two announced yesterday arshad ayub and venkatpathi raju providing the local  flavour  and one of the many fine buildings hyderabad can be proud of legislative assembly  so we would be seeing it during the match very often  but here is the pakistani eleven led by amir malik  wi wicket keeper jahur ilahi young brother of mansur  mansur rana who happened to be the son of shakur rana one of the leading umpires of pakistan shahid saeed gafar kazmi mansur ilahi another very experienced player suheil fazal javed hayat zakir khan and tanvir mehadi will wear the brunt of the medium pace bowling and  sajjad  akbar  the drop man mujahir jamshid who did very well in the under nineteen sometime ago  there was some delay in knowing the exact uh content of the pakistan eleven but we are glad that all the players are now here though some of them have arrived very late but uh of course cricket loving public of hyderabad and of india in general are glad that uh the full contingent has arrived in time  mansur ilahi getting a liitle bit of batting in  and uh near at the v i p stand  a lot of hard work has gone in to make sure that this match was held  ravi i believe mohammad azharuddin won the toss and has elected to field  so we will see some pakistani batting first  mansur ilahi would be looking forward to give another scintillating display  i remember couple of performances in the middle east where he did  uh exceedingly well some years ago  but uhm thereafter i think he has been sort of in and out really  yeah  so he is a very explosive batsman and a very useful medium pacer because i think one day cricket has given rise to uh  to uh an increasing number of alrounders where if you fail with one  then you can certainly try and uh get into the limelight with the other  charu i think i hear a section of the crowd still picking up actually still early in the day but thats by mid-day we do hope to see a a stadium  full  here are the two umpires doing duty for the match  ramaswamy nearer us and behind him shivram  the capacity of the stadium is around uh twenty-five thousand ordinarily but i think it has been uh bolstered a bit by uh additional stand  so yes we do have a full house we can expect upto thirty-five thousand people  both the teams were earlier introduced to the chief minister with the chief guest mr n janardan reddy a very staunch supporter of sports  and in his uh tenure already we had some very major events in hyderabad particularly as you were mentioning earlier ravi the pre- olympic football tournament two months ago  and as you had mentioned the stadium received a complete  face-lift  and the facility is added particularly for the players and uh  others nearer the pavilion are now almost world class which is very good for any venue really  true and being from hyderabad i can only add that the a p government has left no stone unturned to make sure that uh the finest possible facilities uh have been incorporated into the stadium  which had been languishing for a number of years i think it was uh a basically in the year nineteen sixty-one or thereabout  and since then not much had been done so the pre-olympic football was a big boon for sportslover in hyderabad  see because unfortunately although we have the benefit of this beautiful breeze that you just mentioned i think uh further down in the ground it may not be uh particularly heavy at this point of time so it would be very hard through the day and october is uhm not the coldest month in hyderabad  it can get awfully hot but if the cloud cover does take up bit during the day then in fact in the later half we will get better playing conditions  true to remind you once again this will be a forty-five over a side match  the timings are uh well nine thirty really but i guess  it's about to begin  there will be a forty-five minute lunch break and the match will resume at one fifteen till the end of play  the indian team taking the field arshad ayub at front  led of course by the captain azharuddin who had a very successful season  for derbyshire in the english county cricket league  most of the summer no he is a batsman for all seasons i don't think there is any search of any occasion were uh  the batting being open for pakistan by their captain amir malik also very useful opener and to his right in the green cap  a county cricket cap jahur ilahi who is mansur's younger brother  and to remain in contention for the match fourteen  at this age is really a very fitting tribute to his uh  physical prowess  and of course his speed and effective diving behind the wicket but  like i mentioned earlier its a trifle disappointing in one way to not see him in the twenty-two probable announced yesterday  uhm and i am sure he must be very disappointed particularly  the selection is is not an easy job at any time and i am sure the selectors must know what they are doing  meri khyal hai  i think kirmani is at an age almost where he might qualify as a selector   jee haan  jahur ilahi all set  he will be the non-striker  and to open the innings jahur amir amir malik beg your pardon who is also the captain and to open the indian bowling manoj prabhakar  only one slip to begin with dilip vengasarkar  slightly dangerous way to begin that edge carrying  quite safely the second slip which of course didn't exist  the ball stopped at the boundary by kanwaljit singh who is also now a hyderabad ranji regular  and two runs to amir  manoj prabhakar seeing the necessity of the second slip  brings one on  there we have kirmani behind the stumps  vengasarkar as uh first slip venkatpathy raju being brought in as a second slip  arshad ayub seen here with manoj prabhakar ayub is at mid off   that's a nice ball  a very useful swing bowler manoj prabhakar particularly proving himself in pakistan sometime ago  and a very good run  another out swinger all four yes swinging out  ravi if i am not mistaken i think uh uh manoj's  important weapon is his inswinger which he swing by a yard on occasions uh in keeping that in a bit of check right now  it has been  yes like on that occasion  wide of the crease a little faster action and quite a classic inswinger  of course that one didn't swing too much  that is record twenty-eight years old not a young been taken any more  debut way back eight years ago  end of a useful over  a quiet beginning two run from the board for the pakistan eleven  the two men in for pakistan amir malik their captain and wicket keeper and jahur ilahi the younger brother of mansur  who will now take strike against kapil dev  i think the media has been full of praise for kapil  dev's  uh incredible performance in the irani trophy  of course it is uh a team game so the whole team should get the credit but kapil dev is bringing out yet another magnificient performance with the ball and with the bat  ravi were you there in faridabad when this was going on  yes same as old and a hundred and seventy-five brilliant runs uh way back in the world cup  zimbabwe unnees sau triyasi  true and we were   jab bharat ne vishwa cup jeeta   we have got some very low score for five when he went in  resolute thirty or some such thing quite an incredible fight like that five for forty-three is his best bowling performance  thirteen years of international cricket  now that is a very loose loose enough way down the leg side  but even kapil dev uh can have situations like that kirmani i think caught by surprise having to try way to his left  just about collected the ball  so a wide one more to the pakistani eleven  i think the laces may be to blame them tying them again and kanwaljit singh an offspinner for the hyderabadi ranji squad  for kapil dev also two slip  dilip vengasarkar maintaining first slip position and  captain azharuddin at the second  i think that one was not a milimetre away from the central stump because played well forward so no danger  in the second over the pakistani eleven three for no loss back foot into the covers shrikant  jahur ilahi opens his account with a break  manoj at third man gives only a single and that brings amir malik onto the strike  amir malik on two jahur ilahi on two one wide  and the total five  i beg your pardon jahur ilahi has three to his credit  a bit of lift on that ball and amir seeing it well in time let it go through  and kapil dev too sort of angling through his first over  two slip another young hyderabadi doing some duty for the fielding side noel david is now brought in at third place  little change in the fielding shrikant moved to point man in the covers kanwaljit singh mid on  down the leg side and kapil completes his first over  gentle nothing spectacular especially one as a who in one is a battle squad thirty-two  yeah  the field for manoj prabhakar two slip four men on the off side third man point cover and mid off and three men on the on mid on mid wicket and fine leg  oh gone for four  i think jahur played inside the line expecting may be uh uh a bigger swing but the ball pass straightning up the just a bit and catching the off stump  jahur ilahi the first casualty for pakistan and ravi here it is again   in hindi  its here in the loudspeaker on here somewhere laughter but a very good ball  and uh jahur ilahi i think more just beaten by the pace  very quick ball  next man in mansur rana  its right up mansur gets the thirty-sixth outside edge i don't think that was plan to go but it did  i beg your pardon that's a gaffar kazmi we had mansur rana in our list  so that is gaffar kazmi now at the non-striker end  having got in a single off the first ball he played  amir malik minor change in field placing venkatpathy raju being brought in at third slip  that well guided kanwaljit is third man and amir gets single   that's a real inswinger but uh way out way down the leg side so not much scope for damage there  but the kind of the the amount of swing that we were talking about earlier i mean he quite did it  slightly unusual in one day cricket we have three slips  uh that's a crackling drive of the front foot through the covers four runs  we will have to beg your pardon one more time that is the pakistani paceman zakir khan in the green cap on the left now credited with that for now uh you will have to excuse us the pakistanis did come in at a very late stage and this is not exactly their regular eleven  but as the match goes on i am sure uh we will all be far more comfortable about players  twelve for one at the completion of three overs  kapil dev coming in again  for him now two slip  noel david back at point little point  amir malik  malik picks the quick single inspite noel david rushing in still early in the inning so thats some good understanding and good running  thats noel david youngster now becoming a teacher in the hyderabad ranji team  azharuddin lot of responsibility in his shoulders  on his shoulders in the coming months so far uh declared captain for the sharjah and the india pak one day series to be held in india  later in uh when does it begin now november isn't it ? yeah  zakir khan carefully to midoff and i think zakir will get uh to his own stuff when they go into ball  one heard a lot about him in in in  uh for the year having gone by but uh he hasn't really become a regular feature of the pakistani squad so far   iska matlab imran khan wasim akram salim jafar waqur yunus   waqur yunus  waqur yunus  lot of despair  aquib javed  true a run from fine leg  ayub doing fielding  arshad incidently has done a lot of organisational work in this match  yeah  i think some credit that this match is being held must go to arshad  in and out of the indian team for the past few years unfortunately  particularly for his uh region or fans in hyderabad out good work by kirmani diving way to his right  picked up the ball from the front of uh  first slip first slip and amir malik trudging back to the pavilion the second wicket down for the pakistani eleven with just about what's the score now ? fourteen fourteen runs on the board 
a very good afternoon to all our viewers from us here at the karnatak state billiards association match for  the last and final session of the world under twenty-one  snooker championship is about to commence  and the man you see on your screens is ronie o'salavan of england fifteen year old who has established a dominating nine frames to four uhm lead in this finals   it's the best of twenty-one so he has to win just two more frames to win the world under twenty-one  snoo snooker crown  his opponent who you see on your screen now is patrick yelston of belgium sixteen years old who is has  uh amazed everyone with his tremendous sporting ability and is  is in happy temperament  ronie salavan on the first session of this match which was held yesterday just managed to get into a four frame to three lead  but this morning in the second session of the match he was virtually unstoppable winning four out of the five frames that   was was were played  and the centre piece of this morning session was a marvellous break of a hundred and thirty-one total clearance except for the black uh that what you saw that was a mis clue for ronie  o'salavan  and uh he is uhm it's it's a bit  it's a bit humid out there although the air conditioning is on in the hall  it's a bit humid and possibly uh that was the  reason for that mis cue  now let's see here  his opponent does well his opponent hasn't done much in fact  he's left the red hanging over the corner pockets the left corner pocket on your screen  the black is clear so if salavan can put this with a ton of stunt which he has done  he can set himself up for a useful opening break   there's a contrast in styles between these two players with o'salavan uhm certainly i would say the more gifted of the two also being the more thoughtful of the two and i think that that is the right approach  snooker is not a game which you can really uh play with any degree of carelessness  you can play of course but you have to be careful and i think this is the difference between ronie salavan and his belgium opponent  certain loose reds open  and uh o'salavan can take a heavy toll of his  opponent's careless safety shot cough  wondering if there is plant on after us black which is going to salavan  a plant is a shot where you pick the first rid hit it on to the second rid and make second rid travel into the pocket   it's a charge  that was a beautiful shot applause  he brought out the pink and he has now sink it in the centre pocket and come back towards this end of the table  and position for any of the open rids on the right hand  right hand side of the screen that is the one he's come for now is next to the pink spot  from where we are seating in the commentators box it seems as if that red his might not be free or yes it is   it is free only it doesn't look like from this angle and here's his chance to put the blue and turn it into the cluster of edge to open them up   that's not exactly what he had intended  but i think may be useful forty-five break perhaps he will now opt for a safe shot  sending the ball towards the bob cushion applause  so that's got to ronie salavan with a good break of forty-five  nothing to play except safer   it's the one word shot extraordinary and lovely hand between if the ball has enough run in it  uhm that's the kind of thing that yelston who want to avoid if he has any hope of getting back into this match  cannot afford to play careless shots and open up the edge to an opponents who's playing in a good form  will you agree with that arvind ? definitely but at the moment the way he has played that rid it might have been a shot to nothing shot whether he  took a wild swing he has gone back to the bottom of the table  so he may not have just a intellect to pot it  he might have intended to pot it as well as end up towards the bottom because the ball had sufficient run in it  anyway a shot that is being played now by salavan leaves him a red which is reasonably easy for his potting skill  and now this will show whether the young man is going for his  game or whether he's going to be play playing  kg  he can pot to brown in the corner pocket or snooker in behind the brown   he's slumped didn't had a good follower  he knows that though his opponent has got forty points ahead and may be he can possibly make up his by sneaking  well few points   well  that was a very good shot  but  his intention in that particular shot was to play it with a lot of left hand spin to take the ball off the cushion closer to the blue so that the blue could be potted in the centre pocket  but he hit it so hard that the spin didn't really have time to react  anyway he did a marvellous job in that uh clean pot on the blue ball  he just landed it in into the bottom pocket  he is attempting a similar shot now in the corner pocket now  may be worry of uh his waist coat or his sleeve touching the yellow he played that in very much of hurry and missed it  and that's the first decent uh opening  salvan has really left this shot with that careless shot for he should have easily potted that rid  uh now the bel belgium  player definitely should level scores or go further because all the reds are in a position that he can manoveur them open  and he has opened out one red comfortably except that he has to play it with the rest because he might not be able to reach it being a left hander  there again he went to playing with the rest with his right hand instead of now the normal left hand that he uses to play his uh  a inactive pots  going for the pink ball clean as a whistle follows without those two reds  now left on with the red in the centre  very well done  perfectly in position for the pink  a soft stunt loosen the a red into the corner  perfectly in position for the black  and this is uh said for certain viewers viewing this game  on your black and white screens  a frame which should have uh for all practical purposes  gone to ronie salavan is now coming back towards the belgium  player   there's no place for the black ball to be spotted on his own spot the red is occupying the black spots uh blacks' area  and as such is been the black still spotted on the yellow spot now beautiful shot there and he is right in possession for that ball applause  break of thirty-five which puts him five points ahead of uh   ronie's score  uh ah applause beautiful shot he played well for remaining position for the blue  he might even attempt the black because he got the angle to come up comfortably  that was a very hard shot that he played on the black but the ball didn't really travel as much as he wanted to   he's done a damn good practice of play that  damn good shot on that actually he could have uh this was a careless shot because he couldn't reach and he played a haphazard shot   it's a pity that after that i think that that he should have played this shot over reaching with the rest and giving salavan a chance to uh get back straight away  of course as you can see the yellow is tied against the  cushion the bob cushion  and uh it will require some effort to to pot it in position uh correctly for the green  well i think salavan has done quite well to get where he is and he can stun it off the bob cushion  and i'm sure that yelston must be kicking himself right there because he could have wrapped up this frame if he had just taken a few seconds more over that safety shot  now this is a crunch ball the green he can get this  it has come a little too much for salavan has to use the wrist  one point behind  yes indeed applause  ronie salavan has tasted blood and he wants to get this match over as quickly as possible  so he's now gone into the lead by three points  he needs the blue and the pink to wrap up the frame  oh that's it applause before two frames of the match and the first frame of the last session has gone o'salavans'  way  he's now just one frame away from winning the under twenty-one world snooker championship  and uh there you see yelston with his left hand over his eyes  i'm sure he's rueing that rather dreadful safety shot  uh looking a bit dejected but that's only to be expected if he had to have any sort of chance of getting back into this match it was important for him to win this first frame and he certainly had an outstanding opportunity of doing so that as we said before  that hasty shot cost him the frame  well he is off some of the yes and now beautiful first our view of the whole arena very handsome arena  the karnataka state billiards association is very fortunate in having its own premises and having such a wonderful match room  where the scores of the famous that's been played in the final  first sessions score as you can see on the board  thirty-nine sixty-two loosing the first frame and uh  subsequently twenty-four seventy three  the scores actually are the other way round  uh some of them have gone  yes there's the scores are quite right because it was  no the scores yeah you are right you are right  first two frames were taken by yelston   yesterday's score   yesterday's score  not todays' first sessions' but  yesterday's and then it was uh salavan who got that got the  yelston has just broken up for the fifteenth frame of the match and should he loose this of course young ronie fifteen year old ronie o'salavan will be the nineteen ninety-one world under twenty-one snooker champion  feels extremely the pity but uh there is an applause that brilliant shot on the last but one red  fouled uh spoiled his safety shot and what could have been very interesting match is now going to be possibly  salavans uh very easy manner now that the fight is obviously out of yelston applause  he has tied our equation and and it is great but as such no doubt about it  now let's see what what he does i mean he is quite remarkable this man  for his adolescent as i should call him being sixteen years old  sixteen years of age  looking for the plant and trying to slam it now this was the shot which uh if played a little carefully could have uh brought him back very much into the game  but the way he is has burst the back he's still not run left ronie a little easy on this  he's lost the black alright and if ronie goes for this last set of the screen on your left hand side as you see or the  one level black spot the second one   that's the one i mean and he's got it well if he gets that now that he's got this a colour  bringing him back up the table will probably put that to any sort of a challenge that the belgian might have had in mind  with all those reds spread out on the table it looks like a christmas tree and uh here o'salavan his now in a in a difficult position because he's right on the cushion and  he's attempting a slice which he has got in fact and uh  this must be uh well  two words  so not much damage done uh from yelston's point of view uh as a result of that wide slash that he took at the red  applause  round of applause for getting himself out of that self imposed snooker  ronie o'salavan five patrick yelston six  and as i said before o'salavan needing just this frame to win the title  now well planned safety shot but he got the edge on that rid still didn't uh remain in the centre area  however the long pot was won and it was played well by  patrick yelston  this is again an opening from which the belgian can make  a good number of points that depends whether he can muster up all the guts that are required to face a situation like this  provided he doesn't get a rush of blood to the head and do something silly  you know it's uh is quite possible because  you've seen him break down on the easiest of shots  this is the longest that he has take  taken to plan a break if you noticed mike  yes same stroke that strike me i must confess  first time we've seen him thinking so much  uh this is just just he stress at that  actually what happens when a person is a very fast player  tries to think and play a slow game  his reflexes are fast his uh brain muscle coordination is fantastic and uh he doesn't have the ability to cope to the slower situation that he has to at times plan and do  so the score is patrick yelston twenty-two ronie  o'salavan five with with this break in hand  and it certainly could be by the looks of it uhm a winning situation  all the reds are spread out fairly easily fairly comfortably and  just needs to keep his cool and the rest will fall on place brushing some of the dust away from the area of the pink  must have felt that there is something which might obstruct the few balls around  the following up for the black off a cushion black ball on the spot comfortably to go round off a cushion 
 in hindi  bidhan nagar in attack  to sanjoy mitra sanjoy das the captain is looking at the box but referee waves play on  bidhan nagar playing the three mid field players three forwards  and five defenders  sports college lucknow attacking to veer bahadur thapa  now it's rajan kumar kuldeep left footer  comfortably collected by vimal das the bidhan nagar goal keeper  sports college lucknow trailing zero one in this subrato mukherjee cup final  and the substitution being made by bidhan nagar vimal  no it is raja chatterjee who's coming on  raja chatterjee the number thirteen who'll come on and coming out is the number twelve that is santosh gupta  so raja chatterjee will come in in the next back position  bidhan nagar in attack  once again to sanjoy das the skipper  this is in the second half bidhan nagar leading their opponent sports college lucknow one nil in the nineteen nineteen   ninety- one final  bidhan nagar has lost three nil to sports college lucknow  so if bidhan nagar win today it will be their first ever win in the subrato cup  and as their coach surjit kumar ghosh said it will be sweet revenge for the defeat in nineteen ninety-one when they lost zero three to sports college lucknow  referee joji awards foul  bidhan nagar player pulled up for stamping and a free kick to sports college lucknow which they will take just near the centre line  long high free kick but not much danger comfortably collected by vimal das the goalkeeper as he collect it  bidhan nagar in attack through sanjoy das their skipper a good through pass but it's clear for a corner  corner kick will be taken from the far right  some clearance and the ball goes into touch  now sports college lucknow hemchandra joshi throwing the ball but losing out again  bidhan nagar skipper sanjoy das trying to build up an attack  for the off side  so bidhan nagar still clinging on to that one nil lead and if they maintained this lead they will have achieved their ambition of bringing the subrato cup they have been pass getting the subrato cup since nineteen ninety semi-finalist in nineteen ninety semi-finalist again in ninety-nine in ninteen ninety-two and runners up in nineteen ninety-one  but they have yet to win the tournament  aimless football even this early part of the second half  bidhan nagar have the distinction of having reach the final without having conceded a goal  in their league matches they won ten nil thirteen nil and then were held cold by one word shillong in the quarter final they won one nil and in the semi- final they beat the school from ranchi three nil  sports college lucknow from the near right but well cleared by bidhan nagar raja chatterjee  long clearance this could be dangerous a chance by sports college lucknow mid fielder lalit singh takes a very weak try  mid field action not much constructed football and referee joji giving awarding a foul to bidhan nagar because  one of sports college lucknow player obstructed bidhan nagar defender  so it's a long clearance bidhan nagar in attack  from the near left through raja chatterjee the overlapping left back  a long left footer but the ball goes obviously wide  manoj singh long high goal kick but the ball goes into touch on the near right  still bidhan nagar one sports college lucknow nil and kamal ghosh the prolofic scorer for bidhan nagar scored this goal  now raja chatterjee with the ball dribbles well attempted to pass but mis direction  suddenly bidhan nagar seem to have become a bit hasty as time is running out they are getting anxious to hold on to this lead which could be long tactics because the break away move sports college lucknow could equalise  the ball is not of a very high quality  both teams tense and anxious  now this arbind mhatra who's cleared the ball out of danger for bidhan nagar  see bidhan nagar players lying on the ground as a results of these  tussles of the ball  and referee joji calls up for medical assistance and there will be a slight hold up  bidhan nagar high school from fourth lane in calcutta adopted by the sports authorities of india our leading sports college lucknow by one nil both these teams met in the finals in nineteen ninety-one  the sports college lucknow won rather emphatic win three nil  but this time bidhan nagar has have the initiative  they have been the more dominating team but they are not really being able to translate their dominance into goal  approach plays good but near the goal hasty passes  leads to impossession in attack and break up of the attack  so it is bidhan nagar shonkar das receiving assistance  medical attendant near the goal line near the goal and play will resume referee joji insist goal keeper goes to see him and there will be long goal keep goal kick  by parmanand karmakar  shankor das also leaps back onto the field  now bidhan nagar in attack this could be dangerous but komal ghosh looked as he trys to touch the ball  and on the break for sports college lucknow is there  number twelve salim javed salim javed to veer bahudar thapa  and a long aimless kick which sails over the bar  lalit rathod and veer bahadur thapa were the main striker for sports college lucknow on their way to the final  but they have made very little impact against the tight marking bidhan nagar defence  now imad hussein the left winger attacking for sports college lucknow takes a good returned pass attempts across but  is unsuccessful  sports college lucknow trying to build up attack through from the left to imad hussein  and lalit rathod with the ball solo pass but it's  the referee pulls up this tackle by sanjoy das he accidently handle the ball while tackling and throw a free kick  from a reasonably dangerous position if they have a hard hitting striker sports college lucknow could utilise this free kick quite well  standing there is vishal prasad and lalit singh and let us see who takes it  lalit singh serving the free kick just goes over the bar  of course goal keeper vimal das has seen it well and so there was no danger  and referee waves ask for play to resume  bidhan nagar leading sports college lucknow by one goal to nil  sports college lucknow salim javed losing out to komal ghosh komal ghosh pulled up forward for the obstruction and so salim javed will take this free kick for sports college lucknow  a wasted free kick mis directed bidhan nagar also now playing study football just long clearances in inter space  just trying to wind time away  bidhan nagar leading sports college lucknow by one goal to nil komal ghosh being the scorer  raja chatterjee taking this throwing trying to get komal ghosh in action but it is the right back amit singh rawat who intercepts and place the ball into touch  yet another throwing for bidhan nagar  referee joji looking at his watch  bidhan nagar coming close to fulfilling their ambition good build up this but well foiled by surendar kumar  from the far side it is imad hussein building up an attack for sports college lucknow  the typical long pass but very well headed away by bidhan nagar parmanand karmakar  the long ball tactics of sports college lucknow not really  penetrating enough to upset the tight marking and bidhan nagar defence which intercepts very well both in the air and on the ground  habib and mondal now it could give neg  niyogi in the striker position  he steals a diagonal but displayed by shailendra kumar the poor shailendra kumar  and it is lalit rathod give the ball to veer bahadur thapa  dangerous striker  good ball controlled by veer bahadur thapa one word   takes the return pass   it's the rajan kumar moving up but again misdirected by one word bidhan nagar defender shankar das to make a long aimless clearance  this tactics could misfire because on a break away sports college lucknow could equalise  it would be very demoralising for bidhan nagar  in the beginning they stop playing constructive football the type of football they are capable of playing  and that is formed by sujeet niyogi strike and you will see yet another substitution  it's number seventeen sudeep majumdar who is coming on for bidhan nagar so they have used first one word on team substitution they can of course still change their goal keeper if they want according to latest sefa rule  and coming out is the number eight for bidhan nagar is  that is  and a down step sports college lucknow but number twelve salim javed shoot wide  so sudeep majumdar on the field the substitute to komal das komal ghosh from the left side  komal ghosh dribbles well and good ball control komal ghosh gives the fine smooth pass but it deflects for sports college lucknow defender and good recovery tackle  by their one word back surendra kumar which prevents danger bidhan nagar in attack but it's infringement and so sports college lucknow will get this free kick if they take from the near right long clearance from amit singh rawat  the ball with salim javed now with shailendra kumar with manoj singh long clearance to imdad hussein attempted long pass but which is misdirected  so bidhan nagar playing with four defenders three mid field players and three forwards  and leading sports college lucknow by one goal to nil sports college lucknow playing in the traditional four to four formation four defenders two mid field players and four forward  though one of their wingers just frequently fall back to help the forward line  bidhan nagar so far quite untroubled by sports college lucknow  it's long passing game and they can hold out unnecessary defence in one word  long pass trying to get veer bahadur thapa in action but the ball is too long to wangled for veer bahadur to even get near to it  veer bahadur thapa of course is the prolofic dangerous striker for sports college lucknow but he has not received the service to which he can do justice  shankar das getting ready with a long free kick goal kick but doesn't find an opponent komal ghosh going up for the ball losing out to stretched out komal ghosh sports college lucknow taller fitter but making a tight control with the bidhan nagar players there  now it's a good throw pass to komal ghosh  but it accidently handles the ball and there's a free kick to sports college lucknow  misdirected free kick raja chatterjee edge but it heller  goes straight to lalit rathod lalit rathod to veer bahadur thapa  who attempts the cross from the right but he doesn't reach  so one of the rare break away move sports college lucknow couldn't really spell any danger couldn't create any major danger  one more wrong high goal kick to the left side to find komal ghosh  but he is unable to attack  so one more aimless crappy football into aimless crappy football  and there will be a throwing being taken by amit singh rawat the right back  amit singh rawat right back trying to find lalit singh  who turns and shoot but promptly cleared by parmanand karmakar  amit singh rawat  now it is raja chatterjee pulled up for pushing salim javed from behind and so it's a foul  free kick which is being taken by lalit singh of sports college lucknow  free kick from the near right if taken accurately could create danger three sports college lucknow player up in the box but well cleared by shankar das  a chance here for sports college lucknow veer bahadur thapa has the ball  and now good shot by imdad a good shot by imad imdad hussein but which went wide gives the side one word  so this was the danger because what could happen bidhan nagar by being such a defensive and trying to lose out the ball and  on a break away move sports college lucknow nearly collide  now it is manoj singh on the far side  but an aimless clearance by manoj  arbind mhatra sending it to skipper sanjoy das who kicks it on to deepak mandol  deepak mandol controls it's a long clearance a chance now by sujeet niyogi top of the box but the ball goes to the goal keeper  bidhan nagar players resorting to long drives in this closing minutes  probably content on their one goal lead and trying to waste a little time by taking these long rangers they also hope to unsettle goal keeper abdus salam and try for a rebound komal ghosh is a very nippy forward as he is darting through here  on the left but it is amit singh rawat who gets there first and clear the ball into touch for a throwing to bidhan nagar  so these seems to be the tactic for bidhan nagar long passes  and now it is again komal ghosh but uh obstruction by the two bidhan nagar players amit singh rawat and throw foul which will be taken by amit singh rawat at right flank for sports college lucknow  goaler goaler in yellow shirts sports college lucknow  not being able to create any cohesive attack  now bidhan nagar developing an attack to sujeet niyogi sujeet niyogi a fine through pass from far right and on the far right it is deepak mandol getting control yes he dribbles but he is very crudely tackled and rightly gets a foul though one sense may be umpire joji could have given advantage because he had managed deepak mandol had managed to dribble  again chander joshi and the free kick now to bidhan nagar from the far right  a free kick uh sports college lucknow building up an attack from the near side it is to rajan kumar rajan kumar loses out the ball to lalit rathod lalit rathod in centre of the field  building up an attack with lalit singh back to lalit rathod a diagonal pass to the near right to veer bahadur thapa  this could be dangerous veer bahadur thapa moving up picking up pace dribble pass one against the form but he gets a free kick just outside the box if there had been a yard inside it could have been a penalty and could have spell danger  again the break away move causing danger to bidhan nagar  veer bahadur thapa certainly shows good subtle pulse and quick control  the most dangerous movement for sports college lucknow veer bahadur thapa picked himself up his credit being thinking of himself uh a wall being formed ten yards away this is an area with certainly a well directed free kick could lead to a goal  it's a direct free kick veer bahadur thapa is there  rajan kumar is there   let's see how sports college lucknow take this free kick veer bahadur thapa props up and this could be a goal  rajan kumar kicks in the rebound as goal keeper vimal das didn't collected very properly  a crowning free kick put vimal das in trouble he couldn't control it and off the rebound it was the nippy rajan kumar who darted in that goal with the low left footer  bidhan nagar defenders should be blamed with this because they didn't rush back sensing their goal keeper was in danger they should have rushed back to help him one hour now and the game could go to extra time  bidhan nagar school calcutta one sports college lucknow one now there will be greater sense of urgency in bidhan nagar's play now 
good afternoon  we have once again a very hot day here but much more still than it was yesterday  and let me start once again by welcoming my colleagues atul premnarayan rakesh sharma and our expert sumant mishra  atul are you going to sweat as you did yesterday watching the match or in the heat ? well we did all enjoy the kind of tennis ravi that we are going to watch as all the four players are going to battle out very very exciting doubles match after one all last evening  in fact the scoops of ice cream will be most popular and the scoops of delicious uh soft drinks round soft drinks let me first uh inform all the viewers who are with us today that there is some good news as far as india is concerned leander paes is fit and is back on the court he is going to partner ramesh krishnan in the crucial doubles tie  and uh with that uh good news with us i think  it's a good idea if we start with suman than lets see what he thinks this match is going to be like  well to begin with i noticed leander paes has got those  ankle fringe he is wearing when he went to australia so  lets come to the match of one word  i think it's this is a crucial match although i feel that they have played as with the same players  we have a better than fifty fifty chance winning both singles but they will both be tough matches so the doubles in any case is very crucial  this the koreans have seem they were good reputation  but they hadn't played i mean ramesh there makes a bit different because he he is one of those steady players which create the opening and leander has taken to finish them  in a good doubles team there is always one person who is very steady keeps getting everything opening the other finishing  you had the examples of john macandro and kan and peter flemming  flemming was a mm and so anyway so i think the players are topping up now at the side  rakesh you tell our viewers would like to hear in hindi what this doubles is going to be like ? well it's always a bit of psychological advantages uh you had a good victory behind you isn't it ? but on the other hand ramesh is an extremely experience player with a vast number of uh victories of all kind behind him  i think the most important point that we might like to watch today is how he combines with leander paes  uh i rather imagine that paes is going to take the forehand  court suman well i just got to mention this the way they standing the first round they played in jaipur about five weeks ago  ramesh took the right court  uh today i think they have decided so let us how this works out  i would have preferred ramesh taking the left court because in  the steady player always takes the left court  ramesh  also i think that uh we watched yesterday that this tendency of paes to block the backhand return uh can prove to be a bit of disadvantage in in doubles because it gives a lot of time for the opponent to  re recoup his uh stamina or run quickly or get back to position quickly  so i would imagine that uh uh more attacking left hand court player is more vital aspect in this particular game  so we will have to see how the strategy works  uh ramesh and leander paes uh have played only once before rakesh but they couldn't uh  atul uh may be you would like to comment a little bit but i will ask you a question one possible reason for this uh strategy of taking the left court by ramesh krishnan could be that the koreans are putting in a left hander  and therefore really they will have two right court players exactly i was just going to say this ravi  in fact an hour before this programme began they were practising on the outside courts  and both the korean stars were practising only serves from the left court and not from the right court  now ramesh particularly from the left court has a beautiful backhand which he can tip chipping it very well bringing the  opponent close to the net because the server will be at the base line and he will have to come up for the server volley tandum  just one more thing for the viewers particularly the fact that leander paes is wearinng ankle pads today  he put them on almost about an hour and half back and he was warming up with his father on the outside courts  trying it for the first time as i asked him  and ramanathan krishnan told me that the minor trouble that he had in the right ankle would not be a hindrance at all at this stage  uhm well that we'll have to see  the other thing very important is the  india is represented by ramesh krishnan and leander paes  applause  korea is represented by chang jong and lee chong wo  applause  india has won the toss and elected to serve  time till the pairs play  the umpire is coming right  and one of the uh interesting thing that that happen in this davis cup ties i think that india has won the toss in every match haven't we so far ? so far ramesh krishnan won his toss leander paes won his  and now the doubles team has gone across the court  so ramesh and leander will play from the southern end near commentators box end and probably ramesh will serve we will have to see in a minute  in the meanwhile once again to the uhm to the koreans atul  uh this is going to be very tough for the indian because both the players will play on their forehand  and that's going to be uh a very much more attacking combination than uh the normal right handed players well i think it will be very difficult for the indian players to pass them particularly ramesh  and uh the result that i could see yesterday in the two sets that they played you know really serving very very powerfully  and both of them with strong shoulders  both the korean stars were reintroduce but they were one word and leander now is ready to serve  the first service of the match crucial match important match i hope this can excite us  and leander ready to serve  love fifteen  very good volley there but rather unlucky yes  bit too long  he played the shot and leander he saw the ball all the way to  saw chang move  and he was really good to chase that volley quite easily to an empty court fifteen o  oh  fifteen o  another service take chang goes there flack backhand  down the line no mistakes at all  fifteen o  very confidently played by leander thirty o  he was back quick waiting for the volley  very good display at the match  ankle doesn't seem to be bothering him yes  seems to be running alright  thirty o  forty thirty  the first time in the game leander has gotten on to a lead  forty thirty a good service serving wide on forehand  very easy smash for ramesh krishnan forty thirty first game  leander forty  a very good beginning for india no suman  but i like the way uh leander change over to the forehand got them on the forehand because one word been consisted in being serving on the backhand  but now when he won four and forty more  the other point i think is important korean going to do a lot of interceptions  you know self systems particularly so let it will depend on the indian service return also how what do you think of that very brave shot by chang ? oh he's good i thought that was a good shot he he he came took the ball on the rise and hit a flak down the line edge  he got a good tactic good shot i mean he not the  these are the player sort of ramesh is trying to cut off he wanted to keep it down  in the beginning you try all those all such things i don't think he will try but that try that as this thirty all or so towards the end of the  may i we'll have to see whether it can be bad attacking that bold as the games along but  fine  the position at the moment is that india started serving the match  the doubles match first game  leander paes and krishnan are representing india  and chang and lee are representing korea in this very vital doubles match this afternoon at the d l t a court  india has won the first game leander paes held the service after winning the toss  and now chang serves to paes  chang of korea to serve  fifteen love  oh that was that was a necessarily pass somewhat in touch was there have a look there  a nice return by krishnan  paes could have done anything with that in in the event he  steady infatuates put it wide outside the baseline  a bit sure zoom for the rather unnecessary lapse  they really dropped that return a good return chang couldn't do anything there  so it's thirty fifteen to korea  chang serving to ramesh  forty fifteen uh ravi did you notice this time when chang was to serve  lee the right hander non-playing hand put it behind and held up a couple of singles which shows that they are going to run across for singles yes it's it's a sort of  you know signal a signal  a private signal system  a very pretty shot by lee  in fact that return very beautifully  make tennis look so easy like that doesn't it ? in fact these are very difficult shots  so it's one game all first two games had been held by the server leander paes won his first game  chang gave in the same performance  one o first set in doubles tie  fifteen down  now there it seems to be some kind of misunderstanding i thought lee want to get couldn't get it slipped chang ran  almost got it but the net intercept intercepted that  so ramesh won the point  already tension is showing  and there goes another gushing out  suman this is the fourth time in laughs since yesterday as you have mentioned little while line called for might  wo wo wo uh would you see why chang miss that shot  why ? the ball was low near the net yes  and both the indians had covered up the cross court right  so he thought of going down the line going down the line but but he can't run raise it so near the net  you can't you can't have these totally inexplicable errors while you getting too tense uh tense i think  his serve stop by the net  he anticipated that  rather good drive rather good sense have a look there  leander intercepts chang hits another nice shot  krishnan stretches and makes it into a win  oh another lovely shot by krishnan there  a beautiful shot  good return and better volley  an excellent return by lee and even better volley by krishnan look at that good flak return by lee  and krishnan stretches out meets a nice big volley  and he puts it into the net  krishnan there serving over game  game is over india leads two games to one  perfect  but although india has led has won this game and leading two games to one  i think we got to come back to those two point which uh  leander paes seems to have missed up very early in the match he he hit one volley up which was quite unnecessary and that  very interesting smash  it's improvising   i'm is it is it already the nerves catching up with him  no i think he is trying to prove himself that he he just trying to overdo it which is sometimes nerves  it won't be nerves he has played in this tournament  particularly doubles before  but here i think he is trying to prove a point and trying to finish off too soon  now both both the shots were inex in  inexplicable those errors particularly second one when he got so near the net  what and the point is that he has to cool down a little bit because this is going to be a long game probably  and uh if you stretch on to three or four hours of tennis  on a hot day like this you have to keep your cool more than anything else i think  haan definitely i mean he he can't afford to make those those errors because uh af   after a great an open you got a shot like this it is a gift yeah and uh as ramesh keeps the young lad in check  comment by suman and then to rakesh sharma  well i won't call that's a lead they are just holding around because holding services  quite please quite please   two words leander paes  a very warm and enthusiastic crowd  greeting the performance of the two indian players ramesh krishnan and leander paes  and facing the camera on the far side the korean number one star chang jong ta  fifteen love  ah you notice atul  yes  that the korean supporters are in greater numbers today and with their flags waving there sitting out on the west end  very true west end yeah

maharashtra  shanti kumar now  looses out  to suresh kumar  but a tightly packed maharashtra defence  is quite strong in that department  everesto cardoz the captain playing in the defence today this is how kerala progressed to the final  in the quarter-final league they drew madhya-pradesh zero-zero  then beat uttar-pradesh four-zero  then beat the bengal three-one andhra_pradesh three-zero  and in the semi-final they got past goa by four goals to three  vijayan now in possession for kerala  jarcinto there allowed the ball to run over the sidelines teams yet to settle down here  trying to

free-kick  or rather a kick being awarded to kerala  these teams have met nine times earlier in this  championship and it's been kerala who have won five times the other matches ending in draws  some excitement at the kerala half   that's a shot at the kerala bench  their coach k k gopalakrishnan was a member of the kerala team  played in 1966  kerala with the ball now  rasheed  long ball to hashim  santosh now in possession  maharashtra defence regrouping very well a good ball here for harshan  inside the penalty area  but there're two defenders there to take care of harshan everesto cardoz and jarcinto de silva  and uh this is the progress chart of maharashtra to the final in the quarter-final league they drew karnataka one-all beat punjab one-zero then beat assam four-one and in

cardoz going for that ball  and in the clash cardoz had fallen down and now the  game resumes again  kerala now building up an attack through the right flank  harshan going for that ball  but doesn't control it well it goes off a defender  ashok nair and it's going to be a corner-kick for kerala about two thirty-two minutes of play gone in the first half  neither team have scored yet  kerala is better as far as attacks are concerned  that uh kick hitting ashok nair and it's  going to be a free-kick for kerala  a good chance here for kerala to open the score  that was a good intelligent kick taken there by jiju jacob but equally well deflected by manoj bhatt for a corner  yet another one for kerala  the goalkeeper kadir doesn't gathered that one  but maharashtra keep possession akeel ansari  santosh now for kerala  trying to put through vijayan there  ball running loose  to sabu  he tries a left-footer from around thirty yards a rather weak shot  nothing much here for the crowd to enthuse  only mild flutter was provided by hashim in the eighteenth minute  a good ball put through by jiju which found him  with only the goalkeeper to beat and he shot wide  now here's a chance for maharashtra godfrey pereira  centring that one  but way over the goalline  kerala entering the final of the santosh trophy for the forth consecutive time  three times runners-up from nineteen eighty-eight onwards  and the crowd here are hoping that it would be forth time lucky for kerala  kerala in possession now  ball there for vijayan  harshan in control here  good chance and he puts it over the goal  both the maharashtra defenders everesto cardoz and jarcinto  didn't mark him there and harshan there you see him jersey number eleven  had a good chance  a snap move by kerala there harshan all by himself  with the defenders trying to regroup  he tackled the ball well but then his left-footer sailing over the bar  so yet another chance going abegging as far as kerala is concerned  they have done most of this attacking in this match so far  now everesto cardoz the maharashtra captain who played for india in the nehru gold cup giving it to shanti kumar  ball taken away by vijayan  jarcinto de silva now for maharashtra  to manoj bhatt  to arif ansari good ball down the right flank  and the kerala defence quite tight there  marking the maharashtra player and uh  they

kumar now for kerala  hashim tightly marked  cardoz with a clearance  arif ansari  trying to put through godfrey pereira there   there's jiju jacob  tall kerala defender who also played the last  year's final of the santosh trophy against goa  the lone victory for kerala in the santosh trophy came in nineteen seventy-three one word home turf in ernakulam  when they beat railways three-two in the final  maharashtra on the other hand twice winners of the santosh trophy in nineteen fifty-four and nineteen sixty-three  throw-in for kerala  hashim there being tightly marked   that's another throw-in  jiju jacob  now shanti kumar  ball coming to sabu  vijayan there trying to put through hashim  but his chip there a little too long for hashim  and kadir in possession for maharashtra  everesto cardoz  trying to inspire his forward line  done very little today  again a rather aimless pass   we've seen very few attacks by the maharashtra forwards today  they haven't combined well  and there have been very little understanding between the half line and the forward line  vijayan now  with fallen back  trying to put through harshan there's the tall everesto with a header  ball coming to jiju jacob  the pace of the game considerably slackened here   it's a quite hot afternoon  temperature in the mid-thirties  and it certainly would be energy sapping here for the  players  the first half slowly coming to an end  neither team have scored yet  kerala now trying to build up a move through the right flank  suresh kumar there up  ball cleared  again a mispass comes to shanti kumar   who'll be switching over from mahindras to mohun bagan next season  akeel ansari now being dispossessed  santosh  to rasheed  trying to find hashim on the right flank  very few passes here finding the intended player  shanti kumar for maharashtra  to everesto cardoz  vijayan tackling him there from behind  free-kick for maharashtra  godfrey pereira  trying to wield his way through  to shanti kumar  manoj bhatt  cleared out by the kerala defence  crowd here certainly gone quiet  and that's a throw-in none of the maharashtra forwards there   it's going to be a goal-kick for kerala  the first half coming to a close  neither team have scored yet  with less than five minutes of play left  rasheed  ball for harshan  and that improper charge there  the free-kick for maharashtra  jarcinto de de silva the stopper-back  vijay thapa has takes a tumble there  comes to joseph  the kerala left wing back  hamid now  harshan  to jiju jacob  the overlapping defender for kerala  and his pass there misdirected  another kerala move comes to nought  a quick counterattack here from maharashtra  arif ansari  but keeps hold of the ball a little too long there  akeel ansari now  cardoz again an aimless pass  kerala gained possession  suresh kumar  ball again running loose here  comes to the goalkeeper  rasheed for kerala  a long ball trying to find hashim   there's jarcinto with that header  harshan now with the ball  good chance for vijayan  takes a shot from just outside the penalty box a left-footer which goes out  vijayan the captain of the kerala team also member of the kerala police team which won the federation cup this year  and a wayward kick taken there by goalkeeper kadir sends it  over the sideline  kerala keep possession  hamid  long ball there for santosh   there's jarcinto handling that situation very well comes to godfrey pereira  and maharashtra earn a free-kick  crowd has come here with banners and drums  quite a boisterous crowd  referee samil awarding that free-kick to maharashtra  just inside the kerala half  vijay thapa the vice-captain to take the kick  jiju the taller player there getting the better of that duel kerala in possession jiju jacob overlapping  cutting in there very well  and a good ball there for hashim a good chance for kerala  and hashim putting it over the net he had only to beat the goalkeeper there  very intelligent play there by jiju jacob  cut in very well

unbelievable tragedy  a bad despicable moment a bad night when rajiv gandhi was brutally killed  our hearts are filled with anguish and sadness  perhaps the hundreds of millions that make up this vast and vibrant country it is a moment for us to hang our heads in utter shame  there is toll of gloom only broken by the recital of devotional songs  the atmosphere steep in this sorrow of the appaling

senseless tragedy  we have many world leaders here represented in large numbers  at mr rajiv gandhi's funeral with over sixty delegations from the world over who've been coming in since yesterday to pay their last respect to the departed leader  large crowds have gathered here today outside the cordons area oblivious of the heat and the dust and scortching winds  all here to mourn the loss of our former prime minister whom they loved and cheered  a leader whom they showered their love on and who in turn returned their affection and warmth in his untiring attempt to keep the interests of the common man closest to his heart  today the spot where mr rajiv gandhi's life last rites are to be performed was chosen by his daughter priyanka who visited the site day before yesterday and then a couple of times thereafter to see how the arrangements were progressing  not too far away are the spots where mrs indira gandhi and mr sanjay gandhi were cremated  and today the mortal remains of

in particular  air has indeed broken new ground in our ideal fields  and great many strikes  the gulf war has only added to our challenges even though  we are not the actual theatre of war  air i must say has reason to be challenge admirably  by not only providing to the listening public news from the battle fronts but also by promoting public awareness on the importance of conserving energy petrolium products one word economy in national expenditure as well as of  fighting the evils of hoarding and black marketing  the media for becoming more and more vulnerable and media management is therefore becoming increasingly complex  on the one hand is the paradox of care air time being available and an insatiable demand for more radio time  from ever larging ever enlarging an interested groups  the promoters of anti-cosumerism the environmentalist  and a host of other social activists  on the other hand there is the growing recognition  of the importance of media and their autonomy and a constant threat  by extremist elements the millitants promoters of violence  and other anti-social elements to silence the media  all of us are aware of how this was brought home to us in the tragic assassination of lasa kaur who like casa blanca  the boy on the burning death is too dumb in the cause of  keeping the transmission on and the media flag flying  you may even try this when you try to produce better programmes than your fellow workers your seniors your juniors  and your equals can do  this is competition  competition is when you perform in comparison with another  what you must try for is excellence  excellence for its own sake  you achieve excellence ga by competing with yourself  and not with another  you achieve excellence when your sub every subsequent work is recognized to be greater than your previous work  i wish you all every success  thank you applaud  we begin with the citation for the akashwani annual awards nineteen ninety  radio play  imphal

 in hindi  thank you baldev east bengal play a long ball stay in their position majeed chapman chapman playing away to the left sushanu dey making room for chapman  and here shanti majumdar sushanu replace vikas panje  few minutes to go  taking attempt to cross from the left  east bengal earn a flag kick  tushar rakshit he is leaving for sushanu dey  dey is uh shirt number six as he positions the ball  he will take that gentle left footer which will come  swabing away  and ball by majumdar  up go mohun bagan gunabir singh  long ball on the right  and going for a goal kick in favour of east bengal  mohun bagan got a couple of positive chances to forge ahead  again they haven't succeeded  sushanu dey moves here gently forward  pasha looks for chapman  he has in the world lot of uh coverage he darts very quick  to this uh nimble feet  and here is a long range shot in hindi   it's going net across the stadium all through the feroz shah kotla cricket ground  so a new ball has been requisitioned  alok das who will take the goal kick now he instead gets a pass from tanomoi bose  ranjan dey back to das  referee gulab chauhan blows the whistle to stop play because  suddenly the old ball has also come back into the playing arena  now the referee will throw the ball he drops it  and east bengal move out with sushanu dey  he is moving very acute on to the left full swing  but the ball in any case had gone over  section of the spectators of the ground level  really that place of the ground level you you just cannot enjoy the game of football at that uh level from that eye view  than uh perhaps where we are in the commentators box and those on the upper terraces laughter   in hindi  ranjan dey is header  butia  rakshit  sushanu dey  oh god here the chance and sanjay majhi again ideally positioned just above the one word he succeeds in getting the angle pass tanomoi bose  but that angle is a little too much and the goal just rolled across the goal line  few uh metres away from the uprise  so east bengal's first chance in this second half to have forged ahead  watch it again sushanu dey puts the ball ahead sanjoy majhi runs in from the left  goal keeper bose turns rushing out and that angle is  wide by a few metres  majumdar leads the ball for majhi  majhi slow satyajit gets the ball  gunabir gets it to back down the line  foul committed before the ball rolled out  satyajit ancheri doesn't trap cleanly  tarun de biachung butia carlton chapman gunabir kicks it out  iliyas pasha for the throwing for east bengal  swaroop das won't let vijayan anywhere close  in the air the dole won by alok das  this game is also has its highs and lows  the sweet and sours both the teams having missed out one  opportunities to mohun bagan as has had a better share  dulal biswas butia  butia tackled by satyajit   it's sushanu dey in possession  and it's a faulty forward pass looking for majumdar swaroop das got a very clean ahead pasha clears  taken by gunabir waits for the bounce it's too long  chapman puts it out to play  gunabir satyajit chatterjee suryan mark akeel ansari  ancheri very quick indeed  to ansari ansari again coming down the middle cannot get passed  tarun de  ansari very agile player  despite the fact that he looks lean and hungry  scrappy struggle on at the moment in the mid field ball running left and right a few yards  now in mohun bagan's possession  and certainly the crowd doesn't like that  supporters of both the teams present in thousands  the score board is blank in the nineteen ninety-four durand final butia  pasha  yes sushanu dey looking for the open and there is nobody there for that pass played on the left  nil nil  foul there uh again mohun bagan referee chouhan going towards outside right robin ghosh giving him bit of warning  swaroop das it shall be for the free kick  gently chipping it away onto the left flank  stopped by dulal biswas the big centre  alok das  amitabh chandra  back to das  long ball played  and akeel ansari in no mood to oblige vijayan is on his own way  mohun bagan forward constantly on the run  athanu bhattacharya sensing a bit of danger in vijayan did the right thing to come up to the ball  foul was committed by vijayan  here comes the a free kick  tushar rakshit dispossessed biswas backing up   it's uh stretches  twenty-two minutes of the game gone this is the near outpull eastern stand  very popular with the football lovers of the city  oh comes inside the box  here is the chance for chapman he raise for the second bounce alok mukherjee gets to the ball  butia controls back passing to swaroop das back to butia  and butia again attempt to pass iliyas pasha who has gone two yards ahead acknowledges to butia saying well my fault my friend in the meanwhile mohun bagan uh defender alok mukherjee  is on the ground very close to his own penalty box  time off has been called by the referee  and gives a little bit of time for uh two players to have a gulp of water  those two the uh touch line is the satyajeet chatterjee  a stretcher being called alok mukherjee going to be taken out for first aid  chatterjee is throwing  ancheri  pasha now chapman gets the ball pasha again  butia for east bengal he is quick but he hold himself but it is given butia moves upon to the right chapman with the first time pass  and uh vikas panje  uh sanjay majhi that was unable to control gunabir long ball from vijayan ansari is there vijayan is quicker again with east bengal positioned swaroop das  iliyas pasha  sushanu dey is ahead in the dual ranjan gets the better  off majumdar  satyajit chatterjee sets up akeel ansari  square pass amitabh chandra there is it for gautam ghosh  the linesman flag goes up for off side  dulal mohun bagan playing with ten the moment they could be looking for a substitution for alok mukherjee  but no it's not alok mukherjee who is going out  it's going to be bernard who is replacing gunabir  so bernard is one of the many important players today donning  the colours of the calcutta football club  it started many years ago with the iranian then came the nigerian and here is bernand in position for mohun bagan  east bengal defence kept back  akil ansari too much of time  and ancheri waits for that opportunity swaroop das rises to the occasion but mohun bagan again come up  amitabh chandra now takes a shot  it goes wide  east bengal goal keeper athanu bhattacharya takes the kick rakshit fails to stop it  ball to ghosh  on the right flank gentle chip for vijayan  vijayan will look for ancheri  pasha gets to it no he cannot break the hold of mohun bagan  this time tarun de aheads it away  butia  east bengal at the receiving end  slowly pull the ball out chapman resting it ones the ball gone how to play  alok mukherjee back onto the playing arena with the throw in satyajeet chatterjee akeel ansari now  pushing forward amitabh to a good over lap  in the ball and uh reverse bicycle attempt kick from ancheri  atanu quiet yet  behind it was not really in position not in the ideal situation  so even attempt trying that reverse meanwhile a foul commited  rakshit playing square to pasha  east bengal fearing to lose the stint which was evident earlier on  tanomoi bose rolling it for alok das  satyajit chatterjee up come chandra  ansari  ball to gautam ghosh dulal biswas in front of him  ansari again the ball went lose  to the right back chandra  passes it inside the box headed out  vijayan now and butia gets it  he will have to gather speed he will have to give a long ball through gives it to majumdar gives enough of time to the mohun bagan defender to fall back in position  here comes the cross but the tall alok das will have nothing go pass him  vijayan all over up and down he is like the human machine he and ancheri really haven't stop things going for mohun bagan  swaroop das and tarun de have been outstanding in the deep present as indeed iliyas pasha dulal biswas has been doing a good overlap on the left for east bengal  here is bernard back passing you can see he is giving it away to east bengal  majumdar chapman chapman chatterjee here is bernard now for mohun bagan  gentle throw to ancheri ancheri is crossing but quiet harmlessly to atanu bhattacharya  sushanu de  there is a too long alok das sanjay majhi one to one situation  easily outwitted satyajit akeel ansari  gautam ghosh fixed it up closes attack on line mohun bagan looking dangerous now  what you say to that ancheri with just a goal keeper to beat  with the out step of his left he doesn't collect to the way and expectations of the mohun bagan team man  here watch it again a good piece of workmen gautam ghosh  and look at ancheri he is all by himself vijayan has moved up and all ancheri is to do is to kick it away with his right he prefers his left because probably it is the defender coming in his view  and he had so much of time and plenty of uh angle as well  to beat the goal keeper wasn't very far  that makes the mess of it  so east bengal survive  nil nil as we move into the thirty-first minute of the second half  yes mohun bagans attack again there is going up ancheri  well it's a goal applause oh one word  ancheri gets the first goal for mohun bagan in the thirty-first minute of the second half  movements again from the right warmed it and mohun bagan were looking dominating looking threatening as you watch gautam ghosh on the right pushes the ball forward and here is ancheri  number eleven  this time he is not making any mistake he controls with his left he outwit the deep defence swaroop das as top on the wrong foot dulal biswas is left behind and here comes that whacker which is narrowing the angle beating goalkeeper tanu bhattacharya and  it's one zero for mohun bagan  so luck eventully running out for east bengal  ancheri scoring the first goal drawing the first  two words in the final of the nineteen ninety-four durand cup  throwing for mohun bagan and for commentory baldev   in hindi  so it's going to be mohun bagan for the kick off with vijayan back passing  akeel ansari he is just behind  alok das ranjan dey  vijayan gurudas gunabir singh just to net  east bengal gain position gunabir again now to mohun bagan gunabir is a link man  back passing amitabh chandra inside the box  taken by tarun de   it's there sanjoy majhi give there to vikas panje panje looks for carlton chapman  alok mukherjee is there  ranjan dey  alok mukherjee the long left vijayan will not get through it clear  comes to butia  butia for east bengal in the mohun bagan half  short pass  rakshit  tushar rakshit going into the open he is being tackled by  alok das  gautam ghosh gunabir singh now  mohun bagan in position  up comes amitabh chandra right back  to his right striker right winger ghosh  tackled by dulal biswas as he crosses  iliyas pasha was the men carrying away from there  satyajit gunabir again looking for satyajit chatterjee  butia sushanu dey on to the left now dulal biswas  the left back vikas panje 
hello and welcome to the highlights of the fourth one day international between india and the west indies  india were leading two one before the match at the barabati stadium cuttuck  the west indies desperately needing to win here to level off the series at two all and to make it a real live affair for the fifth one day international at jaipur which follows on friday  the west indies made one change beside that it lost at vizag  they dropped barrington browne and preferred to strengthen their batting  bringing in shivnarine chanderpaul  india had to drop navjot siddhu who was injured and brought in atul bedade but surprisingly they brought back chetan sharma in place of venkatesh prasad  it was a cloudy morning when courtney walsh the west indian captain won the toss and elected to bat  we pick up the play of the very first ball of the morning   it's manoj prabhakar bowling to phil simmons   in hindi  west it's fascinating structure there  people standing on the balconies  looking end of the side screen like the centre piece of pavilion   that's gone away for four runs  simmons aiming it well  striking it at off the space just behind square  that was favourite cut of simmons  a cut short centre wide there is two ways of cutting one with the horizontal bat and one with perpendicular that was the  perpendicular way of playing the square cut   it's straight away to azharuddin there in the gully that was an exotic catch phil went into the trap and it went straight away to azhar quite difficult to tell really  simmons got back really and hit it very hard  here i had seen that was a catch indeed azharuddin a very agile normally was amongst  that end up very very powerful over azharuddin had had to go to his right  this is a good start by the west indies because uh there was a quite a bit of moment early on uh in this wicket and uh  the two of them have counted that very well  great shot there by simmons like he go for runs  four runs square cut  that really is a trademark shot of uh simmons uh shot  a little bit of width being a tall man standing up here  that balls are by chetan giving williams all those to play his shot back foot cover drive four runs  williams particularly is very good at shot  well he gave that a fair old whack uh that steuart williams a ball to be head short and on a wicket of this nature now with the uh ball not coming on to the bat that's a free hand for the batsman specially the west indian batsman with such good backfoot there  there he's given it a fair old thump  could be out  yes he is  good catch by manoj   that's a generous really happy and very good well judged that catch by manoj there running back a little bit  and there william's gone  first wicket for india and to chetan sharma  williams not getting on top of that short ball i think he was beaten a little bit by pace here and uh hurried on to him and uh  ball coming a lot quicker then he expected and getting the top edge and manoj prabhakar here running around taking a good catch  that will do chetan sharma as a morale world of good  caught prabhakar bowled sharma for fifteen   that's more of a desperate shot stepping out  uh but well played outside a square drive stepping out  that's a very good shot to play  four runs there   in hindi  in the air but it's safe  lara not trying to bow but he've still soon then but he's gone off fast on it for that to go away  for four runs  sharma now to hooper  jadeja was giving his side he is out  what a brilliant throw and uh a very well field  hooper does is out what a marvellous piece of cricket from jadeja but careless by hooper who was very one word to walk about like that  certainly very very careless and another wicket of west indies could not afford to lose particular hooper being run out hooper has been playing so well  and that is uh uh uh for a big support for the west indies team uhm hooper there playing the ball uh to a shot mid-wicket  just taken off and jadeja coming in and pick the ball up and a lovely throw hit the wicket on time  seventy-seven for three   it's straight   it's another good short there by lara  shrinath is the fielder coming back for the second and it was fast throw but  not out says the umpire  but this indian team so certainly hit in the stumps from all over the field  uh again that could have been pretty close if lara played it to mid-wicket and and shrinath run run they have taken up and a lovely throw in  see there lara is in there just in time  once again he has to chase the run he won't get that  it was played very fine by lara  late and fine and nicely controlled  in the air and a big appeal  no says the umpire mr jose kurushinkal that came off the pad  so  have a look at that one again  another particularly good shot and up and uh very good decision  well that's the edge it's four runs  all is fair in love and war as they say  the end of the over  twenty-four overs and it's ninety-nine for three   applaud and whistles  so lara well he is beginning to make a significant score even though he work on the score is many of his runs made one word  like that  and another fielder at the other end   it's one word to time again the counter term with the mis field by anil kumble  well he did that well for four it was a lovely shot moving freely into the half volly  kumble now to lara  well that was delicately played  and that is gone away for four runs  just about as fine as you could get it  kumble now to arthurton  and that runs for arthurton to fine leg it could well go for four there  it does  so a productive over for the west indies twenty-five overs have gone it's a hundred and thirteen for three  and that's beautifully played by lara wide across at short fine leg  four more  runs certainly coming in  very good running between the wicket  excellent   in hindi   that's a lovely shot there  and over the top  six runs  brian have been trying to play the shot for quite sometime  from the last over he has been successful now   it's arthurton facing raju  uh that should be a close one  uh i thought he played right across the line ravi  here the ball is spinning so it's it's not easy for raju to get a leg before decision unless it's it's  a straight throw as you can see its pitched outside the line and uh  the batsman also has its foot outside the off stump  umpire has given him out  it was a magnificient catch   arthur arthurton stepping out stepping down  from the one word end was a big one word and bat back  caught brilliantly by mongia at just silly mid on  straight drive beautiful shot all the way almost going to the boundary yes it is long on boundary wide off long on fielder had no chance  very good shot there by brian lara  square cut there  lara lara has been playing the shot very well all the way for four runs  there again brilliant paceman that's a bad ball from raju giving lara room and in this kind of form he is not going to waste uh deliveries of that kind there  playing it late and beating the fielder at deep point giving him absolutely no chance  like i said this is a much better brian lara you are seeing  stepping down before the ball is delivered straight down and well fielded no  yes it is  just inside the boundary line well done by raju once again just two runs  raju in the end doing well  to stop the ball just inside the fence  oh there and he is out  umpire has given him out  wicket keeper umpire that's a good skill good piece of keeping by mongia who picked up all the loss done by and uh and this lara being stumped  stumped mongia bowled kumble  ah there is excellent piece of glove work here by nain mongia because brian lara slipped a bit when he played that shot and just dragged his leg outside as uh you would be able to see here there you see just dragging and mongia in a flash and his leg is just an inch outside the crease maybe even on the line but  that's out   a good decision by the umpire there   but that is  end of the thirty ninth over west indies are one ninety one for five  and the new batsman coming in  should be chanderpaul  batsman one word chanderpaul hasn't played a match after the bombay one day  and he should be replacing lara  left hander replacing another left hander  very important wicket for india that because lara was looking extremely dangerous  he is a type of player who likes to play long innings and he had uh still another fourteen overs to go   that's way he was out  high play and he is given out yes going right across the line of delivery  and again umpire jayprakash giving chanderpaul out  l b w bowled jadeja  funny all this game can change uh you lose the wicket  when side is cruising and now here again chanderpaul playing across the line to delivery from jadeja that was coming in and paying the penalty  wide of the crease jadeja angling at it and as you can see  chanderpaul one word is not playing across  score one ninety-two for six now west indies   that's well played there  and manoj shot that by just like stepping for the going near the ball and four runs all the way  with two fielders they are pretty close to each other the man at short third and backward point there is a very little gap there  but uh holder placing the ball to perfection  he was waiting on it  and at the very last minute tabbing it down and placing it beautifully past manoj prabhakar  once it beaten the other fielders had absolutely no chance  that's wide over there and manoj prabhakar alternate yes he has gone in there  a simple catch manoj prabhakar at long on and junior murray is out  caught prabhakar bowled jadeja  trying to hit the ball out of the ground he has just come in to bat uh and it's gather shot by uh murray because he needed to give his senior partner holder as much of the strike as possible there was no need for a short of this kind  there is still over fifty balls to play and west indies should be trying and picking up uh the single ones and twos and allowing uh  holder to do face on the the bowling because uh losing wickets at this stage regularly can put tremendous pressure on the new man who comes in the score is two hundred and two for seven west indies jadeja to holder   that's in the air it's going over the top for six  uh kambli also has gone over the top uh he was unable as well  he has some of the gut shot uh before he picks it up early  gone into position  so it's going to be kumble now to bowl to andy cummins  cummins is gone he is given out he was sweeping  there and uh the umpire uh mr kurushinkal has turned out there so cummins is on his way  uh that fell well whether we take that probably just at the outside of the off stump  no one is certain as to what happen  uh except obviously the wicket keeper mongia  the bail is off and walsh is gone  he has asked the indian perhaps they said well one word  and very unspendidly he has taken that word for it and he is out  well it was very difficult to say because he seem to be right cover in the wicket and just pushing at the ball as you can see there  and it seems that it his pad in the way but it's probably just took the outside edge of the stumps  yes yes there you can see the wicket keeper gloves is away back and you see the man in there and two twenty-eight for nine  one word uhm shrinath again to holder  oh is it that may be a mild but he didn't picked this well  it's well fielded by kumble  shrinath now to one word cuffy  another full toss he played it before  well that was perfectly played and it takes cuffy to nine  he couldn't have played that very safe well i think that cuffy can raise and walk in and hooper  because hooper played that similiar kind of shot when he played in the last game when he went inside to the full toss and that was a lovely shot  as you can see cuffy gets an inside there  he played that didn't he ? uhm skidding it wide of the leg stump  cuffy there was coming down looking for the big hit  umpire examining two words i think so  cuffy but it's a get down on target out  i got some uh upon the hot shot like uh i got some sensational news his highest score in this cricket is one  he never scored more than singles so he reaching his top score as fifteen runs  last ball being bowled now  oh he is obviously over there going for single oh laughs and i tell you what prabhakar he hadn't put his hand to the when that ball hit the wicket

this is the captain of the haryana side and trying to  get back into the indian team   that's ram saran  gurdeep singh sanjeev ram saran on the crossing there  and uh empire sachin navadia who was this side of the team at the moment is supervising the match with uh t s bullard on the opposite side   that's gurdeep singh  no no  kishan singh stop there by shakira  jagbir obstruct it  narendra number two gurdeep singh he has been playing very well i am sure in this tournament  sanjeev kumar kicks there  sanjay bisht india player  gurdeep singh and there is mukesh kumar playing there  still in possession still got the ball in position now balbir sahani hold out for off time  a gentle stroke saki who picked up that ball for haryana ashok kumar stopped it gurdeep singh on baljit  baljit in possession  ball given to him by baljit singh off there he knew his position all over the island and now indian airline trying to make headway  a beaten there  sanjay bhatia  haryana into move now  baljit coming five men across the struck in the process  ball over the striker but no chance ram saran could not get a strike  good to be the goal the play he eject at last certain bid of the touch to uh a straight ball and we have a goal out  but ram saran missed and the first chance for haryana  has gone a waste manoj kumar very ferocious outside  the ball is in possession  a sure goal there for mukesh kumar  he will play final decision into the crossway  oh he made a loss of it but he did a better job but it was  gurdeep who could have stick out there and uh mukesh lost possession  anyway they have a corner ball hit and now let us see what uh uh this ranjit kumar can do but then gundeep has come back there  ram saran in good lead trying to make headway obstructed and kicks watch again gundeep men who gets a drift put the ball at far square on that uh sanjeev kumar got a catch from good run get hold of the ball  amar singh negi that was who were outside from the ball from there and uh play it for uh indian airline shakeel ahmed  down to mukesh kumar  mukesh moving well today  he had a practice tournament here baljit gundeep on to the ram saran  ram saran still in the lead ahead couple of yards but i am sure he knows that he is not there in his own position and that's  end of a ball flight so another cross wasted  harvinder sanjay bisht rajpal to mukesh kumar but ball  a little bit uh shallow and it goes out before he had it  final of this federation cup  the first five minutes did not produce uh yielding  unexpected but haryan definitely having as much of the game as indian airlines gundeep trying to make headway and uh fully that ball out in the two words  ball deflected out to corner  so in the first corner indian airlines the airlines have won  and now its turn of haryana and taking the corner hit is uh  gundeep kumar  he goes to a former india player  gundeep and they all charging here and deflected  gundeep kumar stop there by mohammad arif  tries his scoop doesn't do it well and touch the penalty corner in a good way  baljit singh is going to take the push and is going to be  well gurdeep singh for the hit also near him ram saran  mukesh kumar and uh that's it  and what a lovely shot there is a good short there tries to the corner  but got to face the one word gundeep kumar try to make a big hit  he was to make well but misfield but tries well  second penalty corner on to a real big shot two words  the haryana boys are putting the pressure over indian airlines  another penalty corner second corner now two words  baljit kumar baljit kumar who played one play ball is out there  he always have to play around sanjay bisht one word teaming up with sanjay bisht  he is a bit of trying hard and driving  it is secure there by kishan singh and given on to  gundeep and over to daljit it's over to sukumar   saran kumar has given up there uh moving this uh  defence why middle of exchange of will serve and thinking of strucking by and empire sachin navadia serving the call to penalty corner   that's daljit taking collecting by kuldeep side  in time ball deflected out corner  here penalty corner kick  he did it for two words but went for the straight shot  but uh the ball was deflected there by goalkeeper  subbaiah's stick and in corner now sanjay bisht in possession now that is uh negi  a misfield for haryana  haryana definetly doing most of the attacking in this first half  and uh considering that they are the under dogs for this final is certainly well good cheer up to what jagbir does now  and crossing there and uh again got the chance lost  i mean the score still one as it here appears over to kuku wadia  in hindi  for our viewers now we have that man here mr k p s  gill you have been watching mr gill the matches in this federation cup practically everyday  did you find any outstanding talent during these last few days ? uh most of the players uh who were there in the camp  uh are again been asked to join the camp and we've found about seven new faces here who will be asked to come into the camp  but watching haryana i've been very impressed with their play  yes specially sanjeev kumar is doing exceptionally well yes uh and i want to have a separate look at haryana altogether i want to see how they impress so with such team  and they have been really been playing together  and i believe you have and the half the team from punjab  and half the team from haryana  uh there are players from punjab sindh bank there are players from b s f uh but basically it's uh it's not of  team which has played together for a long team yes they have impressed considerably  now what do you think uh should be done as far as uh if you go round the whole jalandhar you see the boards a revival of the indian hockey being planned  now what you are going about doing that ? you see uh at the moment uh certain planning has gone in as far as asian games are concerned and thereafter the world cup  but i will be looking after the uh champions trophy and the olympic games ninety-five and ninety-six and uh then after that and the objective will be to win these two tournaments  so far as the asian games is concerned uh it's  obvious the time is very short  now but do you have any graded procedures to raise the standard of hockey in india ? uh for these two tournaments which are  coming up immediately there is nothing much we can add on to what has been happening  but for the tournaments which are in ninety-five and ninety-six  we will have to launch a massive talent search by the end of this year  pick up a large number of good players and trained them at different places  and then try to see that there is an overall uhm raising of the standard so that when we go into the champions trophy  and subsequently the olympic uh uh we're going as a combination which is feared all over the world  now you have about forty odd boys in the camp at chandigarh juniors  now what you are going to do about them ? those are the boys who've been selected uh from various camps which were held in country including some boys from the  academy airlines academy and uh in delhi  now we are trying to constituent a team because we have been invited for juniors double games in australia and spain  and in germany  the idea is to try and send out fit teams to these two countries and then watch for these players show  may you also have a long term life as concerning  youngsters in the country  what you want to do about them ? you see i've been talking to people uh  who've uh been associated with hockey and i find that one of the recommendations is that we should trust in young  so by winter of this year november we shall be launching a talent search all over the country for the age group ten to fourteen  and we will try to get these players into uh centre where astro-turf is there  so that they can start playing on astro-turf  and uh also they will be given uh all sort of uh fitness uh programme over the next few years  so that uh they build up strength they build up stamina and build up speed and simultaneously the hockey skills adopted  in addition to that uh thereafter from next year onwards  we will keep on adding on by having a look at the boys ten years old and selecting them to keep on to uh enter this uh stream so that we always have good players whenever you ask  anyway let's hope your leadership mr gill  will uh bring the revival of the indian hockey  thank you very much thank you  okay let's come down here at the burlton park stadium  and the pace in the game has slowed down  also then indian air airlines  are having a diffi difficult time  containing this haryana force  though they have nothing to fear they'll be making the break through they have been searching for all through this back uptill now  so far as airline had three good chances very well done i mean strike  in fact that's haryana it can goal he must be having to chose between and uh that's the ultimately it goes to the penalty corner decision and mohammed arif has always been scoring for the indian airlines  one penalty corner but he didn't do it to get and haryana on to down this there is this new break in haryana team now after this kick for indian airlines good throw ball there for rajinder singh but baljit singh takes ball there and comes out in the clear still in possession  miracle there by sanjay bhatia and put it through  sanjeev and uh kurian indian airlines but that's  true there is a lot of doing  sanjeev bhatia trying to make headway down the left flank  not successful  free hit to be taken now by gurdeep singh  now the the frail haryana push back and tandon given service in this competition  every match practically he has played very well  baljit gundeep kumar   haryana side in possession harinder gets it  and lose it call after to bhutia and back to harinder  and on to mohammed arif  arif is the india pull back who has been on the india team  over the last four tournaments abroad  and let's see what shakeel ahmed the captain of india do  it was a good throw there by jagbir but uh it was twist there by kishan singh  and a free hit for indian airlines just outside the penalty corner  shakeel ahmed back to sanjay bisht  getting to the centre you can see the wet ground there  that is as i talk a little shower we had it's the  one word now at the moment but uh towards uh this uh  one word in this two words on this to put up pace  pick the ball now sanjeev kumar for haryana  the ball there by harvinder of course he may  recording broken and sanjeev takes it to the end  it was through the drive reflection that was two words  harvinder tried on numerous occasion one side gundeep kumar on the other side jagbir singh  both have been missing constantly  they drop the best chance anybody could have asked for  but the one that gundeep kumar had in the first half when uh sanjeev kumar put him through  when he made unstopper to chance and haryana are still fighting to get the ball uptill now  indian airlines on the attack now  ajay singh in possession say in twist breath first rawat gundeep kumar has gone in plan to tame now and he gets all the back over there   bhishan had good match today  trying to make headway gets near of the goal line but it was brought down by that water there  even then he tried but the ball was stuck in slush but here is water and one word  and foul there uh by sanjay bisht  and sanjeev kumar trying to make headway and uh driving first shakeel ahmed who has gone down on the ground there and he was trying to push him through there  and uh inadvertently sanjeev kumar stick went into his stomach now look at it  it was not an intentional foul but uh shakeel went down and he is getting medical attention  we are seeing the man with the t-shirt and uh the white t-shirt and the red cap he was the former captain of india  have won and the final penalty corner hit as in the game and coming behind there is subbaiah being played and was was played by india on numerous occasion  and uh with the absence of ashish ballal who has hurt his knee in camp subbaiah has been functioning all through uh i mean all matches here while uh if ballal was there he would not have been here  so anyway it's why he doesn't to the occasion and he has functioned very well indeed  against bombay he brought out on that lovely chase and again today he is pitied against in fact the reasons are behind gundeep kumar not making uh sure shots at goal was that he was afraid that if he doesn't keep the ball in the right place he would not be able to beat subbaiah  so subbaiah is is slogging with jats that's  frustrating the haryana forwards  though one must say that uh gundeep kumar and then baljit would have the chance to score but they did not make  now later half begin  mukesh kumar switches to two words  it is obstructed there by baljit singh  played inside return pass square mukesh kumar  and mukesh drive it towards shakeel luckily shakeel gets hold of pramod kumar and this side is sanjay bisht trying to make hit  he hit that ball and comprising out of course hitting dangerous play free hit for haryana  kishan singh kishan singh on to ram saran  ram saran still holding up the ball  he is looking out for a hit somebody in the clear does round and loses possession there but it is lucky for him it's  two words  not one word sanjeev bhatia  again he still loves his crossing there and has gone to baljit  baljit he is coming gundeep kumar in the clear now   let's see whether he can do anything uh unable to beat harvinder singh  mukesh kumar in possession  mounting the attack for indian airlines is rajinder singh there  given on to jagbir singh 
good afternoon and uh greetings to doordarshan  viewers and uh welcome to the shiv chhatrapati sport city  at balewadi the outskirts of uh pune  uh pune of course one considers something to a paradise and uh the speech of course dedicated to the late rajiv gandhi the former prime minister of india on his uh fiftieth uh birthday  the uh city of course has been indeed one professional paradise  is uh today labelled as a sport city and uh has been the hosting of uh the international marathon over the last ten years  uh we also witnessed the third national games successfully  concluded at the start of the year  and uh we're now watching the start of the seventh international uh uh permit meet here at the shiv chhatrapati  sport city complex  uh just before we uh came onto the air we spoke to the president of the uh amateur athletic federation of india uh mr suresh kalmadi  the president of the amateur athletic federation of india and uh he is responsible for the seventh international permit meet here in pune  mr suresh kalmadi mr kalmadi nervous  not at all fully prepared  uh tell me the meet for the first time is being held in pune why is that you got it here ? well uh pune has got this beautiful sport city and  manifold athelitic stadium with uh synthetic tract so we thought uh this sport city should have first international event in the form of a permit meet  plus the track at jawaharlal nehru stadium at new delhi  is not up the mark we've been asking them to lay a new track till they lay a new track we can not have a international meet there  uh you are also asking uh looking forward to recognition from the world for the grand feat  now uh in case and uh we are wishful and hopeful that you get it next year  would you then be holding it here ? well uh that will have to be decided by the federation uh we are in a run for the grand feat you are aware that uh mr primo nebolio is the world president in the last meeting he had said that the grand feat will be extended to asia and he has named india and japan as the next country  where the grand feat will be held  so then this time athletic come to india and you see  lot of us uh champions coming here as part of their routine they will have to come here  so earn their points point world wise  so that will be really good  and talking of this uh permit meet what do we have in store ? well uh this is uh no doubt the greatest  athletic event so far held in india   we've never had the level of competition we will be seeing here today  we have got over ten world champions here and the competition is going to be so good because a very good crop of athletes are here today  you are aware that carl lewis and merlene ottey are heading the  list of world champions  we have started this permit meet not to give so much competition to indian but to popularise athletics in the country  we as a country go more to cricket as if we've  been just watching the match  but i think what is needed today two words for athletes that more attention to be put to athletics that's  why we get people like carl lewis and merlene ottey here  so the youngster in this country look towards olympic spot  and uh obviously uh you are also looking at uh  this as a preparation for the indian contingent for the uh asian games  that's right  you see luckily this timed well so the indian team is uh on its last lap to the asian games hiroshima they are going to get tremendous competition here especially bahudar prasad and shiny ibrahim saramma shakti singh uh also relay teams will get tremendous  uh competition here today  so it will be very good uh for them at the asian games  where the standard of the asian games will not be as high as the standard you will see here today mr kalmadi thank you very much we wish you the very best and we hope that under your guidance  indian athletes continue to grow from stature to stature thank you very much thank you  well uh the uh guest of honour uh shri  vidya charan shukla the union minister for water resources along with uh  uh shri mukul vasnik the union minister for sports and cultural affairs uh are here  the festivities would get under way soon  uh but uh to uh tell you what scheme store over the next four hours uh is my colleague commentator john castro  this seventh edition of the i t c international is an inspirational excercise  bringing these foreign athletes to india is basically to give them an exposure where watching the others in action and running aganist them will help our own boys and girls  these men and women who are representing india both in india and abroad to do better  now it's very obvious that indian athletes  rarely get a chance to take their to take part against some of the best performers in the world  now this happens in this i t c meet where you have world champions olympic champions and uh some of the best performers  in the grand feat circuit  and the exposure definitely is helpful and which especially in this exercise with the asian games coming around the corner the exposure will certainly help our men and women to hopefully do better because whatever performances  we record here then probably the same could come at hiroshima or even better because all depending on the morale well john just breaking away from you for a movement these are the uh girls from dastur high school pune  hundred of them and uh they start the march past   they're going to display the rainbow uh the colours which we all know as vibgyor  as the cheer goes up for a fine display we are marching  as one would say kadam se kadam milaye jaa  the band in attendance here is uh from the national defence academy  uh just a few kilometres away from the sports complex  and uh along with the band from the national defence academy uh is the band of the maratha light infantry belgaum  the band masters uh subedar major sumer singh and band master subedar major uh kishan shetty  they are playing kadam badhaye ja  we have a host of dignitories present here  and i said earlier on the guest of honour the uh honourable minister for water resources uh shri  vidyacharan shukla along with uh uh shri mukul vasnik the union minister for sports are here  and this is the march past  john a little deviation they're marching in a jumbled formation  yeah because uh it's uh just had especially we have an opening ceremony in say the asians games or the olympic games  but here more it is a friendly exercise but of course  not in competition  that is why it is uh it has been decided here that they walk uh without the regular marching regimentation that we have normally  well a broad moment for the girls and that's the  section of the v i p box uh you watch uh the union minister for water resources shri vidya charan shukala uh along with mukul vasnik the president of the amateur athletic federation of india   shri uh suresh kalmadi  the uh g o c m c southern command lieutenant general moti dhar is also here  six from belarus two from belgium six from china john there you are for the first time  yes the chinese are here for the first time and you we really do not know much about their performances it is when you ask them something about what they're  really doing they don't understand our language  yes we're certainly uh look for a surprise and  that's vibgyor which goes up for the uh indian contingent  this is a big meet for them  just a few weeks uh before they depart for the asian games in uh hiroshima uh p t usha the darling of the crowd she is there   she's going to be running today as well along with uh  shiny wilson and uh  and of course you can't miss out uh bahadur prasad who's  won laurel's uh for india in the international circuit  a proud moment for the girls from dastur high school pune a hundred strong as they march up in unison and uh that goes to prove that uh we in india are all one as they march together this indian team which is here comprises those  who're going to hiroshima as well as some of the prominent youngsters who are in the a a f i camp that's the amateur athletic federation of india camp those youngsters are getting the exposure so that uh they also get a chance amongst against these world champions and it could helpful be helpful   to them  between john yes uh this is uh the thing in the right direction isn't it ? right you have to give them exposure well as cheer or with applaud and thankfully are the indian athlete have had the quite a good measure of exposure in europe and elsewhere this season and hopefully they should uh come with some medals at uh from hisroshima like at beijing where it was all silver and a couple of bronze  but uh this time we are expecting better much uh you also have to be a very realistic about the fact that the chinese and the athlete from the middle east have uh gone away away from us and uh it is going to be difficult  john the presence of uh carl lewis and uh merlene ottey here is certainly going to be a big inspiration uh not only for the athlete but uh the thousands of youngsters who have gathered  to kipta i mean kiptanui the uh moses kiptanui of kenya  he is the world record holder for the two miles and uh also for the two thousand metres in one word and he will be running here shortly this afternoon  he says my hero is a few words who came to india  and previously in previous years and he says that in kenya we all these old athletes who are greats and greats in their own way  as ideal which is at one time i used to look to crieno  and uh my ideal and uh first to do i'd like to feel like and today he says everybody in kenya says we'd like to be like moses kiptanui if he is wearing a new hairstyle then but uh  you'd like to see him better when he runs  well they all trooping in here the youngsters uh  along with the mothers and i'm sure they are going to be the  stars of the future  they are coming here to watch the big stars in action   they're going to go back home wondering what they must do  and uh we have the president of the amateur athletic federation of india mr suresh kalmadi now addressing the uh athletes well that was uh mr suresh kalmadi the president of the uh  amateur athletic federation of india  uh his words uh to the congregation here at uh the sports complex  a complex which of course uh is a city by itself with uh so many beautiful stadium uh which are capable of hosting almost  all the sports during the last national games the last national games which were held in uh uh january uh start of the year uh only six of them were held in uh bombay  mr mukal vasnik the union minister for sport uh looking at a vision in the distant future  uh he spoke of a four year plan for all the federations of sports  and uh this mission would take india from uh strength to strength as we march on into the  and uh the national record is in the name of shakti singh at uh sixty-one point seven two  we are watching the start of the women's three hundred metres  which has two indians here  we have rosa kutty we got shiny wilson  now that's the well shiny wilson has got about  a good rate yesterday where you have some good athletes you come to win here again come to gain gold medal   a few words  chinese second position at the moment  but the national record is in the name of jyoti sikdar  at two minutes o one point six zero a beat record in the name of yuan grabbermine of germany   it's very hot chase  very hard chase this  katherine maenhout belgium in the first position at the moment  shiny wilson in third position  shiny coming up now let us see what she is going to do now  oh that looked like big break of shiny wilson and let's  see now whether she is going through  striding strongly is natalia dukhnova she's  second in the world championship silver medalist in the world championship  and shiny going for all she can   she's done better in uh europeans on european circuit and it's shi shiny  can do it just now  dukhnova striding back shiny also coming through only a little bit more for a stride got through the back stride very close  but she just cannot make it   that's dukhnova natalia the second in the world championship and champion here the one with the dark glasses  number two two six natalia dukhnova of belarus  second close second was shiny wilson  normally shiny never comes up with such a finish but it definitely looks like that she has improved in the finishing business  and the european circuit has done her well well that's the action replay for you i think shiny is starting a wee bit uh at the bitter end and uh dukhnova of belarus full of experience striding away  it looked so near for shiny but uh it wasn't to be as uh  natalia dukhnova of belarus there she breaks the tape now to win the women's eight hundred metres final and uh edging out  shiny wilson from india and to complete uh the event uh in third spot was uh cydesen karen of denmark  so the teams here uh taking there first medal  and we're watching the uh prize distribution of the  women's four hundred metres  the uh prizes being handed out the medals by the union minister for sports shri mukul vasnik uh to anja rooker of germany who won with the time of fifty-two point two zero  richa hedid of the united states fifty-two point five eight takes the silver  and bi ziagun of china coming in third spot uh  happiness all over her face fifty-two point nine zero  and uh that certainly makes a very happy picture for uh the albums of these three athletes posing with uh shri mukul vasnik the youthful minister for sports  remember we are here at uh the shri shiv chattrapati sports city in pune for the seventh addition of the international permit meet  held on six earlier occasion in uh new delhi at the jawaharlal nehru stadium  and uh it's this is the first time that uh it being hosted at pune  as we move over to the uh men's discus  a hundred and seventy-one ajit bahduria of india  the crowds on their toes at the far end trying to see the  finest athletes uh in action   that's ajit bahduria with the discus  jurgen schultz the world record holder much expected from him  and uh these children in colourful clothes just going off your screen watching uh jurgen schultz at the discus  interruption  we had a very colourful opening uh today here at pune  that's jurgen schultz a fine action replay his uh body coordination   that's what has made him uh record holder at the discus in the world and the germans have always dominated this event  interrupton  they all set for the eight hundred metres which has record olympic champion william tanui in full black  willaim tanui is one great sensational runner alternating between the eight hundred and the fifteen hundred metres   it's unfortunate that paul ruto expected here didn't finally come  otherwise it would have been a sensational race between one the world champion and the other the olympic champion  but we have william tanui here and in the interruption  here the six uh we have two indian runners avtaar singh the best for the four hundred metres in india and jercy matthew  they are organised deliberately put put both of these indian runners together in three hundred because avtaar singh probably could come in in the relay basically the relay for india is very important four by two hundred metres relay and of course both the women four by hundred and four by two hundred metres relay and just for the statistical minded the meet record in the name of billa contella of kenya one minute forty-five point nine three and uh once again surprising john the indian record still  quite old shri ram sing one forty-five point seven seven yeah they don't make them like shri ram singh and milkha singh these days 
well alternatively we also have the women's long jump  at the other end but we shift our attention to the men's  eight hundred metres all is set now and uh  just look out for that man in the full black william tanui if natalia dukhnova uh went full ahead after the first lap in full red  this time it is william tanui in full black but mind you there are five kenyans in this race you really can't say about these kenyans  they just run and run  there goes the start interruption  the first hundred on the track and then shifting it by when you cut into the first lane  william tanui in third position at the moment  two kenyans in the track  but looks like vincent malakawen and henry lebo  but running very easily is william tanui the man in full black  applause interruption  you see that old bunch of there and here is avtaar singh coming in there on your screen interruption  first is the kenyan interruption  now look in second position william tanui interruption here is they all running crowded interruption  now that is william tanui now  two hundred metres free row  another kenyan in the front let's see now whether  it's going to be like kiptanui who was beaten but this time  william tanui still there applaud interruption  oh the great fight between three kenyan  william tanui has fallen behind and another one has come through at number one one two interruption  robert kibbet of kenya was a surprise winner here  so as uh they say in kenya one runner after another comes through so here is another champion coming  now look at this robert kibbet coming from behind  he was in third position and he stretch right through  and went on to first position  william tanui came in too late  he did manage to come through to second position but kibbet had made the break through at the right moment and thus robert kibbet the winner of the eight hundred metres  but you couldn't have asked for any finer isn't it john ? oh yeah it's because uh they keep saying in the interview last evening both this uh uh kip tanui and william tanui that you can never say in kenya who can win and who can't  today and who can win tomorrow  well that's the stuff that the kenyans are made up of  and there they are the three of them acknowledging the greetings from uh this very hospitable crowd here in pune  i think they will be acknowledging everything that has been good  and i think uh john this has been the best race of the day so far yes this was a very good race because uh he came right from the outside and came in  well what is it that uh makes the kenyans uh keep on clicking in these races ? now recording broken  well it's going to be steve watt continue from the score board end   men's javeline uh as we welcome you viewers uh  back to the shiv chhattrapati sports complex and here is  vladimir dubrovschik he has the personal best of sixty-eight point eight zero metres and he's really gone mad because he obviously has shown he can be a discus to the best stretch  well john i think he's happy because that's  what happened he won look likes the discus edging out the hot favourite jurgen schultz of germany and over the last ten to fifteen minutes he has been full of joy and ecstasy   he's taken out two or three of his t-shirts and given them away to the crowd  and the joy is written clearly all over his face and body  for a man of his stature top as he is now he is doing the laugh of honour vladimir dubrovschik of the ukraine  and what a happy moment this is for him  well the germans have been a great favourite in the discus but uh it's uh an upset for uh the germans here  jurgen schultz beaten by his own game toto of mix one word  and that that will be victory ceremony for the men's long jump the winner once more a chinese lan jong of china clearing seven point eight two metres  so the chines uh bringing a few surprises john  in second spot vladimir maleiwind of turkmenistan  seven point seven seven metres  and uh taking the bronze uh the jumper from oman ahmed  obed bashir seven point four five metres  so the uh chinese uh continuing with the success story here at the shri shiv chattrapati sports city winning one more gold medal and uh that's the finish of the women's fifteen hundred metres which uh ended in victory for the irish girl sonia  o'sullivan the hot favourite for this event as john describe earlier on  yeah sonia o'sullivan has has gone to win  but i would like to after since she has is in the way to winning streak at the moment  and you can see what a lovely play she over through to roja kutty and then third to run and of course two words she was the only challenger for her and she kept away two words as well  that was the women's  seven of them in contention  three from india jagjit singh tony verghese and uh satbir singh  the uh national record is in the name of satbir singh seventy-five point two two  let's pick up action in the women's uh uh long jump  elena govorou of ukraine she's on your screen now  the uh women's uh long jump record the uh meet record in the name of lalita brednaya of russia six point eight nine  let's get back to men's juveline again  two of the field events uh going on at uh the same time at different parts of the ground  the women's uh long jump and uh the men's  juveline  well we coming on late  the other meet is coming on now first will be the b wing and then we come on straight carl lewis emmanuel tuffour of ghana  well while we are at the men's juveline uh we and uh while we did describe about merelene ottey holding on to uh  the women's two hundred metres where uh it was expected from her  there has been an upset in men's discus which we announced earlier on and uh the winner there the official result having come in is uh vladimir dubrovschik in eight metres  and uh he upset the apple cart with uh nick winnie of irelend finishing second sixty-one point nine two and uh the german the world record holder jurgen schultz uh in third spot sixty-one point three eight  so on a day when merelene ottey john held on to the expected title jurgen schultz has lost out jurgen schultz uh did say but he was not in the best streak of the moment and he was not throwing the seventy-four which he felt when he set the world record in nineteen eighty-seven  but uh he himself did not dream that he could throw seventy-four point zero eight  and even convinced i beleive for the judges were lying when they said that that was the world record  but jurgen schultz as i said earlier is alternating between  grip practices for the discus throw and also in his sports promotion business because as he said i want to get money because uh he doesn't make as much money as the carl lewis or sir jack  whooker  well john uh the action is now centred at uh  the hundred metre  that's right the blue ribband of uh all athletic races and the name which is uh going to be there where all eyes are going to be focused is uh the eight times olympic gold medal winner and uh the same time that he won the world championship  uh carlson fredrick lewis better known to all of us as carl lewis  he is uh drawn in the second of the uh men's one hundred metres  the uh you have permit meet record for the hundred metres in the name of uh thomas jefferson another fine u s athlete set way back in nineteen eighty-nine ten point two zero  and uh the indian record in the name of r uh gyanshekaran  uh ten point six zero   you have  now in the first hundred metres which is schedule for now  you have two oman runners and in lane three you have gurvinder singh  of india  now these  and i was telling you uh you have two runners from oman  in this first three hundred metres race  and these oman runners are good uh for the four hundred eight hundred fifteen hundred but uh these days uh in the middle east we are having some of the best best coaches from abroad to push their talent  but you could expect uh some of these boys to do well  in uh the asian games at hiroshima  this uh first race in the hundred metres of course will be uh  just uh a teaser for you because in the next one comes carl lewis patrick stevens emmanuel tuffour donald and sherry all great sprinters today on the grand prix circuit  patrick stevens of belgium  well john if you remember uh uh there can always be an upset if you remember one of the first but uh beaten by a lesser known  austr austria   aust  as uh i as carl himself said i know that the contest is going to be very good  and this boy from ghana emmanuel tuffour running in lane five  for that kick ten  and here is the victory ceremony for the eight hundred metres you have shiny wilson the the former record holder for the event which she lost when jyoti mohit sikdar set the new record at  the european circuit  well there is the winner of the women's eight hundred metres natalia dukhnova of uh belarus two minutes zero two point one zero second  and what a fine run she had sporting the uh very famous sunglasses uh which has now become a part of international sport  whether it's athletics football or cricket  shiny wilson uh second with two minutes o two point three two and uh shiny gets a a warm kiss from uh the one who finished first in the race  and that's the bronze medal winner uh cydesen karen of denmark the dane winning uh coming in third spot two minutes o seven point three one second  all squad there in fact everybody thinking as gurvinder singh in the screen from india  he is one of the upcoming hundred metres runners  john and this reminds us of uh the man who lit the flame today uh the man who held his national record and the title for a long long time adil somadiwala isn't it ? yeah  we have a chinese in lane five  now let's see what this chinese man is going to do because already the chinese have shown even with the very few that have come out to pune here that uh they have some good stuff in their country even present uh well uh they are going to do or not uh well uh i mean uh they have not got of course the best from out there  but even those that have come here have done well  john the americans have all these uh health way in the  hundred metres strength for  yes of course  you see has come in  and of course uh everybody has read that uh dimple christly incidently is also from jamaica but now uh is uh settled in england  and a good one word citizen today  and another name which we can't forget is baleri bourgoef with one hundred and two hundred  yeah the only russian to be a sprinter which gone  who has become immortal because he came out at the time when the american were in full sway  rajiv balakrishnan from india  he is running in the hundred metres here  rajiv balakrishnan is not on the list of runners but uh  he is doing the hundred metres free race  and let's see if he he could come in because he is training more for the two hundred metres because uh if the indian team goes to hiroshima then rajiv balakrishnan will run both the  fou hundred four hundred metres relay as well as the four hundred metres uh  so let's see if he can win this the hundred metres free race uh in the national games here interruption   that's one close start rajiv balakrishnan and  that's gurvinder singh in your feature screen  the chinese there also  john and the tension lying it's not only on the athletes but everyone out here as well   lying  yeah the hundred metre is always does that to everybody  because that is the race everybody looks ahead to and uh of course that is a day of great spectacle in any athletic meeting  anywhere in the world  there is another chinese in the second hundred metres race as well and that is that tall person standing behind in second lane  waiting for his trial to come over  and the chinese in the first year in this race you can see in lane two   that's merlene ottey is here  sweet talking to the sports men of slovak vasnaik  applause  it looks like the chinese in the front here is the great fight between korea yes it is looks like that the chinese china athlete who has won  and he did it so nicely one hundred and ten  strangely enough his name is not on the list of competitors yeah  that was rajiv balkrishnan in the blue shorts one seven five  and here is the replay  on the first lane is uh al maksai saidewoma and the chinese runner down in the middle with gurvinder singh  struggling there to keep in the forefront  and look at the end as the chinese runner surges ahead

edward aranha goes into  a very very feeble push on to the right of the goal keeper teja singh  and teja singh was confused soul to judge as to where the ball was going  and this goal coming in the

mascarenhas forward pass  no one to take it all over the sidelines of the air india one punjab sindh bank zero  bhupinder third position gets a very good pass to gundeep gundeep now moves ahead  off

going over the backline   it's in a free hit towards the left flank from punjab sindh bank  good scoop intercepted but  down comes gundeep gives it to ramsharan ramsharan down to left flank  but fails to beat surinder who loses control a free hit to air india free hit going over the sideline on the hit in for punjab sindh bank  nearly twenty one minutes of play gone through air india  leading by a goal  score in the seventeenth minutes of first half by aranha and for the continuation of commentary in hindi it is abhay chaturvedi   in india  abhay i would just like to say one thing five of the  interrupt land  for the air india team now darryl d'souza and  edgar mascarenhas they are infact trained as defendant  but these are the two players who besides being playing as defendants they are always leading the attack  and they are always keeping them forward on the move whereas  there in the punjab sindh bank team the size of these a few words is very long  ah ramsharan gundeep ripudaman  they have not been able to combine well whereas the air india forward they're just lurking near the goal mark  they just get hardly chance at the two words  they would have been thrown up but for aranha that you cast in last line who catches the one with one day and centrally  one word feeling i don't know whether you agree with me or not punjab sindh bank having nearly five internationals is kill their act but i think over confident must have started with that  and this is what you are paying for your over confidence  and so far they have not been able to combine well and all the players played so far ah practically you a few words  before we leave on to catch the relay a few words  i was considering they got just four chances  and out of the four chances they converted three  fourth one was edward aranha a ball going just by yard  otherwise the goal keeper was awake there was no one to  to me it appears the punjab sind bank defence does not know what it was to be  they are running everywhere but not marking defence  who lies the whole side aranha here follows rajesh chouhan and darryl d'souza alex d'souza all coming into the attack nobody is marking  they come into the attack and immediately don't go back  that only shows their partners their thinking which the punjab sindh bank boys two words  the two words  and they are more uh selfish  if ramsharan gets the ball he goes down the left flank he doesn't look for a opening they are along with him  same is the case with uh uh gundeep they have got a very good chance and gundeep has given a back pass to ramsharan  a swing way down the near the right back line  and from here specially  once they go after the back line they are tied because they can't do it  now here is the punjab players back on the crease   the leading team has to prove a few words playing final of the third lala bhim sain memorial invitation hockey tournament  at shivaji stadium  venue of many international tournament  the punjab sindh bank boys just relaxing but no strategy is being formed  again on your same replaying delhi policeman in hindi  punjab sindh bank going into the field  now the second half will start  abhay the three goal lead in the final   it's a very great moral boosting  in fact punjab sindh bank was expected to do very well  played very well  for them it is demoralising  in second half we'll have to see whether they would be able to recapture their form and fight back  yes they have thirty-five minutes or so  because one can't imagine that the punjab sindh bank won't come back into the game  they have the capacity they have the capability but the only thing is they will have to stretch during individual approach  and combined and move ahead with a combined move  here are they air india team on the screen and number eight  where  this rajinder amar on the right side of the screen  with yellow shirts is the punjab sindh bank team and right in the middle with the red shirts on the right is t s bullard the international umpire and on his right is kukoo walia another international umpire  now there goes the scene form rest of the day i shall  suppose the former lieutenant governor of delhi  the punjab sindh bank team being introduced to him  this is narender former international umpire  sorry here is bullard the international umpire kukoo walia  and now the air india team  edgar mascarenhas now introducing his boys to the former lieutenant governor h k l kapoor to his team mates from air india  the four teams presented with the souvenir of this tournament all there is over the two teams take their respective places  punjab sindh bank will attack from right to left  now already down by three goals  they will have to work very hard to get back into the game and the morals of the air india boys is very high  and one thing very notable that the air india defences they are marking their players very well  they are not letting the rafter gundeep and uh ripudaman  ball on to the side and they know the passing would be given to one of them and they are marking it very well  all the attempt of punjab sindh bank to pass on the ball  to either ramsharan gundeep or ripudaman are being frustrated by the passmanship of the well marked passing by the defenders  of air india  air india to start on the second half  edward aranha with the ball the one who scored the first two goals in the seventeen and twenty-third minutes the third goal coming of that stick of rajesh chauhan in the thirty-third the first half itself  back pass chauhan to harpreet on to the right for clive d'souza   that's superb  good take work  to darryl darryl gives it to mascarenhas edgar now from there to rajesh chauhan good shot but it fine play by goalkeeper teja  corner hit by him mascarenhas free hit air india  between the a few words  aimless forward pass over the backline  ripudaman rajinder quick pass to gundeep pasha side by umpire kukoo walia  free hit for air india  first hit for the in the first second half itself by punjab sindh bank that showed their determination now  but lets see  rajinder gundeep keeps at the ball free hit for air india ball with darryl d'souza darryl d'souza  forward to aranha aranha to alex d'souza   d'souza to aranha 
 in hindi  another arjun award winner this sandhya agarwal  and of course we have the cricketing manager of the indian side  uh the third arjun award winner santarangaswamy managing this team  diana eduljee  quite a delivery indeed but the batsman there on the crease  unable to study the ball unable to read the ball are not taking chances of leaving the crease  diana  left arm round on the leg stump  no attempt for a shot  and thirty nineth over completed with diana completing her sixth over two maiden ten runs and one wicket  in just misfield you see franklin and jose now discussing as to the strategy what should be adopted at this stage of the game the fortieth over will be in progress the run rate here as given by our scorer immediately and  it's two point four one  two point four one a very low rate of scoring  not a recitable total to bowl at and australia will have to do something about it right now  before it's too late to recover from the say of ninety-four for six  pramila  see it's pramila from the darya ganj end amar  yeah  and still a spin attack going on although there is a slight breeze on the uh ground today  a little breeze the flag swinging the flag are waving and you can see that the pacers although not very successful they haven't been operated for a long time   it's the spinners who are taking the field today  and first ball fro from pramila  going away from the point  two runs three runs  uh ninety-seven franklin moves on to eight ninety-seven for six the fortieth over in progress  how many overs have all today could you let me know number of overs the pacers bowl today  so it's uh one three o five  five overs five overs each five each ten  so ten overs have been bowled by the pacers see it's pramila the right arm spinner  and the leg stump ball punished but diana right there  the stroke coming in directly to the wicket keeper's hand and the australian run restricted to only two  only one run being taken ninety-eight for six  wonderful throw from the boundary line  for franklin and jose we have told you about the  achievements of franklin young player an upcoming player from the australian squad who ha who are visiting india for the first of the match in the series  here is pramila right arm elbow moved up and on the off stump first into the covers  a little misfielding  single there ninety-nine  quicking towards that wretched mark of hundred but number of overs bowled a little too many for this total ninety-nine for six  appeal jose out and the appeal there  the response is positive by the umpire  you see the batsman returning  and abhay what do you think of this ball ? jose goes back for total of individual total of seventeen  this this session always necessary to know what type of bowling is there and she has come on last evening say she is a  off spinner  she is very success successful  bowler in the nineteen ninety-three world cup where she had a  very good throw with wonderful fielding  she is a very good fielder also  and she is coming up from the darya ganj end  she gave her to guess that sneak off jose and anju jain was right there behind the stump collecting it  anju you can see her there now reaching which is behind franklin  and that's a wonderful shot off the toes turning the body a little bit and uh between the mid wicket and mid on  three runs  they wouldn't go for the fourth  a very fast running between the wickets  before aarti vaidya return to ball three runs added hundred completed for australia  hundred and two in forty point two overs and time taken of course time is not required in the over match  and now we can get a little flavour of the one day match  being played here between india and australia  very good delivery bringing in the ball a little diana eduljee  for a minute difficult to suspend  very articulate vital spot read the batting and there she is frightened one this time  two fielders outside that white line  faster one  not bowling to the field at the moment the faster one wanted to see how the batman  ca respond to such delivery the long off and long on kept but  the last delivery was flatter and faster  and batsman number eight has twelve runs to the credit and the  by the spinners and of course the spinners have been doing remarkably well in this match  franklin taking t s pramila  pramila is the captain of the champion side which won the rani jhansi trophy the air india team and this is t s pramila  another mis- fielding  little bit of mis-fielding there at mid wicket and before the ball is retrieved by lea francis one run added hundred and three for seven franklin thirteen  valuable thirteen valuable runs at this stage  although the rate of scoring is low  australia now moving up on to the target for better total  the weather brightening up a little the sun streaking in  and just when the lunch break is coming the weather  improving  t s pramila bowling franklin  quick  bright facing t s pramila  bright she is giving all the strike to franklin  and bright played this ball uncomfortably losing her balance going on the off side and not being able to maintain her balance to go for any type of stroke  see here pramila elbow high right arm going over  and this one bringing this one ball from the off stump so as it has to turn a little before she could try this ball  but not a good choice to get her fetch her any run  the score remains at hundred and three for seven  the forty second over being bowled  slightly delivery on the off stump but a vast covers head  two runs easily  the cover being too close not moving behind fast enough to get underneath the ball two runs added to the total hundred and five for seven  the forty first to point two overs at the moment the score is hundred and five for seven  diana eduljee that mesmerising left arm spinner of india  operating from the club house end  on the leg stump  a lovely bit of fielding indeed  and i think the indian squad now with a little bit of strike from the australian side has awakened up to good fielding and ria sen good cricket after a long time  a little subdued moving that has gone brightening up now  short pitch right there in the middle  fielded no run as aarti bajaj mid off  left arm going round  not a good contact and finally shastri there at mid wicket at the square leg  the bat and the ball not in a perfect condition of contact  uh delivery on the leg side open up too early the batsman open up too early uh and uh another uncomfortable defensive half defensive stroke didn't go for a hit neither did she come for a forward defence  hundred and five for seven  bright two franklin  attempted cut and of course successful with it  two before the ball is retrieved by aarti vaidya and returned to the wicket keeper  two uh added to the total of australian total of hundred and five now hundred and seven for seven  hundred and seven for seven three wickets remaining two overs remaining  this forty fourth over being bowled  t s pramila from the darya ganj end bowling to bright faster delivery and came in straight to the keepers hand  anju unable to read that delivery of pramila came off herself lucky not to get it touched it with bright  variations in pramila's delivery the last one came in the last of her delivery bringing in the nineth over with two maiden sixteen runs being given away she's captured one wicket so far  at delivery and that is the intelligence diana applies whenever she bowls to cricketers bowl to the opposite side  she is always leading the batsman she saw batsman ready for setting out and uh coming close to the ball and uh here she is  with that classic delivery of hers in the last over  so franklin returned to the pavillion at the score of hundred and seven  and here is the last wicket  so it's collin rose collin at the crease now to face diana  five balls remaining   two words one day international women's  cricket match which is being played between india and australia  welcome to the nehru stadium where the second one day international between india and australia is taking place  we are with you when the third over is taking place  and rose collin just about to bowl the third over  this is the first ball in the third over a beautiful ball it is  and i must tell you my co commentator today is a great cricketer chandu sarvate who is going to give you the  commentary in hindi in the second one day international match  the first ball from the australians where india took three runs and after that in the second over was a maiden over and this is the third over the second ball of the third over  it is anju jain who is facing rose collins no runs to be taken  and it's a the australians w have already proved their ability in the fielding in fielding as well as they have done a good bit of bowling in the end  and this rose collin who will be operating the opening bowler  she is operating from the club house end  the morning is bright and sunny and just lovely for cricket  so this is going to be a fifty over match each side  three overs there is third over being bowled five runs and uh the indian batsman now facing rose collins is aarti vaidya the left handed batsman  and this girl rose collins has been swirving the ball  with this weather and have been able to really disturb the batsman from the very first over  a six footer she said her mother is six feet four inches  and quite a good height for a pace baller  i must tell you about this girl rose collins who got a very good average in the first one day international  six overs two maiden she has given only sixteen runs  the runs given away matters in the one day international  the bowler from the other end is now joe grace  in the first one day international it was anjelo o'neil  from the other end but now it is joe grace who is bowling from the hospital end five for no loss india five for no loss  facing is aarti vaidya and the bowler at the other end is  joe grace  joe grace's average in the delhi one day when she came in to bowl after five bowlers her average was seven overs four maiden eight runs and two wickets  and that effort of hers has brought her into the opening bowling stand and she is bowling from the hospital end now  and that was a marvellous ball going away that too from the left handed batsman that is coming into a right handed batsman  and joe grace a left hand middle order batsman the vice captain of the team the right arm fast medium bowler has been utilising the  weather today  the bright sunshine has got a little bit of air we can see the swerves in the flag and the flags waving  joe grace coming in once more  aarti vaidya  and that's olivia who returned the ball and before that we already have runs added to the  indian total three more runs added and valuable three runs  and of course this wicket as mister salvador told you uh is a good wicket   bahut acchi  joe grace from the hospital end  and she has been able to really beat the batsman once more aarti vaidya playing early the ball coming in a little late  and being wrapped up in the pad  and aarti the left handed batsman the opening batsman of the indian team score has been quite successful scoring twenty-nine runs in the first one day international is now facing joe grace  so that was the over of joe grace  and in this over she gave away only two runs  quite commendable bowling and of course always disturbing the batsman  she has been able to extract and get swing the ball keeping a little low of course and that is one reason why the batsman possibly are not being able to go for runs in this early part of the innings  rose collins to resume one slip   we'll show you the field placing  this is rose collins getting ready just seen beside the captain  that's how her runner is a right arm bowler   in hindi  so that was before julian langle returned it  runs added to the indian total and total moves on to eight for no loss  eight for no loss  rose collins about to bowl  the ball again came in to the left handed batsman and we see the ball swirving out  going out through a right handed batsman at one slip  this is a left hander aarti vaidya though the ball is  moving away from her  and the first odd right in on the wrapped up on the leg  and there is an appeal from rose collins  turned early the ball came in late  and aarti vaidya caught there a little outside the wicket according to the judgement of the umpire  and there she is just about to resume  but she has to really be careful she has not been meeting the ball quite well this morning  and right on the stump once more but very careful this time is aarti vaidya  taking her legs no gap between the bat and the pad and she is playing with that one slip you can just see in fact there are no other closer seen but of course there is a double gully wide apart

felicitating the luminaries of the world of indian cinema  professionals who have committed themselves to attaining a hallmark of excellence  for a beginning ladies and gentleman how about welcoming all the award winners with a round of applause   it's also a great previlege that later in the evening  respected rashtrapatiji dr shankar dayal sharma will be here to present award and also to address us  and now it's time to begin this evening ceremony with words of welcome by mr bhaskar ghosh secretary ministry of information and broadcasting  ladies and gentleman mr bhaskar ghosh  honarary minister of information and broadcasting shri  k p singh deo chairpersons of the different jury different phalke award winners award winners of this year excellencies  distinguished film personalities representative of the film industry the media ladies and gentleman  it gives me great pleasure to welcome you to this evening function to honour the artists and technicians who have con  contributed to cinematic excellence during the course of the year  indian cinema has today carved out a place for itself in popular imagination and convincingly left behind all other forms of entertainment  the credit for this goes to those innumerable artists who constantly endeavour to attain success of perfection while adhering to the indian spirit  over the years as a number of films produced has gone up  so has the number of national awards confer  three awards for feature films were given in the year nineteen fifty-four  today one hundred sixteen persons involved in fifty-one films will receive awards  we do need to review regulations for these awards and make further improvement to effectively encourage the best in indian cinema  shall we take this opportunity to greet all the award winners who are assembled here  we take justifiable pride in their achievements  and i earnestly hope that this recognition of their merit will act as an incentive to them to strive for greater excellence in their chosen disciplines  we have with us shri k p singh deo honourable minister for information and broadcasting to grace the occassion with his presence i extend to him a very warm welcome  the honourable president of india has also consented to join us today  we should be welcoming him in our midst later this evening  may i also welcome dr subbarama reddy chairman of the jury for feature films mr vikram singh who chair the jury for non-feature films and shri khalid mohammad chairman of the jury for the best writing on cinema  i also extend a very warm welcome to the past dada saheb phalke awardees shree jairaj shree ashok kumar  and shri bhupen hazarika  this years phalke award recipient shri majrooh sultanpuri other winners of national awards distinguished representatives of the film industry the media and special invitees who all here to share the pride and joy of this momentous occasion  thank you   in hindi  good evening  honourable minister for information and broadcasting mr k p singh deo the secretary information and broadcasting ministry mr bhaskar ghosh dadamuni bhupenda jairaj saab chairman of jury and distinguished guest  perhaps it would be churlish to say that the entries received  for the best popular cinema and this film criticism where by large  mediocre and substandard  on a more positive note let me state that it was an interesting exercise  to plough through the entries and separate the wheat from the chaff  a handfull of the books and articles indicate us that there is hope yet for analytical and insightful writing  the award wining book nalu nenu by the veteran actress dr bhanumati ramakrishna underscores the point that we need more candid and informative autobiographies from film personalities i need to hardly remind you that biographical accounts  written in west have been important adjuncts to the process of film making  for instance many of us have cherished the life stories  authored by the greats of cinema ranging from memorable biography of charlie chaplin to the flashback on the life and career  by vanessa redgrave  curiously very few of our own film luminaries have opted to put pen to paper  it would indeed be wonderful if directors technicians and the acting fraternity recounted stories of their tryst with the art and craft of film making  at this point i must regret the tendency of most indian publishers to capitalise on the deaths of film personality  whether it was the legendary meena kumari or the grand showman  raj kapoor scant attention was paid to the artistry during their own lifetime  in addition a note of caution has to be struck  the year nineteen ninety-five will be celebrated as the centenary of cinema the world over  if the event becomes an excuse for sketchy and quickly assembled books on cinema it would indeed be a pity  both research and reflection are essential before any major endeavour in film writing is undertaken  to come now to film criticism on the whole the entries in this section displays a thorough lack of humour  most of the reviews and the report submitted were weighed down  by excessive verbiage  without adding anymore verbiage of my own let me conclude with a small request to the authorities from me and my colleagues on the panel miss vasudev and miss uday tara nair could the cash prize in the categories of the best book on cinema and best film criticism be increased from the current amount of rupees fifteen thousand each  dare we say to rupees twenty-five thousand each that would be an extra incentive  here is ending then on the note of optimism  thank you  thank you very much khalid for presenting your comments  i now like to invite the chairman of the non- feature film jury  shri k vikram singh to present his address  good evening  honourable minister for information and broadcasting  shri singh deo secretary information broad   broadcasting shri bhaskar ghosh fellow film makers ladies and gentleman  it has been a great pleasure for me and other members of the non- feature film jury to see and select films for the non-feature film awards  i am happy with report that the documentary film in india is in a state of good health  and the short drama film is also picking up  this is despite the fact that the number of entries in the non-feature category has declined from one fifty nineteen eighty-five  to only sixty-eight this year  this decline i think is mainly on account of the fact  that is lot of non-fiction work has shifted from the film format to the video format  this body of work on video format is still going largely unrecognised  this jury has therefore separately recommended that documentaries and short films on the video format should be brought within the fold of the national awards  how that can be done is left to an expert committee  but there is one field of documentary film which is facing imminent death  this is the yarn of political documentary  there were very few political documentaries in this years entry  it is not as if the film makers have lost interest in this one word  perhaps the real reason is that the culture of respecting dissent is fast disappearing from our social political life  and therefore the social funding political films have died out  if different and even clashing views are not battled and sorted out on the floors of legislative body and in the media they are bound to violently overflow on the streets  there is an urgent need therefore for creating a framework  on our statefunded television that is doordarshan  within which voices of dissent can be responsibly expressed  i would urge the government as a research step  doordarshan should air off a weakly slot which may be called the other vaults the other views in this research oriented documentaries of the political nature  should be shown  these should be funded by doordarshan but the overall thing is monitoring of this slot should be vested in a non-political body of indepen of independent  intellectual  national film awards are a celebration of cinema as an art form a beginning was made several years ago to name an award  after dada saheb phalke and another award after

welcome to you from chandigarh  this is anu prashantiya reporting to you from  doordarshan jallandhar   we're bringing to you now the national lawn tennis championship nineteen ninety-four  the finals which are just about to be played on the chandigarh lawns here this morning  we have there the governor lieutenant general shibir sitting there in the grey suit awaiting the players coming on to the court seated next to him in the black blazer is mr vinod duggal  chief advisor to the administrator of chandigarh  we have the students the tennis players the ball boys there we have the governor going out to the court now for the inauguration of the final accompanied by mr rajan kashyap  the president of the chandigarh lawn tennis association  we have the governor now introducing himself to the players  their is asif ismail and mahesh bhupathy and now we have him introducing to the staff and the other members  he is being introduced by mr maria secretary  i have to introduce mr rajan kashyap and the governor  who are now in the process of being introduced to the players of chandigarh  i think chandigarh has it's rare honour today of having the national once again after almost fifteen years  last national not fifteen years it's about eleven years  the last national played was here in nineteen eighty-three in which we had vasudevan winning the mens' title and i won the womens' title here in nineteen eighty-three  so it's a great day for me to be here after winning the last national being played in chandigarh to come here and commentate today on this mens' and the womens' singles the court these are the ball boys the ball girls  having a talk with the governor  they are the trainees of c l t a as i've been corrected by my fellow commentator  i have to introduce mr mayan kapoor who's also an asian former tennis champion junior champion whom i have with me doing the hindi commentary  and that's the governor going back after meeting  all the players the students the ball boys and there we have the applause by everyone  green grass awaits the match though nationals is now  come of an age where we don't have very huge crowds watching the nationals probably because we don't have the a t t points and we do not  the boys here are the students who are the who've  come to watch the match  the huge stadium in sector ten in chandigarh  the students seem to be very keen on this sunny morning  i think probably the school has given them the day off to come and watch the match  there the hills behind i think chandigarh by and large is a beautiful city  beautiful city with lovely weather  and soon they have started and they've taken lawn tennis in a very big way as they made several grasscourts at the chandigarh club  and now we have the players stepping on to the court  mahesh bhupathy yesterday defeated nitin kar  kirtane  he was extended and he had won the match in three sets  and asif ismail beat k g ramesh in straight sets  asif ismail seems to be in a fitter condition because he just played in the davis cup match and showed great promise in jaipur  but he gave away under pressure  at the last minute he showed a lot of talent but he could not carry it on till the end  let us see how he fares in the match today  the players are now warming up and uh that asif ismail   that's mahesh bhupaty now  mahesh bhupathy on your screen now interruption much thinner than interruption  players are now getting ready for the match  we have uh from the commentators box we have asif ismail uh  asif ismail serving to mahesh bhupathy  first serve  uhm just missed the line  oh that was an easy shot but missed by bhupathy  serving down the middle and the backhand uh of uh bhupathy and bhupathy i think got the ball right in his stomach  fifteen love  again score now is thirty love  first game first serve applaud  a lovely shot  asif ne abhi drop volley try ki lekin  drop volley was a little too far back and it was very easy for bhupathy to reach the ball  there we have the action replay  you can see the crosscourt it just touched the net cord  beautiful shot there by bhupathy  thirty fifteen  oh there was foul there  let them i think both are uh at the moment in the beginning not very well warmed up and from thirty love up  asif is thirty o  first first service  not a double four there by asif i think he should so early in the game he has had first game only two double fours  that was a great point for bhupathy however  service was a little too good for him  asif is not serving that well yet   he's capable of much better service  much much slower he's serving today that's  deuce  that was a well played point  after sent it went right upto th net that's what he should be doing after his service   haan service  and that's advantage point foul for service  i think abhi tak koi accha point one has not seen except one crosscourt forehand that's the replay  in hindi he's not showing  advantage again to asif  there he's taken the first game asif by a good  service down the line from the backhand court  and that's one love asif ismail's first game  inspite of three double faults asif has been able to foiled this game that shows that uh bhupathy has not really fought into this game  and uh we are finding asif looking back because what's  not on the screen is that the governor is leaving  and we have the replay of the point  service which is down the line and asif is still watching  the governor and everyone leaving  now we have the second game of the match   we're going to watch bhupathy serving to asif ismail i was just having a talk with the administrator of chandigarh  the advisor to the administrator and i was given to be   given to understand that c l t a the tennis complex is located in about three hundred acre green park  and there we have uh bhupathy serving his first serve  foul that's right  oh asif is trying for that four hand down the line but i guess he was standing up too straight for that shot  he needed to bend down because the net is usually a little bit higher on the sides  one needs to get down lower on ones' knees   that's fifteen love to bhupathy  fourth first service   that's a good variation in service from bhupathy a kind of a spin but however well vanished by asif ismail  we have that lovely passing shot  makes it fifteen all two three  we don't find much of excitement nobody is out there to try to break service  thirty fifteen fourth first service  that was a service return a bit too higher by asif ismail making it very easy for bhupathy to put that volley away   it's very important in these points in return of service to keep the ball low  and that game point came to bhupathy an easy service game there at forty fifteen  which makes it three games all first set  we find the usual crowd is also very quite  players are also lacking the enthusiasm  i think this game has uh still to heat up  oh  what ? fifteen love   there's that replay of the shot   there's a just a little bit out i thought and  there's a disagreement on that point  the linesman is just sitting quietly and that's  bhupathy arguing that that ball was right but i think there's not true really  simply it's a long argument there  fifteen love  oh ho that was a nice return there  i think uh asif ismail a little too early there that he play  is that put away very decisively but too close was bhupathy and he got that return  fifteen o  got first service cough  oh that was a lovely put away there  besides his forehand crosscourt volley by asif ismail   there's that top spin service an easy volley  because the ball was so high  i think the boys have to look forward to making their return of service much better  thirty fifteen asif  first first service   it's a very good shot return  wonderful passing shot there by asif ismail that was i think the longest rally in the match today   there's that action replay he had to run back to get  that log and there he's extended to the other end of the court and here we see the final passing shot the beautiful backhand down drive by asif ismail  so asif serving forty fifteen on his service first first service  oh ho there quick return there by bhupathy taking asif  into an unforge terrain   there's the replay again   he's rushing into the court and he's just caught on unaware this hits in the middle of the body line shot  still in its point to go for the game for asif ismail  all first service  beautiful shot return there by bhupathy a wonderful forehand down the line passing shot on asif service which makes it deuce now for the players  a chance there that wonderful shot once again you can see how well he converted his back hand and he went quickly before  asif could reach the leg   it's deuce  oh ho that was lucky that was really lucky high backhand volley there's that service and that's the high  backhand volley just touch the tip of the net and dropped off there   let's call a lucky shot at the right time  advantage asif ismail  oh he didn't really concentrate on that one it was not that difficult a shot  that was a lovely service a very good backhand volley crosscourt returned by mahesh bhupathy  and watch that service on the corner and he's right up at the net that's the game  oh beautiful shot there by asif ismail a wonderful backhand crosscourt return   he's right up at the ball  there is look at that stretching backhand volley and that  at the one word  fifteen fifteen thirty   bhupathy's service  uh just missed that was a lovely try by asif ismail going out for one of his big backhand crosscourt return to service but he just missed the line and that gives a chance to bhupathy to equalise the points at thirty all  first first service  oh lovely offensive lot there a beautiful shot touch of mastery there by asif ismail  that was a there's the replay and you could see the stretched backhand volley return and that's  the defensive lot   that's the break point for asif asif ismail the first break point in the match  oh a double fall there gives asif ismail the much needed break at the right time coming also which gives him a five three lead   that's asif ismail forty love the second game of second set  oops that was a unforge terror there  lucky shot  but he's got a good lead there that's the shot we're showing you again on screen and he's trying to drop volley but unsuccessful  the boys are running there on the court so asif chooses not to start his service  these students have to be asked to sit down  the screen is not showing it but the players are being disturbed because the children are moving at stadium  to come back on court childern have now by and large settled down   that's how asif regaining forty fifteen up  and love one for his second set  oops try to block that volley asif ismail but i think he did not put his racket down just let flat straight out  still in the lead asif ismail serving forty thirty  all first service  beautiful crosscourt backhand by mahesh bhupathy at the right time also   there's that wonderful crosscourt backhand  return of service which makes a deuce  all first service i think us break  ke baad he's lost his concentration  second service double faults so forty love there's  an advantage now  i think this uh taking this game too easy is could provide to be very risky for asif ismail   there's a break point now for the second time   that's it there is the break  there is the break which needed which bhupathy was looking for  mahesh up two love  forty love he was leading and there there he lost his concentration  first first service   it's a very weak return of service there  fifteen love second service  just a minute just about asif ismail is hardly showing any the serve in the game  in hindi  at the wrong time in hindi if continues to do this any further he's already one game down his service is lost  he can't afford to take it uh easy  beautiful service there  oh lovely passing shot there down the line by asif ismail that shows he's a man capable of class  thirty fifteen  a good service there in backhand pass corner of asif ismail  and bhupathy is with the safe lead over in third game  the move is set it's going to be difficult for asif ismail now  next second service  oop facing the sun bhupathy trying to give a smash  there was a miss hit there  bhupathy still in the lead with forty thirty on his service a decisive volley there gives him three love leads  i think this uh set is going to be little difficult might   there's the return of service you can see this defensive backhand crosscourt volley bhupathy showed a lot of consistency in this game which which a player even tries to bring up his game  at a certain depth  but now he should so that's love five asif ismail serving  a beautiful service down the forehand corner by asif ismail  down the line winner there making it fifteen all  his service lacked depth which is very easy to go for the down line  thirty all no fifteen all there and i think the students are moving again and disturbing asif ismail  good service but i don't find bhupathy at all stretching  himself  this was an easy ball he could have stretched himself and tried for a winner   he's standing there not even trying to move his left leg to move movements are so slow that's an out  thirty all 
 it's a great privilege for me to be commentating on the women tennis because uh of the past experience for nineteen eighty nineteen years lawn tennis  i was just before the match speaking with uh nirupama that on the screen you see janaki  and uh janaki is from bombay and she is uh janaki is from bombay and she is uh looking fit at the moment  she has lost uh this is a wrong caption i think we are showing that about i was pointing out  uh this is this is nirupama that's nirupama and she is  seventeen years now  so i was just telling you telling the viewers that just before i entered the uh commentators box i was talking to nirupama and i was talking to her father  in fact we have her father here with us in the commentary box  and they both were telling me that uh nirupama was when she was about fourteen this girl was already uh uh number one in india she had won the national uh championship hard court and she has shown great promise  but again from the age of fourteen one never found her being picked up and groomed much earlier and she also suffers from the same problem she says now i'm already seventeen and  it's so late  and uh why didn't she go into big game and big tennis at the age of thirteen or fourteen ? the same answer that lack of finances lack of support and uh  for women tennis i don't think india is a right place at all   we've it's it's continuing for years on end  i remember the same thing used to happen uptil nineteen eighty-one until nineteen eighty-two till i played tennis and the same thing is continuing in ninety-four where have we come ten years from now   i'd like to uh uh interview her father in fact  why don't you come and share your views with us ?  we'll do that a bit later because we have the first game in progress  and that's nirupama serving the first serve  applause  beautiful crosscourt returned by janaki  love fifteen  you see janaki nirupama serving now to janaki   that's a beautiful forehand down the line returned  applaud  and that's love thirty to nirupama on her service  keeping the ball in play nirupama claiming fifteen thirty  for the first set  next shot there a beautiful return by janaki cross again put away forehand crosscourt volley   that's the recaption again  a very good pick up there by nirupama makes it  fifteen forty   that's a drop shot there by janaki  nirupama did not even try for this ball i think it is far too long for her to run  in uh leading tennis unfortunately service has never played such a major role  and there we have first break  whereas in men's tennis it acquires much greater significance probably because the boys follow up their service to the net and the women even after serving tend to stick it on in the base line and that makes the service as good as any other ball  it looses it's significance altogether  when we have big service in the world like martina navratilova and  beligin king and they used to follow up their balls to the net and once they did that it made their service and it made their ball and made the volley much more effective  for it one has to stay around at the base line then service really  does not have that much of significance  we have the first break of nirupama and janaki up one love in the first set  we hope that the women's tennis is not such a wash out as it was in the men's cough  love fifteen  nirupama has beaten janaki earlier when they met this year  that's what she told me  the ball seems to be much faster on grass for janaki cough janaki serving love thirty  oh janaki is uh relying on this rough shot  but i don't find nirupama making any effort to come forward  this tactics of janaki is going to pay off untill unless nirupama tries to come up to the net  beautiful shot there by janaki a beautiful forehand crosscourt taking a round of the court  equalising the score at thirty all  first of service  forty thirty cough  beautiful shot there by nirupama taking on the offensive for the first time and hitting that ball crosscourt forehand  there is that replay a slight backhand return by janaki and that the put away crosscourt  deuce first first service interruption  uh nirupama trying to make a winner out of it second return second service however she missed the points she went in the prickly part where the ball didn't got   that's deuce once again first first service  return of service good return of service by nirupama  cough  i think that nirupama really threw away that point she had a break point from janaki's service   it's not going to be a very easy match for her if she throws away such easy points  good backhand  oh janaki just could not keep up the consistency and hit the ball double fisted backhand out  advantage once again to nirupama to take a break back into the first set  second service janaki serving advantage to nirupama safe backhand return  beautiful shot there by nirupama who's taken on the offensive hitting on both the flags very beautifully and has broken that service of janaki making it one game all  and there's the replay of that shot that wonderful forehand crosscourt winners and no way could janaki ever reach that ball one game all first set  very good return of service there by janaki meeting the ball early and using the timing of the service   there's that  quick return of service there by janaki and that's  the return of nirupama through down cough  yes janaki slices the ball far too often   that's a nice shot there by janaki making it  thirty all  he took she took the ball on the line that's the replay and you see her totally bent in total position going in for that tidal line forehand winner  oh that was just total bad luck she tried to hit forehand crosscourt  i think she needed to bend a little more  nirupama serving forty thirty  foul out   that's deuce once again  nirupama needs to get back into the game with more consistency now beautiful shot there by janaki brought the low ball low ball returned beautifully by janaki there  see how low the ball is keeping see and she is able to  hit that winner  uhm good service there by nirupama stretching around the backhand corner  and justifies only low return  deuce once again  foul first service advantage janaki  third person  wonderful top spin backhand return by janaki forcing  nirupama to deuce once again  now a drop shot there by nirupama  i don't think she really wanted to hit that shot it was  stroke of luck that fell so short  in grasscourt say if it is a drop shot it gets uh difficult to handle it cough  that game to nirupama leading two one in the first set  to carry on the commentary mahin kapoor  to carry on the commentary mahin kapoor  she is coming out with the shots which in the beginning she wasn't  she is getting to the winner she's getting the rhythm now  and is able to reach the ball faster and even the timing of the ball is much more accurate with her now  and uh  beautiful  that was a beautiful shot there by janaki krishnamurthy what all can see here is the low rally which they had  this kind of of best long rally uh in the match here there you can see the crosscourt backhand return and once again a crosscourt return by nirupama and down the line winner  all are just  beautiful shot there by nirupama  beautiful shot out of the blue  you could see nirupama doing a little variation in that game  she started tossing the ball a little higher  you could see that toss now   that's the winner across she sprung out of the blue fifteen all  oh that's nirupama's mistake there  she needs to steady down a little more  fifteen thirty uh thirty fifteen   that's janaki a few words which is not called for at the moment at all   that's the beautiful slice uh combat between the two  girls a shot slight backhand combat with two words it went on and on until the janaki gave up   that's a break point for nirupama and a set point also of the first set   that's it the set goes to nirupama at six two   in hindi   in hindi she played very well  see what nirupama was rightly telling me is that uh she has showed potential much earlier  but she says that uh nobody did anything for me  and i had no financer  in fact i told her you're from tamil nadu and tamil nadu does a lot but she said no i have not got anything from any support from any quarter  the women's tennis also needs to be picked up you see beautiful but missed shot there by janaki first  thirty love to nirupama  lovely shot again  nirupama is really showing a lot of confidence in her strokes  just shaping up well playing well and she still has uh  good future ahead of her   in hindi   in hindi and then uh nirupama also needs to go up on the net much more than she has taken her position  oh that ball was called out so forty fifteen to nirupama janaki is not showing any signs of coming back  in the beginning game of the second set  oh ho beautiful shot there by janaki i think that she's really gone out of the way with the slight backhand and forehand crosscourt return there   that's the replay and that's the crosscourt shot that janaki gave up   it's beautiful crosscourt winner  forty thirty to nirupama  easy return beautiful shot there easy sitter there sitting there for nirupama to put on net  you know there is one thing i wanted to share with you mahin   haan and also for the benefit of our viewers  that ours uh that see uh replay which we've been watching then i'll share it with you there is that put away shot which gives her a game  you know in our country it's very difficult for women to come forward at this level  see for men it's much easier  our country it is very traditional and a women has to perform many roles  she has to also be a housewife  she also has to be a daughter at home she also has to do her studies  and if they come forward and perform like this in matches  then they should be encouraged because they have a triple role if they become a sportswomen  they have because in india sports alone is not enough they ask you what else are you ? what are you in your studies ? and are you an m b a ? or are you a ph d ?  it's very important in our country to be a ph d's  also  and plus a woman is never only a ph d and a sportswoman  she also has to look after her home she has to have babies  so therefore you know for a woman life is much more tougher  and if she comes out of her shell and becomes a sportswoman i think she needs all the applause and the encouragement which she deserves   haan   in hindi  but this nirupama is showing promise but in hindi  then the age is over applaud  fifteen all nirupama was saying she's uh  attending an academy abroad she's training there  just imagine the the expense and who is paying for it  now if the family is uske peeche  it's okay otherwise there's nobody  her mother is uh with her in the academy  uh nirupama nirupama  i remember for seventeen eighteen years my mother travelled with me otherwise who is there to be with us  she travelled all over the country with me  beautiful shot there by janaki  janaki can sometimes pull up some beautiful ground strokes  in hindi  she just needs a little more experience  over first service  uh but she is able to do that well did service and that one game all in the second set  but she returns the service is not very effective 
what i wanted to look at was all communication between different workers in industries at different levels in various organisations  uh and i was looking at i wanted to look at in fact i was interested in looking at both  the reported use of in uh english in industries and  uh the actual use of uh english in industries  uh because i thought there would be a difference  what you imagine you use is not always what you actually use uh you imagine you use a particular language but when you  uh when you are observed you find that there is or you observe yourself you find that you are in fact not actually using what you thought or what you imagined you use uh in different contexts with different people for different purposes  so i thought i would study both the aspects and compare the two  unfortunately for me i was not allowed to record anything at all in industries because for uh they felt that for security reasons they could not allow tape recorders on to  campus now this is one of the disadvantages this is one of the constraints under which i was working  so i thought well i confine myself to reported use only  and how did i go about this uhm well i thought i would select industries in andhra pradesh that is uh for no other reason except that i work there and i thought it would be easy for me to have access to various industries in andhra pradesh  now how was i to decide which industries i should take up for  my study  uh it would be difficult to decide and it was difficult to decide initially  then i thought i would look at uh a comparatively uh industrially advanced area industrially advanced area and a sta  uh uh uh a district that was industrially backward so that i would have the two extremes uh uh for my study  uh ju for that reason i said okay hyderabad is industrially more advanced and karnool district is industrially backward  so i took up these two districts the industries in these two districts for my study cough  now what kind of study was i going to get a representative industrial population from that again was very difficult for me to decide  uh finally i did some reading i uh did a bit of study  i tried to find out get information about the kind of industries one could have and i broadly classified these industries and there there is a classification available uh in the literature uh into public sector undertaking and private sector undertaking undertaking  that was the main classification  and then the other factor that i thought might affect  the use of language uh was location of industry  and this was very convenient for me to do because karnool district being backward had a large number of rural industries  now let me explain what i mean by rural   i by rural i don't mean a completely rural area  because that would be contradictory in terms you can't have an industry where you don't have the infrastructure for for an industry  so let us say by rural i meant very small towns or  uhm probably you would understand taluk better at the subdivision levels  so uh i classified my industries and i selected industries from hyderabad public and private and then hyderabad provided me with the urban sector and  uhm karnool with rural industries  then i decided on how i was going to collect this data  and uh since i had to i was almost compelled to  look at only reported use i had to think about how i was going to go about uh collecting data for reported use of english  uh when i say english uh please don't imagine that i forgot about the indian languages  i always looked at the use of english vis a vis  the indian languages that the employees there uh in these industries were using  now as far as methodology is concerned i thought i would go about it by first of all observing what went on in these industries  so general uh observation and i followed this up by a questionnaire and i refined my questionnaire as i went along on the basis of the observation cough  after my informants filled in the questionnaire i went about interviewing some of them i couldn't have interviewed uh all the informants because i had nearly four hundred informants  but i uh took a fairly large population and uh and therefore i was able to uhm interview quite a large number of informants  uh having collected the questionnaire i would look at their responses and then base my interviews on the basis of those uh uh  of their answers to my questions  one to check whether they were aware of what they had  answered they were aware of the reasons for their answers  also to check whether they had in fact read the questionnaire carefully and uh had answered these correctly some of them in fact it turned out that some of them in fact were not aware of what they have done they had just put ticks and  crosses uh for the sake of completing the questionnaire  so i had to do that to cross check to make sure that they did fill in the questionnaires  when uh i uh analysed this i'm i am saying all this very briefly because i wouldn't like to go into detail  i analysed uh these questionnaires the uh all that i have collected and also uh recorded my observations of their behaviour  and i tried to look at the association or the relationship  between the use their use of english with their  superiors equals and their juniors and relation  to the social variables  that is the relationship between their use of english with  superiors with equals and juniors and with the social variables  type of industry that is either public or private location of industry that is urban and rural  occupation and for occupation i had the uh higher level middle level and lower level of occupation  education again i had the higher level middle level and low level of education  medium of instruction in school  and i had i i i chose medium of instruction in school because that is where the the main differences is some people have english and some people have a regional languages or indian languages  and exposure to english that is whether they in fact  were exposed to a lot of english as far as their reading was concerned  magazines journals now this would also be uh i i predicted that this would be uh related to their jobs as well  depending on what their job was they would probably read the kind of literature that they needed for their jobs as well  now in addition to this i also looked at their attitudes  and i must admit i found it very difficult to assess their attitudes  i did get some uh uh a rough idea of what there attitudes were uh and i ag again related these attitudes their attitudes to english to the the variables that i had taken up earlier type and location of industries occupation education  medium of instruction exposure to english  uh now cough from my analysis of the questionnaire and on the basis of my observation of their behaviour  on the basis of my interviews uh these were the uh the conclusions i drew  the most general general conclusion that i drew was that  these people who are professionals who work in these industries had a very functional professional attitude to the use of english  they don't have a political bias at all  they are not bothered about whether the language ought to be taught or introduced at school or college or not except  when a except uh uh they would be bothered of course ex only when they were uh they considered the utility of that language for their profession  they felt that they needed english for certain purposes  they needed english to talk to uh their superiors for instance  now looking at the variables i found that the location of industry was a very very important variable as far as the uh use of english was concerned  it was a very important variable which affected the use of english  employees in rural industries for example specially those  who had to deal with handloom for instance who had to deal with spinning and weaving and who use only indigenous uh technology  did not need the use of english as much as did those who used foreign technology  and in fact their view on this was that they  as long as they were uh they were not as advanced as the western countries and uh one of them used the word begging-bowl  they had to use this begging-bowl for technology and knowledge they would be compelled to use those languages  that helped them to have access to science and technology to all knowledge that would help them to uh adva uh to uh to be industrially advanced that was their view about the use of english now the other the the the other variable that i found was very important was interlocutors that is those uh they the use of english depended on whether an employee was conversing with his superior equal or junior  and more english naturally was used while conversing with superiors another variable that was important was occupation this was another important variable that affected the use of  language and that also included the nature of their job  those who were highly technically qualified naturally needed to talk about technical matters more than those who were dealing for instance with administration who were not directly concerned with production  those who were directly concerned with production used much more english and felt they needed much more english because their job required them to use more english than those who dealt with administrative matters there were for instance the personnel branch where they had to deal even with the with uh with all those workers from the shop-floor for whom they had to provide say even things like uniforms and shoes  now they did not need english to converse with  those uh with with workers from the shop-floor and doors so they needed to use english much less than those who were  technically highly technically qualified and uh were required to discuss technical matters  uh the another another factor that affected english a great deal the use of english a great deal was context  this was a very important uh factor which affected the use of english  uh formerly for instance when they were at a meeting and i sat in them some of their meetings  when they were uhm talking to customers from outside  when they were at the office doing their daily work and transactions  they tended to use much more english than they did when they were say at a social get together  i attended some of their social get togethers and i found  that their get togethers were much more relaxed much more informal  and therefore there was less and less use of english more and more  use of indian languages  uh uh i am afraid i coudn't quantify the exact uh uh use of english and versus the indian languages but i can only say that there was a client english at the level of formality and this as we went down to more and more informal levels uh became more and more minus english and more and more plus indian languages  and also their attitudes as i said earlier their attitudes to uh the use of english uh were all based on the need for english the various functions they had to perform and they felt  that if a language helps them to do the job well well that was the language they were going to use they were not bothered about whether it had a prestige value or not  for them it was uh and some of them in fact said  sometimes it was an indian language that uh works as a lubricant they call it a lubricant if they wanted to uh get a job done they would suddenly switch over to their uh to their mother tongue  or to the local language  they they didn't bother about whether it was their mother tongue  certainly not which ever language they thought they could   effect effectively communicate in was used between them  and of course most of them felt that english was very essential for science and technology  now this is very interesting it was very essential for an individual's job opportunities and success at work  it was very essential for interstate communication  it was not at all essential for english at home for for communication at home  uh about english for education it is interesting to note that  they had uh different views some of them felt that  we should have english all the way so that all the sections of the people would get uh fair opportunity to learn the language  and therefore go up the social scale and also uh uh get more opportunities for work and for jobs  uh some of them felt that there was no need to learn english at uh uh upto primary school at the primary level because we should be we should give our children more opportunities to learn our own  languages indian languages  some of them felt that english should be introduced only  uh after middle school  they they felt that there was no need to do to introduce english and after middle school too it should be taught only as a subject upto high school  and it was only uh they were all of course unanimous in saying that english should be introduced only at the college level as a medium of instruction  so these are some of the as if the the findings of the study i haven't gone into very great detail because that would have taken me the whole day almost  uh these are some of the interesting findings that we uh that uh i came up with at uh at the end of the the the study 
this is the beginning of novels beginnings of novel in india  now before i take up this uh subject there is query from a colleague of ours from bombay  she has uh she is willing to know as to where we can get material critical material and creative writing on australian literature  because australian literature as you know is quite new  uh from amongst uh uh commonwealth literature uh lot of work is being done in canadian literature this is main mainly because  i am giving you this piece of information uh because there are number of fellowships and scholarships available for commonwealth uh studies and uh not many people are aware of these  now uh literatures in commonwealth again be divided into two parts one is white one is black  in white we have three major literatures australian  canadian and new zealand  uh and in black you know most of these literatures nigerian south african indian pakistani and other literatures  now there won't be many fellowships in as far as uh asian countries are concerned or african countries are concerned but there are some in west indians  and we also have a one word meeting next year in uh kingston jamaica in west indies  so those of you who are interested they could send their papers it means there are three themes   i once i remember on which i am presenting a paper is the theme of voyage theme of flight  uh this you can take up study one novel or one novelist or one writer how she or he has projected this theme in his uh writing in poetry or fiction for example uh it could be a voyage in case of one anita desai  desai from uhm outside world into inside world then she talks of you know inner world  this is a voyage so voyage can be interpreted in several ways  even this east west encounter is a voyage  so you we don't have to be scared of the theme you can write anything with voyage as the as the basic modem  this will be in west indies next year nineteen ninety-two  and uhm uh all applications have to be made to at one word london or the professor in charge there in jamaica in kingston  uh apart from that west indies we have uh  fellowships in canadian literature i think most of you know that at delhi we have an institute known as the shastri uh institute institute of indo-canadian studies  and they give large number of fellowships uh atleast twelve to teachers of english and these fellowships they arrange in at three levels  one is the five week fellowship one is the three four months fellowship and one is nine months  uh again five weeks fellowship is divided into two uh part  one is those who are persuing there research  second thing is uh faculty in recent uh programme that is senior lecturers who are not to persue any research in canadian studies but they would like to be acquainted with the canadian literature or canadian studies and come back and teach uh at b a and m a level or  as guide for m a m phil or ph d students  the so these uhm five weeks scholarships are for students you know students in the sense scholars who are working who are researching  for their m phil ph d's and also for those you know there is a different caption and also for those one is known as uhm study programme  another is faculty improvement  and four month is again for those who want to study in a more comprehensive uh comprehensive fashion  and nine months is mainly for those who are persuing their research in uh canadian literature  uh terms are very lucrative both one word and uh uh uh very good uh amount of payment fellowships during your stay in canada this is about canada  application forms are available  and uh then third is australia australia has not uh instituted any fellowship as yet  but uh they are they have a very uh uhm uhm ambitious programme and they have set up as professor pandey said the other day  australian indian council  uhm this is just being set up it'll come into operation next year ninety-two early ninety-two  and uh under this programme they will be instituting fellowships  they are going to set up a centre uh centre for australia  india studies  similarly indian society for commonwealth studies of which professor pandey is the chairman  uh our society is going to set up an indian centre  centre which will be known as indo australian centre uh of studies you know  indo uh sorry uh centre for indo-australian studies  well both the names are so similar  their is australian-indian ours is indo-australian  uh where we set up this only time will tell uh australian government is very helpful and fellowships will are in the offing  apart from that as far as the availability of books is concerned uh australian government has a very liberal norm in giving books not to individual but to institutions  and there are certain universities cough which have been identified as the universities where commonwealth literature  research is going on poona university is one of them  the other universities uh the universities i know of which  one is delhi university one word university of anantpur  poona university is third bombay university calcutta university bangalore university mysore university chandigarh punjab university uh these seven eight universities then osmania then central university hyderabad these are nine ten universities i remember out of the nineteen universities which have been identified as centres uhm which can promote the study of australian literature and commonwealth literature as a whole  so if you need some books on australian literature it is  that through uh get in touch with these uh uhm universities  poona university has just been given some seventy or eighty books so from time to time they receive books uh from the government australian embassy here and these books are dispatched to various universities  so amongst australian writers the most popular has been  patrick white because he is the only writer who got nobel prize  and uh as far as patrick white is concerned i think all novel most of it most of the novels by patrick white they are available in india  a lot of fiction is also available  but other writers which are coming up like rodney hall who visited delhi university as a visiting uhm fellow last year for about four months  uh rodney hall and leftmary and uh judith one word lot of coach who came to india some three years ago  a lot of work has been done on these writers  i will be very happy if uh we take up research on these writers uh because i should have been saying so british literature uh  is any way dying uh even american literature has become stale  so it's time we focus our attention on new literatures  which are coming up  so if you want uh books on aust  australian literature you please get in touch with these institutions these uh bodies  but by next year we are going to have lot of books  penguin uh has got into australian now some two three years ago  and they are bringing out a series of books  they are monographs and literary books  recently they have brought out no less than i think forty to forty-five titles on australian literature i have some with me uh specially one which is  which is the literary history of australia it's an excellent book if you were to look at that book if you read that book you get to know everything about australia specially about women studies  about aboriginal literature  there is so much common between india and australia  and uh i am very hopeful by next year i think we are going to have  many more books  so from that we come to the beginnings of novel in india  uh as all of us you know that drama lyrics and short stories and other forms of literature they have been there  both in england in europe in india india since ages but drama i am sorry but novel came into existence only very recently this is a recent phenomenon  in england as all of us know the novel uh the origin of novel or flowering of novel i should say is uh uhm linked with henry fielding and richardson eighteenth century  uh we always say that it takes about hundred years for a movement to come to india from england or from europe or from america  so but in ind as far as india is concerned we have the first two novels in nineteenth century only  uhm and uh there is the controversy which is the first novel  but we can talk of some first great novels and one of them is chandu menon's indulekha  now when we talk of a novel in india it has a different uh meaning connotation than what when we see novel in england or novel in europe or novel in america  because novel in india is a classic collective expressions  it comprises fiction from all regional literatures we don't have what is indian literature we we can not define indian literature indian literature means literatures of all the regions  hindi is uh just now a national language it doesn't have a identity of its own so hindi could also be termed as only a regional literature so hindi urdu marathi bengali punjabi these are all literatures and all put together they form indian literature  so this is a collective expression so when we talk of indian novel we talk of novel in all branches uhm in the country  now how did it come to flourish ? in ninteenth century practically there was no novel  and uh uhm till uh middle of that nineteenth century there was no novel  it is precisely and mainly because of the efforts of christian missionaries  when they came to india they wanted people to read bible  and since they wanted people to read bible they learnt our languages they learnt south indian languages first of all tamil uhm then malyalam these languages they learnt and they translated the bible into all living languages of that time  this is the basic uh so if you want to note down the certain points you can just say in point number one that uhm novel  as a literary phenomenon is new to india now novel you put in double inverted commas  novel as a the novel as a literary phenomenon is new to india we all know epics lyrics dramas short-stories fables  they've been they have there uh respectable uhm industries going back to several centuries  but it is only during the second half of nineteenth century  that novel took its root in in india  now uh for the novel popularly popularly uh so called we have to wait till the second half of of nineteenth century  and it is because of uh western impact on so you can take down second point is that it's because of the western impact on india western impact on india  this is because of the western impact that there was a formal development of prose and i said as i said that the christian missionaries they wanted indians to read the bible so they read our languages and then they translated the bible  so that gave a fillip to uh prose writing in our country and then from the prose medium it uh brought into currency  uh translation and then from a novel the proper  then third point is write down that the term novel is a collective expression these are very important points so once you know these points you can explain them  novel in india is a collective expression  it comprises fiction of some length produced in several  regional languages of india comprises fiction of some length produced in several regional languages of india like bengali hindi urdu  marathi punjabi etcetera  now as you know that it was mainly in bengal that indian literary renaissance took place in nineteenth century with the establishment of sir william fort college and uh setting up of a printing press in sarempore by christian missionaries  they they of course had motive was only to popularise christianity but in the process it also gave fillip to the spread of education  and uh specially prose uh writing  now once it became popular uh people started writing uh uh  prose and novels and uh the first attempt which was made  uh in south india was that of chandu menon when he wrote his novel  indulekha  it has been rightly held as a first first significant novel  in malyalam and also of course as a matter of fact in india but there is a controversy because there are so many so many novels written during those two three decades  so it is the first significant novel in malyalam  it it was written in nine eighteen hundred eighty-nine and published in eighteen-ninety  it faced some controversy you know year this side or that side but these are the most recognized dates  uhm now one thing we have to keep in mind is that chandu menon was not a professional writer  he was a judge by profession he was a lawyer then judge and he can be compared for that matter with henry fielding who was a lawyer and then a judge and it was his passtime  he was very fond of company over cup of tea he used to discuss novels  and uh he was greatly impre  impressed by english novels  and uhm very often he uh he felt that he should write a novel  and he was thoroughly impressed by english manners english people english language  uh he was a typical indian person who was uh accost to english culture and since he was in a very high position he was highly impressed by it cough  and uhm his wife was also of the same views  and very often she used to exhort him to write a novel  and one of his friends he uh suggested that uh there is a novel by disreily and the name of the novel was which henrietta some henrietta i remember uh he wanted him to uh this is henrietta temple please just write down the name of the novel  this was written by benjamin disreily   henrietta's spellings are h e n h e n r i e t t a henrietta temple  this is the name of the novel by disreily  and his friend asked him to translate the novel 
chalk with a chalk in my hand and a black board at my disposal because that is what we are all use to  but uh this is some sort of a formal lecture in a sense that i will not be able to move from the uh dais uh here  now i have chosen for my talk today a subject  india's science and technology policy and the possible role of universities in its implementation  while choosing this topic i had two view points in mind  first that as citizens rather than as teachers you should know in what direction our government is moving  what should be the basis of our technological programmes  and how should we really go about it  secondly i thought that as teachers of the university you should know what we should be doing in order to assist our national programmes and therefore partly informative partly i could say a request of what you should really be doing  now if you look into the history of mankind you will find that right from the beginning say from the invention of the wheel you have found that the scientific discovery has been followed by some sort of a major sociological development or economic development where the life patterns have changed  you as i said you could start with the invention of the wheel  you could come to the industrial revolution where the steam-engine brought the revolution or you could come to the present day where the computer uh chip is bringing about such a revolution  and therefore it is very essential to plan our scientific programmes  so you can say that the industrial revolution which swept europe say in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries highlighted the fact that the economic growth of a nation is largely depend upon the scientific and technological advances it can achieve  and therefore we must have a consistance science and technology policy  now you may have a policy it may be perfectly laid down  every step may be taken care of but you can implement that policy only  if the proper environment is present and if you have got a trained personnels to implement that policy  this applies not only to science and technology it applies to every aspect of life take even our teaching programmes  we may know that our m sc syllabii for example must contain a b c d  we also know that all these things must be taught but unless the whole atmosphere in the university is such that we can really teach those aspects and we got trained personnels who are capable of teaching we find that this sort of thing doesn't work  and therefore the first point we must always remember while considering any policy and in this case the science and technology policy is  that the proper background has got to be developed  thus you will find that when we finally come to the implementation of the national policies the brunt will have to come  on the university and on the teaching system because we are going to provide them the men who are going to later uh act and who who in the years to come are going to lead our scientific and technological development  now this aspect was well thought out by our national leaders even before we became independent  the science and technology policy gre owes a great deal to the foresight of pandit jawaharlal nehru  even before we achieved independence in the days of pre-independence uh you will find that in one of the in uh  uh indian national congresses he had outlined our policies in nineteen hundred forty-six when his discovery of india came out  there were statements which clearly showed that he realized  that the social upliftment of the people was not possible unless a basic scientific policy was designed  and i'll just quote one sentence from his  discovery of india which will let you know what his thinking was this in quotes is open quote it is science alone that can  solve the problems of hunger and poverty of insanitation and illiteracy of superstition and deadening customs and traditions of vast resources running to waste of a rich country inhabitate by starving  people  and therefore looking at all the problems he tried to set right the scientific background  and while setting right the scientific background he did not  think in terms of the natural uh resources alone in terms of say  laboratory development but he emphasised the need of what is known as the scientific temper  so the very basis of the science and technology policy as visualized by pandit jawaharlal nehru was the development of a scientific temper  even in any field this could be uh applied and it basically means that you should be able to think in a logical manner you should be able to find out what are the next steps you are going to do and what that is going to lead to  whether your uh actions are correct or incorrect whether they can be supported or not supported that is what the scientific attitude or the scientific temper or the scientific way of thinking means  and that is what he emphasised so the basic understanding is that you should first learn to think logically and to act logically  now with this background he set about uh to creating a background on which technologicl development took place  firstly we all know that he said that we have got to provide better technologies which would enable the country to progress more rapidly  the spinning wheel or the charkha had its own symbolic value it had its value as far as the villages were con   concerned  but simply by producing say khadi we would not survive in the world of competition and therefore for a even such a small thing as a  charkha he introduced the mechanized type of  charkha which is known as the amber charkha or it was known as the amber charkha in those days  similarly he said about building dams  uh he said about bui building   up heavy industries in fact the knowledge that the storage of water was essential for our agricultural development led to our policy of big dams it was at that time in the early uh the late uh say uh late forties and early fifties that we thought of hirakud and uh bhakra and so on  and in those days he emphasised that dams our are the temples of modern india he did not want people to go uh to uh a temple in the religious way think of a temple in a religious way but he thought that objects  which could be emulated which could serve as a symbol of progress should be our real temples  at the same time he set about setting up large research laboratories the first was of course the national chemical laboratory at poona then you have the national physical laboratory and a chain of national laboratories came uh forward  today there are people and there is who think that these steps were probably not in our best interest for example uh you may say that a dam probably gave us water it probably gave us electricity but it did not take care of the ecological aspects or of the environmental aspects  you can say that a national laboratory created certain small centres of excellence but the money poured into the national laboratory  deprived you can say the university these are things we which we find in hind-side but it is the fore-sight that you have got to build up a scientific base which was nehru's real contribution to our development  and in terms of this uh contribution the first thing that india did was in nineteen hundred and fifty-eight when it adopted what was known as a scientific policy resolution  do you mind if i treated it like a class-room sir ? because they will otherwise not be able to take down anything ahn it was at this point that we adopted in nineteen hundred and fifty-eight what is known as the scientific policy  resolution  now this scientific policy res  resolution was aimed at providing the basis for our scientific programmes in future  now what are the main points of this scientific policy resolution ? the first major point was to foster promote and sustain the cultivation of science and scientific research in all aspects  pure applied and educational  so the promotion of research was the main framework or the main bullwork on which our science policy was based  the second point was to ensure an adequate supply of research scientist of high quality  it was this was also considered necessary not only the scientific equipment but the scientific personnel  the third uh point was to encourage and initiate with all possible speed programmes for the training of scientific and technical persons  the next was to ensure that creative talent is encouraged  and finds full scope in scientific activity  and encourage individual initiative for the acquisition and desimination of knowledge and for discovery of new knowledge  and lastly to secure for the people of the country all the benefits that can accrue from the acquisition and application of scientific knowledge  so these are the points which i will give you later  but here we have got to emphasis the fact that what was required was one bui building up the scientific infra infrastructure  second building up this uh scientific personnel required third was to ensure that scientific knowledge was dessiminated to the people  and above all what is most important was to see that any scientific uh programme or any scientific discovery did not lie in science alone but it was transmitted to the people  now in much later you will find that uh in the late eighties this came out in the form of our technological mission which i will talk to about later  but the building up of the infrastructure the building up of the personnel require the transformation of information and the transformation of the benefits of science to uh the rural popu  uhn people or to the poorer section that was the main thrust or the main basis of our science policy as formulated in nineteen hundred and fifty-eight  uh the one word basic difficulty about this  scientific policy resolution which the lok sabha adopted was  it spoke of science but it did not spoke speak   of technology  so the next step came in nineteen hundred and seventy-three when a national committee for science and technology  was formed to advise on how the scientific achievements or the scientific material could be transferred into technology and that is when the people came in  now this uh committee on science and technology  presented an approach paper in nineteen hundred seventy three  so this is the science and technology committee report  and this science and technology committee report emphasised again four or five points which are firstly the resources allotted to research and development in india and other developing countries were grossly inadequate that was the first point  the second the transfer or import of technology from developed countries was not in the interest of developing countries  thirdly many required technologies could be indigenously  developed  fourthly quality and relevance of education in schools and universities had to be ensured so as to stop the stupendest waste in human resources  and next an adequate machinery had to be set up to monitor  evaluate correct and redirect various programmes in science and  technology  now if you look at the basic points of the report of the nineteen hundred and seventy-three science and technology committee you will find that they said what we are still saying in nineteen hundred and ninety-one that is the eighteen years later  we are not saying anything quite new we are again stating the same fact that we don't have enough money for research that we should not import technology from outside we should develop our own technology  the quality of our education should improve and that an adequate machinery should be formed to transfer the benefits of science to society so in other words though our thinking process have been proper  though we have realized what should be done though we know the path on which we have to travel we are not being able to implement it  and this if you can recall brings uh that out my opening remarks that what is necessary is not only a science and technology policy but the environment to promote that policy and the personnel to promote the policy  if after twenty years we still can not find an answer to  uh the questions which we set ourselves uh a long time back then there is something wrong and that wrong is that we have not developed the right attitude in which our scientific development can take place then the next step is in nineteen hundred and eighty  three when the government gave what is known as the technology policy statement  now this technology policy statement tried to say what should be our programmes of technological development  and this is essentially something which is more or less a repeat of what has been visualized in the science and technology  policy  so the government issued in nineteen eighty-three the technology policy statement according to which the basic objectives of a  nation's technology policy were stated to be firstly development of indigenous technology  second acquisition of imported technology and its efficient absorption and adaption appropriate to national priorities and resources  
what stupid ideas are getting hold of all of us  and the teachers have also become trade unionists  they also hold the university  i mean who who is the university ? the vice-chancellor of the university or the teachers who teach they are the university  it is an association  this is my definition university is an association of students and teachers in pursuit of scholarship  scholarship is the only measure of the performance of the university  if you don't have scholarship you are nothing  and we want teachers who are great scholars like those great rishis of ancient times  people who are dedicated who are motivated whose whole purpose is  the pursuit of knowledge and the application of knowledge to the contemporary problems  now we have to produce such man such power such knowledge power in our universities  i am very fond of constantly quoting the ideas of john kenneth galbraith the economist who has pointed out that in the feudal times or even the earlier times slave times the  your wealth depended on the number of slaves you can command  i have one thousand slaves at my disposal i am a bigger man  than another with hundred slaves at his disposal  then came feudalism and they said that a man who has one thousand acres is bigger than a man who owns hundred acres  so the land that was the measure of feudalism  then came capitalism  if i have one crore or i am a millionnaire i am bigger than a man who has only some hundreds  money became the measure  so control over men was the measure at one phase of the history  over land in the second phase of history over money in the third phase of history now what is the measure of today ? what is the measure of today ? the knowledge that you produce  the knowledge that you apply  knowledge is the measure of performance today  therefore universities have to be successive from this point of view they have to produce knowledge now there is poverty of research in the indian university  whether in science natural sciences social sciences no uh new idea generates no new research has come out no new books are prepared some useless text-books are prepared and they are the stuff nutrition on which the student community is fed  now with such poor nutrition of third rate text-books i mean you ask the students of economics he has not read journals  john maynard keynes' general theory of employment interest in money one word  kanes who is that ? and what is his book ? and why should we read it ? now this is our way of looking at things  so uh we need to give great attention to the quality of teachers and to the quality of students  and the academic staff colleges are intended to produce a better quality of teachers a very good idea  i hope academic staff colleges also do not deteriorate  and do not become a ritual  you see there has to be a perennial and continous process of renewal to be just what we are  even a vice- chancellor will not be of any use unless he renews himself constantly  by the one word that i have diclosed in the last few minutes you would have known by now that i am not such an ignorant person about the scene of higher education  after all i was not an educationist i was in the indian administration  but i have been constantly reading about the scene of higher education in fact i began after the moment i came here i said where is radhakrishnan commission ? let me see it first  where is kothari commission ? where are the other what are the other writing ? what are the new thoughts ?  so nobody should take any field without becoming a thorough   pandit in that particular field that is the mark and that is the approach of an academic  even as an administrator i followed the same method  now i might have been wanting thoroughly but at least that was my effort and that was my approach  so therefore how do we continuously recharge the batteries of our teachers  now this is a recharging battery academic staff college is a battery recharging process  so that when you go you are brightened refreshed you are a new person and your personality changes and the students must say  is this the same teacher who has come back  some thing has gone wrong but you know you become different teacher this is what should happen after you go back  you must be full of new ideas full of new energies full of new approaches  you must electrify the atmosphere when you go back this is this is the mark of success of a programme like i hope it will happen here also  you must go and electrify the atmosphere when you go back  the movement you go back the brightness must spread  so will this happen ? you see there are even in modern times we believe that in addition to self-teaching or teaching on the job yourself there is an institution of process involved  i belong to the great indian administrative service which is the successor to a greater what people call a greater service for the indian civil service of the colonial times  now in those days there was no training  the i c s did not believe in this kind of formal our institutional training  they believed in training on the job  the senior man trains the junior fellow  and in those days the links betweeen the senior and the junior  were more personal  yes there is also something in that  but there is also more in the process of institutionalization and it is only after in independence   that a number of institutions of training of civil servants came into existence it became a big business  and that is how in my career i headed no less than four  institutions of research and training connected with one part or the other of our administrative system  uh rajiv gandhi was a great believer and the first question he asked was whether chief secretary of the states and the join secretary at the centre or even the secretaries and ministers whether they were getting any training  this is the question rajiv gandhi asked  it was part of his modernism  and as a result of that for the first time for the big bossess  who consider themselves beyond all training ministers are beyond all training they don't need anything they know everything and the in hindi i a s fellow knows everything  now that theory is no longer considered to be valid  and he definitely the credit of starting such programme for higher civil servants and ministers goes to rajiv gandhi  though i must say in the earlier days of s k dey where i was also the director we use to get senior civil servants as well as even ministers in those days mla's  but in recent times in the whole gamut of public administration this was started  now the u g c has started it on the academic side the same who is good you cannot be standard now our teachers are notorious for using the same notes for the whole of the teaching career  what was given by dhananjayrao gadgil when i passed my m a same notes i go on using for twenty-five years  now the fact of the matter is such is the dynamism of knowledge the explosion of knowledge what that what you said yesterday does not hold good today  a syllabus came in economics and it said the socialistic economic system experience of russia and east european countries now where is socialism ? what kind of socialism are you talking of ? things change so rapidly not only in the realm of knowledge but also in the external world  and the objectives of programme such as this is to constantly  bring you up today both in your subject matter because we have subject matter programmes in respect of methodology which is also important methodology of teaching  and thirdly the general environment in which you work  university is considered to be an ivory tower yes to an extent it is an ivory tower  but this ivory tower of education is not unconnected with the economic environment social environment political environment technological environment cultural environment in which we carry on our whole process of education  and therefore we ought to know this environment  we cannot be frogs in the well dealing only with a commerce accountancy and the like i mean you have to know the whole frame-work  and therefore this general programme of orientation which will tell you about the changing environment in politics  economics in society in technology in culture within india and without india  i therefore hope that uh such a programme will not be considered by you an irrelevant  what is this programme it is not in the syllabus of botany ? this is not a question to be asked here  we are not here concern with botany or zoology or economics or commerce or political science or education or hindi or english in pursuing we are concerned with these wider frame-work  and i hope that uh you will understand the importance of these wider frame-work that you will interact i mean in all this it is not the traditional process where the teacher knows everything and the student now it has become reverse the student feels that he knows everything and the teacher knows nothing and he talks some nonsense and we have to tolerate  this is the new approach to education that seems to be evolving in our country  a student in goa university got ten marks and he failed and he promptly writes me ten letters saying that the teachers don't know uh how to uh evaluate and they have wrongly put me at ten and it is a great injustice to me  now what do you do ? therefore we have to create the institutional approach  for the enhancement and the upgradation of the capability of our teachers but much will depend on the teachers themselves how you participate ? what you get of the programme will depend will depend on  how you what effort you made to get out the programme  if you come out if you bring up your ideas and your experience and to share it with others you will find that apart from the expert who'll be giving you lectures you will benefit more by your interaction with each other  this will be your transformation from a teacher you will become a student from an older person you will suddenly become a young person  this transformation i hope the programme will bring about  it a programme like this makes you younger it reduces your age straight by twenty years  so if you are forty your age becomes twenty  and that happens for a teacher also  the teacher should not go on uh blabbering in an old way  but uh he must come out with all the energy of new knowledge and new curiosity and the pleasure that is there between communication  between human beings  communication between human beings is a very big process  it changes  it is not communication of one from one to one  one becomes hundred in the process of communication  so i hope all these processes will take place and as a result of uh this programme you will go happier uh more uh delighted refreshed committed and uh you will then go back and would not keep what you have taken to yourselves  but would share it with your fellow teachers with your colleagues with your students and with the academic community of which you are a part  so in all this uh process of education and its dessimination  i wish you all very well  i don't know whether what i have said amounts to any key note address  i had not uh prepared myself formally to deliever it but uh  i share what i felt on the occasion with you all  once again i must uh give my heartful thanks to the vice-chancellor for uh allowing us to come here and provide the forum for the conduct of the activities of the academic staff college  and i am grateful to dr devasthali for providing the co-ordination at the level here in this university  i thank them heartly on behalf of goa university and on behalf of myself  and i wish well to you to the participants in the programme and to the programme itself thank you very much 
good morning  uh this is a short paper called teaching classics in an unclassical situation  uh i didn't know what to do when i received a letter from uh professor vanikar uh asking me to participate in a lecture series  so i thought that i must write a lecture  but i didn't know that this is all this  but anyway i i hope you'll bear uh these peculiar things from a teacher who has been trying to teach something impossible  uh for several years  when the indira gandhi open university was launched some years ago somebody mentioned to me why an open university was needed then  most of the northern universities had to be closed for long spells of time owing to one agitation or the other  and they had been sealed closed  the only university that could be open then was the open one  which could not be closed  when i asked in a time honoured university a few years ago  where was the student ? the teacher said since attendance was voluntary the students were not around  this had shocked me then thoroughly  but when the same reason was given by another set of teachers  in another university equally respected just a few days ago i was not so much dismayed as amused  a university now was getting one word of becoming  a fossil  a discarded image and a discreditable model  we say the teacher you have to squeeze the university into museum and a teacher into a zoo now  when teaching itself has become a well-nigh lost art practised  before the modern stone age teaching a classic should be a gargantuan to an absurdity or a quixotic misadventure  but though the teaching of a classic really belong to the realm of such a dark and hopeless comedy my experience with both the classics and the teaching has been mercifully otherwise  i may be allowed to boast that even like the classics themselves i've survived as a teacher teaching classics  that too in an indian situation  at the movement i need not define a classic since everyone knows what it is since you have to know what a thing is even to reject it   i'll rather explain what an unclassical situation is apart from the unclassical situation in the west itself  which even milton feared in his own time whether he was writing his epic in an age too late in a cold climate my damp is intended flight  the indian situation for the western classics especially the ancient one is apparently precarious  homer or virgil dante or milton are not only not read in the schools or undergraduate classes here perhaps with exception of some milton but well are unheard of  there is no grounding or even interest in pagan mythology or christian thought of any real depth before the students join the post graduate classes  nor is there any serious attention to the history of ideas  or evolution of the western culture is greek or roman christian texture any knowledge of greek and latin or even a gentle fascination for them is anywhere in sight is nowhere in sight  again there is no knowledge or sense of the genuises rise evolution and decay of the stars of epic tragedies romance  allegory etcetera  nor is there a critical awareness or discuss   discussions or the matters involved in the study of the classics among the extremist either  in short as far the teaching of the classics is concerned you are working in a thorough vacuum  though your teacher's nature may abhor it  if you have to reach the students with your classics in your uh  ah in your hand you have to undertake the adventure of piercing through a silence of seven-fold or nine-fold or manifold ignorance  but should you despair and give up the sword of teaching then as a sheer wild goose chase   i've an emphatic no to say to this pessimism  it is possible to put those classics across to the students  indian students not because they are the one word or credilous  but because the classics have an intrensic power in themselves  on the one hand and students have an intrensic an instinctive responsiveness to them on the other  should a classic fail it's a pity  something must be wrong either with the teacher or with the student and between them they have missed an opportunity of a life-time it is a challenge for any teacher to steer an ancient classic through successfully in a class without being assisted by a cultivated response in it  but i think the solution to the problem should be divide another way  instead of being exasperated by a classical innocent class a teacher has to exploit the virgin field and convert innocence into an advantage  the basic wealth he should realize lies in the responsiveness of the class to any literature our literature british or one's own  once he's sure of the aesthetic or literary sensibility  so he can find a way for the classic into the imagination of his students when i say that a literary awareness is the most vital factor i do not employ that a classic should be reduced to an easily knowable text the teacher should have a complex economy at his command  he must know uh the right dosage of each element before he administers a classic to the open minded class students of the class  were one to teach for example homer's  illiad i i've taken just one example  one must know how much of the theory of the epic of growth or archeology he must give to his students  if you get lost in the theory of the oral or authentic epic you may not reach homer at all  on the contrary you may raise serious suspicion in the minds of the students whether a poet called homer ever existed at all  having introduced the term authentic oral epic you gently pass on to the homeric age or the heroic age not as a fossil of history but as a genuine milieu for the creation and sustenance of the kind of epic that illiad is  if the students know nothing of the heroic age achilles would cut an utterly sorry figure before them a spoiled child a wilful imbecile  personal honour then was supreme and dying for glory the consummation devastly wished by a hero was his name  the co-ordinates of the age co-ordinate coincide with the co-ordinates of the morality of the hero  the lords have donned a heroic society have to be  ac accepted in a spirit of willing suspension of disbelief or of a voluntary poetic accent  by this the epic is saved an enormous infancy of primitivity  with a select historisity in mind you go straight to the human condition  so that given differing historical co-ordinate  there is an unerring core of the human fate involved  once the right key note is struck the classic is preserved  similarly you have to introduce them to the rules of the epic game the conventions the invocation the catalogues of men and ships and so on  the strolling epic simile the ruthlessly delightful battlefields the feudal games the lamentations etcetera  and then the gods their politics their devious ways  their over-determinations of human affairs and man's constant negotiations with them  the supernatural frame-work not to be reduced to the supernatural machinery that they use one word but to be kept  as a mysterious divine environment in which man has to struggle rise afore  you have to identify and establish the force of gravity  that holds in tension the fears of men  all this has to be done not in a spirit of solemn scholarship  but as a matter of enlighten information to hinder the hindrances to enjoying such works  but this is only half the work  you have to get the work closer to the world of the students'  own experience or sensibility  i have been trying to do this task not by denuding homer of its specific but by gathering him to a vision of what i might describe as  poets' perennial  the perennial poetry which refuses to divide poetic experience or vision in a parochial way and reduce reduce it to a poets'  parochialist uh provincial poetry  explain the unknown homer in terms of the known of  the upanishadas the vedas the bhagwatgeetas the mahabharat and the ramayan and the bhagwat  do not tell me that our own works are less known to our students than the western classics  i have been doing in this way from long before the tv's  had serialised the mahabharat and  the ramayan  our work the culture that they are embodiments of our already embedded in the instinctive responses of our students  and they have to be carefully and convincingly evoked by the teacher  let me give just a couple of examples in a characteristically comprehensive homeric statement  in the thick of the battle dimades challenges glocus and glocus replies what does any lineage matter to you  men in the generations are like the leaves of the tree  the wind blows and one years leaves are scattered on the ground  but the tree is burst into buds and put on fresh ones when the spring comes round  in the same way one generation flourishes and the another nears its end  this inevitably reminded me of the statement from the  katho upanishad satya mevap madhya pakshatye sasya mev tasya mev ajayte punha  the muscle hyphens and ripens ends like corn and stalks up again like corn  the metaphor of the leaves in homer corresponds greatly with metaphor of the corn in the katho upanishad  and both bring out vividly and crystalize the phenomenon of mutability  the cycle of birth death and rebirth  the homeric metaphor as that of the upanishadic unites human experience so effectively that you cease to separate the west from the east and start inhabiting a common state of human faith  to cite another example from the illiad itself  here is andromache illiad book six trying to persuade her husband hector not to go to the fatal battlefield   so you hector are father and mother and brother to me as well as my beloved husband  have pity on me now stay here on the tar  put beside this a statement from the ramayana  made by seeta as a confession of rama's love for her  before anusuya  this is ayodhyakand one eighteen four uh  seetanurago dharmatma matrivat pitravat priyah  with this kind of a parallel so this is i think you will know this sanskrit i mean the student  seeta in love righteous dear like the father the mother  with the kind of a parallel in mind you do not wish to separate the two works the two culture and see them in isolation a bridge is flown across the two  and the one text reinforces and illuminates the other the phobia that a stranger one word is dissipated and an indian reader student teacher is gratified that a common humanity pervades text apparently separated by differing cultures and languages  when i say this i am not way laying the students into the phony field of the comparative literature as such but only knocking down walls or barriers that separates two literatures  it is a matter of of nativising alien an alien literature not by sipping it of its specifics but by opening a new channel of communication  so many problems of interpretation both literary and theological can be lightened by calling to aid works like the mahabharat ramayan bhagwat and pressing them to a service to to into service to gain and access into a pre-christian work like illiad which raises insoluble problems in the mind of western christian reader  i have tried to put across illiad without tearing off its roman roots to my students by a free use of material  from our ancient texts  the benefit has been double if not multiple  our students have freely enter the western classics with a native appreciation of them on the one hand and i've seen the relevance  and significance of our own work on the other  there was a time when the professor of english looked down upon our works in a bid to outer english to english  those days i wish to believe are behind us but that also implies a responsibility a need to emancipate oneself from bookishness into a heaven of genuine learning   i've been tackling works like the illiad  paradise lost the divine comedy with an amount of freedom to release the classics from the prison of impenetrability or mere tacit riven and make them speak to us as living works   i've also been trying to light up areas of darkness  in interpreting our own works like the mahabharat ramayan the bhagwat all these or the bhagwatgeeta  by a constant reference to the illiad the aeneid paradise lost or the divine comedy so that a new discourse is generated  by the free jostling together of great works  this has helped remove to a great extent the grimness  or the the gravity the solemnity that seem to weigh upon our own works  fallen on the trodden ways of orthodoxy  the use of the bible both the old and the new testament  the entire western mystical tradition uh has been of great benefit in the interpretation of our own works too  here again the walls of prejudice and wooden scholarship collapse  and the great work starts becoming parts of the same space the aesthetic and the ethical   i've also been getting appreciable success bringing together the greek and the shakespearian tragedies  understanding a greek phenomenon with a shakespearian example  or vice-versa  should i read more and be conversant with sanskrit drama i hope to understand the more by a kind of a cross irradiation  what i've uh been doing with the ancient classics  classics should be possible with the post- renaissance modern and post-modern works too  but one needs to be sailing the razor edge path of one if one were not to mess up things  this kind of activity needs a great expansion of mind an intellectual tolerance that makes holding many peaks of excellance or phenomenon of significance together simultaneously without reducing or abolishing the uniqueness of each  i also felt always that a teacher needs to be free from any obsession with one particular theory of literature or or criticism if you they want to save themselves from the dangers of distortion  at the same time he must be fully aware of the whole plethora of the theory so that he is able to make use of them freely  even as an electronics engineer uses a thousand of keys to produce a unified effect  i may however say that my key to the classics is only a key a key and i do not know of a master-key which can unlock uh the treasures of all literature  i do not exactly know where i stand as regard to theme of the lecture series creative writing and literature teaching interphase  but this much i can say that literature teaching is not  much less creative than creative writing itself  in fact you create as you teach  and a creative work unless it is creatively read remains just a close book it does not become a text to borrow a term from burke it is a teacher who stigmaties to teach a text can really transform it into what it really is a text which requires as burke would say an attempt to abolish or atleast to lessen the distance between writing and reading not by intensifying the readers  projection into the work but by linking the two together in a single signifying process  a teacher if he succeeds does reduce the distance between writing and reading  he rewrites the works and reincarnate the text everytime  he successfully performs in a class  thank you 
the vice-chancellor of goa university and today's  chief guest dr dubhashi pro-vice-chancellor of shivaji university dr yadav dr fernandes dr devasthali my colleagues from the shivaji university and the participants in this orientation programme  it is a pleasure to be associated with the inauguration of the twenty-second orientation programme being organized by the academic staff college of goa university  this also happens to be the second programme we are organizing in kolhapur  and i am grateful to the vice-chancellor of goa university and to his colleagues for taking all trouble of co  coming over to kolhapur every year and organizing such a programme without this attitude of yours i think it may have been difficult for many of our lady participants to take advantage of  the facility which the university grants commission is offering  at the outset i would like to welcome dr dubhashi to this campus on a formal basis  he has visited us on a couple of occasions but was   that was more of a personal visit and today we have had the pleasure of having him here to give the key note address of this orientation programme  dr dubhashi enjoys a unique position amongst the vice-chancellors of india  most vice-chancellors like myself look upon the job from inwards  we have been a part of the university system and we see  only what we have been seeing for say twenty-five thirty years  but dr dubhashi being an administrator and an administrator  par excellence has the advantage of looking at the education system from outside after taking into account what is present therein  and i am sure this these two factors being able to see from the view point of others and to able to understand your own problems will go a long way in seeing that the goa university develops at a very rapid rate  i have had the previlege of hearing him at two or three conferences  and i must say that all have been impressed with the fresh view points which he has been presenting  dr dubashi has jokingly said that we should not underestimate goa no sir we certainly do not do so  we understand goa is a place where there is an integration of two cultures where the temple of mangeshi stands next to the old cathedral of goa where the scenic beauty provides the very necessary background for the development of the cultures and where you have got research institutes of the stature of the national institute of oceanography  we know therefore that goa is an education centre goa is a place which can really provide something new in terms of knowledge something new in terms of developng the human mind  and it is therefore our beloved previlege sir to share from your staff member as well as from ours the a different view point on culture a different view point on history and a different view point on scientific achievements and the ways  education should develop  dr dubhashi had mentioned the conference of vice- chancellors of commonwealth universities at dehli which was held earlier this year  one of the main problems which was discussed at this conference was that of mediocrity vs excellence and quantity vs quality i am putting it the other way to what the westerners would put it because today in india in the education system at least we find that mediocrity and quantity has held a sway over quality and excellence  and what is absolutely essential from the point of view of the development of education in india is that excellence should be there if there is excellence with quantity i'll be very  proud of it  but at least excellence in smaller amounts would be absolutely essential before we can really give to the next generation what they deserve  and from this point of view the concept of academic staff colleges which the university grants commission has developed in recent years  was is of great importance  it is unless we train our minds unless we enlarge our own knowledge i do not think we can deliver to the students  what dr dubhashi has again mentioned that the students has an idea that what they are getting is really something which is old and outdated  many years ago i read in the readers' digest  a small anecdote which they usually publish but which has stuck to my mind  in the scenario was two young children of about five or six were playing in the school courtyard  an aeroplane went over  one child said it is a v h naming some uh number of the aircraft  the other said no no it is a v uh nine look at the angle of the wings  and then the bell rang  and then one child says to the another now let's  go back and count those silly bits laughter  so it is a fact from knowledge the young younger generation know so much more that probably we probably we  who never had that training in our uh younger days would not be able to transmit it and therefore this question of upgrading of knowledge has to be taken very very seriously  as dr fernandes has pointed out the academic staff college has  three or four major objectives  these are giving you the skill for meeting the new challenges making you aware of the linkages of education with society  making you aware of the current trends in knowledge making you aware  of the educational technology and giving you a practical aspect  to what you are going to do  and i think all of these are very important from the point  of view of a teacher  you will find that the new challenges which are being put  before before us will require absolutely new skills what i as a student learned would probably be next to useless i just cannot handle a computer  but a school ch ch child  today knows the basics of computers he can handle it and five years later unless we all can handle the skill i don't think we will be able to give anything in terms of knowledge to our students  what is most important is having an awareness of the linkage between education and society  many years ago we had the traditional system of education where  the teacher lived in his ivory tower he dealt with different aspects of his subject he gained knowledge he distributed the knowledge  but it was all very abstract  and what sidney smith said was very important the teacher  had the right to do everything  in a university system you had the right to be wrong  that was the uh expression there that even if a teacher taught something which was very abstract which was wrong it was his right and the right to be the wrong was one of the biggest previleges of a university  today the times have changed  the whole social system is financing your education and therefore you have something to pay back to uh society  and this is the university society linkage which has got to be very important  the third aspect is also of developing our knowledge  today we are in an age where you have to draw from every other subject before you can really put forward what your own subject says  and this i don't think can be done on the basis of what  uh we have learned during our bachelor's programme or in our  master's programme we have got to go to the right and left and we have got to draw from every source which we had  uh later in this afternoon i will be telling you or i'll  be talking to you regarding the science and technology policy how our science and technology has developed uh since the days of freedom and what are the problems  now one of the basic problems which i will try to tell you is that our background has not been broad enough  and it is from this point of view just like it is essential for the scientist to know his ancient heritage and his culture it is very necessary for the uh uh student of social sciences to know what the scientific development is and it is from this point of view that uh we will have to enlarge  again when we transmit our knowledge there are certain techniques and then there are certain skills and there are certain limitations  very uh jokingly i will tell you one thing that uh when i  had something to do with the educational mis uh me media research centre at poona university they were developing cassettes  and at that time one thing was said that when it's only an audio cassette one only if there is a speaker and there is nothing else to be seen the cassette should not be more than fifteen minutes or eighteen minutes because you do not hold the interest of a student for more than that period laughter  in brief a teacher uh uh a speaker should be not  should not dwelt too much on a uh special topic  dr dubhashi has drawn our attention to the fact that there is something wrong with our national spirit  we have come to a stage where we have become very much dependent upon other countries  i mean the present economic crisis uh is a very good example and he has also pointed out that the idealism which gandhiji and nehruji had the spirit with which they had fought for freedom and the spirit with which they looked at the future is quite different twenty-five years ago or a little more than that i was in the united states i was studying uh i was doing my post doctor research at that time  and i came to know some of the american professors very intimately one of them in the context of the foreign policies of india and pakistan said like pakistan why do you not co-operate with us if india co-operates the america will lay down the red carpet for your country  at that time i told him very prou proudly  we have been under slavery for a long time we do not want red carpets we want to be independent we would like to stand on our feet clapping twenty-five years later i think  we have failed we have asked them to lay down the red carpet and we are now willing to walk on that red carpet  i do not think this is the proper attitude the proper spirit at which we are looking at our problems  but i do hope that we will not only change ourselves but we will act in our manner when the young generation changes  and for that if you want the younger generation to change then  they should not look down at us they should look up at us  and if they are to look up at us then i think the basic requirement is that when we go into our classrooms we are fully equipped for the next fifty minutes' or sixty minutes' lecture  we know our subject thoroughly well wer are able to enthuse the student we are able to draw from them certain amount of information and we are able to make them to interact with us in the search for knowledge  this is the spirit behind the academic staff college  all of you have been enthusiastic enough to register for uh  this course  i am sure that during the next three weeks you will be provided with a lot of information  my only hope is that you will take this information you will imbibe whatever is given to you  you will see that mentally what has come together it is co-ordinated and a new flow of knowledge emerges  and this flow of our knowledge these new thoughts are not confined to us to our colleagues but they go down to our students  it is our duty and i think all of us here realize this  and all of us are willing to do our job   i must before i conclude i must again thank dr dubhashi for coming here i must thank uh him for allowing the academic staff college of goa university to hold its orientation programme here and i am sure that with the fare dr devasthali has put out for you the next three years would be next three weeks would be  not only very invigorating but will be a very happy  vacation or so called vacation period for you  thank you all clapping 
i prepared it just uh in case we need to refer to something common which we have in our hand  uh and i'll keep the tone of this talk uh quite informal  so in case you want to sort of place some questions  uhm it's better to postpone them till the end of the talk but uh in case you feel that uh you have a very strong impulse to ask something you can stop me you know and you know sort of uh there is no problem  well i've termed this the the title of this as   language in poetry   it's very uh very often we talk of language of poetry or the poetic language  and uh i think there are two ways of looking at it  one is the what we call the classical traditional  approach to poetic language  that there is a special specially marked group of words which are highly poetic in nature the classical and the neo- classical way of writing poems  uh this is exemplified in my first example the notion of poetic diction  uh you must have heard of banabhatt the seventh century  sanskrit writer the writer of the piece called  kadambari the first formal narrative uh very elaborate narrative in sanskrit in prose  the supreme example of classical prose style cough  in sanskrit   it's also the supreme example of what an ornamental style is like ornamental prose style  and it is said what i want to illustrate uh to this is  you see this work was incomplete there is a myth about uh this work called kadambari  the work was incomplete when he was about to die  he called to one of his shisyas and also  his son was there  uh just to test who would who who would be able to complete the work in case he is not able to complete and then  and he you know he pointed to a withered tree and uh  asked what is it ? and i have given the two responses one of bana's  disciple who said shusko vrikshaha tishthati agre agre  in front of us agre shuskai dried up withered vriksha is tree tishathati  is standing  now bana asked his son what about you what is that ? and he said neeras taruhu iha vilasati puratha purataha is again uh uh that's almost the same as  agre  okay but uh it is more poetic to say  purataha than to say agre  it highly prosaic to say agre vilasati   instead of tishathati uh you have heard of the word vilas where you can you know vilasati  in that sense taruhu instead of  vrikshaha iha is uh neeras instead of  shuska it is neeras  so these are some of the dimension of a poetic  diction  modern poets and modern critic uh particularly post nineteenth century post symbolist don't believe in this approach at all  in fact modern poetry has revolted against this kind of thing in fact  the the revolt began with in the west with the nineteenth century romantic poets  wordsworth wanted to write the language of men okay the the common commonly used language not the specially used specially concocted poetical diction or poetic diction  but what it it uh does perhaps this kind of an approach is to draw your attention to draw our attention to the element of choice involved in all poetry  the element of choice in diction that is in vocabulary  element of choice involved in structures their arrangements choice of metre or non-metre everything is a matter of choice and it is a choice  in language and that is why i say it is language in poetry  you have to uh uh poetry happens in language  see again the traditional view that language is the dress  is the ornament for content is the soul is quite misleading  even without taking the extreme organical stand that you know  language and thought language and content are organically related even without going into that kind of an extreme position we can still say that poetry is something which happens in language cough  which emerges out of language you can't think of poetry without thinking of language  you can't say that poetry uh somehow exist somewhere outside language  this language which limits it as wilkin cine had said  uh the limits of our language are the limits of our experience  in that sense the limits of our language are the limits of uh poetry which get written in that language in a sense  but it is only uh metaphor i am using because those limits are extendable those limits are in fact being uhm uh changed and shifted  by the poets themselves okay so this is uh my first point uh that it there is  we need not think in terms of false dichotomies like language vs literature most students and teachers of literature are uh tend to look at it in uh in that particular fashion language vs literature i think it's a it's  absolutely a false dichotomy this is it's a false opposition  popularized by those who were uh well who who don't want to make the necessary effort to you know uh uhm look at the language of poetry carefully  uh so one of the most fascinating aspects of reading and studying literature and poetry to explore its relation to language  now what i want to now look at is see in the twentieth century the swiss linguist ferdinand sassuare first  gave us this particular notion that language is a system of sign the first semiotic motion okay which has shaken the intellectual world which has shaped it in a new way many many different disciplines including anthropology including sociology including psychology structuralism and semiotics have played  a crucial role in literature in language certainly  now what is it mean to say that language is a system of signs what are the implications of this okay   it's a semiot to to give language as a semiotic system  uh let me tell you that sassuare though he was the first twentieth century linguist in the west to look at language in this particular fashion language as a system bu and emphasis the systemic systemic aspect of language  uh this approach in classical times uh goes back to say panini okay  the whole theory of sanskrit grammar which panini developed  has it has been called structuralist it has been called generative now apart from those terms i am not going to elaborate those terms but certainly language and its structure have fascinated people  people have had a lot of theories about it  we shall selectively use a part of that theory in order to see how what happens to language in poetry  just as we see what happens how poetry happens in language i want to see how what happens to language in poetry  and this can be seen at four levels four basic levels of linguistic structuring which linguists have identified  language for a linguist is essentially spoken  so it is cough phonological as they call  phonological phonology is the study of the systems of sounds  languages select certain sounds arbitraly and start  organizing them in certain systematic way  there are infinite number of sounds which a human vocal organism can produce in itself as you can see from a child babling  all kinds of sounds are produced  but certain sounds are identified as functionally relevant sounds  and are structured  so this is called the phonological level of structuring  linguistic structure  these sounds come together to form certain level of higher abstractions that is you can have a syllable and you can have certain clusters of consonants certain clusters of vowels so vowels consonants and higher levels of organizations into syllables  this is one level  further you develop into the level of word word which is called morphology word and formation of words  a still higher level of organization by higher i mean  larger and larger units of organization is the syntactic level  and through syntax you communicate meaning the meanings are also structured in language so sassuare was trying to explore the nature of the linguistic sign which on the one hand relates certain sounds to certain words uh to certain meanings  so sounds on the one hand meanings on the other what sassuare called a relation between the signifier and the signified the sounds and images sounds and meanings etcetera and these four levels of structuring what sassuare developed  and what modern linguistics has developed is a certain way of describing the structure of a language  describing the norm which governs language behaviour ordinary  linguistic behaviour ordinary speech behaviour  what are the rules ? okay  this is what lead us to  now obviously when you have a rule there is also a possibility of breaking that rule of deviating from the rule  and to begin with i would say that poetry is some kind of a purposeful deviation from the norm of usage from the normal usage you deviate purposefully  now i don't want to bring in problems of intentionality and so on  on the poe on the part of the poet i don't want to go into the poet's psychy to ask the questions what did this poet actually mean when when he wrote this  for me it is enough if we can reconstruct some kind of a poet within the poem   that's enough for me i don't have to go and verify from the poet did you mean really this or something else   that's not that's not my approach  that's may be a relevant approach for a psycho-analyst for a biographer but not for say a literary critic  a literary critic would be interested in the text how text  uh become in the texuality of the text okay  how these text makes construct meaning with the help of whatever norm if that is available with the help of one word  so that's why i put in norm and deviation   i'll come to examples a little later  let me go on to the third point in my synopsis  modern linguistics has not stop at the consideration of  structure of language  it has also to say something about the functions of language  particularly uh the european school of analysis see the after sassuare sassuare was a swiss linguist  writing in french around nineteen hundred and twelve he delivered between nineteen nine and nineteen twelve he delivered a series of lectures which have now come to the uh come to be recognized as revolutionary lectures in the form of a course  they were published as a book uh sassuare never intended to write it as a book but uh lecture notes were uh expanded and published in the form of a book course in general linguistics  by students and it has shaped our notions of language  uh though sassuare didn't write anything about literature his views of language have been same as very crucial in our dealing with  poetic language  one at the structural level the american linguist took over took took off from that point and developed theories of structure  one whole school came into being called american structuralism lead by leonard brumfield uh culminated in the work of charles hawkins after that there was again a a reaction against that and  uh from m i t chomsky has been developing his theory of generative grammar nineteen fifty-seven onwards  so this has been the line of printing the generative grammar the structuralist grammar in the field of description of linguistic structure  the other line was followed by the european linguists  particularly linguists of the france school  and there is one linguist who who has remained the link between language literature european tradition american tradition and has sort of you know uh has been able to combine the various uh traditions in the western world and something which can be called a western tradition of linguistics uh symbolized by roman jocobson the work of roman jacobson  uh who was part of the russian formalists part of the france school part of the uh american scene after the sixties  and the functions that i have enumerated uh have been proposed by jacobson very simply  again there is a specially poetic function which he identified but these are not functions which are mutually exclusive  every speech act for the linguists of france school for roman jacobson has six different directions  it can have these potentially it has the six different elements and these six different directions  they are sort of orientations of the speech act  one is you can you can say i am very unhappy   this is self-expression  the speaker is attracting attention to himself or herself and trying to tell people what is happening to him or her  this is called the expressive function of language please notice that unlike the romantic or the expressive theories in the west jacobson does not equate this kind of self-expression with the poetic language  language of poetry is not language of self- expression  second you can orient it to the receiver of your message  in a poetic act you can say please open the door  i am not expressing my feelings about it i am simply  persuading you requesting you trying to influence you to do something  this can be called connotive or uh emotive persuasive  use of language  this is an orientation and please notice that poetry can be expressive but that is not its central function poetry can be emotive persuasive for example take patriotic poetry can be vey highly emotive and persuasive but that's  not its function according to jacobson  the third is i can straight refer to the environment because there is a context to our entire uh speech act  and i can say well uh it's rather hot today  which serves to refer to an internal or external factor in the communicative act this can be called a referential function of language  i'll describe it  referring to something specific in the environment in the context of the speech act this is called the uh referential function or the des descriptive function of language  this also is part of literary language part of poetic language descriptive poetry  for example in novels you get a lot of descriptions you can  you have evocative language you have you have expressive language and so on okay 
doctor agarwal and my and professor pandya and my friends  it is my previlege to be with you and uh whatever doctor agarwal has said it is exaggerating it uh form or thing  i do not have those qualifications which he has narrated just now only thing is that uh i have been throughout a teacher  and a very long career of a teacher  earlier i was in uh rajghat baseti school a foundation for new education society run by doctor j krishnamurthy  foundation  and uh then i heard him in fact i had no intention to become a teacher but after hearing several lectures of doctor krishnamurthy  which was which had changed brought a change in my attitudes in life  i have not become disciple of anybody so far but most of these philosophers had been uh having some or the other impact on me  and i remember krishnamurthy as saying that when you want to create something new you have to start afresh you can't uh begin with the middle  and if you do it you will simply improve upon it you cannot  create something new  well i do not know how to start afresh because wherever i have gone i had got an established institution of course my studies i have started afresh and of course there i have been able to create a new discipline in the botany department of banaras hindu university  discipline of micro- ecology in which some twenty-five research scholars have got doctorate and a couple of them are registered  straight away i joined this college uh uh soon after passing my university and uh i am not that smart to run here and there  for a better job  whatever i got i wanted to make it better most suitable for me and here the people are so wise and intelligent that they moulded me into a science educationist and being a botanist and then a science educationist and then environmentologist and then ecologist and so many ist were added to my name and then ultimately i became a expert in uh out of science school science activity  and unesco accepted me as expert and resource person and sent me to work two three places along with an australian resource person and a canadian resource person  so the credit goes to our my great country which has a variety of states and very intelligent people we are  i can tell you because i have seen many people and i have studied in united states of america also and i find that their entire life and thinking process is just mechanical whereas our thinking process is radical and rather more philosophical  that is why we think very high but when we achieve little we get frustrated unnecessarily because this is just because when you think high and get little bit less you get frustrated nothing else  we are no way inferior to any nation in the world  and i am very sure and very hopeful that india will emerge  as one of the strongest and well built nation uh by the year two thousand is over  and uh regarding this particular programme i have only one thing to say that if india has to sustain as a great nation it will have to show the greatness which is required for a nation as well as for individuals  and the greatness in indian philosophy is dhairya  that is patience  you have to listen to others with great patience tolerate his views vidya education another aspect   dhairya vidya and then bravery you are coming from shivaji's place who was the i think bravest person in our country ever born  and of course patriotism is there  now this is all regarding that dhairya business  whatever we are going to do because tolerance comes when you  tolerate others  there may be hundred and thousand views about presenting a particular question or pasen presenting a particular question a subject in the text  say for example when somebody asks me what is the culture of india  ? which they said they say sanskriti  from which period we should count the history of india from vedic period aryan period or the medieval period or post independence period ? the that india which was existing in vedic period is no more that india existing  the india of medieval ages have also gone  and india born in nineteen forty-seven is the real deadline  from which we should think ahead and think about building a strong nation whatever is there it is we cannot call it partition india  in fact that much part of india was made free and made available to us  to live in and to work  the government of india is uh very much worried about certain aspects of national integration  and also atrocities on women uh either in the written form or verbal or gestural or what sort what may be the gists  say for example if somebody quotes a particualr religion  or a text of a religion others get hurt  now why should we do it ? if he is if if my words are hurting somebody we should avoid speaking those words avoid writing those words avoid seeking questions like that  so if if you want to maintain this secular infrastructure of this country we have to be very cautious in dealing with variety of people  and accordingly this committee has been set up to scrutinize  the question papers of maharashtra and gujarat to see if there are some anamolies and also to suggest methods of avoiding those anamolies  recently we received a letter from the council they they also want the original question papers which you will be scrutinizing so we will be dispatching this whole bunch to the headquarters also  so that india remains as india  india remains as a secular india  and uh nobody should have any sort of grievance that this was done therefore this has been this has happened  so to build up a real strong national character this step is essential  we have al already analysed the textbooks of various languages and various states on several aspects like uh bias uh religious bias or political bias or the  atrocities on women folk and bias also i remember one instance in a textbook it was cited that ram asked sita to go and fetch a bucketful of water from the well the objection was raised why seeta should go to fetch water  why not ram should go laughter  uh the male dominance is not liked  of course we should do away with that  too much dominance of female is also not good  it happens in our homes laughter  so we do away with that and you do away with this  laughter to make our li life  happier  so all sorts of things are there and there is no end to it also don't think that this will be the final  you may be again invited another team may come to do further uh  screening of the question paper  because if somebody wants to be hurt he need not even  read your text he may just simply see your face and get hurt  laughter  what we see that uh some people say that i am allergic to that gentleman whenever i see him laughter i get annoyed  it's alright you have every right to be annoyed  that is what happens in the college also  wherever there is a society of human beings some people you will always find annoyed annoyed unnecessarily no reason behind it but simply they are annoyed that's all  and you can't do anything  similarly here also you see only that the religious questions and the questions regarding to a particular religion are not there and if they are there how they can be moulded to keep the uh views of the people in their desirable limit or you can say that this it should not be feeling should not be hurt  now as a teacher i find that our role is the most difficult role which the society has given to us  we have made it easier by simply visiting the class and  telling whatever little you know to the students and then thinking that your job is over  but if you work very hard to achieve your goal you will find that your life span is very little  i feel that at the fag end of my career say only five or six years are left i feel that i have been able to achieve very little in this and a lot of things are to be done  and i wish that i live for another hundred years to see  a real good teacher being produced it's very difficult when i see the plight of our young people when i see the unemployment when i see the students struggling here for nothing  and uhn others other such cases also i intend  and in this college also i am only doing my routine duty  routine duties are so heavy that you cannot just do the other things  so my pound of wisdom is almost going to dry  to keep myself fresh i still continuing continue  taking a couple of classes so that that compels me to learn  and to go to the class  otherwise this college or any other college they are all true reflection of whatever society we have  now when anything goes wrong the teachers are caught and blamed so as a community i am warning you especially there is nothing to warn to people of maharashtra and goa they are wonderful  in our region  when i make a comparison only last week on wednesday i was at ahmedabad uh talking to the chief executives of education department with chief secretary and education secretary and directors of education and boards and all these people sitting  i said if you ask me to compare between the different between different states of the region i will say  goa and maharashtra are the best because the people are there sincere they want to work they want to work hard  and then comes madhya pradesh and gujarat is the last state  and you must take care of this thing why gujarat is lagging behind ? why your teachers are not coming forward ? if we invite fifty teachers from gujarat five come  fifty-five are forty-five are absent without reason  then one of them remarked that it is because they are all doing tuitions  so that is you to that is you to go into it  and this is this condition so they said that i will send  one person top officer at regional college of education bhopal  he will be visiting us very shortly to find out the problems of gujarati students students of gujarat state  that how is it there problems are genuine they do not know any language other than gujarati  they don't neither follow english nor hindi and we don't know gujarati at all  so how can we communicate with them so they are sitting in the classroom with open mouth and blank faces  so i said you introduce english in gujarat state also like other states because english is going to stay in our country  it is such a language which cannot simply be thrown out by even order  hindi will replace english in some hundred years  it is not a matter of say a decade or two  so he is coming to study the whole thing and then he will make a report and submit it to the gujarat government  so teachers' job is a very difficult job i tell you  and more you get bobbed down into it more you will be in trouble  but you should be a real teacher not just an orator of your subject  and for that you have to have a very deep understanding  your of your subject  you know we are all using our faculty upto cognitive domain only and there only upto recall and memory type of thing that is knowledge  and in knowledge when knowledge enters you develop understanding  we have done away with understanding part  and when you achieve understanding then you develop application of knowledge and skill  that is why indians are more philosophical than more skilled people  so these things we have to inculcul  inculcate among the students  your job is very simple one  and i think such a galaxy of stars will be able to complete it within a day or two or three not more than that  and i will request doctor agarwal the moment you complete your work you may be free to go to your places because we want uh   we want only a report on the analysis of question paper  so i have to attend another meeting at four so i take leave from you people thanking you very much to have come to come  over here and to do this particular type of job which not  which may not be to your taste i am sure  but still we have to do with them thank you very much clapping 
hello you know his importance i deserve as a direct student of gujral and the influence is very much there  that is why it has that philosophical basis  and uhm if you do not understand phenomenology lot of modern critical theory will not be understood because you know they based their idea on phenomenology  the idea of subjectivity we all these days we talk about subjectivity and phenomenology emphasises subjectivity you know how the subject is constituted interesting  idea and as a feminist literature feminist theory you always come across the idea of subjectivity how the subject is constituted  woman as a subject how it is constituted  uhm it is a cultural construction it's not a biological construction like someone who would say the woman was not born she was made  i am not a bo i am not a born woman i was made a woman  so the idea of subjectivity is not a very simple idea it's  very you know the historical construction of the idea of the subjectivity and phenomenology emphasise the idea of subjectivity and subsequently it became a problematical idea that uh  the notion of the subject the constitution of the subject how the subject is constituted is not an easy thing to say you know  it's not something that is result uh taken for granted  and the relationship between the subject and the object who is the subject who is the object ? uh sometimes you feel that the object perhaps is the subject you know so subject object axis is very complex and phenomenology i repeat it emphasise that notion of subjectivity  that's why it is called subjective criticism  whose subjectivity you can ask ? the readers the writers there is also narrator involved in the process of narrative the all subjects the reader is a subject the writer is a subject the character who narrates is a subject  so whose subjectivity and how one subjectivity is imbricated with another you know these are all complex say philosophical problems particularly when you deal with the narrativity you come across these kind of interesting uh i would say that colonical  of very interesting notions about subjectivity  and that's why you know subjectivity objectivity is a very is a false notion according to these there is nothing called objectivity you cannot be objective  objective  you assume that the whole world can be reduced into some kind of  immense neutrality which is a kind of objectivity  is it possible to do that ? the world also as a subject is constituted by your consciousness if individual response to the world in his own particular way where to get the sense of objectivity how is it that you want to be objective ? what is the basis of objectivity ? and who actually makes the basis ? the very fact that you define objectivity you are already  implicated into the very definition which is your personal definition  that is why it's a very very false notion the idea of objectivity there is nothing called objectivity  one is relatively uh you can say uh relatively know like subjectivity and objectivity or subjectivity refers to the subject objectivity refers to the object  and the does the object exist independently of your consciousness ? how does the object get a realised do you  perceive a thing all of you in a same way  when you come into the room your eyes you know glances at something not the entire thing and the same eye of another person doesn't glance at the same thing  so there is all like all i say you the sense of perception  had already reduced things into some kind of selectional it has already selected which thing to see and which thing to exclude from vision from perception  so the act of perception itself is a selective art and when the process of selection has already taken place in in a mental uh you know when when it is in a mental process that the idea of objectivity is lost you don't see the whole world together at a time  you see piecemeal and it comes to you through fragments  and the very fact that you will be selective uh whether you like it or not you are selective in your glance in your vision that actually negates the very idea of objectivity  how do you then make sense of the world ? if the world is such a vast thing which you can't see at a time everything how do you then make sense of the world ? can you really objectively say that the world is like this ? you know so these are all illusions and uh western philosophers particularly created the notion of objectivity as an idea it's a kind of platonic fallacy you can say something  exterior exists and we intuitively realise it's sense it and the very idea of intuition perhaps negates the idea of objectivity that you have some intui intuition in your think in your perception that negates the idea of subjectivity  uh objectivity so phenomenology says that objectivity is nothing it's  just an illusion and everything perception is personal subjective you see things the way you want to see them sometimes you refuse to see  deliberately you do not like to see things because you don't like to see them  but your vision is always selective in its own way it always selects things from a mass of events mass of things that you  uh are scattered around you you select a few because perhaps in a very i i interesting   way logical way become some to your uh thinking  so you select something that confirms to your line of thinking and so on and so forth  so basically any kind of response is a subjective response that is a case which phenomenology makes  you read a text you like it or you don't like it yes  sir phenomenology is the operate experience at subjective level yes but uh at its various uh student criticism like uh as you referred to rather the guidance of these landmarks feminist criticism or even black literature and so forth and so on cough  there since phenolism phenomenology applies to a sort of group volunteers yes it is a group concept i think so how this various or even the idea of new colonisation example literary criticism or literary creation so all this interpretation are can be traced back to the idea of phenomenology only in a way  you can do that you can say that  if there is some if there is a kind of group response and the collective response to something like you have mentioned the feminists or the blacks there have been from the third world any way cough but if there are variations if you look at the individual but there is something called and i that is why i say that and it varies from group to group it varies from person to person and within group there are lot of divergences and you can take note of that  if we account for all those divergences within the commonality which is a kind of one word imposed upon those desperate tendencies in individual perception in fact every individuals movements breaks down before it  takes off   naturally naturally nature of the very idea of phenomenology naturally so it is the very basis of human perception  you  a few words they were talking about their commonwealth now they say yeah about these this whole idea but you know commonwealth of course is a very hetrogeneous concept there is no commonwealth response  a few words  yes you can say there may be a third world reference  but they didn't  but they didn't talked about it to start with see they talked about it but you see how can you then say the australian response is similar to indian response or the canadian response commonwealth within commonwealth if they belong to the first world but still they didn't talked about it see this is as i say it is a desperate ideas yoked in violence you know it's kind of hetrogenity and that also is a very debatable idea  is there any communality of this kind of political term which unites the erstwhile colonies but the response of a canadian response certainly is closer to the american response than uh uh an indian response and you can't uh uh say that a first world country like canada  uh response this in the same way as a third world country so there is a lot of variations but uh phenomenology doesn't talk of course of a group response kind of thing they talk of individual and they don't really like the idea of this collective response is like collective action and if they name it some we will talk about that later on a slightly when we talk about to reader response criticism  but the collective response idea also is self contradictory response cannot be collective because two people two persons do not think alike  and you group them together and say you think alike and you can't control human thinking it is so spontaneous  your own response is so spontaneous you can only politically manipulate the whole thinking process even to suit your convenience it is a political manipulation of human mind can be controlled technologically you know but human response certainly tries to evade this kind of technologing of the spirit  spirit could not be technologised in way you want them want it to be technologised but you can't even say you can't say there is nothing called collective response  blacks certainly think in their own way there is communality of interest  there is certainly when it comes to the the question of white domination they certainly respond in very general way about the notion of domination ideology power and so on and so forth and that is the kind of but it is not perception these people deal with more intensely deal more intensely with how you percieve things how things get realised in your consciousness get realised in your perception how things take shape in your mind so it is the the the kind of ideatic according to ferrel you refer you induce it to some kind of ideatic  ideatic reflection or ideatic uh uh reduction ideatic reduction or reflection idea if now reduced to that level of perception  perceptual you know  and a concept arises out of the innate perceptuality of her idea so that innate perception you perceive then you conceptualise first is perceive you perceive in your mental eye and that perceptuality of every ob the object gets realised  through your perceptuality your perception  there is no object until you see it in your mental eyes  it's not just a visual perception but is a very uh as you know is a very is a mental perception  you perceive the object and suddenly the object take shape in your mind then you conceptualise about it conceptualisation is a cerebral process that takes place only after the mental perception takes place has taken place  this is the way all visible objects are reduced to modes  by which you perceive an inner reality  as i say that it has some complicity with the plutonic idea of essence that the whole world is reduced to the object in a very miniature way in a miniature way the the visible world that you see is a miniature copy of the idea the essence which has occured it has that kind of traditional plutonic kind of notions of the visible and the invisible axis  what you see visible is only a manifestation of the invisible perception  the mind works in its own way and makes things possible so the object gets realised to a mental process and then it becomes manifested through the phenomenology of the object which is a manifestation is possible because of the mental perception  this is the idea of the ideatic reduction bracketing  everything is bracketed between you and the others so you operate at a very higher level of uh uhm  relationship between the object  so the objectivity is not uh nothing is objective per se  there is nothing called objectivity per se you know  objectivity is a realisation of the higher mode of subjectivity  objectivity the id object objectivity is the whole idea the objectiveness objectivity the object uh the objectiveness the object the objectness objectivity is objectness so the objectness which you call objectivity the very quality of the object is manifested through your subjective perception that is why where do you get the idea of objectivity  uh without you know some subjectivity  subjectivity makes the objectness possible objectivity is possible  so the object and subject come together in a very mystical way and that is why consciousness is the consciousness of an object you cannot have subjectivity without objectivity  you cannot have objectivity without subjectivity  this is the subject object relationship and uh the whole world the whole perception of the perceptual world is possible  because of this axis because of this relationship between the subject and the object  am i clear on this ? okay this is the basis of phenomenology and as you know  as you know already rightly pointed out that this is the fundamental  uh way by which you realise the object that you see around you the world comes becomes visible because of the mental  already mental process which was on and you create the object in your own perception 
in english studies there is unit module two  unit two point two point three teaching literature in english  what are the approaches to the teaching of literature in english ? what are the emergent areas in literature in english ? what are the research possibilities ? so a a and also uh  module three you have uh no i am sorry uh two point three  module three research areas in english studies what are the new critical tools evolved by the more recent critical method schools ? what are the trends in contemporary criticism ? what are the new approaches to research in linguistics stylistic etcetera ? so it is hoped that some of the things that i speak to you about will inspire one or two to go along these lines  of the two lectures first uh on auchitya  as a cri criterion of  literary assessment  yesterday i distributed a handout listing the eight major theories not the minor ones eight major theories  and the first of these which is the most notorious  rasa theory we discussed yesterday  today i am taking up what is listed there as number four   auchitya  i have a for distribution a bibliography a select bibliography of books and articles on the application of indian literary theory classical indian literary theory to uh litera   literary works especially uh to modern writings  uh which are available in english  so you will get a list and uh you can you can choose i won't be commenting on that list today but i shall like to comment on this yesterday we didn't have the black board today we have something which is not quite so black but we'll be able to use that clearing the throat  the bb writing these diagram i mention briefly  which is like uh teaching science in the in some of the old colleges  imagine this is a test tube because in the laboratory they didn't have a real test tube so everything was the work of imagination  but today i think i will draw the diagram which is provided by  kuppuswamy shastri as i mentioned yesterday and uh that two triangles and two circle indicate the relative importance of the eight fold system  uh there are some college who would prefer one theory to the other theory but i i have a attitude that each theory has its own specific application  no single theory not even from the west will explain the whole of the literary process  and the relevance of the theory depends on how liberally  how critically how meaningfully we apply this theory  what can a poor theory do if the user of the theory is not  imaginative enough to apply it intelligently  so we have the three major theories dhwani  rasa and anumana or anumiti  anumiti waad or anumanaya inference  these three are linked together by auchitya   that is without auchitya neither  dhwani nor rasa nor anumiti  by itself can deliver the goods  everything has to be used in a proper way that applies to the application of any literary theory as well  the blind application of any theory will not help us in appreciating or understanding or interpreting literature  the smaller triangle guna a guna  theory the alankara theory and  riti theory these are of different schools  and i have given the names of the people major critics who have advocated this with the basic texts  and linking guna alankara and riti  we have the uh smaller circle which will represent  vakrokti  for most of these translations are available in english but as i said translations were made by sanskrit scholars who knew their kind of english and therefore uh the translations may not satisfy the requirements of teachers of english  but it is good if teachers of english can take kindly to some of these tools of research and develop them in the complete confidence that we are free to interpret any theory we handle and we ought to do that not merely borrow them wholesale  so unless you breathe new life into these these are not going to help us  we have to deal with modern literature we have to deal with literature written in a foreign language  and uh we have the gap of thousands of years atleast two thousand years perhaps  so we have to take these into account and uhm what we get from these texts is only the insights  some evidence of efforts made by a people so long ago  to understand the literary process which which in fact defies understanding  no poet no musician will explain to us everything about his own art  musicians are most tongue tied in this you know you sit and listen to me i won't talk  it is a musicologist who will talk about it and he can do that because his mastery is comparatively limited  there are many things which cannot be uh talked about  which cannot be diverged which cannot be even apprehended by the performers so ther there is an element of mystery and we have eight different ways of probing into the mysteries of literary creativity  we will take up this auchitya theory today and uhm i will try to apply it to sophocles edipus rex edipus the king a greek play which is cutting across uh not only time but also space not because the greeks had come here at the time of the chanakya serial but because  uh there is a common ground  the humanist outlook says that there must be certain common grounds but you have to dig deep may not be on the surface  at the appropriate level you will find the connections just as we can discover that we are related to the eskimos in some way if we go back far behind in history clearing the throat  the whole paper has been written out uhm and you will get copies before it appears in some book  so i will read it out with some comments here and there  now scholars from the time of bharata have been conscious of this principle of auchitya  it was shemendra of the eleventh century who devoted a whole treaties to its discussion and thereby raised it to the level of a basic requisite of all successful literary creations  bharata thinks of it as a principle that ensures guna  or qualities and eschews or removes blemishes or  doshas  according to him the bharata the violation of auchitya  of some kind or other might be responsible for any one of the ten  identified doshas  that doesn't mean that there are only ten blemishes or ten kinds of blemishes  ten have been identified because uh you can't uh list all possible types of blemishes we categorise  that we do in modern times also  the concept of auchitya is employed in bharatas prescriptions for the successful staging of plays  although the word auchitya might not have been used by him  in the same way bharata then one word vamana anandvasna  have all recognised the importance of auchitya  but it was left to shemendra as i said the earlier to project the view that auchitya is a fundamental principle and that all other qualities will fail to have their effect if this principle is ignored  so rasa without auchitya will not work that is called rasa auchitya he list them all  shemendra has identified twenty-seven or twenty-eight aspects or areas in which auchitya can be perceived  now we must remember that these are these texts have come to us in a mangled form parts are missing and the works of many scholars have totally disappeared they are only remembered as  abstract names  uh but what what has been saved or salvaged gives us some idea of what can be done with some of these tools  these may be brought under five or six broad heads these twenty-seven or twenty-eight aspects which he has listed under names for instance pada vakya prabandha uh i have a list of uh these items and their translations  i think i'll read the english translations also you know the the auchitya at the sentence level is called uh vakya auchitya auchitya at the discourse level  is called prabandharth auchitya  then we have items under kavya shastra guna alankara and rasa that is uh under metaphor  kavya shastra and under poetics we have certain items  uh like rasa auchitya alankara auchitya guna auchitya so  guna by itself will not be a guna if it is in the wrong place if it is not used with propriety  on the other hand what may be called a dosha  by itself may become a guna if it is used with  auchitya  yesterday we pointed out that uh jugupsa  and uh bibhatsa which we find in uhm uhm naipaul may be considered gunas in his type of work not in somebody elses kind of work  so there is a kind of uh a justification on the basis of the appropriateness of the whole thing to the literary context  under vyakarna which is the major concern of these uh scholars we have pada kriya karaga linga vachana visheshana upsarga nibhava and kala  or uh words level verb level case gender the appropriate gender has to be used i will in my comment on uhm sophocles play i will comment on some of these  uh the use of number use of adjective the use of preposition  the use of article use of tense there should be appropriateness in all this grammatical features as well in a perfect work  but perfect works are rare and therefore you will be able to  identify violations of these auchitya which is called  auchitya bhanga  under loktantra shemendra lists as i said yesterday desa kula and vrata or place race and conduct  and there you can bring in all kinds of sociological criticism if it doesn't suit the particular class or race that is presented in a work for example if the nishada character the woodsman character in a play speaks a high level sanskrit utterance you know that will be inappropriate  so propriety or appropriateness has to be observed in the kind of characters that is presented and that was the idea  otherwise it can violate so there is a chance for sociological criticism to find its way if this is expanded but unfortunately uh it had not been done in ancient india  then under the title under the section kavi   or the poet we have a tatva  what is vrata vratasan ?  vrata is conduct behavior  appropriate behaviour for that man you know if a priest is presented as a character i think he has to  conduct himself in that way  that that's the meaning i give to it you know uh uh i think i have every right to use the ancestral property in my own way  and uhm when i have the term loktantra and  that's kula and vrata i think we have to get at them implied meaning  literary criticism is also interpretation of critical theories not only critical works i mean creative works  interpretation of critical works also has to be done that is what uh abhinav gupta did to anandvardhana when he wrote lochana as a commentary on uh  dhavnyaloka it's an explication it's a creative expansion of the basic ideas of anandvardhana  which had continued for uh centuries until everything seems to have stopped with jagannath pandit and appaya richir  and that is the thread we have to pick up   it's very un palatable to english teachers to try to do something which they have not done thirty forty years ago  uh and the indian language teachers are also very reluctant to do this  they haven't done this apart from discussing the theory they don't  seem to apply this to any modern novel   premchand's novels could be discussed in the light of some of these a total interpretation of tagore is possible but we have failed to do that  and uh i am here to pain you by saying that we haven't done many of the things and explanation is the british were there and we could not do  an english teacher need not feel that english is the last vistage of colonialism you know  teachers of english are not yet to perpetuate uh western values but they can accept everything from the west provided they are understood and absorbed into the system in which we operate  then uh tatva satva we have the uh  clearing the throat the the principles observed the level of consciousness of satva abhipraya or the intention  swabhava or character and characterisation which  is becomes uh very important substance imagination situation thought name in the naming of characters in aashirwad  or benediction  so in every aspect if you take a play for instance you will find examples of all these and a a total interpretation of any single play by using all these insights  now some of them may not be applicable to certain works  every theory has its built-in limitation and a theory survives because of its acceptance of certain limitations  if we recognise the limitation we can make use of it  and uh if doesn't work throw away the theory and not the literary work this is the basic principle  a theory may not apply because a theory is a very broad generalisation it's only a model  and under kavyangas which are not totally listed  three have been uh identified patra prameya  and sandarbha characterisation or rabatra  or patra and prameya or theme  and sandarbha or context  so uh if a uh good interpreter of this theory can develop even as shemendra discussed this theory in a book one word  study in the eleventh century  we could elaborate each of these and give it meaning because it's a part of a total scheme  and if you find any one of these not applicable to a  particular work i think you can reject that or ignore it for the time being that is how literary criticism is possible 
professor kamath professor dixit professor joshi  other members of the vidyaprasarak mandali members of the staff of both the kannada and the english high school my dear students ladies and gentlemen  i feel it an honour to have been invited to deliver the first dr maker endowment lecture  i should like to take this opportunity to compliment  professor kamat and his colleagues on the management of this institution  to have thought of an activity in which the community around this school can participate  one of the weaknesses of educational institutions in our society has been their failure to forge active links with the community outside we have talked about many ideas linking the school with the society  we have talked of school school complex we have talked of school college complex we have also talked of school community complex  but very little has been done  although a great deal can be done even within the limited resources of the schools and colleges  we have not been able to accomplish much in this very important  task of forging creative link with the community outside  the activities in the school and in colleges are meant for the children and the teachers of those institutions  but there are very few if any activities in which the public can participate and feel one with the school or with the college  this failure has affected the ability of the educational institutions to draw vital sustainance financial and otherwise  from the community which is in a position to help the institution in diverse ways  i am happy therefore to note that the society approached  and received positive response from dr maker in whose name this lecture series is instituted  it is an honour for me to be the first speaker and i hope that for many many years to come the experts on various subjects  connected with education and society because that professor kamat told me is the general topic education and society and under the rubbering of this general topic more selected more specific topics  will be taken up by experts for exposition in future lectures  i have been i have chosen rather not that i have been asked to the general topic was suggested to me and i was given the option of selecting any particular topic under the general theme of education and society  and i have chosen to speak on education and development  at the very outset one understands that education and development is part of a larger question namely what is the relationship of education to society ? historically the inter relationship between the two has never been universally accepted  the traditional view of education has been that it is geared  to the specific interest aptitude and needs of the individual  and education is defined as an activity whose purpose  is to promote and develop various aptitudes in the child  cultivate active habits in him and develop such skills and values and attitudes as would finally result in a well-rounded personality development  in other words education has most often been looked upon  as the principal means of individualist purpose of developmemnt of ones own personality  it is his aptitude it is his interest it is his need  to develop his own personality that have constituted the main focus  of education as an activity  the question and in my view the more important question  what should such a educated individual do or what ought such an individual educated individual what ought such an individual to do for his society or for his country is seldom raised in the field of educational discussion  that is supposed to be for each individual to decide  we give him a package over a period of ten fifteen or twenty years of education cultivate certain attitudes in him cultivate certain values in him cultivate an outlook on life in him and then we send him out in the wide world  let him decide what he wants to do whether he wants to lead a life entirely devoted to personal development or whether he wants to be of some use to the community around him and to his own country is a decision which the individual is supposed to take  therefore before going into the specific question of the role of education in development it may be useful to raise the general question whether education is an end in itself or whether there are larger societal purposes which education must serve ? the question has acquired urgency in modern times because education has become one of the key activities in the very process of modernisation  relationship between education and society has become the most fundamental problem of our age because education has become at once  the principal means of preservation as well as of change  traditionally society has looked upon education as a process by which to conserve to enrich and to transmit to succeeding generation the accumulated knowledge skills beliefs and values  on which the society's cohesion and permanence depends but in more recent times and especially in the developing world  and india belongs to the developing world education has increasingly come to be looked upon as one of the most potent instruments of development and also of change  as professor james coleman said and i quote  once regarded as essentially conservative culture preserving and culture transmiting institutions education now tends to be viewed as the master determinent of all aspects of growth and change  unquote  society has probably changed more in the last thirty years  than it did in the preceding three hundred years and this is equally true of both the developed world and of the developing world  it is this continuous and often profound societal change  and the salient role of the education in it that have brought to the fore the question concerning the nature of relationship between education and society  two major post second world war developments account for this new awareness  one is the emergent from colonial rule of the countries of asia and africa whose leaders at once turned to education as an effective instrument of modernisation and national development  the other is the growing awareness among the industrially advanced nations that in the continued emphasis on education lies the assurance of their scientific technological and industrial leadership  and even hegemony  the earlier attitude of treating education as though it were a self sufficient and autonomous system functioning in isolation of prevailing socio-economic realities was largely abandoned in favour of the more positive concept of education as a social sub-system  interrelated with and interacting with other sub-systems like the economic sub- system or and the political sub-system  there are at least three ways in which education has direct relevance to society  first is the way education produces suitably trained persons in required number to man the million institutions through which  society lives and grows  this i call the leadership function of education  second is the contribution education makes to economic development both in terms of skills and attitude  everywhere and particularly in the developing countries the belief in some kind of a cause-effect relationship between education and long term economic development has become almost an article of faith  the rulers of these countries have been relying increasingly  on considerations of economic development to justify greater state support as well as greater state control of education  underlying this emphasis on economic development is another article of faith namely that rapid economic development is the minimum indispensable requisite of democratic political development  i call this the development function of education  the third and equally important role of education relates to its socialization including political socialization function  what do i mean by socialization function ? socialization refers to that process by which individuals acquire values attitudes and feelings towards the social system  and towards their distinctive role in the social system  every social system is based upon its own unique value system  and seeks to perpetuate itself by creating an app   appropriate ideological support structure through shared values and beliefs among members of that society  education is the principal agency for this purpose which begins at birth and continues through both formal and non-formal ways all through life  for example a democratic society seeks to inculcate among its members values of freedom tolerance dignity and autonomy of the human personality justice and fair play respect for truth and belief in human reason and its capacity to solve human problems  a democratic society also seeks to encourage a healthy scepticism towards authority and power and especially towards all forms of dogma and seeks the help of education to achieve these goals i just now spoke of the increasing expectations from education  in social development in political development as well as economic development and i used the word development not merely in the in the rather narrow sense of economic development  i used the term development in a more comprehensive sense of economic  social as well as political  as against the nineteenth century liberal view of education  there is the other view of education as an agent of change and development and it is that view which prevails in india among official and non-official circles dealing with educational policy  it is argued that india is not yet a free society  in a fun in a fundamental sense if by freedom we mean something more than political independence  the indian society's hierarchical structure its caste system inequitus economic system and its anti-labour intellectual culture are formidable barriers to its development as free society and education will have to make a major effort to create a more egaliterian social order as a means to real freedom  unlike western societies where freedom usually meant freedom from the state in india and in other developing countries freedom means freedom from want hunger ignorance and disease in the eradication of which the state is expected to play a pivotal role  in such a situation education for freedom would have a far more positive content than is visualised in liberal education concept it would need to have two components in its curricular content  to enable students to relate their educational experience to their immediate social environment by participating creatively in the transformation of that environment to desired end  the first component would consist of the conserving aspect of education and would be dealing with knowledge information beliefs  values and attitudes  the second would be the participatory component which would have both a theoritical and an applied aspect such as work experience  or socially useful productive work  i do not have to tell an audience of school teacher what a mess we have already made of both these useful concept of work experience  and socially useful productive work  in india education is critically relevant in as much as it is a vital element in the process not only of comprehending but also managing development and change which are two crucial input in our pursuit of a modern nation making  education being a catalystic having a catalystic role it is wrong to look upon it as a self-contained neutral and autonomous system  rather it needs to be consciously oriented towards the building up of india as a nation and towards the realization of our national goals  of a rapid economic development in which the standards of living  for all people will continually be rising  education is thus a very important element in the process of development  but let me pause here for a moment and ask the question  what sort of development ? we all want to develop ourselves  there are no two opinions about that  and we want to develop as fast as we can  no two opinions about that either  but what sort of development do we want ? because much will depend upon our clarity in the conceptualization of quote unquote development that our curriculum in education that our teaching learning and everything else that goes in schools and colleges the character of the activities in schools and colleges will depend upon the clarity we have and the national consensus we are able to build on this central concept of development  until twenty or thirty years ago developing countries like india answered the questions what sort of development do you want  by saying we want much the same sort of development that industrialised countries of the west have achieved  in other words we want to imitate england we want to imitate the united states we want to imitate germany japan soviet union or france we want to become like the western industrialised society whose high standards of living have been made possible by a rapid process of industrialization with central emphasis on basic industries  we want large scale industrialized civilization  it is only when we have that kind of process of development  based on rapid industrialization of the economy that we shall be able to call ourselves modern india a developed india  an india in which the citizens are assured of an ever increasing standard of life  that was the general acceptance of the western model and there was a near unanimity on the need to adopt and imitate the western models of development  but now things are changing  things are changing both in india in other developing countries but more importantly things are changing in the industrial world the western world itself as they have begun to see that the model that was adopted and developed in their own countries is not necessarily applicable all over the world 
hello uh recap we said that there are atleast  two schools of thought when it comes to the scope of economics  one is distribution one emphasises allocation  depending on the school of thinking your tools of analysis also differs  for example when you have distribution as your aim then your thinking apparatus will be in this way where surplus is distributed between workers and entrepreneurs  whereas when you have allocation as allocation as your aim then your tools of analysis are calculus  one another distinction  when it comes to the question of allocation substitution between the two things becomes the central issue  alfred marshall in his principles of economics if you see  the eighth edition which was the last one that is there if he had lived upto now he would have made further editions of the same thing  it is a very nice book people don't read these days that book  it is very good  for the sheer english language atleast it is worth reading  apart from very perceptive ideas  marshall was a man of tremendous perception  joan robinson once said that he has a woman's perception like that because women are considered to be more perceptive than men  laughs  uh so that that that's the way she described him  well if you see in the preface alfred marshall says  that the chief merit of this book is the application of the principle of substitution in every branch of economics because if you don't have that substitution you can't have the maximisation thing  it is an essential part of it  for example if i have a curve like this i can't take a tangent it requires that i have a a relationship which has a curvature here here for example it is diminishing this but it is diminishing at a constant rate  whatever i give up in pie i get in w u and vice versa  whereas here there is an assumption that there is diminishing marginal rate of substitution  this is at the heart of micro economics  take away this assumption micro tools are not there  but at this point one another thing which is normally not refer to in text books let me present to you  this assumption of diminishing marginal rate of substitution  you know it is an assumption independent of mathematics independent of mathematics  for example take the most important micro foundation that first chapter the students learn  that is about utility theory utility maximisation  and when the students come to the classroom we tell them that uh  that if there are two commodities and if i let us say q one  and q two are the two commodities  and i tell the students you know that utility is a function of the consumption of these two commodities  right ? and i make an assumption that the more he consume the more he is satisfied  more is preferred than less  and we make an assumption that preferences are transitive  though you know that it is if a is bigger than b and b is bigger than c than a is bigger than c and not the other way round this kind of axioms of choice we teach them because on that basis this is the micro foundage you know micro economic is grounded in individual behaviour  and those individual behaviour we give in the form of axioms of choice  right ? and on the basis of that we try to derive what is known as an indifference curve or a utility function  first we say utility is a function of q one and q two and in the next page or the next paragraph the text book draws a picture like this b b writing  they won't explain how come this equation this picture came  that is why students find it very difficult to understand  and you know sometimes teachers also find it difficult and sometimes you know what happens is the students don't ask questions luckily otherwise it will be very laughter very embarassing for the teacher because from this to this you try your best  it is near impossible to get that equation i will tell you why  that is what we have to learn in refresher programmes  something on the foundation because what happens is you know for twenty years some book comes we teach to our students on the twenty-first year they say we have changed this book because this is a wrong book like that  we also start saying the same thing laughter  you know in the beginning we didn't ask the question why are we reading this book and teaching to our students  but before that we try to translate it because we want to have it everything in this one and in second bo you know it is happening like that as if knowledge comes for from there  it is true knowledge comes from everywhere  but it can also start from here too  and there can be an exchange that is possible if we look at these things critically  and therefore if we find that there is some problem herer  error here i'm not suggesting throw this away  no no far from it  but remembering that such a kind of a thing is there it is not something very perfect  it is imperfect but all knowledge is like that whether it is physics or even mathematics or even mathematics uhm i will not go drag you into that controversy which is a very interesting one let me come back to this  i am talking of micro theory now foundations of micro theory and in that micro theory takes allocation as the scope of economics it takes calculus as the tool for analysis  it assumes about individuals  the major assumption it makes is people are selfish  they don't say it like this they say they are rational laughs  because if i say people are selfish it looks very bad look he is blaming uh being sales kind of people there we write  uh people are rational and rational means that i can order my preferences and choose the best  that capability i have like that  it presumes numeracy and order  that kind of a capability must be there then only i can okay it assumes like that and it it has certain a sect of axioms about preferences and then we say that utility is a function of consumption  and then we say let u bar be the level of utility  because unless you have this u bar fixed you don't know where is the first point to this graph so you take the first point like that and then draw this curve  but there is a problem because suppose u bar is equal to hundred b b writing right ? then i get some utility by consum  consuming q one let's call it alpha times q one so much alpha amount of satisfaction i get by q one  and then that is the beta amount of satisfaction i get by consuming q two  if this total is hundred then if this fifty that must be fifty if this is seventy-five that must be twenty-five  if this is forty-five that must be know like the it it can't be more or less and this hundred can be retained  and if you retain that hun don't have that hundred you can't draw the curve  if you have that hundred then we find you can try it out any number of times  then we find that it will be a line like this and not a curvature like this  but if you don't have a curvature i can't have a tangent  if i don't have a tangent i don't have a maxima  therefore i need a tangent and if i have to draw this tangent i need to make an assumption  and economist at the micro level have assumed diminishing marginal rate of substitution  it is a contradictory assumption to the givens  naturally the right assumption when you say u bar is equal to this and draw the curve it has to be this way  but we are drawing it this way for mathematical convenience if you take any journal any magazine and start let u be a function of something twice differentiable we make an assumption  differentiable means drawing of tangent that is finding derivitives we say in mathematics but drawing a capa  capacity to draw a tangent  it is tangent is drawable such a curve is assumed  if it was natural there was no need for an assumption  we are making an assumption because this is there is a contradict has anybody followed this ? you can ask me questions about all these things  even in between the lecture also you can stop me and ask i will explain any number of times because this is not there in books  because striking this out is striking the root of neo-classical economics  because if you can't draw this you can't draw an isoquant  same principle is true an isoquant is supposed to give iso means equal quant means quantity  isoquant means equal quantity if equal quantity is to be there then substitution should have been a straight line  because what is happening is here the x axis the y axis  and here is the third axis this is the utility axis actually  and this length is fixed that's why u bar  and what we have here is a projection of this third axis  because it it's a three dimensional picture drawn in a flat way it it happens to all the artist when they are painting  it's usually three dimensional but it is written on a flat surface  but your perception your understanding is like that so here is a third axis not seen   it's projection and as long as this is fixed and straight it this can't be ano anything  other than a straight line  if this is it because scale has to be straight  therefore and it is fixed and it will be a line like this and marginal productivity become in fact that is why many people criticise marginal productivity theory  on several grounds they criti criticised  that  the classical school of thinker don't believe in the marginal productivity theory as you know because for them the wage fund is given  and then the activity of production takes place  whereas for the neo-classical ec  economist the production activity takes place with using those inputs  and then those inputs are used again on the basis of supply and demand thing  and brings rational producers and consumers  they will supply and demand in such a manner that the price they offer ge gets them some return  and that return is as much as what they contribute to output  that's how the marginal productivity theory comes  with all its difficulty it has a grain of justice  in the sense that give him what he has contributed   it's quite a nice concept that is why if you give each person what he has contributed than zero profit condition comes   that's how the one word theorem comes into picture  you see how this is micro economic foundation  are you understanding me ? because you can't have your micro economics without this kind of a thing  one another question  in actual life when you make a choice the choice is never like this because this assumes that always you buy a combination and not any one of them  otherwise it would have beeen somewhere in the intercepting  the indifference curve always start from head here not here there is a need that i must have all the time a combination  that may not be so in actual life except when women are buying their  sarees and they want a matching blouse piece  then only a combination question comes otherwise and moreover a saree and a blouse piece are not substitutes   laughs they are compliment they are compliment and not substitutes and therefore you can't have law of substitution there yeah so actual life what happens actual life is you go to a shop you ask the various prices and things like that you see the colour this that etcetera and so on  and you know how much you have the money and and therefore  then you can order them and take according to you the best  so it will be a line like this rather than a curve like this so but here we have got a choice model which is uh as if thing it is a world of its own  we have created a world of choice making  and then we are making assumptions about substitution and on the basis of that we are deciding the best using the tools of calculus  this is so in the economics of consumption economics of production of international trade any area you go  that is why professor samuel san when he wrote his book   foundations of economic analysis if you see that book you'll find from page one to the last page it is nothing but a systematic application of the theory of differential calculus the same tool the same kind of graph but they are interpreted  if instead of q one and q two i make it k and l it becomes an isoquant and instead of the budget constraint this becomes a cost line  isocostline and wherever they are tangential there it is a question of commodity substitution here it will be a question of fact of substitution  the terminology is different the context is different but the tool is the same  at the foundation of economic analysis you have dispariding of thinking  that is the first point i wanted to present to you because if you say what is at the foundation of micro economic is this behaviour is disparidgm 
madam principal prof surendragopal department of history and director i e s coaching institute uh officers from the university different teachers coming from different parts of the eastern regions students ladies and gentleman i am very happy that the course has been organised for increasing  proficiency in english  i am not uh myself a very proficient man in english uh being a student of uh mechanical engineering all throughout and as you know  the technocrats and scientists they mostly do through symbols  you will say is equal to we'll write a two parallel lines and it remain you see even the same thing  in fact uh any language is uh also a symbol  you have a vocabulary and you use words you combine them in such a way that it conveys your feelings  the general concept of having proficiency in english like a common man you will say if we get something written in a very uhm difficult or one word way they will say oh he is the man is very proficient or if you listen to a speech in which you don't follow most of the things then you will say that he is a very learned man we could not follow  but my concept is uh i mean and i think the people will also agree with me it's different  a man is having proficiency in any language if he is able to convey what he wants to  if you are not in a position to convey your feeling or your thinking or your thoughts then no matter which language you use  uh you are not fulfilling your objective  so i think this type of courses should we organised not only for those who are doing courses in english or uh those who have taken english as a subject but mostly for such persons who don't get opportunity to use english uh to that extent as is  done by other english student  for example technocrats or doctors you will see that these technical people even uh say for example a doctor he will write a prescription except a few those who are very brilliant otherwise also that you can't read the name of the medicines  i was very much surprised when you go to a compounder he will read and give the appropriate medicine  i was very much worried how that fellow can read and i can't read it  then later on i don't know whether it is a fact or uh not  but somebody said the doctor they can't write the name of the medicine correctly they will always commit a spelling mistake so they just give some kind of symbol and a person who is uh dealing with all these kinds of medicine in day today life looking at the prescription that what is the disease what is the symptom they will give you the appropriate medicine  so that is the story for a technical people and you have i don't know how you have invited me either it is by virtue of the position i occupy in the university or i mean unknowingly you consider me very learned man that i can speak on any subject given to me  originally i was asked to distribute the certificates only  and i mean i was very happy due to the simple reason that i will have the opportunity of listening to people having proficiency in english and at least i can uh learn how to write correct english  and increase uh some of my vocabulary  anyway i am very happy that inspite of a very adverse social and political situation due to election and uh  adverse weather condition this sweating and intense heat  temperature uh mercury uh going up to forty-four degrees centigrade i think during this period itself  lot of variation in the temperature  you have conducted the course upto the satisfaction of the participant as i could uh gather from the reaction survey  uh given by to a student you have stayed here you must i mean those who have come from outside they must uh have faced lot of difficulty i don't know whether you have taken them on some tour through  uh i don't know i'm i am not aware but i i i hope  uh they must have taken you round to the places uh like rajgir or say bodhgaya or some other uh uh places of tourist tourist interest  i especially thanks thank uh  those faculty members who have come from outside the state  by their presence our students have been encouraged  they have been benefitted and they uh will be benefitted in the long run even the course duration was rather uh only two and  three week  three weeks but a still a three week  weeks are sufficient for this type of courses i express my sincere thanks uh to uh the institute central institute of foreign language at hyderabad for selecting patna as one of the centre centres  normally now the concept outside the state is patna is a very disturbed place and rather it is very difficult in most of the situations to organise successfully uh such a course  i don't know whether it was well publicised or not because most of the participants are girls only few boys uh students i could find  and mostly they are from patna university mostly from here  uh so i believe it can be well publicise we can invite teacher  actually we really need to teach teacher how to teach english ? or for that matter how to teach uhm what you call any subject ? now this english is uh so much essential with the advent of computer and oth other electronic gadgets  actually now we have developed a language which can be understood by a machine if you are using mostly in uh computer side  there a still either hindi or english or for that uh sorry uh sanskrit or any other language they don't have any place  still there maybe with further development we can do it uh uh other languages also  but inspite of all uh uh effort efforts   by the government or uh by other agencies to promote hindi or any other language we can't do away with uh uh english  because it is a language which is a essential for at least scientific knowledge  in the scientific world you can't do with any other language except english even in russia or uh in france or any other country using some other kind of foreign language they've to write a computer programme in english  so they're actually mostly it is symbols but even using symbol with proper grammar of the machine language  becomes essential  with all these words i again thank all the participants and congratulate the student students for  a participating in such type of course  i am thankful to the authorities for giving me an opportunity to be with the learned scholar scholars  from all over the country or mostly from the eastern region state and the participants of the schools  thank you very much clapping 
what i propose to do this morning is to reinforce some of the points that i made yesterday and then move on to two or three new points  let me say firmly and with all the uhm with with the power underlying my perception of teaching in india that grammar has a very important role to play  so grammar is not out  don't go back with the impression that grammar is out  grammar is in because as i said yesterday grammar is the heart and soul of a human language  no grammar no language  language means grammar  now the question is that we are teaching and learning english as a second language how should we present the facts of grammar in a classroom situation to facilitate the learning of english which means use of english effectively in a variety of situations  so it's not a question that we are not uh sitting here  to say that alright grammar is out now  what we are trying to say is what is going to be the best way of presenting the facts of grammar  so that's point number o one   point number two is that it's very difficult to draw a sharp line between grammar and lexis  and therefore in producing our teaching materials you will have to have two types of materials to be highlighted b b writing  and these two types of materials will be sentence-based grammar  and word-based grammar  and one of the excellent reference books at the secondary level is even now that old palmer's grammar of english words he selected about thousand productive words and he has presented the grammar of those words in the form of a dictionary  it's an excellent book even now  and we are going to do these two within the over-all frame-work of b b writing  so we are going to organise our materials grammar materials in two parts sentence-based grammar and word-based grammar  but whether it's sentence-based grammar or word-based grammar the actual presentation will take place in the context of  discourse of because the point that i made yesterday we are not interested in grammar for the sake of grammar  we are not interested in rules for the sake of rules  we are interested in making the rules function making the rules function  how do we make use of rules to produce language texts or discourse materials ? so that's second point  uh an example of word-based grammar will be b b writing  the choice of verb  you have a network of verbs and then which one to select  in a given context or in a given text  and then the grammar will say once you have selected this  then your choice here is restricted which will also mean that  b b writing this will rule out the possibility of   a that clause coming after this whereas if you select c then you can have a   that clause  third point which i would like to reinforce is b b writing the learner's mind is that mysterious black box  and our ultimate objective is language as i said yesterday is a meaningful human activity  this is the meaning this is the experience this is human experience   how do i say  what are the possible forms that i should be using to convey this meaning or this experience ? and the whole thing is processed mysteriously by this learned black box  so once again we are moving from we are not saying that form is useless  what we are saying is language is a meaningful activity  so what the learners have to have their focus on is  this is the meaning this is what i propose to do  language that's why one of the titles of halliday's  important book is learning how to mean  this is a very important concept  second language learning a second language means  learning how to mean in a new context of culture  learning how to mean  how do i mean ? i know how to mean in my mother tongue  how do i mean in my other tongue which is english ? so learning how to mean is learning to categorise human experiences you remember the point that i made multilingual view of the universe bi-focal view of the universe  this is when i have english glasses on this is how the world appears  when i have my marathi glasses on this is how  now i am using english in the marathi context of culture  how do i use english ? again inspite of all that you keep on saying your students are going to address you as respected sir which is not english but   chalta hai  in our context of culture it's something which is very important they want to show their respect for their teachers so we are moving from meaning to form   it's movement just as yesterday we said we are moving from fluency to accuracy  ultimately our ultimate objective is to help learners produce texts and once they start producing texts the text must be linguistically also accurate  but we are not going to clears throat to put a check on the fluency right at the beginning  we are going to encourage them to play with language  just as a human child in the context of his l one plays with language tries out experiments tries out all kinds of tricks  so we will allow a second language learner also to play with his language  but as a teacher we are around and we keep on saying oh i see what you meant to say is has he come this morning  ? and things like that so what we are doing is as a result of interaction what you are doing is exposing him to your concept of the standard variety of this language  so in fact all movements are from dialectal varieties idiolectal varieties to a frozen standard variety of language for the time being  so we are moving from dialect from idiolect to what we consider at a given point of time to be the standard formal variety of that language  then i said that every teacher of a second language in fact i will say also of first language has to have a set of  b b writing reference tools  and the two important tools are b b writing  as teachers we must get into the habit of looking up a standard reference grammar and looking up something in a standard dictionary  when in doubt go to cobuild or  longman or we have had for years in the field of e l t advanced learner's english dictionary  which we have been using but we have now better dictionaries as reference dictionaries grammar i said we need three types or three levels b b writing reference grammar   what do i say is this alright ? now you will find that in all the states in the country today  newspapers they have i don't know about maharashtra but down south  deccan herald hindu now deccan chronicle news time they have a column every week either  know your english subramaniam or  mind your language or yadurajan's i forget the title of his series  so there is a big demand is this the right kind of english that we are using ? and this demand is coming from senior i a s officers senior executives   am i really right the way i am writing the way i am drafting ? so there is a big demand for grammar   it's not true that there is no demand for grammar and  it's not at the learner's level it's at fairly advanced level  people feel that if they are going to make a sophisticated use of language then they must be accurate  so accuracy comes at that level after you have started handling the language in your own way then at a particular level you feel that it must be grammatically accurate  of course there is nothing like one standard form there are varieties of standard forms also b b writing  then we have teacher's grammar  now the reference grammar derives all the insight from a  linguist's grammar a linguistically oriented description of a language and for example i will treat quirk greenbaum  and svadvik a comprehensive reference grammar of modern english   because what they have done is they have captured the insights from transformational grammar chomsky's generative grammar   halliday's systemic grammar filmore's case grammar  traditional grammar and then put them together  so it becomes an exhaustive comprehensive description of contemporary english   teacher's grammar at different levels for teachers we have to have different levels of grammar which the teachers will need  in order to teach b b writing   learner's grammar will have minimal of technical terms  and the main focus will be use of language in a variety of situations  i will give you an example in a minute  for example b b writing we set an exercise on  ramu's routine activities every morning  the focus is on every morning  what does he do every morning ? now see our emphasis is on every morning  a person who does something every morning as a matter of habit habitually  so although we are not saying that what we are going to have in this text is simple or habitual present but we are highlighting that indirectly  because our main thing is characteristic activities of this person every morning  what he does every morning ? so he gets out of bed at six every morning he brushes his teeth and so on so on so on  and then at end we have a box item  after they have practised language you have a box item and this box item is for generalization in the form of grammar  and we say this is what in grammar is called the simple present and you underline the simple present  so we are not teaching the simple present for the sake of the simple present  we are saying that there are certain things activities which a human being does habitually repeatatively again and again regularly  and that gets focused you can underline that and then at the end you have  the simple present as a box item  in fact this mechanism of box item was used by i forget  the name of that american linguist uh felix it will come back  to my mind later  lado  haan  fries and lados no no not fries and lado they you we had rapid review of english grammar we have ten or twelve copies  prininska sir prininska prininska prininska yes prininska  trusty matter that's all ah ha yeah  some prininska  haan haan yeah  a few words   let's take anothe another  example b b writing  the passive b b writing  even in our text books we have to organize it in two parts  right at the beginning there should be uh some kind of  some instructions built into the text which the teacher is supposed to follow in teaching presenting that particular lesson or that particular text item  for the teacher it's very important for him to know that  b b writing  this is the formal representation  if it's not there then it's not be  passive it may be some other kind of passive  so the teacher must be familiar with this that the real form of the passive will be a choice of a form of the verb to be followed by  the main verb or whatever verb comes after it in the past participle form   that's one thing that the teacher must know  second thing that the teacher must know is it's a  mechanism a linguistic mechanism a language mechanism for promoting the object and demoting the subject  but this is for the teacher  what are the situations that are that may necessitate the use of the passive ? the situational factors are that we are either not interested in the agent in the doer or that the doer is unknown or that the doer doesn't need any mention  then the sufferer the affected the receiver comes to the front  this is subject position and the verb has a marked feature  be plus in past participle  so the teacher must know that the use of the passive is context governed use   it's the context that gives you a clue to the use of the passive  and if you look at your text  you see blood transfusion  now this is a kind of text which belongs to the register of science  and in the register of science unless it is biographical or autobiographical the doer is not so important   it's the action that is important it's the activity that's important   it's the thing done that's important so i have marked on the first two pages at least ten examples of the passive  where they say now this is done every day with good results uh very little can be done now about this because it has already been done  change may be caused if you do this  a soldier may be brought in and put to bed  a man's blood was changed  man could be put into something something something  these were the things which were asked  this was tried out  it was done and so on  so on the first two pages i find that the focus is on activity on the action done on the thing achieved rather than on the agent or the doer 
principal madavee shri suresh pendse who has been put in a position of eminence in a most unexpected manner dr shastri prof pradhan shri  dhuri who is sitting just below me on the right hand side  and shri tatyasaheb patwardhan or tatya patwardhan if not tatyasaheb and members of the resource person team  members of the staff of the english department of this college and  fellow participants in this two day seminar on the method or methods of teaching or trying to teach varieties of english  to the twelfth standard boys and girls who happen to join our college when prof uppar it may be pronounced as upper also you see  laughter that also is there saw me in my residence at bombay  and showed me the letter of the principal i said see i am most innocent into bracket ignorant of the subject matter of your discussions or participations  on my great teacher later on i'll have his i have something to say about him uh dr v k gokak  uh it was said of him that he had a first in english we don't say first class we say first means first class  in english language and literature in the university of oxford in the year nineteen hundred and thirty-eight  and i matriculated in nineteen forty  and karmveer bhaurao sent me to this great teacher in sangli  and i was a little student with a gandhi cap  when i first told that our sir had got a first class in english language and literature i didn't understand the distinction between the two  later on i came to know what literature was and what language is or is likely to be  and being a teacher of english for nearly twenty-three or twenty-four years i was never in charge of teaching grammar  my acquaintance with english is through tarkhadkar translation number one number two number three  perhaps you do not know who tarkhadkar was ? laughter  or why he bothered to write these three books of translation when one was quite enough ? a kale's lesson in english translation rao was kale's  younger brother satara r r kale   kale's lessons in english translation  so i matriculated as i said in nineteen forty so our method of methodology of teaching english at satara was to put it very  roughly very crude  but having come into contact your principal said prof patil is a living example i hope it is still living laughter  and as i was telling my old friend suresh pendase in the bus in the car that he was so kind enough to place at our disposal  i received letters from my friends barrister p g patil  ajeev sevak rayat shikshan sanstha satara  now the word is aajeev sevak they said  ajeev sevak ajeev means nirjeev  laughter  and if by looking at me if he has that idea i wouldn't quarrel with him laughter  so this literature the horizon of literature was open before us in that small college with a population of a its enrollment was dr shastri i myself don't believe when i joined sangli  willingdon college sangli gokaksaheb who had come from oxford the strength was three hundred and fifty  all four classes of arts and two classes of upto inter-science  six classes three hundred and fifty  and the professors were about thirty-five that means per every professor ten students which is a good good quota i see  and as i said dr gokak came from oxford trailing clouds of glory do we come from heaven from god who is our home  now i am in my proper element uh not grammar but literature  i had these two lines young men and women are from wordsworth ode on intimations of immortality from recollections of early childhood  this is the mouth feeling type ode on intimations of immortality from recollections of early childhood  and there wordsworth is developing the thesis of  samadhi  when we are laid asleep in body and becoming living soul  samadhi uh don't think about samadhi because you are very young men and you not bother about that just now  laughter  and there is a famous stanza which begins with where these lines occur our birth is but a sleep and a forgetting the soul that rises with us our life's star hath had elsewhere it setting and cometh from from afar not in entire forgetfulness  and not in utter nakedness but trailing clouds of glory do we come from god who is our home heaven lies about us in our infancy shades of the prison-house begin to close around the growing boy and he sees it in his joy until at last the vision fades far away into the light of common day  now i have quoted about ten or twelve lines which i heard from  the lips of my great teacher  when i was sitting on the very first bench that was my only distinction  sitting on the first bench because sometimes mr president our one of our teachers in sangli was not speaking loudly enough  so i said sir you are not being audible even on the first bench whereas our teacher said and the principal the dr shastri has allowed me the free use of marathi language occasionally  so he said you can't hear me ? i said no sir i can't hear in marathi  laughter in marathi  a man who thinks about this filling things etcetera he has missed his way in the college  so dr gokak this is how we see he used to and dr gokak never stood on one spot on the platform  he used to move from one end of the platform to the other those of you who have visited sangli willingdon college you know that f y arts class  and in those days dr shastri as you know the professors had to wear a dark gown  town and gown town and gown this is a a terminology from the university of oxford and cambridge  town means people from the city and gown means people  students from the university  town and gown that has become very brown now so uh that is  laughter  and so dr gokak used to play with us as if we were little children in the family  he used to engage two periods in the f y arts classroom which  which principal would engage f y arts students or p g students  i understand these days principals don't bother to take any class at all laughter  i hope you see this time dishonour rule does not obtain in this college laughter  because basically uh i was so happy to know that your principal gets a salary of eight thousand rupees  laughter eight thousand  and when i started teaching in sangli uh satara under karmveer bhaurao my salary per month after b a london bar at law was seventy-five basic and forty-five days allowance laughter  this is arabian nights stories laughter   b a bar at law b a london bar at law salary one hundred one hundred and twenty rupees  this fellow should be sent to the yeroda or mental home  laughter  and when uh dr shastri was saying uh sir what about  vice-chancellor's pay i was getting two thousand rupees as v c  vice-chancellor v c  but the work was so difficult that rather then be v c i went to w c  laughter  and my salary at that time was two thousand rupees  and income tax and other tax cut i use to get fourteen hundred  rupees per month  but money is neither here nor there what what salary did karmveer bhaurao get ? no salary because he was an honorary worker  and hence boys and girls i am a a very senior persons so you are all boys and girls for me laughter  i was taught this poem in the fourth standard the eighth standard now fourth standard in my time abu ben adham  adam means aadam  really it is aadam but this lee hunts did not know aadam  so whether it is aadam or adam or adham same thing   abu ben adhem a d h e m may his tribe increase this is a famous phrase in english may his tribe increase  today our tribes are increasing by leaps and bounds on the family front laughter  so abu ben adhem may his tribe increase  and i'm quoting this poem please remember the way i am keeping time keeping rhythm  this is how our teacher used to teach us abu ben adhem may his tribe increase awoke one night from a deep dream of peace  deep dream of peace  some of you uh gentlemen have dreams  some of the dreams are black and white some some professors get into technicolour dreams but that is alright laughter   awoke from from from one night amo from a deep dream of peace and saw within the moonlight in his room making it rich and like a lily in bloom  lily not name of a girl lily or leela   like a lily in bloom making it rich and like a lily in bloom  he saw in his dream an angel writing in a book of gold  exceeding peace had made ben adhem bold  gold rhyming with bold   exceeding peace had made ben adehm bold and he wri  he asked him what writest thou  tarkhadkar translation today you don't know what thou is ? i write we write thou writest he writes she writes they write  where is thou now ? t h o u thou that is now planted and supplanted also  janabai that famous saint of maharashtra says yega yega veethabai maze pandhariche aai  uh i remember this not because i am pandurang patil  you see yega yega veethabai maze pandariche aai   vitthal is suppose to be a mother and so yega yega veethabai  we say this is unmannerly you should say yaho yaho vithalrao kuthe gela hota magapasun laughter  so yega yega veethabai maze pandhariche aai  so that thou thou pronoun is to be used when you are addressing god  when you are addressing your parents or mother and when you are addressing your beloved forget about the third thing but if you say god laughter  and our mother  whenever most of us go barefooted in our childhood and whenever you see a thorn pricks into our sole s o l e sole of our so we say aai ga  do we say baba ho ? aai ga that is the significance of yega yega veethabai  so thou what writest thou  the angel was writing like this  the vision raised its head and said the names of those whom love of lord has blessed  i don't know what your name is mr so and so i am writing down the names in my book of gold the names of those whom love of lord had blessed  now this is a list of successful people   so abu ben says is mine one  is my name in the list of successful lottery winners ?  is mine one nay not so  nay of course today you don't use nay  we say n e i g h that's different neigh laughter a horse neighs and the lion roars which is neigh nay n a y means no nay not so your name is not there  when abu knew that his name was not the poet has used the word  in the next line abu spake more low   nav hai ka ? nahi ararara  abu spake spoke more low   then write me as one who loves his fellowmen  if my name is not there in the list of people whom love of lord has blessed then write me as one who who loves his fellowmen   the angel wrote and vanished  generally angels don't come back a second time   the next night it came again with a great wakening light  the light which woke up abu with a great wakening light  and showed the names of those whom love of lord has blessed  and la last line lo l o  means beholds   lo ben adhems name led all the rest  means he stood first in the first class  i have recited this sonnet a poem with fourteen lines  because this is the description of all benifactors of mankind  whether they are people like sadguru gadage maharaj  i was professor at sadguru gadage maharaj karad and beyond our college there is a another college started by yashwantrao  chavan's institute science college yashawantrao chavan science college now venutai cha arts college now  and those colleges had very majestic and imposing buildings as your principal has said six buildings worth sixteen  lakhs of rupees  so i can't i have not not only cou not counted but i can't see so much amount of money haven't seen so much amount of money  and our gadage maharaj college was only a a monastery  math of sadguru gadage maharaj a small building unimposing building and me and mrs patil working there  and the boys used to be matriculates from our high-school  because as the principal said we run forty-four colleges and three-hundred and seventy-eight high-schools  not even your director of education department run such an enterprise  so we asked the boys you see why is it that you see you are over stepping us and going to that college  they said sir your gadage maharaj college is only a math  gadage maharaja's math  laughter  and that is true this person gadage maharaj gadage those of you who come from rural areas know what a gadage  is ? laughter  these days nobody has seen a gadage  we have only seen  he had this royal insignia this earthenware pot was the royal insignia of this great saint gadage  ladies and gentleman when you were born very few of you have  been born in a nursing home because to be born in a nursing home you have to give a previous notice to the doctor in our case no notice was ever given laughter  why we were born is a mystery ? laughter  how we were born is a still greater mystery ? and where we were born is a matter of conjecturing  because my father was a primary school teacher and therefore he has written out written down noted the date of my birth  but some of you not know your dates of birth  gentlemen if you read a famous book in english  autobiography of booker t washington booker t washing t means telliferd booker telliferd washington the negro educator who died in nineteen hundred and sixty  karmveer bhaurao has been influenced by him also  booker t washington's autobiograpy is named as   up from slavery up from slavery translated into marathi as atmaudhar  and the very first sentence of that autobiography is i was born somewhere and some when  where i was born nobody knows and when i was born nobody knows so this we were born in a dingy room on a makeshift cot  not a modern cot but a makeshift cot  and when our mother have delivered us or must have delivered us we were heated by the coals put in an earthern ware pot  so our association with this earthenware pot  gadaga is from our birth  and when we are about to breathe our last may it be a far off event you see when we are about to breathe our last somebody has to carry an earthen pot before the funeral procession 
ah uhm uh thank you very much uh professor kohli  spoke so nice words about me uh i don't know how much i deserve them  uhm professor kohli requested me to talk on  national income uh accounts  uhm my purpose here was to make things very simple  uh maybe what my idea was this is a most of you are teachers and you know in a class when you go to a class  there are bright students there are mediocres there are bit dull students also  so teacher has a big problem of uh satisfying all the  students  so now comes the question what level he should go  it should benefit most of them so one has to be bit uh see that everybody follows  uh now we have that gathering i see most of you have put in some more than a decade of service  and most of you are uhm good good having good experience in teaching uhn  what i want to do here is only thing is some of you may not be having uh background about national income accounts  and other things  uh with that intention i want to give some idea about what  national income accounts is ? how it is useful ? and how it is computed ? and then in the second lecture i would give try to give you uhn the backgr the trends in india   indian economy  what is the per capita income of a india ? this thing and how it is computed ? what are its weaknesses this is for todays programme  uhm as i told in beginning this is li i would like to make it as simple as possible without ma uh this thing   i my main idea is that everybody should get something uh that is the thing they should feel it okay  others who are more interest in deeper questions can approach me again uh your all all the time you are welcome and  it's a great pleasure to have interaction with you  now uh if i ask anybody what is in  income ?  what is your income ? you may say some six thousand seven thousand or ten thousand  things  but it it looks to be very simple question  but if we go deeper it is not as simple as you think at the first time  uhm take uh this income somebody mainly we who are salaried person by income we meant whatever salary we are getting that monthly that is the salary or at the best you say okay whatever our take home salary is there  after deductions  okay we are having ten thousand salary or some two thousand is deducted eight thousand is our take home salary  this we take it as a income  this but if we go deeper this is not the only total income  for example some of us may have some own house  in that way we also get a a rent imputed rent  so our income consist not only of salary but also the rent of the house in which we are living because if we go for some other rented house we had to pay that rent for that house  now because it is our own house we are not paying so  indirectly it means that we are getting that much income we are not uh paying cash but because we are utilising that uh services of that residence resident it also means  it is uh rent  we are getting rent in this thing  our income also should include salary beside salary it should include the rent  some of us may have put some fixed deposit in the bank  f d  so annually we may get some interest  that also is a part of the our income  that thing interest that we get on our fixed deposit or saving accounts in our bank   my maybe it may be small amount but uh for uh  conceptual purpose it should be included maybe we may if we take in our bank account uh may be interest we may be getting hardly per annum some fifteen twenty  rupees or hundred rupees per annum because our savings may not be much but it is also a part of our income that interest that we get then we may have bought some shares or dividends  uh this is mostly the salaried persons buy the shares and this things  the dividends that we get on that uh shares also a part of our income  next component we may think we may have some people may have agriculture land they at their own native place  from agriculture they will be getting some either they may have leased out the land to some tenant and getting rent on it that is a rent from the land  or they may be having share cropping they may contribute something to the cultivation and for uh tenants cultivates and they get share cropping will be there  this also forms a part of our income  so uh in the beginning when you thought what is income  you took it as salary income means only salary for salaried persons but actually if we go deeper it includes many other components  which we generally uh don't take care of notice it  that it actually income is such a broad concept  when income is a for of a individual is so  difficult to compute or even assess uh what about the  country's income   country's income means income of all the people in the country   it's all the more difficult  what we mean by natio income of the nation or national income ? the national income means the value of the output which is  produced in the country the final goods value of the final goods produced in the country is taken as national income now here i use the concept final goods  why we should use final goods ? because if we don't take account of this we'll  have some problems called double counting  suppose wa if you want to if you don't  take care of this there is a problem of double counting  suppose you take the case of uh a simple example which is given is about the bread industry  so if you take the what all the total value of the bread produced in the country  total value of the wheat produced in the country  total value of the fertiliser produced in the country  there will be double counting or treble counting how ? when you take the value of the bread that value of the bread also consist contains the value of the wheat used in the  making of bread  so uh the and when you take the value of the total wheat again you are counting that portion of wheat which has gone into the making of bread also  whatever that all wheat produced in the country will not go to making bread but atleast some wheat is goes in making of bread so the wheat is counted twice  wheat is counted when you are taking the total value of bread  wheat is also counted when you are taking the total value of wheat and also think of fertiliser which is used in making of  this bread uh wheat   producing uh for producing wheat we make use of fertiliser  the value of the fertiliser is contained in the value of wheat  again it is also contained in the value of uh bread  so if you don't take care of only uh final goods  we'll be commiting this uh mistake of counting the same items more than once  so we should try to avoid this  now comes the question how to know which is final good  which is not the final good  so is bread the final good or is wheat the final good  is fertiliser final good  so because there is a difficulty in distinguishing which is final good and which is intermediary good we have another to overcome this problem we have a method called value added method  in that means uh in each industry how much value is added  by each industry  that we take into account not the total value of the output of  bread industry   we'll only take the how much bread industry has  added the value to the product  so baking bread baking so they have pro sold the bread at ten rupees and uh they have bought the input of say eight rupees worth of inputs for buying wheat and other things they have paper and packing other things  they have brought uh purchased the bread industry has purchased eight rupees worth of inputs and they have sold the bread for ten rupees  so now they how much value they have added to this bread they have added the value of ten two rupees  because eight rupees was the value of inputs which they have purchased ei ten rupees they have sold  so that to bread uh that final product which we  suppose we take it bread for that bread they have added uh uhm  value of two rupees  this is how we uh take it as uh value added  so one has to be while computing national income one has to be careful in avoiding this double counting or counting the same item more than once  then another thing we have to notice is this national income is in only money terms because we are hetregenous items are produced  iron is produced uh foodgrain is produced so many items are produced  so it is a it is expressed only in money terms  agriculture output could have been produced in uh mentioned in physical terms whereas national income has to be expressed in money terms this is another important thing to be noted  so we require some prices  what prices should we use is another difficult question uh to answer  then we have to notice that it is a flow concept  flow means how much output produced during a particular year or a particular month  instead what is the value of uh income means income per month or income per annum like that so flow means the period time period is important   it is a national income is a flow concept that means how much value has been produced from january first nineteen ninety-six to  december thirty-first nineteen ninety-six  in this aca calendar year how much is produced so it is a flow concept  uh these are the some of the important things to be noticed about a national income  now what is the use of national income if it consist  outside if uh ask this question at which national income is  used as a economic barometre  like what is the condition of the economy to know the condition of the economy  like a doctor if you go to a doctor before you ask any question he will put his thermometre into your mouth  and he wants to know the temperature uh things so a economist also if he wants to know the condition of any economy he says what is per national income of the country  so that means some uh weaknesses in this national income  but it broadly indicates the health of the economy how good how  sound is the health of the economy  so this is necessary national income is necessary to know  health of the economy  and also we can compare two economies which economy is stronger economically  for intercountry comparison is also it is useful  so how so america is rich you know how much in a  what is the per capita income in india what is the per capita in america say twenty times it is more than in india  or thirty times more than in india  so that shows how rich they are  so for in relative comparison also this uh  national income is useful  then within the country also we have so many different states and we want to compare uh which state is better which is doing well  so which is richer state uh like that so interstate comparison also to make interstate comparison also this uh na state income uh estimates are being made these days  then we know over a period of time how country is growing  to assess the performence of an economy also this pe  national income data is very useful  then you can also see uh that uh in the economy there are different sectors like household sector we have  we have corporate sector we have government sector  what is the interaction of these sectors that is how much  how much is government sector is taking away from the household sector how much government in the form of tax how much government sector is taking away from the corporate sector in the form of tax 
uh prof deshpande the coordinator for this particular course in english of the academic staff college marathawada university  prof shastri visiting professor here and my friends  professor deshpande of course uh was attempting to apply cosmetics to many of the short comings that i possess  and he was praising many of the things which i don't deserve to the power of yen  so you've got to take everything that he says with a  pinch of salt if not with a ton of salt  uh having said that uh god only knows how desperately  i wanted to become what uh the standard coach of the marathwada university says as a non-teaching employee of a non- agricultural university laughter  so that's what i wanted to become  and uh unfortunately various development took place and uh as a consequence i am here trying to discuss things with you share some of my thoughts with you so that's the background  but anyway it gives me a lot of pleasure to meet many of my old students and old friends in this congregation  although i had initially promised to uh lecture to you of a  seven hours in a weeks time unfortunately because of various factors i am unable to meet you for this uh duration  but i think i am going to think of it what i would have normally spoken in seven hours in just two lecturing units  i am going to cover most of the things in these two lectures the first topic would be on the broad fields and  conventions in american literature and it would be followed up by the various fictual concepts that are employed in any discussion of american literature  now to start with let me establish a comparative frame of uh reference between indian writing in english and american literature  i fondly recall that both these topics were introduced at my old alma mater andhra university way back in the year nineteen hundred and sixty-two  that was the year when one of the earliest of one word  scholar to have collected a degree in the united states of america professor raghavacharalu had come back with a ph d from the university of pennsylvenia and my old teacher professor shrinivas iyengar had uh written a pioneering book on indian writing in english so these two streams came to a head and we were very fortunate to be students and that was the year when i graduated and i wanted to pursue my research but uh in the department itself there was a good deal of discussion about indian writing in english even the topic itself had become controversial debatable  they were toying with the idea of employing the term indian english writing or uh indo- anglican or anglian uh writing and ultimately iyengar thought that indian writing in english would be broadly  descriptive and proper and raghavacharlu introduced american literature so we belong to the first generation of students who were exposed to these two streams  and surprisingly we also had the a sort of exhibition every fourth year the university organises an exhibition it's so easy for people belonging to the various science faculty to display all their technological wonder and innovation but then for students of literature what can they do so what we had done was to graphically visually represent various aspect of american literature indian writing in english and we had drawn various charts  and i still remember uh we drew a x axis and a y axis  and there was a confluence of influence between the political happenings and the li literary  development  a crucial periods of time remarkable text was produced that was the end result of our own research i wish i had kept an old copy of uh that visual display  and one would notice that in many respects the development and the growth of indian writing in english and that of american literature seems to have taken a broad pattern a particular configuration which is comparable  and uh if you go to the beginning you would notice that uh  the elements of indian writing in english were triggered off they were given the necessary one word mainly because of the famous minutes of lord macaulay in the year eighten hundred and thirty-five  and uh if you are student of american literure you would notice that uh we normally divide american literature into the usable path and the the vibrant american literature which uh  acquired a particular shape and a dimension in the year eighteen hundred and thirty particularly when uh uh emerson delivered that famous speech addressed the phi betta kappa association of howard  even it is cool the speech which is one word on uh which was later on come to be known as american scholar speech and now a days everybody come to this this particular speech delivered by emerson as uh the literary declaration of independence so that's the importance that they give so one notices that uh in terms of uh the time sequence  the growth and uh progress they're comparable although america was discovered technically within course because we are celebrating the quincentenary year of the discovery of america columbus reached the shores of america in the year fourteen hundred and ninety-two perhaps in the month of uh august and uh  precisely on august sixth  and uh you know the basic thing he was in search of a passage to india and then he discovered a passage to the new world and uh in the initial stages of course most of the literature was in the nature of uh letters addressed to relatives friends back home in portugal and in spain because he was commissioned by king ferdinand to undertake this uh trip and uh this sort of a epistolary exercise formed the source of american literature but uh most patriot americans would like to claim  that uh even the name of the person who discovered america had been rather portugal  his name is christopher columbus  christopher meaning christ bearer columbus meaning the person who illuminates column that's the unit which measures light so this is symbolically speaking christopher columbus discovering america established the influence of light over the forces of darkness that's how they symbolically tried to explain  the significance of columbus discovering america  and uh the later immigration took place in the early part of the seventeenth century uh particularly with the myth lover  compact and uh the pilgrims landing on the plymoth rock  apart from various jokes that are bandit about one of the joke says that uh instead of the pilgrim father landing on the uh plymouth rock if the plymouth were to land on the pilgrims one word uh things would have been much better there won't have been any genocides of indians in america not to speak of the genocide that was committed in vietnam etcetera etcetera atleast the ugly americans would have been saved the image of the ugly americans so apart from these things one uh has a perception about the influence of religion uh in so far as the american writing is uh concerned mainly because of the radical differences of perception  religious differences the interness and battles particularly between the puritans and the anglicans  in england it's one word over and uh the immigration to america took place and the initial writing was broadly conditioned by these uh denominational cause  uh the calvanistic street became very very important and as a consequence of this one word calvanistic street they thought that the founding of america was a new opportunity for mankind it's uh europe had become totally corrupt and therefore people are saying what is happening in bosnia  and herzegovina and sarajevo which gave rise to the first world war because uh archduke ferdinand was killed and uh that released various forces which resulted in the beginning of the first world war and people are worried that one word ethnic strife would spread all over europe and who knows the third world war might start from this particular cockpit in europe now the root of uh the migration towards america uh refered in the broad denominational fight that took place all over europe between the anglicans who were one variety of uh catholics and this puritans and uh they believed in the calvanistic dictum of   determin determinism and all these things they percolated into the general psyche of uh the american immigrant there and initial literature in america is conditioned by uh this sort of a uhm shall we say denominational and uh religious  conflict and strife okay we have uh various calvanist fighting it out to establish mainly because they thought that uh uhm the discovery of america opened up possibilities of man going back to the condition of the pre one word had  because uh after the saviour redeemed mankind over a period of time man has succumbed to evil forces  wherever man goes he carries the seeds of evil with him  man is corrupt and whatever he touches is corrupted so this was the broad belief and uh instead of the new maseih america itself provided the image of the new garden of eden after uh jesus got back the paradise that was lost because of stone passion crusification and sacrifice here was another great opportunity so they wanted to transform america into a new garden of eden so this was the bold possibilities that they envisaged in america they thought there was a glorious opportunity for a new beginning  so all the literature reflect the search of perception  a new opportunity and with an advance fall with two words  until a greater man redeemed us but even the sacrifice of  jes of jesus has not helped us now they thought that america is going to provide another opportunity for the redemption of mankind so generally one notices this sort of a reflection in the early american literture now thereafter one notices that uh we had the transcendentalist presenting their own point of view particularly uhm  thoreau and uh emerson but the speech that i was refering to  becomes a very crucial part of the growth and development  and one notices that after eighteen thirty american literature  acquired a new vibrancy of its own where people like whitman  whitman was not trying to immitate the romantic poets he had established a native idiom and his rhetoric was filled with the ringing world that the americans had employed and it was transmiter but then it represented the new democratic america  so this is reflected in the leaves of grass   and in the poetry of uh whitman i mean as though it appears as though whitman was just waiting for somebody to give the green signal so that uh he could publish all his poetry without much of uh innovation and uh  there also one notices that the contemporary of uh whitman particularly hawthorne and melville because of their deep study of elizabethan literature the renaissance period they started uh  writing a particular variety of english employed many of their literary devices which uh had become important in the whole world  they were still tied to the apron string of most of the english writer but the great divide occurs when it comes to walt uh mark twain  that's why one normally says that mark twain is the lincoln of american literature  we have uh a conferable frame of reference between what happened in politics and what happens in literature here i wanted to notice that one  if anybody has seen the picture of uh washington the first president of the united states of america washington is modelled after the classical pattern he looks like one of those great roman senators wearing a show guard and even the face is so impressive as though it is chiselled in marble  but when you come to lincoln by no stretch of imagination would one call lincoln a person built on the classical mode he had none of the gracian features he was uh  homespun and homely and but then there was a certain dignity  it's like the writings of melville and the writings of mark twain  so even in politics one notices that the balance of power  to use a jaded expression had shifted from the tide water region of america that is the east coast the applachian mountains and the the new england region to the interior of america the river the mississippi missouri river so lincoln came from ohio he spent most of his time in that particular region the heart of uh america whereas the earlier presidents they came from the old aristocratic patricians families of virginia or new york so in political terms balance of power has shifted from the new england region to the heart of america america was still expanding westward california had to be populated  the gold rush had to take place later on  the so called resting movement had not taken place by that time and uh one notices that lincoln became the president possibly the most important president in the united states of america who  brought about lots of changes and the civil war took place and uh  emancipation of the negros also took place so all these things gave rise to a particular culture that was rooted in the uhm genius of the people the indigenous genius of the americans  so in literature and in politics this sort of a influence is uh discernable and uh one would notice a similar thing happening because i started uh refering to indian writing in english when you come to our own uh uh literature that is written in english one notices that uh  after macaulay's minute particularly in bengal i have been pressing this thesis i don't know whether uh it's acceptable or whether it is well received or not  in bengal which is one of the oldest provinces of the british raj one notices that there is a simultaneous movement of uh what i call as uh both the reformation and the renaissance  renaissance in literature reformation in religious aspects mainly because uh people like raja ram mohan roy and the other  who are acutely conscious of the decadent aspects of hinduism  consciously they thought many of the good things from christianity and from various other religious sources in order to bring about meaningful transformation of hinduism  what were the uhm inseparable uh inadequacies of hinduism  sati child marriages and various other irrational forms of worship so one notices that uh this sort of a revival of interest in the ancient glories coupled with the conscious approach  to bring about reformation took place there  initially many of them underwent conversion to christianity but then they wanted to retain what ever was residuely good  in hinduism  and as a concequence they started a movement known as the  brahmo samaj  there are three movements which could be considered as part of our own reformation brahmo samaj in bengal   arya samaj in erstwhile punjab undivided punjab   prarthana samaj based in pune  so these i mean i'll speak tilak ranade gokhale etcetera were all associated with the prarthana samaj  based in pune so they were acutely conscious of uh various defeciency  in hinduism and they wanted to rationalise an ancient religion and of course later on we had people like ramakrishna paramhamsa although he was totally illiterate many of the things that he spoke were christ like  
my name is madhu purohit  i'm an automobile engineer i've done my  masters in motor vehicle technology from germany  uh i would like to talk about the topics that are usually taught in uh the automobile institutions like poly technique and even now some of the famous colleges like b v b college  uh they are adapting automobile engineering as one of the subjects for degree courses  uh i'm of the opinion that the topics that these people use uh some of it is basically wasted because they are wasting your time also and probably their own precious time  uh because they teach you so many things that are not directly connected to automobile engineering  and in order to probably create or get the best type of quality of people that are there abroad  in order to get that type of people you have to really have subject concentrated to the subject that you want to specialise in  you know we have electrical engineer or mechanical engineer  who are taught uh the production engineering  and say in what way is production quality control okay he is going to be a design engineer his job is to design not quality control it is upto each individual when he produces that part to see that the quality is alright  but this guy he wastes his time studying production engineering and quality control so many other things  i feel that in germany basically people are taught more direct pertaining to the subject  yes we were also taught  now i'm an automobile engineer along with automobile technology we were also taught about rocket technology jet engine or say gas turbine but we were not tested as such  that was just given to us as a background so that if somebody talks about jet engines or gas turbines or high breed engines we should know what he is talking about that's all  we need not have any special uh you know theoritical know-how and specification or any kind of thing like that  so that made it only knowledgeable  see we know of oh yes i know what gas turbine is about  i know what these things are about  but basic thrust was on to our automobile engineering only  pertaining to those  and that is what i was talking or rather telling these people that we should adapt more of that type of technology where in we can get better types of people  they need not then wait for gathering experience in some automobile industry or whatever  they need they could be immediately absorbed during their  for their work the type of work they want to  while as now here we have automobile engineers or mechanical engineers they just taken in as engineers and they don't know much about practical aspects  for that matter they don't even know much about theoritical aspects  because what happens is uh the theory is so res so restricted to their own this thing that they have they don't know  here idea is the institution place more emphasis on this type of  uh retention power you have not this concept whether you know the concept  they say alright i give you these notes and you see that  you learn so and you know if you don't write these notes and write the same things what are in the notes you will fail probably  and this is the biggest drawback  people are not given the time and even the opportunity to express themselves the way they want  now if i teach you something about one particular aspect i teach you the principle behind it  now if the principle is known you can always explain back phenomenon about that particular principle to anybody in any way you like as long as you bring the gist of the subject  and that is what you require  now i ask these boys who have done their diplomas and all that  okay what do you understand by this yes we had learnt it i do not know what it is  see because they are lacking that definition because they have learnt it only as a definition they have not learnt it as a theory as  a concept  and it is so shocking you know now people who came here i was  i had the opportunity of giving a lecture in k h k about four times and there was a course for training the trainer  so those people who are already training other people i had to go and give a talk to them  and i asked them casually how you know you will talk about engine  four stroke engine what is the four stroke engine ? can anyone of you tell me what a four stroke engine is ? and you'll be surprised not a single man was able to tell what a four stroke engine  and they are all automobile engineers  so what we lack is basics  people like to draw graphs that is something if you meet an engineer he will suddenly draw a graph  he says this is the talk and no power graph this is this graph  they are so much into this graphs and which is not necessary  they should know what basics is  now we have somebody selling maruti eight hundred  what is this eight hundred ? i don't know  so this is what is required that we need to do it our people should be given basic idea about all these then you go into details fine when somebody asks you know if my mother asks me a four stroke four stroke what is this all ? i should be able to tell my mother who knows nothing about technical stuff  if i can tell her what a four stroke engine is and if she understands that is the way you should teach somebody because all of them are novice  if you are teaching some technical student then i can afford to give them some kind of a technical definition because if i say  for every two revolution there is one power stroke  only a technician will understand probably what i am trying to say  if you are a non technical person if i tell you this it will mean nothing to you and this is what this is what will happen to students if you tell them this  they only learn this what i have told them okay our teacher has given our lecturer has given this if i write this i'll get full marks  now this is bad  what we have to do is come down to basics teach them basics  so the subjects also that are chosen should be related directly related to the subject there are thing that the students are may be mechanical engineering electrical engineering or design engineering whatever  so it is very important that we also have those kind of subject in oriental  then we have some people say what is the you know  future for an automobile engineer  you see we are looked down upon by the society at large  yeah i do not know really i'm also puzzled now how to really change this thinking because people here basica   especially in small cities like dharwad  when somebody says automobile engineer they really don't know much about it  and then they feel okay automobile engineer means somebody who does not have brains up there  somebody who is not fit for anything or any other profession he has to be an automobile engineer this is the understanding  and how wrong they are because now the automobile field is becoming so sophisticated  unfortunately we are about fifty years behind in our automobile field here in india  but with the finance minister uh  man mohan singh plans you know for reducing tax or you know giving free trade uh facilities to our business people probably we are getting in some new technology  and with the help of these tech these these newer technologies the cars are going to be so sophisticated that an ordinary man who used to think okay this is my thing you know that set up something on the roadside and do it he will be absolutely nowhere because he will not know what to do with these vehicles  and only a person who has educational or lot of an intellectual person with educational background in that particular field will be able to tackle this job henceforth  so but it is so difficult to tell now like you are there or you are there now to come and tell them look i don't mind marrying a guy who is an automobile engineer because he is also like a degree holder like any other guy what's wrong  okay he has to deal with car and he deals with some machine which you don't see  but cars you often see and you have that picture in your mind you know already preconceived  when you go on the roadsides you see some of these fellows who got no shoes they wear chappals some torn shirts and all that they lie down and they are so filthy from top to bottom that is the picture you have  and the moment you think of an automobile engineer uh this fellow also must be exactly like that and i don't want to marry this guy  so this stigma we have to one word it you know  there is a vast difference between a guy who has done his diploma and would like to work as an automobile engineer than  the guy who is working on the roadside  so the social stigma has to be of course like they say  charity begins at home  we have a to start from home  take my parent when i got married i told my parents look okay you don't tell the girl what my qualifications tell her what i'm  doing exactly  because i don't want her to get a shock because when i got married i was in australia  i had come here only to get married and she was in bombay and all that and i had to tell her parents and her that look i work on cars i literally i am underneath and i do get filthy  because i don't want her to let me and say oh you are such you have done your masters and all i had thought you would be sitting in some cabin somewhere and  nothing of that kind because this is what happens basically people tell something and there are some  you know difficulty sometimes misunderstanding somethings then i don't want her to repent her parents to repent  things should be very clear but like i say we should start from home  my parents okay they know exactly what i have done where i stand and what i do  that is what each person should start telling his parents and his friends because this is the only way  if i meet somebody directly and i tell them  look it will not appeal to them it has to start from home you know you've got better ideas coming from home you rather do things that your parents tell you instead of taking or making your own choice and saying i don't care what you think i like to marry this guy because he is an automobile engineer  no this will never work because we are so you know far behind still in these aspects  and that is why to change peoples attitude and you know it is very difficult  attitudes are something you can't change  that is what i am trying here in my workshop now to change attitudes their thinking of regular maintainance about cars  they think service means just wash and grease and finish  those people who come here with that intention in their mind i just send them away  i just don't entertain them because this is not a place only to wash and grease i have got diploma people here working  i would like to utilise them to utilise their know-how and tackle some mechanical problems rather than just waste their time in you know washing and greasing  i say why don't you fix up some mechanical substance there is some noise here and some noise there why don't you rectify that  but they don't have that  here we believe our indian people believe in breakdown maintainance  until the vehicle is running they just keep it running and one day if it breaks down on you then you think oh i should go to a workshop now there is no such thing called as preventive maintainance  that preventive maintainance is yes it is expensive and we do change or throw away parts which are still slightly good  otherwise they would have run  then people say why do you throw that it is still okay  so preventive maintainance yes if you want the down time to be less that means you don't want your vehicle to be you know  parked in the ga workshop for a long time because of non availability of that part or whatever because you didn't change it that time now it's totally broken so you have to wait 
 i've also wanted to enlist you uh another very important writer margaret atwood margaret atwood and robinson they each together are very much nationalists  nationalist in the sense that they have raised their voice  against the imperialistic dominition of their country  the situation is something like this cough on the one hand there is the imperial britain from which they have not been able to see the a few words  so the britain is the exploiting power the conventional  relationship with britain on the one hand and america on the other side because across the border is america which is as well capitalistic exploitative society  if they don't uh bow or if they don't release them or if they resist the influence of the neighbour  then this is a very difficult situation  resisting a neighbour is more difficult than resisting somebody  at a distance because you can't you have to come into contact daily contact with the neighbour with whom you have to workout a relatioship in which there will be co-operation and wanted or unwanted help  you can't escape the influence of neighbour  and the neighbour is another evil which wants to dominate as we have seen at the very outset that there was a clash of interest and ideas at the beginning which brought out uh two nation of canada and america  cough  so america wants to exploit canada capitalistically  and there is another type of relationship with britain  parental relationship that too is very painful to receive at  what has canada to do  where is the choice ? either you say good bye to your parentage or you say good bye to your neighbour or you allow yourself to be doubly exploited  both of them are exploitative  this is the worry  and margaret atwood has raised her voice particularly  against the what is called the fashion of women's  liberation movement that swept the whole of europe some decades back  we saw to liberate the western women margaret atwood says  through her fiction that it is not feasible it is not possible  it is another way of uh self detention  the books which she has prominently written which are which have made her prominent are the adable  women and surfacing both the books  deal with this problem of influence of the neighbour and of them of you know  the west uh the the women's liberation movement is  europe's gift in which the women doesn't know what exactly she should do in order to be called a liberated women  so she is advised to say good bye to all the conventions all the conventional morality like the institution of marriage  again about amphly and clara the two women  characters in the adam and who have been discussing this  clara is a married person  joe the husband of clara is always impregnating her  and then every time there is a child  and who nurses the child ? the mother only gives the birth the rest of the care is taken by father feeding washing clothing everything  his poses according to our writer atwood is problem of father image and the mother image  what will the child think ? who is the father ? the child will more likely answer a person who feeds  who cooks who washes is the father  who is the mother ? a person who sits enjoys sleeps reads writes is the mother  there is a clash  there is the projection of the clash of values  the value system will stand changed  and our one word goes a step further  she says why worry at all admitted that a  women's life is made unfulfilled until she has a child  that is the question of women but that does not necessarily mean that she should marry where is the logic  marriage is a social institution  it does not necessarily mean for someone to produce children  that he or she should marry someone  you can have the children even outside the wedlock  so you chose your man  you know one word him a child is born good bye to the man  the child will also mean i'm the mother my fulfillness in my lap to hell with you man get away from you that can be one solution  the problem will be the problem will be laughter  how do you know who is the boy you see there is a real problem if you are a woman liberationist and if you are a woman  you want to break away from all of the convention may be then you should actually prefer to be the mother of a girl child  this is what the logic is  but no mother no mother has ever thought of a child inside the womb as there for a girl every mother thinks of the child as he  what is this he ? why always he even though you are claiming or shouting from the rooftop that you are liberated woman that you are no longer a slave of man the same problem of slavery man's slavery you have become over traditional in mental theory of the covention which accords greater status higher status to man  so even though you are a liberationist you are still thinking of your child about whom you don't know as a he it means you are still pining for a male child  this is a thought this is a very embarassing for for all  women  so our uh uh puts up this question to which there is no answer except that ultimately we arrive at a conclusion that marriage  is a co-institution  it solves many problems not only of the personality of the feminist but even of cohesion of harmony in the society  and thereby she seems to reject this wave of women's  liberation that has come from europe the parental left  in such a theme she finds that a terrible mistake there seems to be an american in the pristine forest she finds that americans are poaching americans are there looking for  the wealth which they can exploit the natural wealth  so if they are boating in the lake the american is always interested in finding out whether there is a good amount of fish  which he can perhaps later how to exploit it  in the forest pristine dense green forest our  margaret atwood finds uh beautifully located huts over which the americans c i a agents have an eye and they want to have  such properties where they can plant themselves in order to espionage  so we can say that here is a writer a woman writer  who has very much identified herself with the problems and establishments of her country  she has identified but she has not been able to find an answer  and this inability of the writer to find an answer to the complex problems of two words full and neighbourly uh compulsion  which has created a very ordinary event situation  it's at the present incidentally is the hallmark of women creative writing  and they are uneducated they can't meet seem to know what exactly they should do  so this type of situation has attracted or marked the writing of the character  uh however there is an exception  that too is a little along the line because we have so far discussed english speaking novelist writers  let us go to the french canada  and i have selected and talk for a few minutes   i've selected to introduce you a very prominent french canadian writer premjeet roy  premjeet roy has written a novel uh where  the hen's will nest where the hen's will nest   this is a novel about a very very remote area  uninhabited by the people  and there is only one family after traversing the land  crossing various streams and waters you reach a place where there is only one family  and that family is a french speaking catholic  and this lousina the woman has a problem  she has eight children  she is an educated woman  she occasionaly visits uh centres  uh let me introduce you to which we can call centres of civilization  she keeps in touch with the modern world in order to know that  the progress or the new i mean uh or the new things that are happening  must be known to these people and they must not be deprived of the  of the latest only because there is some problem ? is it because of me ? uh uh i hope these external things are not against me  laughter  can we do something about it ? interruption  so she occasionally i don't mind if uh it doesn't work uh  interruption but this will continue yes  so she goes  she has a problem of education of her children she is living as a family unit in a remote forest area and she is very much worried about the education of her children because the canada government stipulates that's in order to  sanction a school there should be atleast six pupils  she has five  at present she has five and one is too small to be admitted or enrolled as a pupil  but she nevertheless writes to the government and they mercifully appoint a teacher  the first teacher is a catholic woman  the moment she comes she endears herself mixes with the family becomes a member or part of the family teaches very meticulously  she is very punctual  she wants to take full interest without wasting a moment so one year passes  the education of these children for one year has taken place  there is a transfer  the next woman teacher is an english woman  and the moment she comes she finds fault with everything that exist there  she starts complaining oh what a stretch i have had to travel  i'm tired and i'm bored i'm as if in a in an undesirable situation  i feel very much unhappy here  and what are these people lousina's  they have not provided a good accomodation to me  the food also is not palatable to me  the children are also very dirty they don't have good habits  she starts complaining  she complains and complains  but she stays on  and she's looked after by lousina as she did in the case of the earlier teacher  she was a french here is an english  she does not give any chance of complain to this woman  but this woman by nature is fussy as we call such people  she is also transfered  and when she is transfered she realises oh the place was  not so bad after all  i could have stayed on why have they transfered  the two types of attitude at the beginning and at the end  and lousina does not feel uh that she should complain against the teacher because she finds the great advantage of an english speaking teacher being made available to her children because otherwise her children would never have a chance to learn english  particularly in the context of the modern world in which english has become a lingua franca  if her childre her children were given  education or instruction only in french they would lose the advantages of the world wide uh contact spread of kmowledge etcetera etcetera  so she feels that it's a very good event that  this coach as the british teacher have come and  she feels thankful to the arrival of these two teachers however the third teacher is a male  he is a french male a bachelor unmarried  when he comes he doesn't take any interest in teaching children he says teaching will take place afterwards don't worry let me go to the nature let me enjoy i feel very happy  i'll shoot i'll fish  and he would retire to the jungle put a cap on his eyes  and sleep there  and he says education will take place we'll  see to that part of duty later let me enjoy  he enjoys he always  he starts calling her mama oh mama  mother  and he is interested in eating good things always demands this and that does not feel shy or constraint  and then he also receives the transfer orders  he does not disclose it  but all of a sudden there is a change in his attitude  he becomes very serious in teaching these children  and they realise that this man has a wonderful store of knowledge he teaches them wonderful things very advanced things  and before he goes he completes what he calls his course so there is no complaint  lousina loves to have this man as a teacher  she says why don't you stay on ?  write to the government we'll also write  that your stay here should be extended  the man says no thank you for all the hospitality and the care you took of me  but i'm going on promotion  and i'm going to a place where i would like to make my career  this is not the place where i can make my career  so even though i love the place i have enjoyed it but mum  i will not tie my career  we will leave the narrative here and discuss the merits  because we find the time constraint  now what happens is this canada is a bilingual country  as i already said at the said at the outset that there are  language problems and there are nationality problem  there is a talk of separation  but here is a message from a french woman writer who seems to be advocating the coexistence of the two and not encouraging the separation or division in society in the polity   he she seems to be possessing that english  is alright for the french because the french as you know  hate english  they hate everything that is english  they would not speak a word in french canada if you talk to them in english  that is not acknowledged  so this type of hatred should cease because english  learning has its own advantages  and she seems to feel it that there could be harmony  in the society only if we didn't talk of the differences  at a party she invites she invites all the types of people available there 
hello everybody my name is ramesh and i would like to speak about indian culture and indian art  first we have to know what exactly is indian culture ? indian culture flips the whole and soul of the the spiritual life of a person or the spiritual mentality of a person now when we compare the indian culture with the other cultures indian culture is considered as the one of the ancient and the oldest and the topmost and the critical culture of the world  now we should know what exactly is the culture ? and what exactly is the art ? culture as far as india is concerned is a way of life  but the way we are culturing it now that is totally we are going in a different concept  that culture is totally apart from the culture what i'm  going to speak   india's cultural heritage actually it's not only one of the most ancient but it is also one of the most extensive and varied  uh tu it has contributed uh throughout the ages many races and people uh who have either temporarily come into contact with india or have permanently settled within her borders  joining the lines of her children and helping to evolve a distinctive indian culture  the key note of which is synthesis on the bases of the eternal values  now it gives us glimpses of vedic civilisation that indian culture which is having a history of four thousand more than four thousand years ago that is including indus valley civilisation now the indian culture was laid and of the china the buddhist movements which tried to spread their accumulated spiritual wealth among the masses and classes of the country  that actually is the foundation of the uh two great ideals of india that is synthesis of culture and spiritual regeneration of a man uh it have has been uh truely laid in these early phases from which the future structure of india's  culture has been raised  as a matter of fact uhn the great culture of india is basically a synthesis  you know a synthesis of not only blood and race but also uh speech and uh what uh we can say the ways of thinking of which their different speeches are outward expressions as well as the  cultures that is material culture and intellectual culture and  spiritual which gives ideologies and determine attitudes and actions  the uh geographical background actually it uh  it it should also be taken into consideration  because man in any area any area of the world is the product of as much of his geographical and economic environment as of his racial and cultural bearings and movings  no culture or civilisation now this is actually going to be a important point whenever we speak of culture this is going to be a very very important point  no culture or civilisation have come into being in any country and at any age in a completed and a perfected form  like an athena coming out of full grown and fully armed from the head of the divinity vision  you know that's a actually a story  now man is for ever becoming and like all things within and uh  his affairs are ever in a state of flux  uhm now let us come to let us jurisdict ourselves to india  uh india some would prefer to describe it in other way as the expression of a basic and original univa uni uh what do you call it as uh the universal uh unity in its various uh uhm we can say it as manifestations  this other way of looking at the matter has something attractive in it for those who believe in a progressive uh degeneration from a golden age of their imagination rather than in the in uh  evolution through the ages  but in fact in the face of the observed facts it is a case of unity gradually becoming established out of diverse and uh contending elements  uhm and the first human habi habitants  of india that actually they represented various different races whose origins and whose language and basic cultures when started were different from each other  it was not totally a different uh altogether from square one it is from differnt squares  now let us come to the evolution of indian way of life  here this indian way of life is totally the foundation of this indian way of life is totally indian culture  now the uh as a matter of fact considering the vast amount of uh uh what literally we say it is uh like your name in our knowledge of india  in the formative period of our culture it will not be possible for us to obtain the full picture out of a welter of race and movements  and of the ideological exchanges for mens and uh we can only see dimly the gradual establishment of a way of thought know and the way of life that we can associate it with india uh as a distinct entity among geographical units and uh you know human innocence  the various races follow each other as a face to sequence that is making ultimately for that richness of life and experience and thought and spiritual prospective that are in the civilisation and the culture and uh uh the basic uh ethics of india  the neolithical negroids from africa the protoastroloids and  ostroids people and probably if may know that is from asia and the mongoloids from far east  no but congeries of asian peoples who appear to have brought the dravidian language and culture to india and indo-europeans in their various elements racial and linguistic uh all these things counts a lot  now indian way of life as it emerged with a birth of the indian man  i'm i'm specifing here indian man which took place as the result of uhm uhm what uh they say that uh the mythology and uh  histories of the india at the time of the aryans that is  the mongoloids the ostroids and the dravidians and indo-aryans and the indo-europeans  this this is going to be a very very huge list  now the second half of the second millenium that is b c it was the period of large scale tribal movements and racial one word   throughout the whole of the near east  in the as far as indian culture is concerned i wanted to tell you one thing that is excuse me that is exactly based on the the vedas and the upanishads  and uh philosophical concepts of life  uh in a well known rigvedic hymn that is describing the battle fought by the indo-aryan king surdas with uh the confederacy of ten kings one word  actually they were uh a love people  harikrishna dev he is one of the well known philo   philosophers and culturist  he said he had suggested with great plausibility that the tribes mentioned in the rigveda were the same as those mentioned in the egyptian documents  and uh this would suggest that external influences from the near east was not absent even in the ancient period of india's  emergence as a characterised cultural unit  and uhm this person harikrishna dev would identify the farmer with the people known to egyptians as uhm the purasati who were the same as the uh philistines and palistines  and uh that's convincing but nevertheless noteworthy  in uh these proposals to identify some king mentioned in uh  shatpata brahman  now all this all this why i'm mentioning the sanskrit names is totally based on the indian culture  indian culture actually these all these names what i'm  speaking of that is all its each and every brick of our indian culture you know it's a dream house  now until recently it was generally admitted that vedic sanskrit was the oldest indo-aryan language as far as the indian culture was concerned  uh later finally the hitite question came before us  that uh and it is now admitted that the discovery and the reading of the language of the hitites has brought forth the history of the indo-european and the earl earlier  visitor  this would make the ancient greek language interior to the  vedic by atleast a couple of countries  so by observing all these things we can come to a conclusion that indian culture actually it was not brought up on its own it was brought up through the the influences  through the the way of thinking of the other cultures  that means we may come to know that before indian culture  there were some more countries who were who have developed their own cultures and their own systems and their own way of life and their own uh way of thinking their own way of uh expressing themselves  now we will look at the universal ideals of indian culture  now we should look upon the pilgrims programmes of humanity as being essentially one in this great question of uh which mankind has undertaken  ever since man became conscious of his intellectual heritage  india in its own way has made a contri great contribution  in formulating this contribution of india  from the very fact that its genesis are the people its genesis as a people i am specifying here india has had to take note of the thoughts and ideas and actions and behaviours of so many different people so many and uh take note of them sympathetic and uh  what we can say that uh you know uh all embracing spirit that would be the the better word all embracing spirit that means it is the spirit which which welcomes all the cultures and all the concepts all the way of life  and that is what it has that is what has given the basic tone or colour to the uh uh culture of india as representing a great synthesis  so this synthesis word actually i have already mentioned that indian culture it is the synthesis  and it is philosophical as well as spiritual and mystical synthesis as well as practical expression of which is the sum total of the all the philosophy which developed in india with the great ideals of uh the vedas and the upanishads and looming in the background and uh even forming the basis  the aspiration and the way of life as proposed by this culture and  and accepble acceptable to the entire mankind  it can be theoritically put in a one word form  that is uh a few quotations from earlier indian literature actually i am taking this uh literature from from one of the  references  it says thus that which is is one wise men speak of it in many ways  now this i'm specifying here that which is is one and wise men speak of it in many ways  and uh to refrain from all evil to cultivate that which is good to discipline ones own mind ignore evil cultivate graciousness develop universal love and do at your good to all  now when we observe all these quotations we will get a   very very very very clear clear clear   cut crystal clear idea that indian culture it is the base is very broad very broad and that broadness that uh broad single base and different buildings have been constructed and the different religions has have been constructed that different philosophies have been constructed and different concepts have been constructed  now when we study indian culture actually we should look at the geographical influence in the on the development  and evolution of indian culture  now i will i think that uh in studying the cultural development of any country not only india i i'll i'll take it out the general this thing the general country  in studying the cultural development of any country the importance of uh its geographical factors okay it can can hardly be minimised in the early periods of human history geography determine to a great extent to the that the leads and uh uh activities of the people as well as their thought and literature  now i'll tell you geography shaped history largely than uh  as it does even today all over the world though in a different manner man has been independent on the physical facts of nature but he has not been content to live under these limitation  and he has always driven progressively to break through the barriers placed by the nature  and uh history of india is uh no exception to this point  so this interplay what we call it as interplay of uh the forces of geography and human will and genius  actually it is uh indeed very interesting subject and now we'll try to uhm what shall we say evaluate we'll try to uh enhance the influence of indian geography and the culture of its people on the one hand and how the challenge of geography has also been met on the other  now let us come to physical facts  now this physical facts uh which have uh directly or indirectly influenced the history of civilisation of india and it has been the size of the country and its comparative isolation uh  afforded by the himalayas 
as uh my guru is here i can breath more freely uhm  and he is going to record my talk also  well i selected this topic e l l english language learning uhm we have read and heard so much about e l t now  perhaps you may find it interesting and this is the last period uhm so i don't want you to be bored  so this is a new topic uhm e l l uhn not quite new  you know that second language learning and first language learning first language learning is at takes place uhm early in childhood and it is acquired you know  and second language learning takes place when we are adult so it is learned uhm so acquisition and learning while this cough uh  differentiation you know acquisition and learning  but here i'm putting before you a new outlook even second language learning is acquisition like first language acquisition because to acquire second language is  to take an additional language after having acquired one language  after having fully acquired one language  so that's why we call it second language  now what the difference between the two learner l one learner and l two learner ? now if we observe l one learner we can very easily see  that even their proficiency is at very low level  well they never hesitate using their first language for you can observe children uh you can observe uh around you so many you see persons even those persons who never go to school uhm especially children  now if we observe l two learner second language learner they are mostly adult because if they are not adults and if first language and second language uhm if a child acquires then even that second language is like first language uhm if the child acquire simultaneously  and as we are adult we are more cognitively mature  second language learners are more cognitively mature  they are have more metalinguistic awareness well this is word this is sentence this is phrase know metalinguistic awareness second language learner  and they have more word knowledge say this is the difference between uh l one learners and l two learners  now in learning l two we observe two psychological processes now one is simplification and another is over generalisation  now l two learner shall have this tendency of simplification well he while learning target language or second language  well he tries to simplify  well at all linguistic level like lexical level morphological level  even at syntactic level  and there are many jokes also  now here is one example uhm from morphological level   two chicken many bird  well plural form plural form well is missing here  many bird many birds you know  but many bird two chicken now this occurs at the morphological level simplification  well there is no need of birds because there is many birds is not needed because there is many  then uh you may take even the language of telegram  language of telegram now this is simplification at the syntactic level  well refresher course ends tomorrow i i don't know when ends you know laughter  but you may telegram send a telegram   refresher course ends tomorrow uhm home sunday or monday or  uhm whatever day it is  now here uh say articles are missing prepositions are missing well this is the example of simplification at the syntactic level then well there are many examples of over generalisation  uhn l two learners uhm uh over generalise it at all linguistic levels again  say instead of using specific verbs like fly  run well he uses the nuclear verb like go   now go is a nuclear verb you know it is cover term you see instead of using specific verbs like run fly travel  etcetera he uses go  well this is one example of over generalisation you see at the lexical level  now where the morphological level i think you know  wh when you assess you see uh the writing of your students you may come across many of them instead of went gone instead of you now went gone  instead of children child instead of  children you know child  so this occurs at the morphological level uhm over generalisation  so first thing we observe in this l two learning is l two learning is not linear or cumulative  we do not go on adding the structures one by one or we do not learn them all at a time  you see this l two learning is uh neither linear nor cumulative  but this is somewhat u shaped you know u shape learning now i will explain this uh unfortunately i don't have a piece of chalk and duster you know but uh i will try to explain  well in the beginning when learning is almost  mechanic mechanical say the right use of the  right use of plural suffix s or es   l two learner you see catches it  and in terms of accuracy in terms of accuracy well he  must be given hundred percent mark that is the beginning  but this learning is mechanic this learning is  mechanic mechanical he is accurate he learns mechanically as we say know parrot learning  so and then his level of accuracy falls down well he he begins to commit error  he begins to commit error  his level of accuracy falls down  and then again it rises this level rises so that's  why you know i said u shaped  u shape learning l two learning is u shape and even first language learning is also u shape  so first there is high level of accuracy and then low level then again high level of accuracy  there are three stages first stage high level second stage low level third stage again high level  here this u shaped learning strategy u shape learning strategy that l two learner uses while learning second language is worth considering seriously  unless we know how our students learn second language  no methods will be useful  we will never be successful  we will never be successful uhm let me tell you once again  well we should know them how they learn ? what strategies they use ? uh what are the processes that take place while learning l two ? and this is very important process uhm u shaped learning  now there are three stages let me repeat again first stage mechanical learning when we go on adding the structure  second stage second stage when accuracy falls down  now this takes place because once a structure is mechanically learn once a structure is mechanically learnt the whole system is again restructured  the whole system is again refined  uhm whatever language proficiency the second language learner has it is again disturbed when new information is added when new structure is learned  now the whole structure is you see renewed again  now this is the second stage that's why the learner  you see makes many mistakes  he commits many error  now third stage after restructuring the system again his accuracy level rises  he makes no mistakes  well he well his proficiency level also rises  so this u shape development is very important process in second language learning because it deals with the error that the learner makes  yes if we consider these errors then we can know our students or second language learner  but we teacher pay very little attention to our to our student to the error that they commit to the mistakes you know that they make while learning  now it is part of their on going process of learning second language  well making you see mistakes or committing error well it is part of the process of learning second language  and that's why we should take it very serious we as teacher and try to analyse the the error that they make and then judge or decide the level of proficiency uhm they they have achieved  now there are two kinds of error they make or two sets of errors they make  now first is interlingua error b b writing  interlingual error well they are interfrance error b b writing  and second intralingual intralingual error b b writing they are developmental error b b writing  now these errors interlingual error are mostly interfrance error our see first language interfrance interferes with the second language learning and uh we we find our student  transfering you see the the features of their first language to their second language  this we can identify very easily  now intralingual error these are the developmental error  they are part of the development of you see the student or the learner in second language  so here you know i say it is one word b b writing  it is part of the process of learning second language  now interlingual error are error because of our attitude you know behaviourist or what you call see even  structural i call bahaviourist b b writing or product  oriented b b writing  and this is process oriented  well here i have in my mind the teacher versus the researcher  now for me teacher is more important  now researcher may level it anything but we must be able to identify it among our student among the learner that they come to us  so we must be able to identify you see these interlingual error uhm which are the product of our view to language learning  our view uhm towards language learning if our view is product oriented we find these errors but if our view is process oriented  if we think that learning second language is a process you see then  the errors are intralingual error  so this i leave to the teacher  now here one important thing must be noted at every stage of learning the second language learner at every stage of learning the second language learner has his own language which is called interlanguage b b writing interlanguage  and this interlanguage lies somewhere between first language and second language  but it is the learners language  it is the learners language at every stage the learner you see arrives at his own language and that is his interlanguage  it is always under fluctuation changing because it is  part of the process it is part of the process  now this interlanguage theory you see developed in about nineteen sixty-nine well is very important  now it is nothing but an interium grammar it is nothing but an interium grammar that the second language learner develops or l two learner develops on his way to target language on his way to when going towards on his way to target language it is an interium grammar  now it is in itself a system distinct from l one and l two first language and second language  and this is the language that we as teachers first understand  if we succeed in understanding this interlanguage of the learner  yes we will be a success well in what you say teaching the language and they will be success in learning the language   ou our own strategy of presenting our material asking them to do some task you see our way of guiding them will depend upon our knowledge of this interlanguage of the second language learner  now here i don't say we fail we i don't say we fail  but well we we ignore to to some extent well we we take liberty to to some extent and here you see what i say we go away from our student  if we are language teacher we must make our best to identify this interlanguage  at what stage the process of learning the second language learning is now you see if a teacher knows this he knows his student  he knows the process  he will be able to guide and he is the best teacher  uhm well in in my opinion a teacher knowing all the methods of teaching is not a good teacher laughter uh uh the teacher one who knows his student well one who knows his learners well is the good teacher  then only you will be able to guide  if now there are uh many level given to this  interlanguage uhm i don't you see waste your time on it  but interlanguage is very curious you see how a a learner reaches that stage of interlanguage uhm is very interesting to know  well this process takes place in a certain sequence in a certain order and this sequence this order well you may call acquisition order language acquisition order or you may say developmental sequence b b writing developmental sequence  well this is psychological process and only researcher can know this uhm how how it takes place  well we we teacher can judge it only by the results that we get from the student uhm but a good researcher uhm knows very well  how this process takes place process of forming ones own interlanguage  but this is not uhm formed by mechanical learning  now this is formed by following this acquisition order  or developmental sequence  you see developmental sequence now uh i will mention two  well uh project you see undertaken and also completed  one was on interrogative and another was on negative 
i think you know something about credit cards   the way in which a credit cards card   is issued to customer and the means in which you can use the credit card  basically a credit card is an unsecured loan  given by any bank or financial institution  when a bank is going to issue a credit card we say they have a strong certain capital base  we or bank's fundemental aspects behind which a  credit card company runs is the requirement of working capital  so banks can draft the fund from other departments and uh  that's how issuing this credit card  let me tell you about the proper method credit card  is issued  see basically as i told tell you it's an unsecured loan we don't require any uh what do you call as deposit or any advances against issue of credit card  all the customer has to do is to give some documents proving his income  and we have certain criteria for procurement of uh issuing that  credit cards   let's suppose it's a salaried customer  he had to have a minimum gross salary of fifty thousand per annum  and thirty-six thousand per month  so this is for master card and visa card  we also have another card called the diners club card   so the premium have a value card it's about uh if it is a salaried guy he had to have an income of fifty thousand that is the take home and the gross of ninety-six thousand  so these are basically two views one is the verification view  and other is judgemental view  who has taken unsecured loan we have to verify as to the genuinity of the customer  he might for all you know he might going to be your credit runner  so the person you have to pick is that that are really executives whether he is really capable of holding credit cards because the banks stake is involved in it  and we have cases of two words worth lakhs  of rupees  so the first thing that we require for that guy is to  fulfill our income criteria  if he fulfills that we have to fix some verification criteria so the first thing that we do is clear application  we have what you call as direct sales agent  so these guys go and get application from a major company  and uh big shop partnerships and all that  so as soon as they clear applications and get them signed with all the documents they are submitted to a certified public accountant he may call us metro city they submit all app or the application to the metro city  and the metro city gives them to uh c p i in madras, whom we call as a noddle certified public accountant and uh that noddle  certified public accountant verifies after the completing of the application whether they have fulfill the criteria manually and uh data enters them onto the computers which are in the system and at the end of the day he takes down them as a dbase file  and at the end of the day he transmit this through a modem to trivandrum  and everyday evening this transmission gets into progress and after this gets downloaded into citibank systems we have to convert it into our database and we have to issue the database upto work table  so we have to run certain programmes they are called odi programmes or what you call end of the programme  after all these programmes are run these database downloaded into our system  and next day morning they will be available for verification  so the datas here and the application will come in the next day morning  as soon as they come we have a process of what is called as moving an application to an approval stage  we have a different stage  suppose uh uh applicant doesn't given give  his date of birth  it is a mandatory field we have certain mandatory field suppose if he has not given his address  suppose if he has not given his date of birth  if you suppose if he has not given his income we have a mandatory field which are compulsory for any application  so everyday a programme is run  and uh the pointer looks up these certain fields and if these are not fulfilled it throws them into a certain station  okay and uh if this check is fulfilled it moves to another stage  where you call a credit scoring programme as such based on the age of the applicant on his financial status  on his uh assets worth on the type of vehicle he own  owns there were funny fundemental tid bits  and taking all these into account a certain score is assigned to a customer  suppose he fails to score he will never be given a card  and uh suppose he crosses that score he moves to another stage called a de-duplicative stage  so all you know a customer might apply once again he may be already having a card  and uh he might apply once again to get another card  and there might be a chance of fraud  so to rule out these cases cases of fraud we have certain programmes what is called as de-duplication programme  we have a database of around four lakh fifty thousand members  around two lakh members and one lakh  fifty thousand applicant plus some one lakh in our work table  so our database or or what you call uh members  addresses and all these are totally on birthday base  so let's say these data gets matched against any of these   let's say date of birth or address or anything it is it goes to a certain status and any officer concerned has to look into it why why is it that ? for all you know me and my friend could have a same date of birth but we are different persons  so we have to look uh this is same person  and suppose these are different he has to clearly  clear uhm de-duplication programme  and after they cleared it it goes to credit verification stage  okay and uh the credit verification stage is sometimes all about  the verification of the application towards its completeness  towards the income criteria and certain how it consist criterias   consists of criteria which i mean the credit card  man may subcribe  so we have to look for all these things and suppose if it is fulfilled we move to a different status  and then two parallel process go on  one is the fiscal reputaion criteria and the other one is the bank verification criteria  suppose uh for certain categories of applicant we have different categories of verification based on their deliquency and their past performance  we have a we have taken a from how these portfolio perform  and based on their performance of these portfolio we have induced a certain verification criteria  so suppose uh let's say if it is salaried person we have to perform our own verification  suppose if you contact in a public limited company here the credit runner is much less you know public limited company we have to check for the person has he really applied for a card  you see the person who has really applied for the card and certain checks over it we have to check about a few words  yeah he may cross that stage  and then suppose it is self employed we have to do a bank reference so this bank reference tell you all about the customer whether  he has any bounce cheques what is his nominal balance  so this will provide you valuable clues as to how he could perform on your account  so after this has proved being pushed the application get certain status and after all this is done we issue a card  as soon as the card is issued based on the source of accumulation the billing is done   the there are five different types of clause of acquisition  one is the direct sales agency  the other one has got a cross road application  suppose if he is already a diner clubs card number we sell him a  visa card or master card across the billing  or when he gets the bill he gets these kind of application he is into the cross road  the third one is take on take on and there customers have been short finale  so he all the customer has to do is come and pick up the application fill up all this and if he fulfills the criteria he is given the card  and there are two three other ways in which a card is issued so these are the different ways in which application is closed so based on the source of application the billing is different  so as soon as these are entered a card is endorsed at  on the third day as soon as application is approved so as soon as the card is approved it goes to the customer on a second day  lately by third day the card get endorsed  the next day the card reaches the customer  and if you want to withdraw cash from what do you call as the automatic teller-machine or anytime money a t m he has to get the card encoded  there is a certain uhm personal identification number which you give to a customer  only that customer holds that number and on then only he uses that number in the a t m he can withdraw money from that a t m  so he has to get the card encoded in the a t m and then you can use the car card for cash withdrawl  for purchases a customer need not get his card encoded he can just walk over to any shop which accepts our cards  those are called member establishment  so here he just walk over to a shop buy anything and then charge his card against it  we have what you call as charge list  suppose a customer goes and buys uh certain products okay and uh he has to submit the card  we have certain enrollment for every merchant establishment based on their performances and their deliquencies  so let's say a jewellery shop is a high risk area so every charge that is booked in a jewellery shop should be authorised by city bank  so every time a charge come to a jewellery shop the  member establishment has to call up city bank to take an authorisation code which is an online real time system  so certain fields are looked for and the card number is looked for so suppose the card number is data entered in that  it immediately looks for customers account its credit open to buy and how much is the credit line and how much has he utilised it  and there are certain checks towards it wh   whether he has any bounce cheques in his account  so it looks for very synthetic field and that either approves it or reject it  if it is a if it is approved or certain code is generated  and the the code is given to the member establishment he has to write it down on that stamp slip on his copy there are three copies atleast one to the card member one to the city bank and one to member  so he has to write the authorisation code on that card state bank submitted to city bank  i mean when there is an authorisation code the charge will be valid  only in case of flow limit higher than what a fixed deposit has given  in case he has charges below the flow limit accepted by city bank he will not take an authorisation  he can just give the charge to one word and  submit to city bank to get payment within two or three days  the main reason why uh charge required to be authorise is because of the delin deliquency of customer, let me suppose a customer has a credit line of only twenty-five thousand and he has applied sixty thousand and he hasn't paid us till now so we can't allow the customer to use the card and keep piling on the deliquency or the raise up raise debt getting accumulated  so we have to serve him certain point of time  so let us say a customer goes deliquent and his account is blocked here  when these customers their tendencies it's  normally to go and buy something above the flow limit  so when they go above the flow limit the merchant ordinarly takes the authorisation from the city bank  so let's if an authorisation is declined the one word of charges declined and in certain cases where there are more sensitive cases we pick up the card  and if the card is picked up from a merchant establishment the merchant gets a an award of thousand rupees or put on  it's depending on the value of the outstanding of the customer  so these merchants help about in uh quite a good way  and another way where we detect fraud is about uh another  sensitive areas where these customers go is to the a t m  so these customers go and try to withdraw money from the a t m  so what we do is we block his account to the a t m  and uh at the end of the day we transfer certain file  as soon as these files are tranfered to the a t m through a modem  any card that is black listed or hot listed in the a t m if it is inserted into a a t m counter the card gets wall out  you can never get the card back  the only way that you can get the card get back you should get reinstated or to get a new card  so these are some ways where fraud is being detected or is being controlled  and the money that we made is on discount that we get from member establishment  so let's say this is called the plastic money and everybody profess not to carry money and they prefer to carry only credit card  so we go negotiate with member establishment to accept our cards  what is the benefit for a member establishment ? he has a larger customer base  and what is the benefit for city bank ? we get a discount of two point three percent  uh let's say a customer goes and buys goods worth  rupees hundred rupees okay and suppose the member establishment submit the charge to us we pay him only the amount less the discount on which there it is agreed 
one of this that is some should know in the true  kshatriya spirit  so here is well provided paradise  so that he need not had any two words  and he could not even believe you see that is somebody  shailender one word life he was brought up  within the premises of the palace  gautama breathed all the sin that a younger prince should have  that is on the previlege within the palace  the father could prepare to see that his son never went out of the palace  once he went out of the palace he would naturally can't face the scene the stark realities of this mundane world  he detected the suffering sickness decay and death for about twenty or thirty-two years it's not clearly mentioned gautama lived secluded within the palace  when he came of age he married a princess known as yashodra and he had a son also by her who became  came to be known as rahul  now buddha was born with a mission  destiny must have its own course  and it it open at a proper time  his trusted charioteer known as channa who had been instructed by the father not to take the prince outside the palace premise  he requested channa let us have a ride outside the palace to see the world outside  channa he must break away the path the life of buddha  he reeling to his pressure of the prince  he took him outside the palace  of course his wahan a coach or riding properly on a horse chariot was going he found some people  suffering with intense pain  naturally gautama asked what is this that i see ? this is called suffering  suffering due to various causes physical mental  psychological problems may be there  but physical suffering is the most notable one  that created impression on him  so he came back  taking that impression within his mind  another day when he went around the city kapilavastu  he saw sickness people suffering from different types of diseases  buddha never knew what disease was  so he asked his charioteer what is this that i am seeing ?  this is known as sickness disease  people are subjected to various kinds of disease  this is a second impression that gautama had  he comes back to palace  he came over this first suffering then sickness  then after a few days again he went he went outside on his ride he saw an old man tottering on his walking stick  a new sight for him  what is this ? he said it is called old age  and everyone is subject to this old age  the lone and sinister old age they may be young people who would have a difficult match but normally people grow from  balavastha one word then praudha  then old age then dehant that is the usual procedure  so this is a third impression old age yeah that gautama had on his mind  he came back to his palace  lot of tremendous disturbance was there  seeing one after another  finally one day when he went out he saw a dead body being carried to the cremation ground   what is this ? he asked channa  this is called death  everyone is one word died none can escape death what is happen they should be either buried or cremated and there is an end of his physical body  so these four impressions suffering sickness oldage  and death led such a strong impression on the mind of buddha  that he went and went back to his palace  then he one word his life  i must find an answer to this  how to escape this four-fold  transformation siddhant one word not be every one as it called  that to turning point in the life of buddha in the life of gautama  finally one day he decides that he will leave  his hearth and home his young wife and a new born baby rahul  in search of that truth which will bring solace to humanity which will solve the problems of this four kinds of  changes that every body is subject to  that night when he decided is called mahaesha  very significant word  he saw his wife lying on the bed took a last glance at his wife and the child rahula also who happened to be the future prince  and left the palace  it is said when gautama took the decision to leave everything in search of truth the jataka stories that is the buddhist scriptures bore ecstacies in describing this event of buddha leaving the palace  there is mentioned that god rejoiced  buddha leaves palace with his channa that trusted charioteer to the forest  and once they enter the forest he removed all his dress the princely dress the outfit the princely outfit that he had  handed them over to channa and shaved off his hair and wore simple clothes ordinary simple clothes  this all is a very interesting anecdote  channa returning to the palace without buddha without gautama  but then that was the prince's order he had to carry out  then began the search for truth  because he he was about thirty years of age at that time  then buddh uh gautama left his palace he was about thirty years  for ten long years he underwent all kinds of austerities  hardships privations trial and humiliations mortification of his own body  subjected himself to various kinds of disciplines physical and mental  in this context i must tell you that buddha was not a buddhist in the sense that we understand him today because  buddhism came into existence much later probably a couple of centuries later on after the demise of buddha  but at the time of gautama he then lectures in religious schools the various systems that we have had from that on various  kinds prescribing various types of disciplines  so he goes to various teachers seeking their advise and subjecting himself to various kinds of disciplines  for ten long years but at the end nothing happened only his physical frame became emaciated  he was losing strength proper food was not given to the body for the maintenance of the body  then he decides this extreme two extremes one we refer to from first term when he was brought up on the lap of luxury that was one extreme  so those important years he was also twenty-five years  then in ten years subjected to himself to extreme poverty privation trials and humiliation the other extreme  these two extreme should be avoided that realisation came to him  in the meantime he was wandering in search of truth  search of illumination search of acknowledge that such a feat that passes or understanding  by the time he comes to buddha gaya now it is known as bodhgaya  he two words  by the time he came to bodhgaya he was about forty years of age  he had decided that he will give up this two extremes then he followed that one better example that is given to us in the geeta in the sixth chapter seventeenth verse a few words in sanskrit  food and recreation yukta should be moderated  no extremes  not over eating hence feeling all its energy in digesting that food  we know our experience tells if by chance we overeat  how much of energy is lost in digesting that food  you feel so lazy whole day  so long back the centuries before buddha gave on the same  shri krishna has told us in the geeta  avoid all extremes a few words in sanskrit he created in excessiveness  but it should be moderate avoid all extremes a few words in sanskrit  even in our activity intense activity should be avoided  and lack of activity also should be avoided  but moderation everything should be moderate that is the lesson that shri krishna has given to us centuries before the time of buddha  a few words in sanskrit  even in sleep and keeping awake a few words in sanskrit this called yoga  moderation never means what happens it destroys all kinds of dukha suffering  so by the time buddha reached the present bodhgaya  some of you may have glance for forty-five forty-three forty-four years ago  nineteen forty-three more than fifty years now i did go there it has developed much later now  many new things have been added  in the last century the whole temple was covered by a big  one word  one english collector of that district it is in bihar  two words by name he just by chance he was escavating something he found  the tip of a brick temple and he asked these people to remove a old temple that is there in bodhgaya two words  temple  here if you view by the side or the back of the temple  there is we have a ashoka tree peepal tree  whether it is the same ashoka tree that buddha meditated under we do not know  it cannot be because two thousand five hundred years a tree cannot  survive  but its descendents it has also a very these are a very good tree  so when i because of sentiment associated with it a few leaves i brought from that tree dry leaves that fallen  so that was again on the same vaisakha purnima  day he reached that place  in the afternoon one village dame sujata by name brought a little payas for him  buddha accepted it  we should think that sujata is blessed because she offered that payas to buddha  and that gave him some strength it is called which had some miracle after years of mortification  after having taken that payas he comes to that bodhi tree there was no temple at that time only tree was there he sat under the tree it's called the bodhi vriksha or bodh tree in english it is called  some some descendents of that bodhi tree have gone in different parts where ever buddhism spread  with deep determination he sat under the tree  one of the most glorious verses that i have cone across in sanskrit is this that buddha sat under the tree with deep resolution having had taken that payas he sat under the bodhi tree  he has an hymn a few words in sanskrit  in this seize let my body triumph and my skin bones and flesh may be destroyed  first a skin a few words in sanskrit let it be destroyed   a few words in sanskrit untill i came that knowledge  which is difficult durlabh it has never been impossible  impossible means it can never be attained  with a difficult one word that is true spiritual life itself is difficult  but nobody has said it is impossible   a few words in sanskrit for beyonds and beyonds people have rights and then they have obtained until i sent that illumination   a few words in sanskrit i shall not budge an inch from this seat  this is the determination with which buddha gautama sat under the tree in the event  that is the story comes a whole night marahans  temptations of various kinds first sensation then terror they go side by side  but no yielding for any of these neither sensation nor terror because he had a mission to fulfill  gautama had to become buddha so he never afraid of every quarter change scene is changing and mara  became languish  and by heard on gautama who sat under the tree became buddha  buddha means the enlightened one  he became fully enlightened  now after this he starts for it is said in the jataka stories that he got up from the seat coming round  now as symbolically they have made stone lotuses as he came up from that seat every step that he put there was a lotus coming under his foot  until he started going out  then starts his spiritual mission  for forty years the first forty years with the twenty-five years happy luxurous life marriage birth of a son  and the determination to leave everything  and in search of truth for ten years hard rigorous spiritual practices  then again his bodhi this illumination that happen  on the same day vaisakha purnima just exactly forty years later  five hundred and sixty minus forty may be about five hundred seventy in b c  then he went on preaching to people about this meaningless  it is a performing yagas shileniyas  because at that time parnivantkas at your  one word they were spending all there energy in performing  yagas shileniyas  it is mentioned in the vedas in sanskrit  you have a desire if you want to attained heaven you have to perform yaga yaga yagnya did not go to heaven you have to perform sacrifice  but all that is meaningless much later thousand year later from shankara lasting life refer to shankara also who was also against the performance of yaga sheliniyas  it was more after the upanishadic way of life  buddha also comes to the same tradition same upanishadic tradition he was never against this upanishadic tradition  but his whole concept that is vital core what he calls  nirvan  he coined a new word  in our hindu tradition also we have this type of  brahma nirvana vrikchse  brahma the highest knowledge it's also called  nirvan  if attained brahma nirvan such a blowing up  because a kind of a negative concept but shankara gives us positive concept content to this idea or concept of the highest realisation  so as he was preaching men and women came this is one notable feature in buddhism  he made no distinction of caste community race or sex  men and women are all accepted and became monks and nuns in course of time  not during the time of buddha but during the late 
i will take exactly ten minutes of yours to brief you  about our institution  many people may not know the background under which this institution was born  i don't want to boast about myself but some of my friends for example now my good friend mr leherchand shah he has been associated with me indirectly for this school right from the first day  we decided to start this institution and still he has a soft corner for the institution  whenever i request him to do something he goes out of the way and does it  now he knows the background and some of the elder people  of the so called founder members of the institution they are knowing the background of course  in this particular instance we must remember our late  revered parampujya gopalacharya mouli who was the first person to inaugurate this institution and also blessed us and till his last he had his blessings with us and even in his absence our present parampujya  vidyasimhacharya is at the back of the institution invisibly and he has been blessing us all along  now we believe god's grace elder's  blessings always lead to success of anything  building an institution starting your activities social work commercial activities anything to do good to humanity  whether it is a medical aspect or any kind of thing or religious aspect  now this institution when i migrated to mulund in nineteen fifty-seven beginning or fifty-six end there were some enterprising kannada speaking people in dombivali thana mulund  and uh neighbouring suburbs  they came to me they just requested me why not we start some karnataka sangha and continue some activities  i said okay  any cultural activity and naturally in those years  before nineteen fifty-six dharwar belgaum bijapur karwar districts were the part of bombay state and many kannada speaking people  in those from these districts they came and  migrated to bombay for education for their building up their career commercial activities came and settled down  they became one with the masses of the locality and they started their own activities  naturally culture and civilisation and the tradition  in india differs right from himalaya up to ka   kanyakumari slightly though we are all one so far as the thinking is concerned but the traditions in areawise languagewise some difference take place  so some people said we should maintain our tradition also  though we have migrated from our districts and come  came and settled down here now we've become a part of this place  of course i should say i'm here from nineteen forty-five   i've seen the generation passing  today some of the grandchildren or great grandchildren of the people who came fifty hundred years ago from karnataka their children do not know even kannada language  but that doesn't mean we are not here on a linguist aspect or the communal aspect other thing it is only to maintain the culture and tradition  each culture and tradition has its own history has its own good points and therefore we are only seeing the good points of the culture and civilization and not the bad points  now for example he is uh speaking this language he is speaking this language i must hate him no not that way  bombay is a cosmopolitan  every language every caste every creed it is a mini india  and we are also a part of mini india though originally we come from some place but we have to maintain our culture and tradition we are trying to maintain  for that purpose only i agreed we started  but i used to see in those days there was only one kannada school somewhere in a corner of sion and matunga  that too in a hutments military barracks running  and ultimately this was shifted to wadala and i used to see young boys seven years eight years going in the  railway train all the way from ambarnath dombivali kalyan and other thing etcetera or wadala cough  so i said look if at all there is anything it is education  with the education we can bring up our people  or the society which has come and settle down here become a part of bombay they will definitely be benefitted so why not we start uh an education institution  everybody appreciated  then we more or less decreased the cultural  activities of the karnataka sangha and started the  vidya prasaraka mandala and in those days we used to call it mulund-thana because there were many people from mulund many people from thana even dombivali everybody was coming  so it was mulund-thana that was the name given and we started  in the initial stages some devoted few workers  they associated with the institution and some of them were not still born in the institution  they were born a few years later  now i can say kamath or joshi or uh shastri  they came and joined a little later  then this institution started increasing the activities we didn't have any place  so the first one year the institution started working  at my premises where i was staying in the balcony  and there was one teacher who sacrificed for couple of years  one by name mrs setlur she was a qualified teacher and  you'll be surprised i used to pay from my pocket fifteen  rupees per month to her to conduct the kannada k g  kannada first standard kannada second standard  one teacher conducting all the schools  and we had devoted workers like one mr bharbare he was working in the a g's office now i do not know where he is  and there was another mr malagi these two people had sufficient time at their disposal being a government servants not i want to belittle a government servants  but when you've got your own shop you have to go right eight o'clock and open it and keep be   there whether the customers come or not  but the government officer he can go at ten o'clock and come back at five o'clock so long he completes the work  but they were devoted workers  they used to go door to door where kannada people are staying  and request them please send your child to our school  that some of the parents were uneducated they were not able to send somehow convincing forcibly they used to bring they were  they were these two were the boys who were todays aaya  who bring the school children to the school and take them back home  that kind of activity they have done  i mean that was the kind of attachment devotions for the work they had  and this way the school went on  then in mulund in those days the population was about  thirty thousand  fortunately or unfortunately i had many kacchi friends who developed and we started one small social club of mulund  of which our dr lalan the first the oldest m b b s doctor general practitioner leherchand shah and some of the people we started the activities  and then slowly i rather converted them you know now conversion takes place converted them to devote something for the school  during this contact i came across the managing committee members chairman president everything etcetera of the gujrathi schools  so manilal chaturbhuj gandhi became a very good friend of mine because of my association with these people and my activities  so became a friend  i requested him one day we are small people we don't have money we don't have funds we don't have workers can we use can we use  your school when you are not using without disturbing you  he said most welcome  then i asked him we don't have big money to pay the rents also  he said who asks you to pay the rent ?  they didn't ask a single nayapaisa and then  manibhai's all the children became our good friends and they also from that managing committee they looked after us very well  and sometime you know when our school grew upto s s c standard  cough the grown up children sometime become mischievous  they used to break the glass they used to make it dirty  they don't uh take care of the toilet  then tear the paper and throw it somewhere  now we were running in the morning shift and hardly there was half an hour dist difference  between their school and our school and lot of complaint from the headmaster of the gujrathi school started coming this this this this this but let me tell you my good friend manilal and his team of committee members they were so cooperative one day they called me arey kulkarni tum ek kam karo   tell me what is it dekho tum ek jhadu wale ko laga do   children make mischief and other thing etcetera  so therefore before this school come they will just clean it and make it good so that i don't have to listen to my own principal to coming uh i mean uh making complaint against you people  so this is a good idea  it should have struck struck the headmaster there at that time  but he didn't  our gudi was there  i forced gudi to come and join this institution he was not willing to come because two reasons today we all of us look to security  now our children grow  okay what are you going to do ? so in good old days are you getting a government job ? close the eye and join because it is secured  so private company is it a long standing then join  if it is a private company just started oh nobody knows whether after five years this will remain or not  so those were the days when everybody was looking for a secured job  mr gudi had already a secured permanent job in one of the leading schools of n k e s but somehow i succeeded in brainwashing him and i told him we may not have money we may not pay you what you are getting but we have a soft corner for you if you come and sacrifice and ultimately i had to cut a joke at him  who is at the back of you ? he even today a bachelor still there associated with the school indirectly  who is at the back of you ? for whom you want to have a a secure job ? come join  do some social work at least you'll get a good name  he came joined  then all the youngsters team came and joined  then we were on the look out for a place  and this kamath came across the landlord of this place and uh we had nobody to pay  this man mahalay had a very big land  so he was selling piece by piece  we selected  do you know it took us five years to make the payment to him piece by piece piece by piece hundred rupees two hundred  rupees thousand rupees two thousand  rupees because we were to collect and give it  in those days what was the mode of collection ? sorry to say some of our kannada people at that time  were in trade in business in industry  i was a very small man in those years  i used to go to them  look you are from karnataka we have started a kannada school we want to do this we don't have funds government is not giving us any grant shall we will you help us ? so some people who had love for education okay here is our fifty rupees  in those days fifty rupees was a big amount  nineteen fifty-seven fifty-eight  hundred rupees was a big amount  some people used to ask me are you sending your ch  they asked me point blank question  are you sending your children to this school ? i said no my children are going to english medium school there was a simpson school or something like that  then why do you want this headache ? better go away  even people insulted me like this  so ultimately i came to the conclusion any help or donation will come from people who have if i go and ask them who do not have what can they give ? at the most people who have got a love for education they may give the sympathy  if they are elders they may bless  if they are youngsters okay you ask me run about i will go run about beg borrow won't steal but i'll get something  if they are youngsters who has a devotion for education  so i tried fortunately for me associated with a chemical trade in uh bombay  i started only one aspect  this most of the gujrati people were in the chemical trade in those years and i was associated with the chemical trade  i used to give them advice guidance whenever they came  they had a sympathy for me  so i said let me try to tap the source  so once a year i used to go to them with a small request and in those days for a souvenir we used to keep hundred  rupees is the highest for advertisement fees  and hundred rupees very few people will pay  half page quarter page one eighth page based on hundred  and go door to door  some people say arey jao tum pachas rupye leke jao   even they would not ask for a receipts  i said no you must take the receipt  this money collected in those years was utilised only for  paying the salary of the teachers plus whatever we were able to contribute from our pockets  then i said this way we cannot do it  bhimsen joshi being a very good friend of mine invariably whenever he was in bombay he was camping in my house  those days also like today his fees are fifty thousand  rupees  in those days he would go and sing if you give a good cup of tea at your house  so i used to request him and he said okay for your school i'll give you a free performance  and what i was in return giving he would come for some other programme at their expense and one day give it for our school  and we didn't have a big money to purchase the i mean to hire a big hall so we used to request the poddar college principal take that poddar college hall and run this small show and to bhimsen joshi one and a half rupee ghuch  that's all was given to him  he was very happy and convinced and he gave us couple of programmes  then not only that he brought that ustad uh uhm what is his name from benaras shehenaiwallah  yeah bismillah khan  he told bismillah because bismillah and he were studying together somewhere in north india sleeping on the footpath of the  guru's house both of them and uh serving the guru in northern india and therefore they were good friends  he said dekho ye hamara shaala hai uske liye tum  phokat mei karneka  of course we paid in those days hundred rupees or something like that to meet his expenses coming from benaras and all that and that is how begging borrowing we started 
friends today i'm going to talk to you about two dimensional stratagrowth by identical limited aggregation by electrolysts deposit process  the passing century has witnessed scientific investigation  of order systems such as crystalline systems and so on and so forth  order was even discovered in liquids like liquid systems  but during the last part of this century scientists have realised that many recorded systems behave in perfectly orderly  manner  for example biological systems are never crystalline and they contain more than seventy percent water and yet they perform functions which are most orderly  many physical technological and biological systems  have been shown to be related to and described by non-integer dimension as called fractional dim fractional dimensions  a concept which was originally uh discovered and beautifully demonstrated by b b mendel broad in his classic book called fractal  uh lot of information has been gathered about these systems  such as technique such as experimental theoritical and computer assimilation  in this lecture today i'm going to introduce you  to a process of generating fractal aggregate that is developed in our laboratory  the plan of my lecture will be as follows  although most of you must be familiar with the fla fact factual concepts  for the benefit of those who are uninitiated in this field and for the sake of completness   i'll first give an introduction to the concepts of  fractal such as definition of fractal the concept of self similarity and their invariance the physical significance of  fractal dimension and so forth  before going over to the method of generating fractal  that we have developed  and since the aggregates that we obtain are diffusion limited aggregate i'll introduce the diffusion limited aggregation of with an nth standard the module which is developed by with an nth standard  the first experimental uh evidence of different type of aggregates  was given by electro deposition process by sauda atoll and gregor atoll  whereas the method which we have developed is electroless deposition  and using this technique we have generated aggregates of metals like copper silver and zinc which will be compared and contrasted   i'll also show a method of how to measure the  fractal dimension experimentally for the agre type of aggregates that we have generated  the diffusion limited aggregation is aggregates are formed  by uh interspin which are very near to equilibrium  i mean very far from equilibrium  whereas when the crystals are very near to equilibrium the morphology of aggregates is entirely different   i'll give some beautiful examples of diffusionless aggregates which are generated in our laboratory from crystals  which are very near to the equilibrium   fractal geometry provides a natural framework for describing and understanding those form this according to euclidian geometry are formulae that is to investigate the morphology of amorphous now how to describe fractions   frac in general if you observe a particular object for example take a glass of water and a bucket of water where the mass per unit volume which tells you about the density of water does not depend upon the volume of water gratitute for measurements  whether you take a glass or you take a bucket the density of the water will remain one  so in euclidian type of object the density remains constant  irrespective of type of the measuring unit  but if you consider some different object as i'll  show here then the density no longer ramains constant as the size of the object  this object is generated in this particular case by well defined determinous to prove  a cross is generated by putting four particle around the central particle and this is used as a iterative unit  at the four corners and at the centre you replace every particle by the cross and you will generate this figure  and if this process is repeated several times then  a figure such as this is obtained  now let us try to calculate the density of this object  or as you've seen here since density can be written as density can be written as mass upon volume  so we can write this equation as mass is proportional to volume  that is mass is proportional to length cube  and in two dimensions mass will be proportional to length square  now instead of mass we can use the number of particles as unit because number of particles will be proportional to the mass of the  uh one word  so number of particles in euclidian system is proportional to the linear dimension to the power of euclidian dimension  for the sake of simplicity we are considering a two dimensional system  and as you can see here in this particular system  here value is at k  k is any number if this is k is equal to one ah i have okay i'll just put it up here  so you have k is equal to zero k is equal to one k is equal to two and k is equal to some number k let us say cough  and i'll show you how it is obtained  so you will have here for k is equal to one you have five particles in this particular figure  so your n is five  for k is equal to two you have twenty-five particles as you can see there  so your n is five twelve  and so your k is equal to k and n is five to power of k  similarly if you take the linear dimension that is if you measure this distance then for k is equal to one simply k into three that is three times k this and i have not drawn it properly  if you look at that figure you will see that this plus this plus this will give you this for k is equal to one two and three  so for k is equal to two we have k into t to the power of two  you can count here  it will give about nine distance three plus three plus three  and for k is equal to k cough we have k into three to the power of k  so in this equation if you have log of n divided by log of n to the limit a going to infinity then you find that this comes out to be log of five divided by log of n using one point four six five  so you see that the power of the i mean if you cough  can rewrite this equation it will become n into number of one word s to the power of some constant number  but a is unit here  right a is uh you can take it uniquely or you can know even if you write a and solve the equation we get this in the limit a tending to infinity  so we find that this number comes out to be a  fractional number  so for euclidian object you have a proportional to l to the power of euclidian dimension and for a fractal object this is a fractional number and because it is a fractional number it is called  a fractal system  this word fractal was coined by b b mendel broad to represent those system which occurs the physical properties cannot be described  by using euclidian dimension  for example if you take a mountain you cannot call it a triangle you cannot call it a sphere and therefore its properties will not be describable by euclidian geometry  you need to take some other measure to describe the properties of such systems which are plenty in nature  uh blood circulation system or nervous system so many systems if you look at them you cannot put them into orderly phenomenon  and then you require some science to describe such systems because the aim of science is to bring predictibility to events  if you cannot predict than naturally you can't have some  uh good sign you can't predict certain things then it's not science  so in order to bring predictability you need a framework which will describe the image  so fractal framework produce a provides something  which with which you can describe these events with certainity now we should understand that there is this dimension  which is used and if we call as one point four six five is the dimension of the system but that is not the real dimension of the system really it is a two dimensional system as you can see there  this term fra dimension is borrowed because that particular number replaces the dimension in the eucli normal  uh equation  so we call a fractal dimension  it is not a dimension in the actual sense of the word  it is but because this fractional number replaces the dimension of the system to make the mea physical measurements meaningful  we call it a dimension  so when the notion of euclid and dimension poses a conceptual problem in underst understanding  certain system the concept of fractal dimensionality gives a manageable and convenient answer to such questions  just for the sake of completeness i'll give some mathematical equation which should not put you off  so in general if rover is the density of the aggregate at a point r and n is the total number of particles in a cluster of radius i then the density density correlation function can be written as here  so you have several forms of of this equation which i have written there is simple form u is equal to m upon v  c r can be written as r to the power of minus three minus three that e is the euclidian dimension and this d is the fractal dimension  if this number is written as alpha then you have c r  varying as r to the power of minus alpha and fractal dimension can be measured experimentally by using any one of these cough  equations when different techniques are required for such measurements  now i will describe the concepts of self similarity and  scale invariance of the fractal  self similarity and scale invariance are the fundamental properties of fractal i don't say that scale invariance is fundamental because there are fractal in which the scale invariance is not necessary in the sense  the power which we saw just now this d distance need not be a constant number  it can be expressed as a power t and those fractal are called multifractal okay the common fractal normally i mean to be conceptually very simple the scale invariance and scale similarity are considered to be two important characteristics of the fractal  so in this figure which we have generated just sometime before  if you take any part of this figure and enlarge it then you get a figure which is identical to the start   starting figure  and then again take any part of it so i have put it  then again enlarge a part of this figure  it will appear identical to the original figure  and that is why the fractal systems are called self-similar  because the a any part of the system if it is elarged or contracted looks like the original system  but this self similarity ends when you start distinguishing between the particles  when you start seeing the particle from this take a small part of it and enlarge it it is no longer going to look like the like  original figure  and so this puts a blow to critical form below which the system will not behave as a fractal system figures might be same no it is it is no longer a fractal system then  and similarly the size of the aggregate itself puts a bound above which the system cannot be called as a fractal system because i may have a large system with sub units like this now each sub unit is a fractal but these sub units might be arranged in crystalline position  so in that case i have fractal behaviour only between  the size of the particle and the size of the aggregate which is fractal in between these two units the aggregate behave like fractal  but above and below these limit they do not behave like fractal  and these are called the lower and upper critical bounds of the fractal system  now in this particular case the figure has been generated using a  precise deterministic mathematical rule  but in general we make a fractal which exist are not created by mathematical rules  so in that case the self similarity is not exact  it is a statistical self similarity  as we can see here the object which are created for example by some processes like the smoke are self similar and here again  if you enlarge a small part anywhere here it will look similar to the starting object it will not be exactly identical to the starting object and yet it will be similar to the starting object   it's statistical properties will be similar to what you have from the original object until and unless you start resolving between the particles when again the self similarity breaks down  so you have statistical or deterministic factors which are self similar  so let us see what is scale invariance of statistic  the equation m is proportional to l to the power of d sixth off the scale invariance because the in this equation it all remains constant  but the question we comes at to in this equation euclidian  where euclidian is dimension is used also this power remain constant  so what is so great about the invariance of fraction  in order system also you have scale invariance  this the importance of scale invariance becomes clear  when we look at it from the other side  what i mean by other side is that is if you have objects for which for the measurement of which mathematical equation cannot be written down you cannot define it  then you cannot define if that means they are not still invariant whereas for those objects for which you can give some meaning to the one word are only objects which are scale invariant  i will give a very specific example of a coastland  we have all visited beaches that is sea beach i mean  and if you'll see the morphology of the sea beach  you will find it something like this it's not going to be a straight line  now i'll take a one kilometre strip of the coastline this is one kilometre  and i measure this one kilometre length by using a metre long scale  i keep my metre long scale here and start measuring this by kilometre length  i find that my coastline length of my coastline is thirty-two kilometres  then i take a one metre uh sorry one centimetre uh strip  and again measure this coast length  again here there will be something  so i measure the length of the coastline as three into ten to the power of seven kilometres  and if i take one millimetre it becomes ten to the power of nine kilometres  there it appears as if it is not possible to measure the length of the coastline because depending on what unit i take for measurement it keeps on varying  but that is not true because the including coastline can be  statistically defined it cannot be exactly defined but length of the coastline can be statistically defined by an equation saying a few words  if we put one metre one centimetre or one millimetre you will get  l exactly predictable 
so in this my last talk in in this uh refresher course  uh uh i can't do uh in fact i want to give two talks on commonwealth literature as such but uh cough you'll  have to be satisfied with only one  and again in the in the department here there are people i mean who are specialists in common wealth literature and probably  uh they will say something more uh concrete about uh  australian literature uh african literature  now cough uh now uh commonwealth literature  when it was conceived i think sometime in the nineteen sixties  now i have one date here seventeen september nineteen sixty-five uh on which an association of commonwealth  literature and language studies was formed  and so that's a a good date nineteenth sixty-five  but the very term commonwealth itself the term commonwealth  is uh quite an old one  in the seventeenth century the seventeenth century uh  uh the act of uh british parliament established a commonwealth company  uh a a comprising english england and all the other  uh i don't can't read in this or the other territories  you see they called it a commonwealth comprising england and all the other uh dominions and territories  it it it's a seventeenth uh century uh idea  and uh the ac by the act of parliament this commonwealth was established  and uh then in the eighteenth century berk the great orator political orator now he speaks of the commonwealth of  nations commonwealth of self governing nations  then in the uh nineteenth century i mean the some of the colonies like canada and uh new zealand and australia  and so south africa i mean they  uh became in a sense self governing nations of course under the  uh uh rule or reign of uh the the british king or the queen  now it's in uh twentieth century that uh uh now en england of course was a great imperial power with a power over quite a number of colonies  and uh to begin with uh it is a very comfortable imperial power  enjoying its uh rule over so many uh colonies  and uh the and the english people were very proud uh about the fact that uh the sun never set on the british empire  but uh uh in in twentieth century in the first two decades or so i mean in all the colonies there was an awakening  and uh and the struggle for freedom uh started  and then it is as a result of the second world war  and also as a result of uh the the uh strong freedom movements  in the colonies most of the colonies became free  so actually india and pakistan were the first to become free in nineteen forty-seven  then in uh fifty-seven ghana and malaysia in nineteen sixty nigeria uh sixty-two yuganda sixty-seven uh   da dangarika and cyprus and sixty-six malta zambia sixty-five congo and like that  you see so it's in the forty late forties and fifties and sixties i mean the most of the colonies became free  and uh so for some reason because i think the the british government was uh uh quite ap apparently  showed a kind of a generosity towards the colonies in giving them freedom  uh though the the then freedom struggle were were become had become really ripe  so it was a kind of both both give and take you see  and that's why the the england had very cordial relationships with the colonies  and because of uh this cordiality the the commonwealth was born and uh jawaharlal nehru as i told you is one of the great uh  advocates of the commonwealth of uh the british colonies  and uh now it is at that time again the concept of commonwealth literature came into existence  so i gave you the date as about early early sixties now uh what are the factors that uh brought  all these literatures together  now one of course is the english language and the other is the the common cultural relationship between the between the colonies and england  and uh one might say the colonial consciousness and the english language have were the two binding factors  now to begin with i mean uh those who sort of the commonwealth literature uh were uh people from leads university as i told you yesterday  now professor walsh was the first person to write a small book on commonwealth literature and in the introduction to this particular book uh walsh says speaks of uh the the central cannon of british literature and uh these other literatures are uh  satellites of this  you see they are smaller groups which are attached to this central  area of uh british literature  so you you find in that concept of uh the commonwealth literature a a kind of imperial attitude  it still carries imperial attitude and makes the british  uh literature as the central cannon and the others its satellite  but uh the the ca the writers in the colonies of course they reacted very strongly against this imperial concept  of uh commonwealth literature  now uh what are the literatures that came together uh  the australian literature uh  canadian and then uh new zealand then african then carribean now in canada a uh there are about two languages one is uh french and the other english  so half of uh canada and uh africa one word  muslims uh newly educated people wrote in english so the entire african literature a and also for some uh pople from uh what country is it ? lagose you see they wrote in uh french but they  whatever they wrote was in immediate translate the english  and then uh as far as india is concerned as i mentioned this morning only one tenth of our literature was represented only that literature which was written in english  so if you look at these commonwealth countries we find there are white commonwealth countries and coloured commonwealth countries there is australia canada new zealand in fact they  they they still follow the european tradition  after all uh the australians and the canadians and the the new zealand people they are englishmen who went and settle there  and the relationship between the cultural relationship between england and the other these uh white commonwealth countries that of one might say father and son father and son  and uhm now the problem was they wanted to seek their own identity  they wanted to become australians or canadians and new zealanders so that problem was there with them  even though the the son as he grows up he would like to be separate he would like to have a separate identity from the parents  you see it it is that kind of uh development that you find in uh the literatures of the white uh commonwealth countries  but if you take the coloured countries what are the coloured countries ? india uh and africa and west indies  now uh india for one reason or an   another i mean it didn't develop a a kind of protest that africans africas developed towards english  uh eng uh england  now uh even though my even looking at the indian let's  take i mean uh each uh each literature i mean uh australian literature canadian literature or indian writing in english  or african literature  now even before they came together under one umbrella of uh commonwealth literature  now each literature had developed to a certain extent  now uh one can say that each literature have  has passed through nea  nearly four phases  and actually it is in the third phase of its development  that uh these literatures came together under one uh umbrella  now this is the first stage i mean that is during your the  the period of imperialism  you see the the there there was this writing writing in  in that writing you find that uh the british culture was the dominant culture and uh the the the culture of the colonies was the subordinate culture  and uh the the colonies in a sense for one reason or another yielded to the british dominant culture  uh but this yielding is not uh i mean a very simple kind of an yielding  in the case of australian literature or canadian you find this there is a very simple kind of yielding because they were uh more or less the british who had just gone away from uh england and they were staying there  so before they started talking in terms of their own identity in the beginning they did enjoy this yielding or continuing the old tradition of the british  uh but later on the second phase the second phase is a very important phase the second phase is a love-hate relationship  now in india this love-hate relationship begins uh in the  uh early twentieth century with uh uh the gandhian period during the gandhian era one might say this uh tension  uh was at the highest  and the that's the reason why we have great writers during this period  any period of tension or any period in which there is this love-hate relationship  so uh that period is very fertile  we have very great writers uh not only they did write in english but also in the other uh indian literature  i mean uh who expressed themselves during this period  and that's why from one point of view that was a period of renaissance for us in india  even though we accepted uh a good deal from the british influence from from england uh we took them forms the the european forms the novel the short story the one act play and  uh three act play and all those things  but uh still uh they tried to express the indian experience in a very intense way  and uh during the third phase the third phase is the phase that comes immediately after getting political liberation uh that is political decolonisation  immediately af that is followed by a third phase  and when i mean there is an attempt to i uh seek ones own identity uh and uh to seek ones own national spirit  and that's how a very interesting stage of development  now it is a during this stage the third stage of the development of uh colonial consciousness that uh we find this coming together of uh uh the literatures of all these colonies under the umbrella of uh commonwealth literature  now the fourth phase comes after that say is is now  that uh the most of these literature are in the fourth phase  and the fourth phase is the phase of confidence  you see now most of these literatures they have attained in a sense their own identify and they have produced their own uh  great writers and uh now actually each literature i mean can stand on its own legs  uh so i have a feeling that the commonwealth literature  i mean in third phase they came together and there were there were number of similar problems that uh uh they were facing probably the  pha the problem of uh seeking ones own identity  and uh almost all these literatures went back to their past  their folklores in order to derive inspiration uh uh and uh  uh in one way or other in fact there are various ways not one way in which they found their own identity  but uh they found there there there they went in for various strategies uh in order to uh seek their own identity  and once having found their own identity now they they  they are very confident now  they are confident and the each has developed its own literature that is they now a a big body of canadian literature a very large body of australian literature and very large body of uh carribean literature and also african literature  and uh now the africans have become so conscious that they don't want to write in english any longer and uh they've  have started writing in their own languages their own tribal languages  now uh uh i've a feel i i have a hunch that uh gradually this uh commonwealth the concept of commonwealth literature will uh disintegrate  because the need will go away  there was a need for sometime you see united we stand that kind of attitude was there and uh no then we did a lot of uh  i mean uh comparative work and uh number of conferences meeting together but now we find that uh each literature has come of age and it doesn't require the help of the others  and uh they they there are more differences than common points now in the fourth phase  so i have a feeling that uh now there will be disintegration of uh commonwealth literature and uh each literature will start just as american literature became totally independent  of uh uh british literature in the nineteenth century and established its own identity and now they talk only of american literature similarly australians have brought forth i mean big uh uh histories of australian literature and now they don't need the help of the the umbrella you see commonwealth literature they have achieved their identity they have their great writers like uh uh patrick white who won the nobel prize the great novelist and then they have very important poets like cannis leaser or a d hope or judith wright and again they have uh  they're quite happy with uh their australianess in uh  they've achieved it  and the they have well defined they have defined their australianess and uh they're happy with their development  and similar is the case with the africans  now africans during this third phase they did produce some great writers like uh chinua achibee then ole soynka then ngugi  now ole soynka well he got nobel prize and chinua achibee is all he also became a world figure by his first novel itself the things fall apart  and so they have achieved their own identity  and now again their breaking up in the sense now ngugi say i will no longer write in english  he will write in his uh kenyan it's not swahili but some other uh uh language it is a different name and he wants to write in that language first  and then translate from that into english  uh now uh so they are all very now very self conscious about their africanness or australianess or canadianess and uh now  they're very few points which are common amongst all these  commonwealth literatures  and that's why i've a feeling that uh they will separate and indian writing in english will become part of indian literature  you see instead of uh uh aligning itself with commonwealth literatures uh it will seek its identity with uh other indian literatures in other in native languages  and uh this is in general uh what would happen and probably what's going to happen with uh commonwealth  literature  now uh the the main problem with uh this commonwealth literature was the was the attempt to seek ones identity and this is a very interesting phase  and africans have went gone back to their ancient uh gods and rituals  and uh uh the way they went back in fact uh is a is a is a lesson to us  and i would like to read for example some of the things  the way for example they went back to their gods 
 it's a good morning to you all  uh in fact you see my aim is to give you as much information about indian english as possible during these two lectures  it's uh there has been a lot there has been a lot of work in fact you see done in order to establish indian english as uh a standard variety of uh british english  so uh i will give you means in fact you see i'm  just giving you information about whatever has uh gone in for  the establishment of the identity of indian english  so most of you know that uh the term indian english is used to describe english as used by  the indians  uh there have been several attempts to establish the identity of indian english through investigations into its major distinctive features uh the seminar on indian english held at uh c i e f l  hyderabad in nineteen hundred seventy-two may be described as the first collective effort to arrive at some definite conclusions regarding  the status of indian english  now the conclusion arrived at were indian english is not a substandard english it is not pidgin english it is not just british english with a few indian spices added to it it has its own distinct identity  so these were the conclusions uh at which the seminar  on indian english held at uh hyderabad arrived you see  so uh ramesh mohan later on edited the paper published  the the papers i'm sorry the papers which were presented at the seminar uh with the title indian writing in english   now as the title of the book suggests the emphasis was on indian writing in english only four papers attempted to describe  the lexical phonological and syntactic features of indian english and one of the papers was by kachru one of the papers was by kachru  now you must be knowing you see during the colonial days  englishmen considered indian english as a substandard variety of british english  uh now for instance you see certain uh derogatory terms were used to describe indian english terms like babu english butler english  now you get reference to these terms in yule and  bernell's hobsan and johnson uh hobsan and jobson i'm  sorry hobson hobson jobson it is hobson jobson uh which was published in eighteen hundred eighty-six  uh now indian english was also described as kitchen english  and arey bhai slof by p lal in his article on uh  indian writing in english which was published in harward educational review uses these two terms kitchen english and arey bhai slof  so uh so the means uh during the early days indian english was not acceptable to the british people and uh probably the indians even did not think of indian english as uh having its own distinct identity  but uh the sustained efforts made over years by indian english linguists critics creative writers and teachers of english have now established indian english as a standard variety of english now i would uh uh comment on you see indian english as a non- native variety of english  now some researchers or investigators would accept indian english as a non-native variety of english whereas some uh researchers  would not accept some researchers like daswani he would not accept  indian english as a non-native variety of english  uh now it was prator who first talked of uh indian english this i have provided you with uh select bibliography and uh there are references to some of the articles to which i'm  going to refe to which i'm going to refer in my  lecture you see  so prator uh dismissed indian english as a local  unintelligible model of english  so he said this is a local model unintelligible and uh  uh he objected to the setting up of the local variety of english instead of r p as a model for the learners  so he insisted that r p should be the model for the learners  and there should not be uh any attempt to present the local variety of english  now uh prator in fact called it the heretical tenet  he said it was uh it is the he said you see it was the heretical tenet that the local model should be given uh for the learning of the pronunciation  now uh you probably might be knowing you see it was bansal who insisted that there should be a local model a local model for  the teaching of pronunciation  uh so far uh there have been some attempts you see but so far  we have not been able to come to a local model probably it would be possible in future when uh the i c e project will come out  i c e project that is the international corpus of english project  which is now being carried out you see and the for the first time you would be uh for the first time you see the spoken aspect of indian english is taken into consideration so later on it's quite possible the possible that the local model of spoken english would be uh presented  so prator uh seems to have ignored the basic principle regarding intelligibility which when he calls indian english as uh unintelligible he seems to have ignored the basic principle now  now catford in his uh uh article the teaching of english as a foreign language which was which was published in nineteen hundred fifty says that the concept of intelligibility has to be related  to the concepts of appropriateness and effectiveness in a speech situation  so he wants that we should relate the concept of intelligibility to the concepts of appropriateness and effectiveness in a speech situation now kachru adds to these to the parametre of the context of situation  kachru talks of the context of situation now uh so i i indian english has all of you know  is used in uh socio-cultural context  it is used even  so indian english as uh most of you know is used mainly in indian socio-cultural educational and administrative contexts   i indian english has been used as a link language as a  official language so we need to take into consideration the context of situation now uh uh talking about the phonology or the phonological aspect of indian english it may be said that uh we should give more importance to the meaning rather than the noise  now i would like to refer to j r one word book uh  speech which was published in nineteen hundred and thirty-three and uh which was reprinted in nineteen hundred sixty-six  now j r one word says that uh uh meaning is as much  a property of the situational context of people as the noise is  so meaning is necessary and that's why uh i think you see it would uh not be sensible at all to present the speaker of r p as the model for spoken english uh to a junior class in a village in india  uh it would not be possible uh uh it would not be sensible and it wouldn't it would not be even necessary  now it has been claimed that uh uh indians need not concentrate much on the spoken form  it has been claimed you see means when you uh take into consideration the aspect of communication  uh now it is said that uh the meaning should be taken into consideration rather than the noise that we make  so the role of english in india has been to integrate  culturally and linguistically the pluralistic societies within india  and uh it has never been the primary aim of uh english in india  to integrate with the british or american culture  american culture and that's why we did not pay much attention you see to the spoken aspect  but uh we should rather concentrate on the written communication so throughout the years indians accepted english they acculturated english and uh the acculturated english is what we call indian english what we call indian english so this linguistic assimilation that has taken place   in with regard to english in india may be compared to it may be compared to the indianisation of persian language  or the dravidianisation of sanskrit language or even the indo-aryanisation of dravidian languages in india  it may be compared uh to these now  bhatia uh presents four criteria on the basis of which he would establish indian english as a non-native variety  for the first criterion about which he talks is that in india english is learnt from the school stage of education  so before uh uh before a boy starts before a boy or a girl  uh starts learning english he or she has already learnt the mother tongue  she has already learnt the mother tongue so the use of english in india has been from fine to formal  or sometimes even informal situation  but uh uh english in india is never used for intimate situations  it is never used for intimate situation  uh so uh the according to him you see the second criterion is this the intimate situations are not the region of uh indian english  then a non-native speaker has limited facility to use the various registors of the language  so the native speaker can use all the registors of the language whereas uh uh indians in uh indians cannot use all the registors of language  then as a non-native variety english in india has uh  phonetic syntactic and symantic deviations  so these deviations even would establish india english as a non-native variety  now bansal objected to prator's observations uh bansal bansal infact you see uh wrote uh in his  nineteen hundred sixty-nine article that the subjective element or the  uh or the puritan attitude which uh prator had been representing in his criticism of indian english was altogetherly wrong so uh bansal tried to measure the intelligibility of indian english  so he wanted to establish that indian in indian english is intelligible as against prator's criticism of indian english as uintelligible  so uh he uh came to the conclusion that uh an average figure of intelligibility between educated indian speaker and r p speaker is seventy-three percent is seventy-three precent  so uh indian english cannot be dismissed as unintelligible variety of english  so his study was based on a on recorded specimens of english of the indian speech community and uh it described even the phonetic features of indian english speech which uh differ from the r p  bansal's nineteen hundred seventy-two study was an attempt to analyse and describe the common core of language patterns  the common core of language patterns  now uh later on you see perk even quirk talked of the  uh nuclei the nuclear english  he talked about the nuclear english later on quirk  now the common core uh of course uh uh one of the conclusions i would be arriving at would be that when it comes to the common core indian english does not differ much from  british english  so this would be one of the conclusions uh at which i would like to arrive at the end  so bansal wanted to uh find out if it was possible to have the common core shared by all the members of indian speech community all the members of indian speech community now he said you see uh now of course you see in india  english is used for uh a variety of purposes  but bansal compares the variedness of indian english with that of human behaviour  so he says human behaviour when we talk of human behaviour  we concentrate on similarity and not on differences  so in the same way we should think of this similar uh the similar aspects or the similar features and uh that would enable us  to have a common core for the spoken indian english  now verma uh describes indian english as an offspring yielded by english a second language with a distinct indian flavour  he would describe indian english as one of the languages of india  used by a community of people at different levels of communication so and then further he says within the overall general framework of the basic linguistic systems of british english it displays certain distinguishing features and uh he would say it is the interlanguage situation that contributes to the distinct status of indian english  so he would say that it will be interlanguage situation so his concentration is on the interlanguage situation  so verma did not want indian english to be grouped  with american english canadian english and australian english because  he said these are the mother tongue varieties whereas indian english is a non-native second language variety it is a non- native second language variety  now as i told you before daswani would not accept indian english as a variety of british british english  so but uh there is some positive element in his criticism of indian english  he says if systematic relations uh if systematic relationship between varieties of english such as american australian canadian english and indian english is established then only indian english may be accepted as uh a variety of british english  so the relationship between the mother tongue variety  and the indian english needs to be established and then only we would accept indian english as a variety of british english  now if you know you see uh chowmsky would uh say that  uh the divergencies this when we talk of a language when we talk of a a a language let us say uh divergencies at the divergencies are shown at the level of surface structure rather than at the level of deep structure rather than at the level of deep structure  so daswani says that it has not yet been proved that face structure rules of british english and indian english are the same  are the same and that the difference is only in the area of uh  transformational and phonological rules  so only when it would be proved that at the level of deep structure indian english is the same as british english and uh only at the level of uh the surface structure indian english differs from british english then only we may accept indian english as a variety of british english this is what uh uh daswani would say  uh daswani also comments on the eratic use of articles and prepositions in indian english  he even comments on the phoneic interference on account of negligence of some phonological rules  so we uh infact do not know certain rules and we ignore certain rules and that's why there is phonic interference in indian english  so he would say uh he would say you see it is out of our  ignorance it is out of uh our ignorance or negligience that uh  we use uh different structures  we use different structures and that's why indian english is not a variety of uh british english  this is daswani's uh point of view 
mr vice chancellor mr narayana rao distinguished members of the faculty ladies and gentlemen  you know the great advantage of being chief election commissioner of india is that in the last few days and a last few months i have been able to achieve life long ambitions  only last week i achieved the life long ambition of entering into the stella mary's college in madras laughter  and today i have achieved the ambition of getting into the central institute of english and foreign languages  a kind of place of education academics and learning  which would normally frown upon any bureaucrats much more a bureaucrat whose name is synonymous with controversy  the vice chancellor has been good enough or bad enough not to give me a subject laughter  in the trade which i follow once i get hold of the mike you don't let go off it easily  so if i don't let go off the mike kamal narayan will show me some little symbols to show that it is getting late and that his blood pressure is rising laughter  mr narayana rao gave you an introduction about myself he said many nice things he said so many nice things that i thought he was describing somebody else laughter  he didn't tell you that i wrote the s s l c exam what used to be the end of school exam twice laughter and applause  he did not tell you that i wrote what in those days days the plus two exam used to be called the intermediate i wrote that twice  laughter  and when k subramaniam taught me english at the madras christian college in march nineteen fifty-one i wrote the english preliminary exam for the physics honors twice laughter  so how can you invite a person of this kind of academic qualification to the most outstandingly academic circmustances of the central institute of english and foreign languages no no no i forgot to tell you i wrote those exams twice each year because the question papers had leaked laughter and applause  nineteen nineteen forty-seven was the first time the s s l c queation papers leaked in madras  nineteen forty-nine was the first year in which the intermediate question papers leaked in madras nineteen fifty was the first time when a honors degree preliminary examination question paper be it english or something else  leaked in madras  so i wrote most of them twice i am not going to tell you my academic abilities because they are part of the history of an extinguished civil servant  i have been in bonded labour with government for thirty-six years from april nineteen fifty-five till december of nineteen ninety when  in a moment of extraordinary carelessness the then prime minister put me into this job despite the warning laughter of a previous prime minister who said this gentleman will still live to rule the day they make you chief election commissioner  he did  he did  roughly two and half years later speaking on the floor of parliament in february ninety-two mr chandrasekhar the former prime minister said i've done many serious mistakes in my life none has been so serious as the appointment of mr seshan as the chief election commissioner laughter and applause  i have a feeling that mr chandrasekhar's feeling towards me are slightly less frozen now because more recently i have noticed the sign of thaw  you basically are a set of teachers teachers and  teacher's teachers and teacher's teacher's teachers and who am i to speak to you about ? what am i to speak to you about ? the vice chancellor to some degree and mr narayan rao to a greater degree spoke of india and its democracy  when you talk of india's democracy you can hold your head up in great pride and say where else in the world do you get the democracy of this kind  on the first of july last about two three months ago india's  population was nine hundred and nineteen million people  of that about a five hundred and fifty million were voters above the age of eighteen anybody who is above the age of eighteen who is an indian citizen  who is not a confirmed lunatic and who has not been declared disqualified by some law is entitled to be a voter and he is entitled to be a voter in a particular place if he is ordinarily resident in that place that is what the law says  the law was not passed by me it was passed in nineteen fifty  when i was still studying physics  when we run a full national election in this country we run the election in eight hundred thousand polling booths man by four million civilian employees at the rate of five per polling booth  we're going to shortly make it six  why are you suddenly increasing it five to six ? because we are going to have compulsorily atleast one woman polling officer in each booth  so that mr lalu yadav who told the t v last week only  he said in hindi laughter who will be a lady   laughter  and mr lalu yadav will not be unhappy  so i was saying we use four million employees in addition to that we use a million and half policemen outside all kinds of policemen state policemen state armed policemen state reserved policemen  uh state home guards policemen state every kind of policemen central policemen central reserve police border security force indo-tibetan border police central industrial security force railway protection force  laughter any number of forces we use one and half million policemen to run a full election in this country  when parliament run its election in nineteen ninety-one a few months after i became the chief election commissioner we had nine thousand candidates for five hundred and odd parliamentary seats  but what an average of about eighteen candidates per seat there were some seats in which there were even a hundred candidates were  per constituency  in one part of india not necessarily for a parliament seat for an assembly seat in tamil nadu at a place called araba puruchi we had three hundred and seventy candidates for the assembly seat so that the ballet did not look like a sheet out of india's  todays newspaper it looked like todays edition of the newspaper  laughter  when parliament election runs in a normal course if there are nine thousand candidates we consume twenty thousand tons of high quality paper  and to each and every polling booth we reach seventy-five items like alice in wonderland of ships and shoes and sealing wax of cabbages and things of why the sea is boiling lots of ballet boxes and ballet papers and sealing wax and the melting wax and wires and threads and uh all kinds of things hurricane lantern if the andhra pradesh electricity board to switch off electricity don't worry i can reach you without benefit of mike  laughter  seventy-five items are reached to everyone of this places not all of them are easily accessible to motorise transport there are places where only the camel can reach as in jaisalmer or in bahmer or in sawai madhavpur  there are places like not only in ladakh or kargil but also in lahore and spity where only the largest helicopter of the indian force the mig twenty-five can reach those polling booths with the polling party and the polling material there are parts of the sunderban's jungle were only elephant back will reach there are parts of the island territories which only a boat would reach  and thanks to the extraordinary good arrangements made by distinguished predecessors of mine i've had eight predecessors  i'm the nineth chief election commissioner of india  those arrangements are so good that they are the eighth wonder of the world laughter  make no laughing statement about it  hold your head high  adult franchise was introduced at the point of time at which  india's literacy was less than twenty percent  today gentlemen in-charge of education programmes in different parts of the country put out lie after lie after lie all of governments programmes are called crash programmes because they all crash  laughter  crash programme in english education do you conduct those ?  laughter and applause  crash programme in rat elimination laughter  every crash every programme is called ra crash programme in malaria eradication crash programme in women's environment  everything is called a crash programme  but today at the end of all kinds of crash programmes literacy amongst women in bihar is still about four to five percent  the chief minister will be angry to hear me say so he says it is ten percent  doesn't matter i'll concede ten percent  in haryana they say it has reached thirty percent  but brides are largely for burning still in haryana  in haryana brides are largely still for burning  if they don't produce a son they are burnt if they don't produce dowry they are burnt  generally if they don't like the dau daughters-in-law they are burnt  first burn the daughter-in-law then ask the question  laughter  in their jest our fore-fathers the founding fathers of our constitution decided to endow upon the people of this country adult franchise that anybody who was twenty-one at that time now converted to eighteen in the last four or five years has the right to elect the government of this people of this country  when you talk of india you're talking of indian democracy you talk of india what is the picture of india that you get  ? the picture of india taught to our children in our schools today most of you are english teachers you don't know this but go and sit in english class and the history classes whether in college or in school are there any history teachers here ? i hope not they will throw something at me laughter  in fact there are twenty-five states and six union territories and one national capital territory of delhi there are chief minister and there are air bus cabinets and eyebrow cabinets and air bus three twenty cabinets in these places  they teach you about the greatness of my literature in telugu and my literature in tamil and my literature in kannada and my literature in marathi and my literature in gujrathi and my literature in something   there's hardly anybody to teach any of my children  my literature in india  but that is not all the history you got to teach people in this country in bad english if you go to the history classes mr ashoka dugged wells and he builded hospitals laughter  that is the kind of history being taught you know what is the use of giving only the english teachers to this class what about the history teacher who gets into the class and dictates notes saying ashoka dugged wells and he builded hospitals  justice india evoking you a feeling of an india which made my grandfather's grandfather's grandfather look at a little pot of water and say in sanskrit  that was long before somebody said kaveri is my grandfather's  river or my grandmother's river  today you and i have been taught english must be abolished  the local language should be brought in in hindi  laughter and applause  have you taught the children of this country the greatness of this country where there is a part of the country which get five hundred and fifty inches of rain per year and still has drinking water problem for five months in the year because they have rendered the total topography  similar to my head laughter  do you know of barmare and rajasthan or savai madhavpur where the annual rainfall is two inches ? do you know the rann of kuch where only the white wild ass and the red flemingo are available ? do you know the snow deserts of ladakh where the snow leopard alone lives ? do you know the rain forest of kerala and of arunachal where botanical and uhm zoological diversity is at its acme of completion  ? not of perfection but of completion  what do you teach them ? you teach them that the kakatiyas were in warangal and the chalukyas were in badami  fact what lot of good it does to me to know that kakatiya were in warangal and therefore warangal university is named after kakatiya is that right ? laughter  oh fact lot of good it does to me if somebody comes and says  what is the kakatiya ?  now if i'm especially when the doordarshan  prouncer prounces it  you don't know whether she is speaking english or french or what foreign language she is speaking laughter  our education system to which i shall come back which is going to be the theme of what i want to say today is the greatest tragedy which is available in this country today or in their greater tragedy there are there are any number of tragedies in this country and those of you who're standing i recommend warmly that you sit down otherwise you will get tired  laughter 
 you'd be happy to know that you and professor shastri they are preparing a cassette of the spoken indian english   english was very old in this country from the time of the east india company  east india company which came to india in seventeenth century  they started english in the coastal areas of andhra pradesh to begin it  and then with the establishment of east india company at madras calcutta and bombay things have improved  and during seventeenth century as well as in eighteenth that is finally english was systematized and standardized by the macaulay's minute  it was introduced in the schools which was started by the east india company and english became one of the subjects of study  people have been studying english for last so many years  and uh it became a big a matter after the establishment of the three universities at the provincial cities of madras bombay and calcutta  english is studied both for its language as well as for literature  english has influenced the indians and very much it has given strength and source to them to fight against the british later on through english only indians have came to know what is a democratic system how the government works in england and the speeches of burke and many other uh leaders in the british parliament  influenced the indian leaders  and english is one of the motive factor for many people  who started writing in indian languages even bankim chandra chatterji  who wrote such a beautiful novel like uh anandmath  was influenced by english and he gave a slogan called  vande mataram  so english has become one of the important languages in india english is studied today in schools colleges  universities  english is the lingua franca  and i think through english only for the first time  india is uh made one uh otherwise it will be difficult for most of the indians to know each other  because there are so many languages in india there are nearly seven hundred languages in india there was a cultural unity but a linguistic unity was not there and uh therefore english has provided this and in this  unity of language people began to be united they used to exchange their  opinions they used to read newspapers which were coming in english and therefore the people like uh uh srinivasa iyengar who has written about the development of indian english through his book indian writing in english it is a good thing the english have done to this country  during the last two hundred years the language was  developing in different ways  english is not spoken uniformly by all the indians  as a matter of fact english is not spoken uniformly even in england  only r p is spoken only south of london  there are other dialects like uh uh scottish dialect or welsh dialect or other dialects which are not standard dialects of english  like that in india also uh the english is influenced by  indian languages  every indian who speaks english is influenced is by by his mother tongue  and there is a telugu english there is a tamilian english  there is a punjabi english there is a hindi english like that various dialects are there  for these things we had to bring out a standard a standard to understand each other and a standard which can be useful to have a  to systemize the this international language  english is essential today in the modern world because english is spoken by the largest number of people in the world  english is spoken in america english is spoken in australia  new zealand canada and many other countries  i think nearly one third of the uh people of the world they are speaking in english english is adopted by even other countries who are   do not speak english because of its uh business  purposes and transport purposes and many other purposes  therefore english is essential today to the country probably the old classic classical and uh english is spoken in the colonies as pointed by rushdie in a better way than his own mother country  so english is international nobody can say that english is not wanted today  english is required for anybody to become international in communication  they therefore english is going to live in india even  uh against the wishes of many other people  and there are people in this country who're talking that english is to be replaced by hindi and regional languages  regional languages are to be studied as well as the national language is studied and at the same time we require an international language which will uh make us a part of the world  because the world is only a global village today  india cannot survive without english or a international language like english  and uh it is important for every country  therefore english will remain with us  and english is studied even in the central institute of english and foreign languages which has come into existence in nineteen fifty-eight  this institute was established when the government of india  in the education department and by the british council as well as the ford foundation  and it was established with a specific purpose to improve  the language content of the en english    and english literature is taught by all universities in their department of english literature  but language was not studied  there is a controversy whether english language is to be learnt through literature or literature is to be learnt through  english language  both are important they are the two co uh sides of the same coin  and one can learn good english and by that he can learn good literature  or if one is a constant reader of literature one may acquire  unconsciously good english  but english has many other aspects  it has its spoken aspect  one should be conscious of the pronunciation  and if a indian goes and talks in united states of india united states of america one may not understand what he is speaking because his english contains wrong stresses  and wrong tone probably people will not understand him  therefore it is essential to standardize what we speak  and the institute of central institute of english and foreign languages makes a good effort it at it it has a language lab it has various other facilities  through which it wants to improve the standard of of english  spoken by every segment of the people of india  therefore number of people after their m a or postgraduation in english language or education or some other subject  they come to the central institute of english for studying english language  we have different courses here and uh we have e l t  methodology  we have a language laboratory and the department of spoken english and uh phonetics we have other departments also  these departments during a course of one year they give a systematic training in studying english language  and uh this is helpful for most of the teachers who come here  to learn english because when they go back they can teach better english to their students  it will have a percolative effect because these teachers who are trained they can teach better when they go back to the schools or colleges  and the students are to be taught young because their pronunciation if it is influenced by a trained teacher in english at the central institute of english he will be a better speaker and an effective speaker  communication with proper pronunciation is important to understand each other  therefore english spoken english particularly is important  at the regional level at the national level as well as international level  and english is given the importance in our education system  as a matter of fact most of the publications in india are in english uh every year we're publishing nearly eighteen thousand books in india  out of eighteen thousand nearly eight thousand to nine thousand books are in english and whereas the remaining are published in the regional languages or uh vernacular languages of india  so the publication not only in the case of books even in the case of newspaper most of the important newspapers are in english  newpapers like times of india the hindu  and uh they are very effective communication media most of  the circulation of these two papers are very large  people throughout india they read these newspapers and uh  the english is the lingua franca today in india effective connector between various states who speaks various languages  therefore english is uh unlikely to go from this country  and english will remain for a long time to come  uhm so the the english has uh uh in english is  part of the national life and uh throughout education the students in the schools and colleges they read it but mostly the english is an effective medium only from the college level after school leaving  therefore the english if it is introduced even at uh  at class three year class four that will be more effective and uh a bilingual child or a multilingual child is more intelligent  and the language can be learnt only at the in  childhood  and instead of forcing english at a later stage of life  which will be difficult and as a child will pick up a  languages easier and quicker  therefore english would be introduced at a uh the school level rather than at uh college level  and uh english is also important to get jobs and people with more education they want to go outside their country  if india like i india which has  large population if it wants to export its educated people   to other countr to other countries like singapore or saudi arabia or u s a english is essential  even in the case of the professional uh educated people like engineers or doctors if they want to go abroad they require english language  and uh without english one at one cannot go outside india and even if he goes outside he will find number of difficulties  and uh professionally also if one wants to be up-to- date  he should know and he should read english books books which are coming in english  and most of the uh knowledge which is created throughout  the world somehow or other by translation or by uh recreation it is coming into english language books which are published on large scale in england america australia hongkong and other places therefore through the english language books only you come to know what is happening outside our own country and uh they through them the research is developed  research is one of the important activity for any country  because without research it is you cannot uh develop and uh the development for the development of a country you require information latest technology latest knowledge  knowledge is a resource today  now without knowledge you cannot have anything  it can be other resources  you can have a resource of one word you can have a  coal resources you can have petroleum resources  but knowledge resource is very important knowledge is power uh even you take a small country like japan which is only as big as an andhra pradesh but it is today on the top of the world it is because of the technology which they learn through english language  and even england which is not bigger than one state of our country and england ruled the world for a long time and there was a saying that sun sun never set on the british empire  how did uh the small countries small isles like british isles could rule such a vast world ? it is because of the latest innovations that have taken place  in their country and these are essential if you have come to know about  the developments in science it has it was only possible by reading  english language books  we have come to know about newton's theory of gravity and even einstein's theory of relativity all these things helped us helped our science  and particularly in science and technology most of the books are in english and they are not in vernacular languages  the defect is the international terminology is in english  and it is a standardised terminology it is not possible to have the translations of the same terminology in our vernacular languages  the our languages have haven't developed that much 
back to our i s l m model that we had discontinued  last week  and uh a continuation part of it is the second set of the market and that was the monitary sector equilibrium  and when we come to this already we have seen how the real sector reaches to its equilibrium position and the result of which is the i s curve   we've drawn the i s curve also  now here we come to this l m curve  the equilibrium in the monetary sector would ultimately give diagramatically the l m curve  and why l m as we know well l is liquidity m is money now following almost the same pattern of explanation as we did in case of i s curve we can very well present this whole thing  but initially the proposition is that the monitary sector equilibrium is reached at the rate of interest at which  money supply equals money demand  a very simple kind of an identity you can take into account here  its a situation wherein money supply would be equal to  money demand  so this equality between money supply and money demand is the condition of equilibrium here  to put briefly then m s h to indicate supply of money  is equal to m d small letter of capital letter and this we say is the condition of equilibrium  and this will be our first equation  first equation very simple thing  and now you will find that the rest of this analysis when we progress would be by and large within the keyntian  framework  almost much closer to your explanation of tension liquidity preference theory of interest  much of that is adopted here  so the matters become quite simple for us  for example as we did last time left side right hand side  now what determines the money supply ? we have already given an answer to this when we discussed tension theory  what determines the money supply ? the state of reputation   it's the monetary who determines the monetary authority  so money supply is determined by the monetary authority   b b writing  and it is because of this we will not be able to get any equation so far as money supply is concerned because there is  no set formula for determining money supply at a time  that is just on the basis of the needs of the time that the monetary authority goes on contracting or expanding the money supply one side is open  and therefore now for the rest of the thing every emphasis will be placed on the demand side  now when you come to the demand side of money this demand is determined by b b writing by the tension method  three motives three motives haan   we'll put in general say by the three motives b b writing  which govern liquiditive preference  and we follow this particular line cough uh when you say after three motives we group together say in general say transactions and precautionary motives  now when you come to the transactions and precautionary motive  say broadly they will be calling it as transactions motive  both are combined together  now when you take into consideration this one this transactions motive that is liquidity preference for transaction motive  depends on  level of  level of income level of income b b writing  it depends on level of income  now in tension language this transactions demand for  money is indicated by the term m y  level of income is y  therefore if you would like to put this by way of impression  means say m-one is a function of income  m-one is a function of income  now this is second equation that you are able to get  so one part of the total money demand is taken care of  then you come to the second part of it and that is what comes now ? speculate speculative demand  now speculative demand for money b b writing this depends on ? rate of interest  correct it depends on rate of interest  and therefore you want of this speculative demand is described as m-two  the notation m-two has been used by kens and therefore we put in that m-two is a function of you can use any notation to indicate function f or k anything is a function of r that is the third impression  what we are doing here is just using the tension model of liquidity preference  and it's mostly that which hicks and henson have used  in order to give us the monetary sector equilibrium  now given this two things equations two and three now  what we know that m d that demand is equal to m-one plus m-two b b writing  this is what we know  if that is so given this therefore we can say to put this in equilibrium one or this condition of equilibrium  so we can say then that substituting b b writing  in substituting two and three in equation one  this and this we would be substituting in equation one  therefore we say money supply is equal to let us initially put m money demand just derivation every step i would like to put before you and m d is uhm one plus m-two  and we know that m-one is a function of y  so instead of m-one if you put in or substitute f y  its a function of y that is income  and n place of m-two put k r its function of rate of interest so this you're able to get ultimately that money supply is equa function of y plus a function of rate of interest  this becomes your equation number four  as we derived fourth equation in case of the real sector equilibrium  and once you come this this is the equation of l m curve b b writing  this is the equation of l m curve  so in a simple way we have derived these four equations  just see the stage by which we have progressed  we began with the fact that the equilibrium in the money market or money sector would be establishd at the rate of interest at which  money supply is equal to money demand  money supply is determined by the monetary authority at any given time  money demand is determined by liquidity preference  so you will find here the l comes here and the m comes on the other side  the right hand side of this equation is all liquidity feature the left hand side is the money feature  and therefore liquidity money they are the two dimensions which are used  in case of liquidity the transactions demand for money  m-one is determined by income level  so m-one is a function of y income  whereas the speculative demand for money m-two depends on r  rate of interest  and therefore m-two is a function of r  naturally substitute these two in one and ultimately you have come to this part  so as i said the left part denotes m money supply  the right part determines l the liquidity preference  and therefore this is an equation of liquidity and money  in graphical terms it is described as l m curve liquidity money curve  so again you find that this part is so easy to present  because it is nothing but a repetition of tension presentation by and large  what you teach in the tensus liquidity preference theory  the same part is used we've put in terms of four equations  now once we have done this basic exercise then we go to draw  the diagram  and since there are four equations by which we are putting this  we again follow the four diagraphic chart for coming to the l m curve  and therefore in this case again i'll suggest you to take a full page for the diagram  the four diagrams we will be drawing side by side  as usual we take up one two three four in an  anti-clock fashion  and the direction would be the same as we have now notice  you start from diagram one reach to diagram two then come to diagram three and from three you come downwards to diagram four  now to begin with in case of uh the first diagram  we begin with the speculative demand for money m-two  the first diagram begins with m-two  so on x-axis you measure m-two which means speculative demand for money b b writing  and then on y-axis what would come ? rate of interest rate of interest r would be there  now we would follow the same technique as we did last time taking numerical scales because the matters become very simple for our understanding b b writing  just the usual figures perhaps i've taken  now again the second stage that we follow is to have the vertical and horizontal faint lines  so that the graph sheet would be ready  and we know here the relationship between the speculative demand for money and the rate of interest  is it positive or negative ? negative  negative negative  so m-two is negative function of the rate of interest  that is what we note in this case also  if at all you can add this particular no e it is l negative function m-two is a negative function of r the rate of interest  they have a negative relationship  so naturally as usual you find if the rate of interest is suppose eight percent quite high the speculative demand can be just hundred  a quite low demand for speculative purposes  if it comes down to seven percent the speculative demand will go up to two hundred  you move to the right on x-axis as you come down on y-axis lower the rate of interest more the demand for speculative purpose  so rate of interest if it comes down to six percent you have demand three hundred  if it comes to five percent demand is four hundred  and if it comes to four percent say demand is five percent and we join these points get a curve  now this curve can be described as a curve for m-two  m- two curve and if you wish to write here the demand functions speculative demand function m-two is a function of rate of interest  so you have taken care of equation number three here that is represented well  now from there you pass on to equation number uh the diagram number two  and as you know that the usual way of drawing that whatever is presented on x-axis in diagram number one will be repeated on x-axis in diagram number two  and therefore in this diagram you will have m-two represented on x-axis  so let's first have the scale of m-two  transfered to this b b writing  and let's have the vertical lines drawn  so here you have the speculative demand or money   b b writing transfered here  now this second diagram will take care of the equality identity money supply equal to money demand  but this identity will represent not simply by saying  money supply equal to money demand but that we would be taking with the help of one which was here money demand was is equal to  m-one plus m-two  and that part we will be taking money demand equal to m-one  plus m-two  and here we assume its certain total money demand which means money supply it equals money supply  suppose here we assume that money demand which means money supply also is five hundred crores of  rupees  if we presume this then this graph what would come on the vertical part of this diagram ?  it's n  no  you have to concentrate only on that equation  if on x-axis you are able and you have taken speculative demand for money that is m-two what would come ? rate of interest rate of interest  where comes the rate of interest in this equation ?  one word  its two words   laughs  this has to be understood correctly and properly because  this can be an accidence for for any any person while drawing the diagram  other things would follow very automatically  interruptions laughs  no income business should be there no rate of interest should be there  supply of money is equal to demand for money and demand for money is broken into two parts m-one plus m-two  if one axis takes care of m-two the other axis must take care of ? m-one  m-one laughs  see how it comes i'll explain to you  but let us put this and have the diagram ready for drawing this one  say m-one which represents now you are coming to equation number two which is an equation of m-one uhm and you are bringing in m-one plus m-two both together  which make up the demand for money and which is equal to supply of money  so that identity can be represented this way  let us first go for this scale  we follow the same numbers here easy way to put in  you can use any numbers b b writing  but normally i presume in all classes that the students know number upto ten maximum one to ten  so that very easy to go with single digits if at all a class like yours is there i presume that you know numbers upto hundred  uh because calculations orally become very easy the whole thing is that what figures you take do not matter what this hundred means it can be hundred rupees  it can be hundred crore of rupees  hundred million of rupees whatever you can put into bracket  so how much amount you put in it is immaterial that  so let us have the horizontal line to get the points corresponding to x and y axis  now let us see how this comes into  we have presumed that total demand for money is five hundred  and this total demand for money is m-one plus m-two  now given this m d equal to five hundred if i give you  an amount equal to m-two i think you can do some subtraction  and find out the value of m-one  now let us go this way that given that if m-two is hundred what will be m-one ? four hundred four hundred you know subtraction very well  then sub herein comes the first point that both together will make up five hundred rupees  so m-two is hundred and therefore remaining is m-one is four hundred  the transactions demand for money 
indian food is often spoken of as rich which is to say fatty  and spicy meaning chilli hot  nothing should be farther from the truth  it is unfortunate that the excessive use of desi ghee  which is clarified butter or vegetable shortening and spices  by a handful of half baked cook made as a misunderstood food  our food is rich but not fatty  it is true that we sometimes cook in a little more fat than necessary  but the amazing thing about indian cuisine is that the cooking is deemed complete when the fat leaves the sides or comes on the surface  in other words the ingredients expose all fat when fully cooked  the excess fat merely uses the cooking process  in any event it is supposed to be drained off before the dish is served  in fact the drained fat which we call rogan   can be reused and makes a better fat medium because the flavour and aroma of spices acquired during the cooking of the dish  of course the rogan cannot be used again and again but just once again which is not to say that this series is even for one solitary moment recommending that to use a gram or a mililitre of extra fat  the same applies for that nasty word spicy  the fact is our food is spicy not chilli hot  we make use of our exotic spices for their special flavour and aroma  the use of red chilli on the other hand is at one's  own discreation like to burn yourself do so don't want to  don't burn others as well  there are however some regions which are using more red chillies than the others  they are the exceptions rather than the rule  having said that this episode is guarantee to give lovers of hot food a vicarious thrill  those with feeble guts i advice to stay away from today's  fiery delight cough  hey manjit what's this pungent nose testing aroma ? what you are smelling is red chillies  and believe it or not we are going to use sixty-four red chillies with two and a quarter pound of meat  he is going to make us the spice chop called lal maas  translated that means red meat  one of the kinds you and i know about  the red here refers to this red chillies  and he is going to use sixty of them mind boggling figure  of course this is arguably the hottest dish in the land as you can see this guy is just about ready to burn my in all you if you have steel- line stomach this is just a delicacy for you  whatever my fears about red chillies i've got a health mandate and get into my dig  welcome to this dawat the first dish in today's  menu is lal maas or red meat  pieces of succulant lamb in a volcanic gravy  a dish guaranteed to wake up your insights   we'll begin with a list of ingredients  two and a quarter pounds or one kilo of lamb deboned and cut it into one and a half inch cubes  sixty red chillies  one and a quarter cups finely sliced onions  one third cup peeled and sliced garlic  one cup yoghurt  one teaspoon roasted cumin  four teaspoons corriander powder  half a teaspoon turmeric powder  five tablespoons refined oil  the preparation time for this dish is one hour and the cooking time is fifty minutes  with accompaniments this dish serves approximately four people the method  remove stems from the red chillies slit them beseed and soak sixty whole red chillies in a bowl of water for fifteen minutes  before you get alarmed at the quantity of red chillies used  here is a reassuring word about red chillies  while manjeet prepares the other ingredients let me clear some cobwebs about red chillies  for a long time especially outside this country the word spicy has been synonymous with chillies  to us indians the word spicy means a combination of exotic spices of which chilli is just one measly part  eaten in the right quantity and the prescribed limit is one teaspoon or two or three whole red chillies per person per day  chillies are said to prevent cold cold sweats induced by tension and cholera  now in the last thing it is important to consume a little bit of chilli during the monsoon  proceeding with the preparation whisk one cup of yoghurt in a bowl  add the red chillies shake a dry girdle and add one teaspoonful of cumin seeds  roast lightly noise of roasting until the cumin pops and emits a unique aroma  now add this to the yoghurt chilli mixture noise of stirring  add four teaspoons of corriander powder half teaspoon turmeric powder and stir in salt to taste  whisk and set  some of the effects of the red chillies are also neutralised by the garlic and yoghurt in this recipe  without yoghurt it would probably be impossible to digest all those red hot chillies  and now for the cooking  heat five tablespoons of refined oil add the sliced garlic and set over a medium heat until golden noise of stirring  add the onions and stir again until golden brown nise of stirring  finally add the meat and stir fry until the fat begins to leave the sides of the pan  this process is also called pruno and takes approximately five to six minutes  now add the chilli yoghurt mixture and stir fry until the moisture evaporates noise of stirring  to complete the cooking add three and one third cups of water bring to a boil cover and simmer stir occasionally until the meat is cooked  to check if the meat is done take out a piece and break it apart  the gravy should boil till it has the consistency of a thick sauce check the salt and the fiery red meat is done  but this is best eaten with the steamed rice or chapati   arrange chopped tomatoes and onions in a platter and spoon on the sizzling lal maas  the second dish on our menu today is pepper chicken or mori curry  chicken with a totally unique flavour salty chicken taste buds pepper chicken is from the chickena district in tamil nad  which is home to the trading community of chickenna  they however call it murgakoli chickenna  in it they use an inordinately large quantity of coarsely ground black pepper powder  i can see manjeet is getting a bit little impatient  and i'll tell you a little bit more about the pepper  later in this programme  if you are ready with your stationery here is a list of ingredients  twelve chicken thighs seven corns cardamoms five cloves  two sticks of cinnamon one inch each a quarter teaspoon fenugreek seeds one and half cups of finely chopped onions two teaspoons ginger paste two teaspoons garlic paste two tablespoons corriander powder two teaspoons chilli powder six medium sized tomatoes beseeded and diced three table spoons coconut paste three fourth cups of corriander leaves five tablespoons of freshly ground pepper corns salt to taste and refined oil for cooking  the preparation time for this dish is thirty-five minutes and the cooking time forty minutes  with accompaniments this dish serves about four people  for the marinade in a bowl add thirty spoons of crushed pepper corns and salt to taste  to this add four tablespoons of oil stir to mix  stirring  rub the chicken thighs individually in the marinade and set aside for thirty minutes  and now on to the cooking  heat six tablespoons of refined oil in a pan add the marinated chicken pieces one at a time  set a evenly to feel in flavour and juices  reduce to low heat and remove  add more oil if required and in the same pan add five green cardamoms five cloves few sticks of cinnamon and a quarter teaspoon fenugreek seeds  stir until golden and add the onions saute until golden brown  add two tablespoons each of ginger and garlic paste  and stir fry for a few minutes stirring  add two tablespoons of corriander powder and two teaspoons of red chilli powder  stir stirring  add the tomatoes and saute it for a few minutes  finally add a quarter cup of water and stir some more  when the fat begins to leave the sides add two teaspoons of freshly ground pepper corns  stir lightly and add the coconut paste  cook this mixture for two to four minutes  now add the chicken and salt to taste  add water  reduce the heat cover and simmer until the chicken is tender  this will take approximately ten to twelve minutes  while we wait for the chicken to cook a brief word about black pepper talking about chetinad it is inevitable that i should tell you about pepper  foremost pepper is said to cure and prevent asthma  taken with honey it is said to give relief in heavy cold  it is good for the heart and is said to ease stomach aches  and cure piles  sprinkled on fruits or other foods along with salt sea or rock it is supposed to make for an excellent digestive  to serve make a bed of the gravy  arrange pieces of chicken and garnish with fresh corriander  and more fresh ground pepper  in fact celebrity panel does not feel rich tonight with the  lal maas black will definitely be the other colour scheme interuption  let us proceed to the dining table while our guest try out this coveted dishes  you know what we are eating is murgakoli  chikenna when translated what that means is pepper chicken  i thought they ate really spicy food  uh it is spicy but it is slightly fried means a little oil to go head off you know he makes the second dish for that laughs  fifteen chicken pieces for this chicken and what pieces are these ? yeah this chicken we have used the uh thigh of the chicken  so that you have the consistency uh is there in the base  i thought it is the same and that every every person gets the same part that is important uhm actually we have gone a step beyond uh uhm and what we are talking about now is dinapsychology  uh and the objective here is to make sure that everybody is cut off meat or the the shape of the vegetable is identical so that when you peep into somebody else's plate you don't have this terrible sense of envy as if you know uh say arti has the better piece and romi hasn't got the one that she like  so we just make sure that everyboby is dining pleasurely equal by providing an identical cut all are being identical size of vegetables but this what about one word may be a particular guest would prefer to have another piece romi it's not as if we sort of you know done this at random but we have consulted our butchers any how our butchery uh  in indian cooking is a very very strong point without that you really can't uh provide any good uh delicacies so we consulted our butcher and as per his advice decided for example the case of the murgakoli chickenna but the ideal stuff would be the thigh  may be manjeet can tell us a little bit more about it yes its your own choice also and uh whether it may be that must need one dine whether you use dine from the thigh or the one word  i see that means originally from the chickenna if they have a specific piece or this you feel is inferior in now well this uh they feel that one one word of the meat should to be used in a particular curry  originally i've got some chicken of it used  that's to as a matter of fact if i may say i am looking a bit you know in the south in considering the one word as a major brahminical influence and consequently you will uh notice that when you go down south that uh the pieces of meat are usually cut into very small  sizes  and they are really nugget size pieces  but they originally do it for snacks you they will know only use of this size normally it can be looked this size 
it is commonly believed that the only way to cook kabab  is in a tandoor or on a grill  nothing could be farther from the truth  there are several ways to cook kabab and there are many kabab which can be cooked in several ways  to cite an example the tikka of kid or lamb can be roasted in the tandoor cooked on a grilled  shallow fried on a girdle or in the rajastani style cooked in a  hundi or pot  there is another fine example where tikka or fish  or can be grilled in the tandoor or as in the case of uh amritsari machali deep fried in a kadhai  which is a one word of worth  moreover let me assure you that kabab cooked on grills with those and in kadhai are as popular as those roasted in the tandoor  yet it is the tandoori kabab especially  tandoori chicken which helped indian cuisine build its international reputation  based upon the success indian masters not only gave a gastronomic accent to the rustic kabab but created delicacies so sublime and subtle that they expand best selling restaurants which made curry places curry houses look ordinary in comparison at least as far as the bottom line was concerned  hi manjeet why so smug ? hi jack not smug but satisfied  whenever i think of kabab i look upon a time  when there was nothing for vegetarian and today today it has much more to offer welcome to this dawat   today's exquisite recipe has been especially selected for  kabab lovers  for those of you who enjoy grilled and fried food we have the most savoury kababs made from cottage cheese and spinach for the vegetarians and prawns and minced meat for the non- vegetarians   we'll begin with the prawn kababs or  tandoori zhinga  if you are ready with the pen and paper coming up are a list of ingredients  twelve shelled cleaned and washed a grade prawns  for the first marinade you need three tablespoons of ginger paste three tablespoons of garlic paste three tablespoons of lemon juice and salt to taste  for the second marinade you need one cup of yoghurt a quarter cup fresh cream two tablespoons of gram flour one and a half teaspoons ajawain one teaspoon white pepper powder  a quarter teaspoon clove powder  for the garnish you need tomatoes carrots and cucumber  onion rings papadam and lemon  for cooking you need a few tablespoons of butter  the preparation time for this dish is thirty minutes the cooking time is fifteen minutes  and with the accompanied salad it serves approximately four people for the first marination shell clean twelve  a grade prawns  in a bowl add three tablespoons ginger paste three tablespoons garlic paste three

second marinade  in a bowl put one cup of yoghurt add a quarter cup of cream and whisk  to this add two tablespoons of gram flour half teaspoon  ajwain one teaspoon white pepper powder clove powder and mix again stirring  now remove the prawn pieces from the first marinade sqeeze and transfer to the second marinade  sprinkle more salt to taste rub down in the marinade to insure that they are evenly coated  cover and refrigerate for two hours  remove the marinated prawns from the refrigerator and skewer about three together over lapping  keep the tray under the grill to collect the spill overs  now grill the prawns in the oven turning them frequently until they are golden brown  remove from the oven and paste with butter  return the rack to the oven and cook for two more minutes  to serve remove the prawns from the skewer arrange fresh tomatoes onion rings a lemon ridge and papadam  squeeze lemon on the prawns before serving  for the spinached kababs here are a list of ingredients  two and a quarter pounds or one kilograms fresh spinach one and a quarter cups chana dal or bengal gram lentil a few cardamoms a few cloves cinnamon and salt  for the filling you need

potato strolls and lemon  for the cooking you need oil for shallow frying and butter for pasting  the preparation time for this dish is forty-five minutes  the cooking time ten minutes  and with the salad it serves approximately four people  clean two and a quarter pounds of spinach in fresh water  drain  keep a pan of water add spinach leaves and blanch for five minutes  remove and refresh in cold water and drain  take one and half cups of bengal gram lentil  soak bengal gram lentil in a pan of water for approximately thirty minutes  for the spinach kababs we need only one and a quarter cups of the lentil  the remaining quarter cup will be reserved for the  shikenpuri kababs mentioned later in the show  after thirty minutes remove one and a quarter cups of the lentil and transfer to a pan  add eight cloves one stick of cinnamon five cardamoms  salt to taste four and a half cups of water  bring to a boil over medium heat  as soon as it begins to boil reduce the heat cover and simmer for approximately twenty-five minutes or until the lentils are well cooked  remove from the fire and cool  let us move to take the spinach by putting it through a mincer when cool  to prepare the filling grate half cup of cottage cheese  to this add half teaspoon cumin seeds a quarter teaspoon freshly ground pepper mix well and set aside  prepare the walnuts by cutting them into quarters  when cool make a smooth paste of the lentils by putting them through a mincer or blender  heat one tablespoon of oil in a frying pan add the spinach paste and stir fry over medium heat  now add half teaspoon red chilli powder half teaspoon cumin powder quarter teaspoon black pepper powder quarter teaspoon green cardamom powder quarter teaspoon maize powder a pinch of clove powder and salt to taste  reduce to low heat and stir fry until the water evaporates  now add the lentil paste and stir until the two pastes blend together and the moisture is absorbed  remove and cool  when the mixture is cooled divide it into twelve equal portions and shape into balls  flatten each ball place a portion of the filling in the centre  top with the quartered walnut seam and reshape into a flat patty when all the patties are ready refrigerate for twenty to twenty-five minutes  to cook the kababs heat a little oil on a girdle place a few kababs on the hot oil and shallow fry over medium heat until golden brown  slip over and brown the other side  now paste with butter and cook once again until a darker brown crust appears  to serve arrange a salad on a dinner plate add the kababs  and serve with a lemon ridge in fried straw potatoes  for the yoghurt stuff minced kababs or  shiken puri kababs you need one pound minced kid or spring lamb a quarter cup bengal gram dal ten cloves of garlic one teaspoon cumin seeds five pods of green cardamom  two sticks of cinnamon five cloves one teaspoon turmeric one teaspoon red chilli powder and salt  for the filling you need three tablespoons of yoghurt cheese  a few onions a bunch of mint four green chillies and salt for cooking we need oil for shallow frying and butter for pasting  for the garnish we need fresh salad lemon and green chillies  the preparation time for this dish is one hour  the cooking time is ten minutes  and with the salad it serves approximately four people  put one pound of mint in a pan add a quarter cup of soaked and drained bengal gram lentil add ten cloves of garlic one teaspoon cumin seeds five pods of green cardamom two sticks of cinnamon  five cloves one teaspoon turmeric powder one teaspoon red chilli powder salt two tablespoons of oil and one and half cups of water  mix and bring to a boil over medium heat  reduce to low heat cover and simmer until the lentil soften  and the water is absorbed  stir occasionally to prevent burning stirring  remove and cool  when the lentil minced mixture has cooled mince in a food processor or mixer  remove to a plate and knead to mix thoroughly  divide this mixture into twelve equal portions and shape into balls to prepare the filling chop two tablespoons of onions to this add two tablespoons of coarsely chopped mint  in a bowl mix these ingredients with three tablespoons of yoghurt cheese  add four seeded and finely chopped green chillies salt to taste and mix well  flatten each portion of the lentil minced mixture spoon in a portion of the filling fill and reshape into a patty  when all the patties are ready refrigerate for twenty to twenty-five minutes  on a girdle heat a few tablespoons of oil add the minced patties and shallow

marinade on the coated cheese cubes  cover and refrigerate for ninety minutes  to cook preheat the oven to two seventy-five degrees  remove the kababs from the marinade skewer about four cubes placing them an inch apart on a skewer place a tray underneath to collect the drippings  now put the kabab rack in the oven under a grill  and cook until golden brown  turn the kababs occasionally to make sure that they are evenly grilled  when the kababs are done remove them from the oven and deskewer the cubes  to serve arrange salad vegetables on a plate put four  kababs add papadams and brush the cottage cheese with butter before serving  come join our guests and enjoy these exotic spicy delights  that stimulate your appetite and pamper your palate 
 it's moving   it's moving okay  okay now cough this is the d s p sonograph  and this has a lot of hardware inside and also in it's rom there is software  so the several commands we feed in it takes in and processes or do  done through this software which is built-in in it  and it's a special special purpose you can say  it's a special purpose computer  then this is the monitor it's of two fifty-six colour shade monitor  you can see the i have to get the uh mike on mike microphone is on uh what's his name ? last man now who is the last man ? uh anupam   anupam's table is there in a in a in a package you can pick it up  uh uh hello  uhm this is a very sensitive uhm uh monitor it can give you two hundred and fifty-six grades of colour  compared with a v g e monitor which you see usually a good monitor which gives you four shades  we get uh nice uh this thing and it's a flat screen too  it's not protruding this way it's a flat screen  monitor  and this also could also be connected to a computer right now laughs these guys are trying and not able to succeed that's another problem they have  you can operate certain things from the computer  yeah  uhm there are we should look at this all the controls are at the front panel  there are some controls at the back panel but they have to be  used very rarely for a initial setting sense on  output there are certain outputs that could be taken from the back panel  here you have this this is the input section and this is the output section  you input speech or any sound you can also get the output of the sound  usually it is if you don't mute it the output comes through the speakers which are connected at the back  you can also listen through a headphone here  the inputting is done you have two channels you can choose two channels channel one and channel two  yeah  and then first do the recording  when you are recording through a microphone you have to insert this into the microphone here  this this is channel one this is channel two  this is for microphone and this is for auxilary that is tape recorder and such purpose  it will be higher voltage input  and similarly the other two cough  you also select your input level it is at thirty degree which is a comfortable input level  you can also increase it to seventy seventy is the maximum  and it becomes you can see that it is getting over loaded  see even it's picking up from here  hello hello hello   that's too much actually  so we go down to thirty  now it's not so sensitive  let me get out of that actually that takes time to display yeah hello  this is the convention spectrogram that has bottom of the layer  and the top one is a it's in a wave form  so you can input it here from here either through microphone or through the auxiliary input  and then okay for inputting you have to do record you have to be in record mode  once you press this one this is a very sacred button  if you press anything here whatever is recored gets erased as there is this it's a circular buffer is there continously records and erases  as it proceeds it goes in a circle  so once i press this it's now recording  recording is going on recording is going on right now whatever  i'm saying is going inside and it is being kept inside  now to stop it and to preserve that signal i have to press this knob  and then always that enhance is necessary comes you just press this button e it will do the enhancement on its own  now the settings have been changed let me come back   go back to my settings cough   hello yeah i have increased the input level here to forty degree you can see the difference in the the way the amplitude is getting displayed there  now when i decrease it to thirty you will see that it becomes less  and twenty still less  okay forty forty is quite comfortable in fact uh sometimes it becomes a bit loud  what we can get here is a continous spect  right now what we have chosen a spectrogram at the bottom  screen and the wave form at the top screen  so let's say something like akka   in fact there is a clipping here this kind of straight line means there is too much space means too loud that clipping is going on  that clipping is going on which should be avoided  clipping means it's it's it's called overloading  overloading  you can see that it's it's clipping here too  so we should not be too close there  so akka akka this is quite comfortable cough  uh just if you take this signal akka  here you can you can get a few points in this i mean the interesting points you can see there  one thing is you can see it is something like i produce something like a sentence a declarative sentence with a pitch falling  you see the pulses are going down becoming separated here and here too the distance between pulse to pulse is becoming more and more  that means your pulses in in a in a given period of time so the pitch is less  and we can do many many things with this signal here   let's put some cursors now this this brings cursors in and out okay  so the cursors give you the facility to measure let me shift them now they are on the lower screen the red cursor i'll shift them to a shift it to the upper screen now there you see a red cursor but that's not one cursor there is a green cursor behind it  just we are moving this moves the cursors  by moving it okay you get the both the cursors separated the reading at the red cursor is three point six five something reading of the green one is three point five the  dif the difference is point one three  yeah okay point one three so this duration between these two cursors has come out as point one three four one three four four seconds  we can use this kind of information  let me expand this very form but as it's in two contract form so i can go back to time access okay and select the time access and the upper screen this is my upper screen i activate that small knob there and make it expanded and it's  enhanced now  yeah it will rewrite  redraw that i unselect i unselect still this we have to enhance  so i say enhanced it has enhanced it has redrawn in an expanded way okay  what i can do is i can precisely measure the length of the closure the length of the closure of k in akka   okay now this store business is that it makes the cursors  where it converts the red and green to green and red  it has the only the red cursor moves the green cursor does not move so if i want to move this cursor i have to have it in red colour  if i want to move this first i have to make it red then i can move it  or if i want to move back convert into red and then move it okay now roughly that is the time taken for the k to that is the maintaining that's it due that's the closure period of the k in akka  that is point one nine second roughly point two seconds  okay  point two seconds cough  so immediately you can get the measurement of the durations i want to measure the duration of this aa  as opposed this aa   that's very easy point one point one seconds and then somewhere roughly there and somewhere roughly there it's point point one four seconds that was hundred milli-seconds and this is hundred and forty-seven milli-seconds  okay   let's take a word two words in marathi  see what is the difference between the so called  shwa vowel there kara kar karto  kar karto  this is a kar tu kar  means you do the work imperative form of kar    and it is phonetically shwa   it's not a long shwaa it's  a shwa  uhn let's look at it's length point one eight point one eight four six  this is aa of   kar  this is a this is k is here you can't see k this a  simply a okay  in fact you can hear that you can choose a particular portion here how it sounds or indeed the head phones otherwise it will disturb everybody and you know if you go on playing that  and then this is karto me kaam karto  let's say  now this is the now this is the k closure   a a ki closure o fading away fading out  now here remember that was point one eight four seconds  okay kar a this guy is point zero seven okay almost half  so this way immediate measurement you can get and if you have let us say hundred or hundred two hundred samples just transfer them one by one  there is a you can have a large uh buffer also and you can choose the buffer size and measure them  now sometimes you have a doubt about where a particular segment started and where a seg segment  stopped let's say ended  we have both systems  let me realign them  okay this is the kar   you can see this this is spectogram of the same thing i gave the same signal in both the screens this is the wave form and this is the sound spectogram cough  sound spectogram is a is a two dimensional thing  and here you can see the formants that means change in colour  you see the f one f two f three f four and each vertical slash let me explain this you will see this  okay now it's clear you can see the slash one after another corresponding to this pulses each slashes is one lot of pulse  you can make it even even uh more a  now let's watch how the how the pulses look like look at each pulse each pulse  yeah  each pulse  so it is like that  then uh we come back go back to   the original earlier one  you can see the formant transition this is the   aa and going higher going into   ra  this is falling down to ra   as ra has that s two rise s two fall kind of thing  uhn so those make you about what is a formant i'll just immediately show you what it is let me invoke another module   it's a rerecorded the signal is a bit loud here  now cough because of this  yeah   i'll rerecord this signal  take the let's take the vowel e  vowel e has the first spectral peak  at around two hundred fifty hertz  second spectral peek should be around two thousands hertz  so this is the usual configuration   let's see how it looks like   ee ee okay  oh that's just a minute   ee ee   that's good  this is an expanded we can see each uh each pitch pulse  each has a pulse here  and then the information uh of that you can pick up one glottal pulse  okay it's a bit loud here and see it's  you can actually get the measurements of the what we call f one conventionally call f one that is the first spectral peak  and the second spectral peak you know here it may be difficult for you to follow let me change the colour  okay okay this the spectral peak first spectral peak  and you can see the central point there and it is two forty hertz  that's the standard text book you saw two fifty hertz is the first spectral peak of the e  first form of the f one is at two fifty hertz  this is spectrum spectrum after you know you do this enhance for your analyses you get the spectrum  then the second spectral peak is is here you can see it visually  this guy that is the second formant which will correspond this peak you know both of them are moving in the similar they are moving together both the cursors this two three six zero  this is again a text book case okay  if you look at ledger if you remember ledger of this chart of f one f two f three  and this third one has got a split there actually third and fourth are bit  oh  third and fourth is a are bit merged  i don't know i i think it shift aside yeah  ah this is a better one yeah  let me clear this uh let me clear this guy yeah  now here see that the fourth spectral peak is here  now there is the fourth formant  so first form and second third fourth first second third fourth okay  now let's go back to the second spectral peak here  remember it's two three two zero  let me produce a an aa and see what happens to that aa aa aa  yeah the f f three f two has come so low compared to  the this one it has come down to eight forty  so that f one f two f three f four the movement of these  you can see the each formant you can precisely measure not only by looking at this if you want much precise measurement you can do it by this spectrum  this is the spectrum of the signal at that red cursor  if you want spectrum of this signal over a period of time  you have another choice power between cursors   it's a power actually okay  now you need two cursors now power suppose i want to have an averaged spectrum of this i put the cursors there i simply press d it'll come there  so it's over a larger period  but you can even analyse pitch pulse by pulse here pulse by pulse you can analyse here  so ao characteristics of different vowels  could be analysed by looking at their formant characteristics 
so today's uh recipe is the punjabi dish we call alu ka parontha  it is one of uh the most favourite dishes can be used  to be eaten at breakfast or just at tea-time  it may be a little heavy for the ordinary people but i think  easy to make very tasty  uh the ingredients that we use are mainly potatoes wheat flour green corriander leaves salt chilli powder to your taste  and green chilli  take the potatoes boil them till they are absolutely soft peel the potatoes mash them add the other ingredients  that is green corriander leaves cut them absolutely fine  add the salt according to your taste some chilli powder and a little of ajwain  mix all these ingredients and prepare a ball of the mashed potatoes  now this is the stuffing that we use for the  parontha  regarding the wheat flour take enough quantity  for your guest take a little water and knead the flour by gradually adding the water to it  see be careful you know not to make the flour very soft the dough very soft nor very hard  it should be medium enough i mean easy enough to roll it out  make small balls of the potato stuffing and also small balls of the dough  roll out the dough into a little round shape  yes in the shape of a small puri  place the potato ball in the centre flatten it on the puri and now gradually cover it up with the dough it and it becomes into a flat little piece  now roll this whole piece again out by applying a little of the dry wheat flour and rolling it with the rolling pin  the shape should be absolutely round the movements should be smooth and equal so that the potato stuffing also moves equally within the dough  otherwise the edges will remain without the stuffing and they will be a little tasteless  once you have rolled it out properly into the shape of a  chapati you may put it on to a heated tawa  keep the gas at medium heat  when the first side of the chapati is ready you may turn it over let it cook for sometime  and now apply a little ghee or oil to the surface of the chapati  turn it over apply a little ghee to the other side  and now keep moving the chapati from side to side  till it turns a little golden brown  this is your alu ka parontha   i'm sure the aroma is coming  well serve it to your guest along with it see that you add a little of home butter or amul butter and then ask  your guest whether they enjoy it  of course a little of curds will add to the taste of the whole dish  this is alu ka parontha  in this way you can prepare many other paronthas  also  they may be with the help of raddish they may be with the help of onion and cheese cottage cheese or even with the help of green leafy vegetables like palak  in the same way you can as you have used potatoes you may use the raddish that is grate the raddish squeeze the water out  use the same ingredients and then stuff it into the dough  as far as onion and cheese is concerned you may grate the onion into the wheat flour as well as the cheese and then knead the dough  and the similar method is used for green leafy vegetables like  palak or methi  cut them finely wash them and knead them with the flour and you have a variety of paronthas either for tea or for breakfast  and one more  you have a dish called one word  yes there are many other dishes there is no uh paucity of dishes where the punjabis are concerned yes now these are the simplest ones you can have uh what is known as chole bhature which is a very famous  uh punjabi dish  one or two words  right chole have to be soaked that is they are white gram they have to be soaked overnight and uh  so that they rise up and become soft by morning  you may grate or in a mixer you may mash about four big  onions  fry these onions to a golden brown  similarly add the juice of say about four tomatoes to these onions after it has become golden brown  then you may add salt and uh chilli powder some of the spices which are also of course optional  and after you have added all these ingredients add tamarind water a cup of tamarind water  the chanas must be pre boiled and after all the ingredients have been cooked well there should be no smell of the onion remaining raw onion  you now add the chanas to the cooked  masala  add a little warm water and let the gravy remain as thick as you would like it that is your personal taste  regarding the bhaturas bhaturas are made out of maida or white flour  like chanas they have to be prepared the previous  night the arrangement has to be done the previous night  the white flour is kneaded only in curds preferably  sour curd  once it has been kneaded well and thick you don't have to make it soft you leave it overnight  and because of the sourness of the curds the flour rises up next day you make small balls of this flour roll them up with a rolling pin and you deep fry them in oil on medium heat these are what are known as bhaturas and with  the chanas they form the dish chole bhature   before serving them see that you cut fine rings of raw onion  long green chillies and a lots of fresh green corriander to serve with the dish  uhm anything more yes i do not know that punjabi dish and one or two words  about samosas and a few words   kachoris is from gujrat oh kachoris are uh uh chiefly marawari dish ahn yes samosas are prepared universally uh if you want in uh punjabi you'll have then  dahi balle dahi balle is another dish which is typically punjabi  like the dahi wada  yes similarly or if uh if we can say   raitas are something which is totally in uh punjabi  that is it is prepared with curds  ordinarily people prefer even in the south to have curds directly but punjabis would prefer to have curds with something in it prefer that so we have a variety of raitas  you you may set a bowl of milk in the night to become into curds  in the morning you may put it into the mixer rotate it  and then you add a little salt chilli cumin powder and a little of powdered black salt to it as digestive  then it depends on what you feel like eating that day which  raita you prefer  it may be potato raita it may be  cucumber raita it may be with corriander and chilli or what we know what is popularly known as kishmish ka raita  i think in english we will call kishmish  raisin raisin  yes it is raisin  now the difference between preparing of the other  raitas and raisin is that with raisin is that with raisin it is sweet and the other raitas are with salt and chilli  now when we prepare the one with raisin you take about uh half a cup of raisin you soak them into warm water and leave them for sometime so that they get soaked  you put about four spoons big spoons of sugar into the curds  rotate it well uh one fourth spoon of salt one fourth spoon of  garam masala that is all spices crushed  now that it is ready you squeeze out the raisin the  water from the raisin and you add it to the curds  this is a special dish generally prepared on occasions  because raisins are not very expensive now a days  so when you have uh what you would call a dawat  you would add the kishmish ka raita as one of the dishes to the others now things on the menu  the last uh dahi wada what's is like the dahi bhallas yes it is known as  dahi bhalla in bhalla in  punjabi dahi wada universally all over india  yes   dahi wada  it can be made out of the mung dal  or the udad dal that is one is yellow in colour the other is white  preferably it is the white one that is the udad dal  that is used  you soak the dal overnight you rotate it in the mixer mixer next day  and it has to become absolutely into a thick fine paste but the paste must not become thin  it should remain a little on the thick side  once it is ready you grind a little cumin seeds you grind uh ginger and green chillies and add them to the ground udad dal  then heat a little oil and make small balls of the udad dal and leave them into the oil  keep turning them till they are a little golden brown and remove them onto a piece of paper so that the extra oil is drained off now take a large quantity of curds mix it well beat it up well add salt chilli and also a little cumin powder to it  the bhallas which have been prepared should be soaked for atleast fifteen minutes in warm water  as a result all the oil is drained away into the warm water and you don't get that taste of oil when you put it into the curds then soak it in the curds and allow it to stand for atleast fifteen minutes so that the curd penetrates into the bhalla  and softens them  along with these it is always better to have chutney   this is known as khatti mithi chutney  you prepare it out of dates that is khajur  and out of tamarind water  soak the tamarind for half an hour squeeze it out thick liquid add a little water sugar about half a spoon little salt chilli powder cumin powder and corriander powder to it  mix it up beat it up well so that all the ingredients  form a thick paste like substance in the same way the dates are being soaked the seeds they have the seeds are removed and they are mashed with your hand and you they form an absolutely thick paste and to that you may add or you may not add a little salt and chilli powder and keep it aside so that when you serve the bhallas arrange them beautifully into a dish put a little curds over it add a little cha  khatti mithi chutney on the surface and a litlle fresh green corriander and serve it to your guests 
up till now we have seen the semi- poses and some other bends  today we are showing you bharadwaja asana  before going into the way of doing it i would like you all to see so that you can get the imprint of the  asana  you can look now into the pose music  this asana is dedicated to sage bharadwaja  the father of drona the preceptor kauravas and pandavas who fought the great mahabharata war  as you look at this pose it will tell you that we have  the forward movement and the extension backwards of the spine  but we do very little about the lateral movements of the spine  so this is the first primary asana to rotate the lateral muscles of the spine so that the spinal muscles on the side are strengthen so that it prevents what we call today the split disc cases  now we go into the technique of the pose  first one has to sit in danda asana as you see here the foot should be vertically doing tada asana  and the legs should be doing horizontal tada asana   so that the whole leg from the hips are like a stick  after sitting in that pose flex your knees move the feet towards the right feet placing the right foot over the left foot which gives a grip or a support or an anchor for rotating the spine to the maximum or optimum level  again repeating reach the right hand towards the ceiling  extend the upper form from the right feet and revolve the trunk even maximum from forty-five to fifty or sixty degrees  without disturbing the left knee and the hip so that the knee and the hip run parallel to each other  then along with exhalation bring the right arm down  form a cup shape then take the left hand back near the elbow and revolve using your behind as a friction  revolve your spine from the pubic towards the right hand  and adjust your spine from the tail bone to the neck so that all the thirty-three vertebrates of the spine get an even rotation  stay there with normal breathing lifting the lever up  and turn the diaphragm from the right to the left in order to feel the spine more  when you secure that pose bring the left arm behind the right and catch the right arm above the elbow and keep it like a stick the right arm facing the fingers against the ground inserting into the knees  then pressurising your finger against the upper hand revolve the pubic the lowest trunk the middle trunk and the top trunk and stay at the left shoulder to the maximum  this gives you an idea that how the spine moves side ways more and more which relieves soreness of the back lumbago  one word hip pain and adjust the body in such a way that it lessens the pain and relieves it  similarly the pose has to be done on the other side releasing the hand bringing it to the front take the right arm back come to danda asana  stay for a while do normal breathe one or two then with an exhalation move the feet nearer flex in and move towards the left hip  pressurising the knee on the ground walking the right outer knee and the right hip to keep them run parallel to each other  bring the left arm above stretch extend the body maximum  revolving the trunk towards the right arm to the maximum  without retarding the rotation back bring the arm down along with the exhalation  keep a cup cup shape move the right arm back and pressurising your foot against the other foot turn the lowest trunk to the maximum  lock the ligaments of the knees  there they should be compressed in order to get the rotation  revolve the spine to the maximum and set the kidney into the kidney so that the blood is sucked by the kidney for it to function better  i just see it's the simplest of all asana  but the effect is enormous  any person who have got a slip disc can begin this pose like this before they attempt any other pose  here the fibre which picks the spine is taken off  and it gives a tremendous relief on the back  then with an exhalation move the left arm back and catch your leg no i'm sorry hold it catch your hand behind extend the left arm to the floor using the finger to pressurise grip revolve the spin coming to shoulder the shoulder blade the kidney the weight even the bladder should be lifted up and then to be revolved  this is the final pose  then you come back revolve release the finger  take the left arm on the back side of the hip on the left  remove the leg to the front this is danda asana  when there is a back ache people having slip disc  it's very very difficult to do on this floor because they cannot  move their bodies at all  in order to make them get the mobility we make them to do on a chair which you are going to see now  you take a chair near you insert your legs on the path of your chair  sit firmly on the seat  then catching on one edge of the armpit supporting the elbow as you see keep the other hand behind grip the corner of seat pick the support of your outer knees will contact with the leg of the chair and turn your spine to the maximum  and this is a real panacea for people who have got salip disc or who are in the process of getting injury to their spine  one word of the spine  this can be done on the other way also without changing the leg you turn and we revolve so that both side you can see this spine now better which has tremendous room because when we sit on a chair we have no compression of the spine  it gives a tremendous room for the spine to revolve or to rotate  hence it is called the lateral rotation of the spinal movement of this arthrites  those who have back aches strain or pa   pain they can do this pose conveniently anywhere on the chair your relief today is a permanent cure forever provided it is continued regularly  so keep this in mind as the doctor says take four doses a day if you do this pose with an interval of one hour every now and then the soreness of the thigh pad disappears and there is a tremendous freedom for the movement and you'll recover from the disease sooner than one anticipates namaskar god bless you   today namaskar today we are showing parshwathana asana   as i said before it's good to have a look  into the pose to get a mental picture of parshwathana asana    now you can look at them music   this is parshwathana asana parshwa means side  thana means stretch   from there we go to prasavika padastha asana   this is step pose to parshwathana aasana   i hope you got a mental picture of  parshwathana asana and prasavika padastha asana   now we are going into the way of doing presenting this pose   first we have to stand in tada asana as you see it  when we do tada asana remember that the bottom feet should be very very active the skin should be very sensitive at the bottom   you know the pointer which you see that's the brain of the foot that should be circularly curved in order to get a firm grip which help the shin and the thymus to come in   then extending evenly from the middle of the arch we have to stand erect   then we do namaskar normally saluting to one to the other   namaskar this is how we salute the soul of the other person at the same time saluting our self   it has to be done in the same way from behind   let the body turn   spread the palm take the pa join the palms to the back  allow the fingers upward and then raise the fingers to the maximum to reach the upper portion of the shoulder blade   and join the palms firmly into the wrist   surely you have done that   now if you look at this lady you see the two triangles  evenly divided from the side of the chest to the lower and the forearm forming a right angle triangle   so when a person presses the hands like that this perfect  double trikon asan as we followed   in order to get it we have to press the wrist together and push the forearm muscles towards the elbows descending the upper arm down   this is very good for dropping shoulder and drooping shoulder blade dislocated or displaced shoulder   and normally people suffer from tennis shoulder tennis elbows tennis wrist were dependent get disturb of swollen   they dis they remove their swelling and are afraid to hold their right hand to play again   come to this side   now the technique again   take a deep inhalation jump about four to four and half feet apart  take the right foot out revolving the right foot forty-five to  ninety degrees   the left foot about fifty to sixty degrees   turn the trunk maximum towards the right so that the body  experience on the middle of the right leg   the middle of the right foot on the side the middle of the knee on the side the middle of the thigh on the side   if you take the flying your navel your diaphragm centre  one word should run on the inner leg of the right   extending both legs backwards pressing the right heel on the floor extending the hinges of the heel of the right push back the right in order to woken the left leg   turn the pelvic rim of the left towards the right   open your chest do normal breathing   when the breathing is not explained   pressing your palms throw the head back now if you achieve this pose it's called parshwauttana asana parshwa means side uttana means extension   you can see the side legs side chest stretched   so extending the side legs of the body or raising the side chest exhale go down   when you are going down see that the navel is brought down to a vertical downward stretch of the navel   turn the left leg towards the right and move the right outer buttocks right outer buttocks towards the left leg   so that both the buttocks run parallel to the back wall  stretch your forehead on the knee if it is easy move the head down then the nose then the legs   if you are secure stretching the outer edge of the left foot  from the ankle downward towards the ground which is a gripper  you have to turn the one word muscle of the left which is above the knee towards the right   and extend this chin further down to rest on the shin  shin is a lower bone of the leg   then linken your body from the floor of the bladder   you should have a single stretch from the tail bone towards the head   doing normal breathe in that position you can see the side legs working very accurately with full of life particularly the inner right leg   inhale come to the centre revolving the right foot again  turning the left foot out   stay there for a while in the centre   take one or two breath then with an exhalation move to the left turning the right foot in and the left foot out ninety degrees   before you raise your head secure the right outer foot on the platform firmly   and then raise your head up from the trunk and extending this pelvic bladder from the right to the left lift up open your chest throw the head back with normal breathing   stay in that position for a while maintaining normal breath   then with an exhalation move the head down   you saw the pose when the head is lifted the whole uritary organs were lifted up   so one word for the one word or the looseness of the floor with the bladder there you get strengthen in this pose  extend further and further if you know if you can do better   now pressing the left central heel of the flaw at the back  open the knees more and more towards your right legs   and as the left leg moves back the right leg should give room  by creating space for a perfect stretch  you can see the clear triangle in the leg   and maintaining the triangle as a form stay there for a while  then after exhalation move the head to the centre turning the left foot in   and stay there for a while   do normal breathing   then press this palms on the floor look up   when you look up spread your leg more and more after  pressing the palm on the floor   without disturbing the pubic bone the physiological organ  from the pubic upto the neck has to be extended towards the collar bone   look up pressing the wrist   this helps tremendously to take a deep inbreathe  without any strain   when exhale take the head down   prasadita this is prasadita padasthana asana prasadita means extended pada means leg  as the legs are extended it is called prasadita pada uttana asana means the head is brought down the floor with an intense stretch   so it is prasadita padasthana asana   this is a base to begin shirsana  many people are afraid to do shirshana becuase they are afraid to keep their head down   so this asana trains the brain to get acclimatise to keep the head to the ground then easily the confidence come and they can practise shirsana   and this is a soothing both for the brain as the brain gets tremendous blood supply in this position   in here we come up when you are staying in this pose you have to maintain normal breathing   you can contract back begin the middle portion in the spine into the body as seen as place the fingers on your back exhale both together stand in tada asana 
hello i am tabussum khan and i love cooking  but cooking is not such a minor job as some people make it out to be take for example the simple act of boiling an egg  if you don't know how to do it properly you can make a mess  yuk if you want to avoid a mess like this then you must know some basic facts about eggs  remember what you learnt at school ? just inside this shell there is a membrane called the outer shell membrane  and at one end of the egg usually the broader end there is an air space enclosed by the outer shell membrane and the inner shell membrane  now when you heat an egg this air space expands  and if you heat it rapidly the air space expands rapidly since the volume is uh restricted by the shell the shell cracks  and the contents leak out  and this is the result  now if you heat the egg slowly using a low flame then the air inside the air space expands slowly  the outer shell membrane is made up of methastheracin  protein the kind which you find in our skins and the air can escape out of the membrane towards the shell  the shell is calcium carbonate and it has very fine pores  the air can escape through these pores outside  let me demonstrate demonstrates  notice may i am not taking too much of water than is needed to immerse the egg  if there is too much of water then the convection current can take the egg up and down hitting it against the sides of the vessel  that can also lead to the cracking of the shell  now a slow flame and a long wait music  the problem with this method is that it takes a very long time to have a hard boiled egg music  now if i want to go to college in the morning i would definitely get late  so i have learnt a simple trick music  first i determine the approximate position of the air space inside the egg  then using a sharp pin i make a tiny hole in the shell  just on top of the air space  now i can get a hard boiled egg very fast music  the natural pores of the egg are too tiny compared to the hole that i have made and all the air can escape through that hole the result is a perfectly egg shaped egg when i feel it  music  notice the difference in the shape of these two eggs  the flatness of the egg where there was an air space is not present in this one  aesthetically more pleasing isn't it ? so there is no point in looking at the beauty of these eggs  unless we can eat them  and sometimes i find it very difficult to eat an egg  because of the smell  it reminds you of the chemistry laboratory which keeps apparatus and the horrible smell of hydrogen sulphide  usually it's a rotten egg which smell of hydrogen sulphide but if after boiling it if you leave the egg in hot water  even a fresh egg can smell of hydrogen sulphide  to understand this phenomenon we must look into the contents  of the egg white music  the egg white is not actually white in colour until you boil or cook it  it is transparent and consists mainly of a globular protein called albumin  protein as we know it is a long chain of amino-acids  among the twenty odd amino acids which are normally found in protein there are three which have sulphur in them cystin  cystine and methionine  when the long chain of amino-acids folds on itself to form the globular tertiary structure quite a few hydrogen bond and a few s s bonds help to stabilize the structure  when we heat the albumin these bonds are broken  the protein settles out and undergoes what is known as denaturation some of the s s bonds are also broken down and ultimately form  h 2 s which gives you that typical smell  the denatured protein then cross to into each other  and cogulate  this is how the albumin becomes white and opaque  the tendency of the liberated h 2 s is to move towards cooler areas that is towards the center of the egg where it comes into contact with the yolk and reacts with the metallic irons of the yolk to form a green coloured salt  thus the yolk gets a coat of green  personally i don't like the egg to smell nor do i like it to be green  so i'll tell you a simple trick to avoid both these problems music  as soon as the egg is boiled take it out of hot water and put it into cold water  and as i told you before the tendency of the liberated h 2  s is to diffuse towards cooler areas  so now instead of moving towards the center of the egg it will move out of the egg  so there will be no bad smell and no green coloured yolk  the problems arise only when you leave the egg in hot water now we come to the last problem of dealing with hard boiled egg  the difficulty in peeling  sometimes along with the egg shell the egg white also seems to come out  actually this does not happen with all the eggs  usually it comes up very easily  this only happens if you have a fresh egg  the solution to this problem is simple  do not hard boil a fresh egg  the intermolecular forces between the shell membrane and the egg white are stronger in fresh egg  within two three days of laying these bonds become weaker so if you want to have a hard boiled egg choose an older egg   music  but if you want a fried egg it's better to go in for fresh egg  the intermolecular forces are stronger in fresh eggs  so you get a more compact looking fried egg  and if you use an older egg it tends to thin out into the pan and run and it becomes difficult to handle when you are turning it  so boil or scramble an older egg  i suppose we talked about fried egg the boiled egg the scrambled egg and the list is more than completed if we add omelette to it  music  the delicacy or the softness of an omelette may depend on how much of froth you manage to make when beating it  the method of beating the egg or the technology may contribute to the frothiness  but more important is that vessel in which you are beating the egg  i have cleaned this vessel very well with soapened water to remove all the grease from it  and in another vessel i apply a light coat of oil now i take two egg from the same batch of eggs that i received  from the poultry farm this morning meaning that the age of both the eggs is the same  now watch beating the egg  notice there is not too much of froth in this vessel with the coat of oil in it whereas in this one there is a lot of froth  why ? in the physics classes at school we have learnt about surface tension  bubbles are more easily formed in water if we add soap to it  because soap produces the surface tension of water  if we apply this principle of surface tension to this phenomenon  you have solved another practical problem in your kitchen  oil increases the surface tension so it is really necessary to clean the vessel thoroughly  before you beat the egg that is if you want a really soft omelette  in this programme we have eaten boiled eggs fried eggs scrambled eggs eggs made into an omelette  but i am sure we will have indigestion if we have any more of this stuff  so let me conclude this programme by merely mentioning the mouth watering delicacies in which eggs are used  caramel custard pasteries cake meonade and a lot of these delicious stuff  and i'm sure a song in the praise of egg would include the voices to the from some of us who are vegetarian  but you wouldn't mind eating a so called vegetarian egg  a vegetarian egg is nothing else than unfertilised egg  there is of course no difference in taste between a fertilised egg and an unfertilised egg music  hi rajan  hi  how are you ? fine   kya hua again you have got pain in your  yeah shoulder base and neck   yeah  yeah it's paining  lal sahab this is my brother rajan  hello jee  hello nice meeting you   in hindi i think because of prolonged driving throughout the day he is driving around  do you think you have any simple exercises for people who do a lot of driving ? yeah sure  could you please show us some ? yes i'll show here itself  here itself ? yeah  oh very nice laughter that will be very nice when you have to drive uh you know long distances perhaps you could do some exercises in between any time mean when you have  oh that would be very nice in hindi  if it pain or pressure okay yes  some are very simple which i will show you here unless you perhaps i'll show you more if you'll have time  one is this put your hands here on the seat breathing in you lift your body up and take your hand backward as high as you can  here  the other exercise which you can do is put your hands here  right hand lift it up and then turn your head to the other side breath in out down  now breath in look  yeah   that's right clear breath in up  breath out breath in up breath out  now another exercise what you can do is rotate your shoulder breathing in out out down   it's very simple   breathing it up  yeah it's very really all are very simple  breath in up out as you reach down  then forward  i hope this much you can manage  yes i can already do it   is it all lal sahab  yeah some are these and then there are plenty of exercises  since the space is limited out here i am sure you can't do all the excersises here  naturally why don't we go and demonstrate some excercises for better endurance ? sure come  bye bye  all skanda chalan can shoulder shrouds or skanda chalan can take off stress from your head and shoulders which come under heavy attack especially after prolonged driving  simply breath in as you take your shoulder up and breath out as you bring them down  prolong driving affects your blood circulation very badly  these simple spinal twist up here accelerate blood supply to the whole system making you refreshed again  this is suptahastapadangosth asan  very useful asan for relieving stress and strain from your entire back besides it also can take off extra flesh from your abdomen  breathing in take your leg to the side out come back  you can repeat between seven and ten times in the first two weeks  this pawammukta asan is giving a natural massage to your entire system  you can stay there for as long as you feel comfortable  press it very naturally  don't strain yourself too much  you see during prolonged sitting and driving or travelling  your all the body joints almost are frozen specially your knees and the feet come under a heavy attack  circulation is affected very badly  so these simple movements can relieve the pressure from your legs and the knees  also if you have knee pain often or the knees are stiff even in a day to day life these simple movements further knees and the legs can help you come out of that uh situation  this is called vakra asan the simple spinal twist or the first position or preparatory exercise for  ardhmasendra asan  it gives a lateral movement to the entire spinal column  this can help you alleviate back ache and one word  etcetera  this is one of the constituent of surya namaskar   called ashwa sanchalak one of the best  yogasan to relieve stress from your back head and neck  and shoulders  after having done all these yogasan and exercises you must relax in this position in hindi 
i think some of you who have seen the last programme would be ready with your sticks  so let's get started  as you remember last time you saw how the stick was held  and also saw a few basic steps and a few basic strokes with the stick  now those of you who are familiar with the word  kaata or familiar with judo or karate would know what the word kaata means  but for those of you who do not know the word kaata  kaata is a fixed prearranged form of excercise done in  many marshal arts  it is either done solo or performed with a partner  these exercises are repeated till all the movements become smooth easy and spontaneous now in stick fighting also we have got these fixed  or prearranged type of exercises  but because of the different styles involved and the different names at the moment for the sake of convenience  let's call them kaatas  last time you saw kanduraburakailugaru doing some basic steps now let's take a look at him doing a few  kaatas  here in this kaata only two strokes or hit  or i should say hit are being practised the right and the left but in different directions  note that only these two basic strokes are used but in all the four directions of the one word  incidently guruburakailu is one of those few masters  who travel from village to village rarely staying more than a few months at one place  a few students pay him a small sum for his services but  mostly rice or wheat is the only payment he gets for teaching them  there he is finishing off the kaata  that is the traditional salami or salutation now in this kaata he start   starts the same way as before but uh this time with the stroke on the head  two more strokes start from down two more parallel to the ground and a stroke towards the back then he turns  he does the same thing over again towards this side also now he is finishing the fourth side and here he comes forward for the fifth time there he turns and goes back and finishes the exercise with uh traditional salutation or  salami  but before the salami he is doing the  basic strokes again  the salami usually is done before and after  each exercise in all the traditional art  now this time he add a double stroke to the head and then does the same strokes which you saw in the last exercise  but he adds one more stroke from down which was a powerful stroke then he turns  here this is the powerful stroke which starts from down and ends up  note how graceful and smooth the movements are  the synchronization of the movements the hormony between the hands and the feet  for this reason new movements are gradually introduced in each new exercise till all the movements become effortless and spontaneous  well though there are more than twenty such exercises in the udaygiri style we'll take a look at only one more  well in this final kaata all the movements will be done in a circular way but before the movement starts a poke or a thrust repeats the movement  watch he finished the circular strokes and now the thrust or the poke starts with the throat as the target  there it is the thrust and the circular movements  note that the stick never seems to stop  it keeps on moving  this is in defence as well as in offence  the stick always covers the body  and that's it that's the salami  or the salutation  these are some basic exercises  after learning these the students learns how to hit  that means he learns the blows and the hits  now here the need or the necessity of a partner is important  this is also done in a fixed prearranged form  the reason is that if it is not fixed and prearranged the  chances of injury are more  but gradually as the skill of the person increases  then he could indulge in free fightings  loosening up or warming up guruburakailu moves forward  to take the salami  this is his student ramalingaraju  there they have done the salami and now they move back  now he comes forward for the basic hits which are usually done before the start of each kaata  and now the exercise starts which has got nine hits  this time they do fifteen hits in this kaata   first the basic blows that's the deceptic  blow to the ankle  one two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven  twelve thirteen fourteen and fifteen  now in this exercise other than the nine basic hits  there are twelve more hits which are added to this making a total of twenty-one strokes or blows sound of sticks  and they finish it off  now comparatively this set is more difficult than the previous one though there are only four blows involved  the basic hit and the exercise starts one two  three four  timing is very important in this  ah that was the reverse stroke  again  this exercise is also the same practically the same as before but uh instead of the first hit the first blow or the stroke is the thrust at the throat  and the same basic fourth blow  rhythm and timing is very important here  there the rhythm has been changed to a double blow  from down  now this kaata is similar to the last  two you saw but here there are ten hits rather than four blows which you saw  they have named it the jhapak  timing and a keen eye is very important here  well we can go on and on for there are many such exercises but let's not do that  uh we've to take a look at only one more  that's from the udaygiricheda school  here they are finishing this and now we'll move on to the last exercise  here nothing is prearranged or planned or fixed  this is something like free fighting sparring and the hits are spontaneous  now this type of practise or fighting is done when the student has already learnt the stick forms  this is helpful in the actual use of a stick that is  when a competitor fights  though competitions are very rare now- a-days and they are only held in some villages and not in the cities  uh in competition the stick is sometimes coloured so that if the stick touches it could show where it was touched  ah that was the close one  but the master is directing the students movement  though there is a lot more to stick fighting than what you just saw these are a few kaatas from the udaygiricheda school or the udaygiri style of stick fighting  now to some it may seem paradoxical but in many fighting arts of the east medicine and healing play a very important role  many masters are vaidya hakims or bone setters one such master was the late shafi ustad  the tradition is being carried out by his student khalifa gulam rasool  mending broken bones is his profession  he has learnt the secrets of herbs oil and healing lotions from his late master  and now he makes his own medicines  gulam rasool is a very busy man with a very tight schedule right from dawn to late in the night he is at his clinic where he looks after his patients  though sometimes when he is not very busy he teaches  stick fighting also  no matter what ones faith is devotion and prayer play an important part in ones training  here khalifa gulam rasool gets ready for an exercise   that's the salami and he starts with both the sticks rotating  this exercise is known as chaadar or a bedsheet  it is appropriately named because uh sticks are covering the body like a bedsheet would  both the sticks are moving at the same time  this is used to keep people away from you  and the that's the finish of the exercise with the  traditional salami  gulam rasool's son gulam moiuddin is on the left  and karim is on the right  they are doing salami  and now the work starts  this is the simple exercise with just four hits  there they finish off  now here is something interesting  other than blows and thrust which you saw in the udaygiri style here the lathi or the stick is also used  to lock the joints and immobolize the opponent without actually hitting him  these are known as bandish or  let's call them locks  here the elbow has been locked  abdul samadh his student and the elbow and the shoulder is locked here  the wrist also seems to be locked  that is a good one the elbow has been locked   that's sure it's painful the neck has been locked  now there are two sticks being used  well one arm the other arm has also been locked  both the arms are captured  well that's the strangle or a choke on the throat with the elbow also locked  you have seen two different styles or types of stick fightings  now i would like to show you a few basics which could be learnt easily by you and put to good use if the situation demands but let me tell you something  do not misuse the sticks give it the respect it deserves but uh before we start let's take a look at what we did last time  in various styles there are various hits and blows but basically there are just seven hits with the stick  i'll do them slowly  from your basic stance lift your hands up and get your hands down again  this is the first basic hit on the head  it comes straight down  the second hit is sloping from up to down  the third again from up to down slanting  fourth is parallel to the ground fifth is also parallel to the ground sixth comes from down to up and seventh is also  from down to up  and of course there are point of the stick is also used to thrust or poke  what you saw were the seven basic strokes  now i'll show you a simple basic exercise  now usually in stick fighting when the stick is brought over head or from the side the leg also moves with the stick that is what i am trying to say is that if the stick comes from your right side the leg also moves forward or if it comes from the left side then the left leg moves forward  now this is not a very hard and fast rule  it is flexible  sometimes even when the stroke is coming from the other side the step may not be taken that is the right leg is in front but the left stroke comes  let us not think of this at the moment  at the moment when we get the stick out we will  step forward  so from here from your basic start or your basic stance  lift your hands up over your head  now in this movement you have blocked the opponents stick  or you have blocked a blow to your head and protected yourself  from here take a step forward hit  take one more step forward hit  now what happens you can rotate to the left side or the right side or the back  now i'll move to the left watch  again i'll go towards my back  what i have done is that i have taken a complete circle  now this circle could be towards your left side or towards your right side depending on the situation   i'll do it again slowly watch  well that speed also is possible but to start with  we'll do it slowly  now what you have just seen is just a fraction of what  stick fighting is all about  if you are really interested then it's better that you find someone who knows stick fighting and who can teach you  here i remember the saying of the late swami shivananda who says an ounce of practice is worth  several tons of theory goodbye 
i first became interested in fabric painting when i saw it  advertised in a magazine  so i went out and got a whole lot of colours and uhm i first started out by painting on pieces of pa on pieces of uh cloth  i took the designs from magazines from uhm cards  and uh sometimes i just used my own free style design  then uhm i started uh painting  now this is a pillow case   i've done a few designs on this pillow case with fabric paints in the beginning i diluted it very thickly didn't use much water so it's come a bit crudely  it hasn't come very well  so uhm i decided to dilute the paint a little more  and make the colour more refined  now i use all sorts of colours like blue green yellow  violet indigo black white on black  you can use any colour on any kind of cloth and the results are fantastic now have a look at this bedsheet  this is something i tried quite recently  this is a mixture of all sorts of ideas   i've taken it's some kind of ink freaking  you can do the same sort of thing on paper take a piece of string dip it in ink put it between two pieces of paper flatten it the paper and pull it out slowly  now the same idea has been applied on this bedsheet  but the string i have taken is slightly thicker and i have streaked the bedsheet all over and then the results that you can see are fantastic  it has given it a very printed kind of look and uhm very professional  and not only that i spray painted all over the bedsheet  with different colours and i've used enough stensils to mark a ki kind of outline all round the end of the bedsheet  so uhm the effect is quite good actually  now uh this was just a trial actually starting with sort of bedsheet because bedsheets aren't very expensive  now here is another piece of cloth  this is a dress material  i have decided to go a step further and try out this kind of fabric painting on dress material  i have done the same sort of thing but i've used uhm  cut out moulds  the moulds are potatoes and ladysfingers  these can be used as moulds for printing in different colours all over the material and i've also spray painted the material  and streaked it  you can even draw your own little stars here and there and see like this and uhm the results are quite good  now all that has to be done with this material is to be cut out and sewn into a dress  i still haven't tried making a dress out of it yet but uh  once i do it the results are good enough i am going to start selling them and i am sure the market is going to be quite good for this kind of stuff because its quite original and i don't think anyone has quite tried this sort of thing before  you can do almost anything with fabric painting you can paint curtains you can paint bedsheets you can paint uhm dress-material handkerchiefs pillow covers  table-cloths  all sorts of things you use around the house even like uhm  just little designs wall designs to hang on the walls and anything else you fancy actually  uhm so uh fabric painting is fast becoming quite popular especially for curtains and other things used around the house but this is the first time i am trying fabric painting on dresses  people have tried it before on uh t-shirts and uhm  other things but i am going to start something new now i am going to start fabric painting on jeans and other articles which haven't been painted so far  now uhm this is a pair of jeans  the modern trend is not to wear jeans that are flawlessly clean but rather to be speckled with all sorts of colours and paints and uh patches  in other words jeans are fashionably dirty these days  people prefer to wear them dirty  now instead of making jeans dirty i think a better idea would be to paint the dirt on  but not exactly paint the dirt on we would rather paint patches on or paint little things on it or even use stensils or potatoes and ladysfingers  you won't believe that a pair of jeans could be made to look like this  now this looks as though it has been done in a factory  and uh i have tried selling a few of these dress and few of this  some of the dress-material before and uhm the prices are people are willing to pay a fair quite good prices for this sort of things  they don't get this kind of print on material which they can buy which they buy in the shop  and uhm well they are willing to pay quite well for it  now these are some curtains  i have hung them up in my bedroom here  see how the outline has been carefully sketched on to the curtains first  these are not quite finished  but the outline has been sketched  now what i have to do is yes since it's been done with carbon paper  now uhm i have to paint the outline and then  paint it in  i also get ideas for my designs from a monthly subscription for a magazine they send pamphlets  small pamphlets with different designs in it that can be used to  fabric painting  and the designs are quite originals in them you can draw animals or flowers or just abstract designs  you can spray paint you can use strings of one word  if you have a good imagination sky is the limit you can do anything now here is another thing  here is a bag  this handbag is made of denim and it has been painted  with fabric paints  there are special types of paints we use for this kind of painting they are camlin wat uh they are not exactly water colours they are fevicraft  they are called fevicraft colours and they are available in a wide range of colours they should be diluted quite a bit and you can paint  see how i have done this bag  the result is astonishing  not only can you paint bags and other pieces of cloth but you can also paint vessels infact anything that you use around the house you can paint practically anything  you can paint claypots  you can do all sorts of designs on clay-pots even egyptian designs like the old egyptian urns greek designs like graceo urns  and uhm they will make wonderful ornaments put all over the house  then uhm some people so  some people just come and ask me to paint things on any object they bring either pieces of cloths or some a  pie a piece of cloth they want to make into something or any sort of cloth actually plus different sorts of articles  you can even paint uh vehicles like bikes  you can do all sorts of designs on a bike  and uhm this is becoming quite a fad these days with the younger generation specially people in colleges because they go in for all sorts of crazy things on their bikes these days like stickers and other things  and fabric painting happens to stay  it stays on bike for a much longer time  it doesn't come off like a sticker  not only can you do fabric painting on all these things you can also paint canvas shoes  you will be amazed at the sort of things you can paint on canvas shoes  you can totally change the colour of plain white canvas shoes  you can make them look very trendy and very fashionable by  painting almost anything on them from your relations to all sorts of exotic designs  you can paint towels skirts jackets  denim jackets are another fashion these days with fabric painting people go in for all sorts of things written on the back of their denim jackets here is one  this one somebody gave me and told me what to write on it  so i have painted it the way that person wanted  i take orders sometimes but mainly i use my own imaginations  and i normally do exactly as i feel like i let my imagination run wild sometimes and the results are usually very good  they are impressive  and lot of people like my work and uhm here all the things in front of you   it's quite an array here and uhm it's   these are most of the things you can uh use fabric paints on  i am sure other people with good imaginations can think of many more things from fabric paints  and uhm that's about it the fabric paints  so this is how fabric paints can be used  hello there today's topic home-made cosmetics  out of the fifty or more cosmetics that are available today we have selected a few for your preparations at home  the accent has been on easy availability and processing  please have your books and pens ready so that you can note down the formulae and procedure that are going to be flashed up on to the screen  follow the safety precautions to the best of your ability so that you can get serviceable and usable material  many people say the use of cosmetics is a luxury  others are equally voceferous that it is important for personality development and en enhancement    we leave it to you to decide  but have your books and pens ready and for your information cosmetics is derived from the greek word cosmeticos  meaning skill in decorating  another meaning for the word cosmos is ornament  and as you know cosmos also means the whole universe so the supporters of cosmetics say that the scope is wide ranging and far reaching  now professor sai prakash will tell you more about this let us start with the first procedure of preparing a cleansing cream  historically one of the earliest creams was prepared by  jaily around the year one thirty-two hundred a d  and he was one of the famous physicians of that particular time next only to hippocritis  his cooling ointment called serateem refrigeran  they call into a present cleansing cream has the basic ingredient  bees wax olive olive oil rose water etcetera  and the combination of this cleansing cream even to this day is almost similar  in chart one you have the basic ingredients present in a cleansing cream like bees wax mineral oil or vegetable oil as given in part b of the chart water and borax  these are the ingredients with which you can prepare uh a simple cleansing cream at home  and the purpose of this pa  particular cleansing cream is to remove oil grime  facial make-up etcetera from face or throat or other parts of the body  and other creams such as uh vanishing cream hand cream or one word creams are prepared with this basic formulation  we have the method of preparation in the flow diagram given in chart two  and uh in the chart you see that we have uh bees wax and mineral oil taken together melted and heated upto seventy degree so that the wax melts and we have a homogeneous solution  borax taken in water dissolved in water and once again heated to seventy degree so that both these reacting  bees wax in mineral oil borax in water are at seventy degree  and they are mixed up slowly  borax in water being added to this bees wax oil composition slowly with continuous stirring  and when all the ingredient has been added you stir vigorously and allow the temperature to cool down when it comes to around fifty degrees or so you add uh uh perfume of your choice   it's because one has to be very selective in adding  perfume because the choice varies from person to person  a suitable perfume can be added and then the temperature brought down further  at this stage you see that the whole thing emulsifies  and you get the cold or one word cream of your choice  now the procedure is very simple and uh we will be doing that particular experiment now  here we have bees wax it is made into small chips uhm  when it is marketed it's of this particular shape  this is done to see that it melts easily and this has this has got to be dissolved in mineral oil  here is the mineral oil sample  i am going to pour this into a beaker and uh the quantities are as given in the chart the same poportion being taken  this is the mineral oil transfered into a beaker and then  the beas wax is crushed into this utensil  and uh we have a set up of uh i'll  take it out with the help of a glassrod  after tranfering bees wax into mineral oil we now take  borax and dissolve it in the wa dissolve it in water for according to the quantities given  and then heat these two ingredients to seventy degrees and i have the set up here the heater and then uh water inside and that water is getting heated up  i now transfer this beaker into the water bowl  arrangement i have made and also the borax water  combination  borax dissolves and we now have to heat it to seventy degrees now if you are doing it at home and if you don't have  thermometer with you you can as well take seventy degrees as an approxiamate temperature when vapours just start coming out  now that the temperature has come to seventy degrees we  remove these to and i place at top bees wax borax or bees wax and mineral oil combination  and i start adding borax water mixture slowly  with uh continuous stirring  you see a sudden change and a sort of a emulsion forming  and this is done under hot conditions both of them at seventy degrees  initially both these solutions were colourless now we will get a beautiful cream and i add the whole thing and  stirr it vigorously  you can take the one word surely it's  different beautiful cream that is prepared 
suddenly pain in the chest occurs unexplained sweating is here  and breathlessness may be there and suddenly or within a few hours or the same day at any time a person can die suddenly  now this death when we say death this is apparent death  and this is uh clinical death there are various names for it  it means that the heart has stopped beating say and there is no respiration the person is not breathing  so that is but the brain is still functioning  so till the brain is functioning the man is not dead  he is not really dead so he is not biologically dead  so that period is only about four minutes or so  if during this four period of four minutes before the   br brain death occurs we can revive the person we can make his heart beat again and his respiration come up again  then the man can be revived and he survives  now it has been this period of four minutes is too short  for any doctor to reach any place because th  this sort of death can occur at any situation  you are in the factory you are in the office you are in the college wherever you are you see wherever you are on the road side  this sort of thing can happen at any time  now when it happens and there no doctor can reach to do anything  so it is the passerby the standers-by the people in the house  who can do everything to save the life and follow the technique of c p r that is cardio pulmonary resuscitation it is a very very simple technique and anybody can learn it  music for sometime  so friends we'll just learn the technique of cardio pulmonary resuscitation  by cardio i mean heart pulmonary means lungs and resuscitation means revival  learning the technique of reviving heart and lungs when it fails is what we call as cardio pulmonary resuscitation  before we actually learn what is c p r or cardio pulmonary resuscitation is it's uh imperative that we should know as to where the heart is situated and what exactly is its function  that heart is just like a size of the fist and is situated in the centre of the chest with the strenum or the breast bone in front and the spine or the backbone behind  and uh it pumps the blood to all the tissues of the body  almost trillions of cells of the body and the main target organs like brain which is the master controlling function of the body the kidneys liver and heart itself  if the heart fails that is the pumping action fails the death ensues  and this death is of two types a clinical death or what we call a temporary death and a biological death or a permanent death  the time interval between this temporary death and the permanent death is just four to five minutes  it is this time interval which is crucial and we have to take all the measures of c p r at this junture  now before we learn the technique of c p r it is very very essential for us to know is the individual alive or dead  if alive is he sleeping or he is unconscious and there are certain parameters by which we can easily determine whether the individual is dead or alive  like for example we must try to say ask some question to the patient are you okay ? if he is not if it there is no response then we can just pinch the skin or we can press over the upper portion of the eyes we can just have a deep pressure  if there is no response that means the individual is not  uh not in a sleeping state but he is unconscious or he may be dead  now how to distinguish whether he is dead or he is unconscious  we can easily see the chest movements or the breathing movements  if a person is unconscious we can see there is a breathing movement or you can bring the palm of your hand and put it just in front of the nostrills or over the uh mouth and we can fe   feel some warmth of the air  or we can just bring the cheek in front of the mouth and the nose and if we can feel the warmth of the air we can say that the individual is unconscious but not dead  and the third thing commonly which we should feel is we can see the carotids the one of the arteries which is very close to the adams apple or what we call as the voice box or a sound box there is a groove on the side of this apple  uh this uh uh adams apple we can just feel the pulsation  if we can feel the pulsation we can say that the individual is unconscious but not dead  if you are not able to perceive the pulsation and we say there are no chest movements no signs of respiration and uhm uh pulsation or heart pulsation we can say that the individual is dead  and then we have to keep certain do's and  don'ts in mind  for example we should never try to keep a pillow under the head  now why it is so ? the principle is i'll just explain you  whenever a individual breathes he breathes either from the nostrils or from the mouth and whatever air he inhales it goes through the windpipe and goes into the lungs and the air which is inhaled goes into the windpipe and the lungs expand and the chest moves  if for example we just keep for example we are keeping a pillow under the head this windpipe is obstructed and there is a narrowing of the windpipe you can see here this red one this is windpipe it gets choked  and there is no free passage of air into the windpipe and an individual instead of saving him he can just uh go into a sudden death so we must make an effort never to put any pillow under the head the second thing which we must keep in mind we can put any pillow or anything under the legs  by doing so wi with the effect of gravitation we can push in atleast two to three bottles of blood into the brain  and just by doing so a patient may have a enough circulation in the brain and he can be easily revived  just by a simple technique of raising the legs or raising the pelvis of an individual  the third thing we must never put in any water or any  sol any solid in the individuals mouth  there is a risk as the individual is either in a temporory death or in a permanent death whatever you put in the mouth will go into the windpipe and the windpipe will get choked and there will not be any passage of air into the windpipe and person may die suddenly  if at all we find that there is any vomitous or there are any secretions any throat secretions lying in the mouth or there is some foreign body or there is a uh food material or there is water accumulated in the mouth our effort should be to put in the finger  and wipe out the whole mouth and keep the patient or the individual  uh head on the lateral side either on the right side or the left side whatever is a convenient  the next thing which we must keep in mind is we must assure  that there is not a inch of crowd around the individual if there is a lot of crowd we obstruct the air to go into the patients uh vicinity and we should see that there is a free entry of air into the individual or who is a victim who is almost in a process of death  so these are certain do's and  don'ts which we must keep in mind once we do so and we find that still there are no signs of life then we should start the technique of what we call as c p r or cardio pulmonary resuscitation and uh this can be remembered  by simple words of a b and c by a i mean airway and b is breathing and c  means circulation  once i say a a airway means how to take care of the airway  and b is breathing is the process or the method by which we can blow air into the individuals lungs to give him life and c is the circulation that the technique by which we can revive the heart which has failed so as to achieve the circulation in the brain and all the vital top parts of the body  this is what i meant by a b and c  now how to do this technique of a b and c we'll  learn in a step wise fashion  the first and the foremost a means care of the airway our aim is to keep this windpipe which you have already seen  in that model  but we must see the patency of the airway or the windpipe  so we have to keep the victim's position in that fashion so that the windpipe is absolutely patent and we can do so by chin lift or head tilt position  means we can give this you have to elevate the chin and just  you have to press back the forehead of the individual  by doing this doing so like chin lift and head tilt position the wind pipe becomes absolutely patent  this is what i mean by a it is very very simple anybody can learn it  and just by doing so atleast twenty percent of the lives can be saved   it's such a simple technique  and after doing so if you find there are any signs of  breathing or any signs of circulation then we are not to worry much about it  and if you find there are no signs of respirations and there is no signs of uh circulation we should start with another step of b what we call as breathing  now this breathing can be uh learnt in two ways  like uh we can give either a mouth to mouth breathing or a mouth to nose breathing  and one should never feel shy that may be of a opposite sex may be a male female may be young or a old individual our aims and objective is only one and that is to save the life irrespective of the sex and irrespective of the age of an individual and this can be achieved by bringing our lips in front of the victim's lips and make it a absolutely airtight seal so that when we blow the air into the patient into the  victim's mouth it goes straight away into the lungs  and we must ensure before doing so that we keep the  individual's position in the chin lift and the head tilt position  and the second thing is whenever we blow air into the  individual's mouth we must clinch at the nostrils  if we do not do so then whatever air is blown into the  individual's mouth will leak out from the nose and we will not achieve the goal   it's very very important and simultanously we must watch for the chest movements that is our technique or procedure of giving the air is alright  and if it is not so you will see there are no chest movements  or there is some leakage of air either from the sides of the lips or from the nostrils  and this can be done suppose for example if i am alone  there is only one rescuer instead of two then we have to give a mouth to mouth breathing by chin lift head tilt position clinch the nostrils and bring your mouth so you have to give sudden  short blow of breath into the individual's or victim's  mouth  for example if there is a fracture or there is a bleeding from the mouth or there is a vomitous or there is some foul smelling coming from the mouth then you can start with mouth to nostril breathing and our aim is again same our objective is same that we have to keep the individual's position in the same fashion chin lift and head tilt position  and we have to see that the mouth is closed when we give a  mouth to nostril breathing like this  once you do so we must always watch for the chest movements if our technique is right the chest will move and we will be sure that we have given the blow or breath exactly into the wind-pipe  that's how the lungs expanded and the chest moved  once you do so and we find there are still no sings of breathing there are no signs of uh circulation we start with c  by c i mean circulation  now how to achieve the circulation the technique is very very simple  like for example you can use your middle finger and the index finger you can keep it exactly in the centre of the lower chest  there is a notch here  if you see here carefully that is a notch  here the two halves of the two halves of the chest bony cage they meet this is the notch here you have to keep your fingers the index finger and the middle finger  bring the palm of the other hand and keep it over the breast bone  remove this hand and put it over the other hand and interlock it  and you have to make sure that you give this procedure of what we call as heart massage or what we call as compressions over the heart to revive it  you have to see that you just lie absolutely in a straight position you do not bend your elbow joints and you give enough pressure so that there is a compression of about half inch  to one and a half inch just indepth  we should not go beyond that  and you can start giving compression like for example you can give compressions like this one thosand one one thousand two one thousand three one thousand four  one thousand five one thousand six one thousand seven one thousand eight one thousand nine one thousand ten one thousand eleven one thousand twelve one thousand thirteen one thousand fourteen one thousand fifteen and after doing so straight away start the same position chin lift head tilt position clinch the nose  and give mouth to mouth breathing  then continue this procedure till you see the signs of life in the form of respiration or in the form of uh uh circulation achieved  if you find that still no signs of respirations we must continue the technique till we feel the carotids artery here main artery here or we see some sort of breathing and the pa or  some sort of regaining of consciousness if it is not there we have to continue it there are certain things which we have to keep in mind when we do this technique of what we call as a close cardiac massage or a compression 
i am told i have coronary artery disease what does it  it actual actually mean ? you see normally your heart requires inadequate supply of blood  right to enable it to perform its function of pumping blood to the body  now this blood it receives through three major arteries  which as you see on this model yeah goes on the surface of the heart  right  when these arteries get blocked the process is known as atherosclerosis  uhm uhm then the blood supply to the heart suffers  and when this occurs during periods of stress the diminished blood supply to the heart manifests as pain  uhm which is called angina  so if one of these vessels were to get suddenly completely blocked  i see  then a portion of the heart muscle would die  oh  and this is called miocardial infarction or in  layman's term a heart attack  and therefore why does this disease occur ? nobody really knows the exact cause for this disease  i see  but medical science has been able to identify certain risk factors which predispose a patient for this disease uhm  of these risk factors one of the important ones is smoking  oh  the other risk factors are diabetes hypertension  a high cholestrol diet belonging to the male sex and a strong family history  for example if your father or brother were to have pulmonary artery disease ahn hn hn then the risk of having this disease is increased   ahn hn hn  how do you confirm that uh an individual has got the disease ? you see initial investigations like a chest x-ray and an e c g ahn ahn which should be performed by a private practitioner would give a clue to the existence of this disease   ahn  but the actual confirmation that one has this disease can be made only by taking recourse to certain sophisticated investigations  ahn ahn   ahn  right  and the first of this is called an exercise electrocardiogram  uhm uhm  in this a continuous record of the patient's  electrocardiogram is taken while he is subjected to graded exercise  right  and this gives us an idea of the capacity of the heart  to cope up with the exercise  right  and if the heart is unable to do so uhm uhm  then this manifests as chest pain or as changes in the electrocardiogram which is recorded uhm uhm or as a rise in the blood pressure   uhm uhm   uhm uhm  nuclear anginography is another recent innovation in modern medicine i see which helps us to further define the function of the heart  and in this a radioactive drug is injected into the blood stream   i see  right  this accumulates in the heart and is picked up by sensitive sensors  uhm uhm  this gives us an idea of the exact amount of blood being  pumped by the heart during each beat  uhm uhm  it also tells us that the certain portions of the heart  are not contracting properly uhm uhm or there are certain areas of the heart which are receiving less blood supply   uhm uhm  right  the final diagnosis of course can be made after a test called coronary archiography angiography  uhm uhm  and this is the test which is performed under local anaesthesia by the cardiologist and radiologist  uhm uhm  and in this test a cathater is passed through the femoral artery which is the blood vessel supplying the leg  right  this cathater is pushed into the heart uhm  and the radio opaque dye is injected into the heart and the coronary arteries   uhm  right  this tells us firstly the function of the heart  uhm uhm as well as delineates the anatomy of the coronary arteries  uhm and shows us exactly where the disease process is blocking the arteries   uhm uhm   uhm  uhm  this not only confirms the diagnosis for us uhm uhm but it also tells us whether surgery is feasible and if so uhm which portion of the artery should be repaired  uhm uhm   uhm  i see  so what is this bypass surgery ? you see in bypass surgery our aim is to increase the blood supply to the heart by surgical methods  i see  there are two ways to tackle this disease  one is by giving medicines  uhm uhm  however medicines can only improve the blood supply  to the heart marginally  uhm uhm  they mainly act by reducing the demands of the heart  uhm and thereby the work capacity of the patient is now significantly increased   uhm  oh  in bypass surgery we aim to actually increase the blood  supply to the heart by creating bypass channels surgically  right  thereby not only the capacity of the heart is increased   uhm uhm but the capacity of the patient to lead a normal active life right is increased   uhm uhm   right  i see  but what do you exactly do during this bypass surgery ? i mean  the exact surgical procedure is difficult to explain  uhm uhm  but i have a video recording of a bypass surgery  uhm uhm in progress   uhm uhm  oh  if you would like to see it ? i will show it to you  ah ha certainly love to  you are looking into an operation theatre  the preparations for a coronary artery bypass procedure up in the way  the patient suffers background noise from coronary artery disease and requires bypass graft of the blocked artery all the perfusionists the nurses and the anaesthetists get ready the patient is put under anaesthesia  the chest and the leg are draped in sterile towels  to expose the heart the skin overlying the breast bone  is cut  the underlying fat and subcutaneous tissue are then divided to expose the breast bone  which is then cut through with an electric saw  the procedure called sternotomy noise of sawing  the heart is covered by a membranous sheet called the pericordium and when this is cut the first view of the heart beating underneath is accorded  meanwhile another set of surgeons has exposed the long vein of the leg known as the saphenous vein  portions of this vein will be used as conduits by bypass graphs cough  when this has been done the stage is set to connect the heart to the heart lung machine  this machine will perform the function of the heart and lung  during the entire procedure  so this blood must be drained from the heart to the heart lung machine and this is done by means of special plastic cannulae this tube attached from the right side of the heart will drain impure blood from the heart to the heart lung machine  the blood will be purified in the heart lung machine and will then be returned to the heart by means of another tube attached to the aorta background noise  this then completes the circuit which diverts the blood  from the heart to the heart lung machine and then returns it to the patient  thereby bypassing the heart and lungs  during this time the heart can be made to stop and the main operation performed  the connections between the tubings and the heart must not only be watertight but must also be secure to prevent any accidental blow out during the operation  also care must be taken to prevent any air bubbles from entering the circulation  and the heart lung machine is started  blood will be pumped into the body and the patient's  own heart will slow down and will stop injecting  the saphenous vein is then distended and checked for any leaks  and prepared for the anastomosis  for this the heart must be completly stopped and so  the blood supply to the heart is cut out by planting the aorta  the cordioplagic solution is injected into the heart an ice cold saline is poured on its surface to lower its temperature this protects the heart during the period that is blood supply is entirely cut off  the selected artery is then cut beyond the block and this probe shows that one end of the artery is completely obstructed the grafting procedure starts by attaching one end of this saphenous vein to this cut in the artery  this anastomosis is performed with a very fine  polypropelene suture  a high degree of precision is required at this stage  for this anastomosis must not only be watertight but must be absolutely smooth so that the blood flow from the vein to the artery is absolutely unhindered cough  while all this is being done the heart lies completly still protected by its lowered temperature as well as the effects of the cardioplagic solution that has been injected into it  surgeons at work: visuals  once this end of the anastomosis is completed the completion of the graft requires that the other end of the graft be connected to the aorta  but this does not require a stand still heart and so  the heart at this stage can be made to beat again after its blood supply has been restored  the other end of the saphenous vein is now prepared  this end has to be connected to the aorta  and for this a portion of this bl  blood vessel is isolated in a special form  an opening is made in this isolated portion of the aorta  and to this opening the other end of the saphenous vein is carefully sewn sewing the vein  this again is performed with a very fine polypropelene suture the completed graft now fills with blood and supplies blood to the portion of the heart which was earlier deprived of blood supply  the oxygenator is the centre piece of the heart lung machine  and performs the vital function of purifying the impure blood that it receives from the body  it oxygenates the blood and removes carbon dioxide  advances in modern medicine have made coronary artery bypass surgery not only a safe procedure but also accessible to the common man  the same sequence of events continues and the second and the third graft are placed in succession  thereby bypassing all three blocked vessels  the completion of the procedure the heart beats vigorously  and is now ready to be disconnected from the heart lung machine  the connecting tubes are then removed one by one  disconnecting tubes in machine  all the openings in the heart are carefully stitched and a final check is made to look for any bleeding points at the side  of the anastomosis  the major operation over the chest can now be closed  the divided breast bone is approximated with stout sutures and the subcutaneous tissue and the overlying skin are stitched together in layers  the graft at the end of the operation the patient will be revived from anaesthesia and shifted to the intensive care unit  for recovery 
may it please your honour  now this is a case in which originally there were five accused persons  there were five accused persons  and the police was able to get the presence of only three persons they could arrest three persons  so we have started with the case against these three accused  two have clarified right from beginning interruption they are not there no one of them  thereafter your honour was pleased to frame a charge against them on two accounts the charges execute them  interruption  against three persons interruption  three accounts interruption  which is that charge number sir ? interruption  that is there that i'll i'll i will be giving up that charge sir thirty seventh read is bombay police act for that purpose i have not laid the evidence sir  because in order to prove the charge under bombay police act  it is necessary for the prosecution to show that the promolgation  order was duly exhibited and it was promulgated in various parts and not only that but there was it was specially also there interruption yes yes the bandra police station then i have to examine the constable i have to examine the police officer i have to produce the diary entries showing all those things which has not been done in this particular case  therefore as it has cou code  number three two words your honour can take it that the prosecution has not laid any evidence on that account  therefore now the first charge is that your accused number one two three along with absconding accused motu mota umesh and kadam on or about the third day of april nineteen eighty-eight at about eleven ten hours in presence of the common intention at open place near harbour railway line   shun shunting track pragati nagar  matunga dharavi bombay at nine committed murder by intentionally  and all knowingly causing the death of iyengar  silkrumal pandu and thereby committed an offence punishable under section three naught two read with section thirty-four of the indian penal code and within the cognizance of this court  now second this is one charge of murder  murder in respect of iyengar  second charge is under section three nought seven sir  that charge is that you accused number one two three  along with the absconding accused umesh and kadam  on about third april on the same day at about eleven thirty-five in presence of common intention did an act of causing with  rampuri knife and koyta causing heart attack near government milk booth opposite madrasis masjid dr ambedkar road matunga bombay with such intent interruption  ahn with such intention and under such circumstances that if by that act you had caused the death of kadu hosappa achari kadu hosappa achari you would have been guilty of murder but the kadu he is survived and therefore  and that you caused the hurt to the two words and thereby committed an offence punishable under section three nought seven of the indian penal code with read with section thirty-four of the indian penal code and within the cognizance of your honours court sir  now therefore there are two charges one charge  interruption yes interruption because i have not laid any  interruption in entire view  no evidence has been laid  therefore as we got third cause prosecution itself is that they have not proved the third charge because no evidence was there on the third charge sir  now your honour as far as the background of this case is concerned actual interruption actually we started recording the evidence on fourteenth october ninety-two  prior to that this case went from various courts to various courts and thereafter ultimately it came to this court sir  till then the accused prevent at the trial court from commencing the trial sir interruption did not allowed  interruption  they made all efforts to see that the accused that the advocates are made to run away  they would say that we don't want these advocates we don't want that advocates and ultimately even the court also cancelled those prosecutors they made allegations against the court also  all types of allegations were made and subsequently the case has come to this court  moment the case came to our court we we immediately framed the charge and started with an assertion proceeded from day to day  right upto eighteen december  on eighteen december ninety-two i closed my case  thereafter it was expected that immediately your honour will  take upto thirtieth  that your honour has done  and after two words judgement of the accused it was expected that i should start with the argument and the defence should do immediately commence with their arguments  unfortunately mr seth the defence advocate on behalf of number two and three went out of bombay making a promise to this court  that he is going to give a written argument or if he is not  then he will come and argue himself and at the most it will take another two or three months so your honour was to give then didn't  interruption by march interruption  and he said that but he promised that even prior to that  he would send the written argument so the interruption   haan they have got this to say  but nothing of this kind kind was done   it's only about couple of weeks that only two or three weeks back that he happened to be here in bombay and that is how we have fixed up this particular date for argue  therefore lot of delay has been caused in recording the evidence and the arguments because we started with the  recording of the evidence on fourteenth october and on now on fifteenth september i'm arguing the matter  therefore i'm sorry that i will have to take your honour through the evidence of each witness because nobody is expected it is not expected the court to remember what evidence was laid one year back practically one year back  so i will have to go through each and every witness read the evidence and thus start commenting on it  so i will start with the first witness p w one sir  interruption  in all in all in this particular case are examine  twenty-four prosecution interruption witnesses  to divide this into two separate compartments because some of the witnesses will be in respect of murder some will be in respect of the second charge interruption and some witnesses will be common witnesses namely when both both the accused both the persons were taken to hospital the same constable there he made diary entries etcetera  so there would be some common witnesses sir  then regarding scene of offence and all these thing some common witnesses will be there  so now we'll i'll start reading p w one sir so that will give the list of f i r  if your honour wants this facts i'll give the this facts sir interruption  now this has not been done in chronological order  we have not examined the witnesses in a chronological order  therefore some witnesses are pertaining to first charge immediately some pertaining to second charge  so whichever witness was available those witnesses were brought by the officers because the accused as i have said  in the beginning when i open up the case i said that these accused are notorious type kind of notorious character bad character  accused  and witnesses were afraid of coming  so the police officer mr ansari and other officers they had to take lot of pains to go and collect them search them and then get them here in the court  so it which ever is available i started examining  so normally otherwise what happens normally our practice is a a all prosecutors that  when we find that there is charge of murder then we start examining all the witnesses regarding that particular charge in a chronological order  then three nought seven same order and then some common things  doctors etcetera they are all common thing which are there  but in this case unfortunately for the prosecution it was not possible because victims were afraid they were running away and the officer has to go get them locate them and then they were brought here interruption  yes because they were afraid running away means they were they made themslves scared to the police officer  the moment they found that some officer from dharavi police station interruption  the people are interested but unfortunately for the prosecution  two accused are were abscounding and they are still abscounding  and and those accu accused persons has a gang and this gang was moving in that area with the use of this  tho constant fear in the minds of witnesses that these two other persons may not directly but through some other persons may attack them and therefore they were not willing to come interruption these interruption of course this gang consisted of this main five persons out of which two are now ab ab   absconding interruption ah yes  and apart from those those two persons again formed another gang because these three persons were not there they formed another gang  but then they were not directly coming in dharavi area they were sending those persons in dharavi area because they knew the moment they come to dharavi area these officers from dharavi police station ansari  and other other jadhav they will definitely arrest them because they would arrest them  therefore they would not come personally  they would send their other gundas there in that locality to settle everything interruption  and therefore this is the this therefore when i read the evidence some of the witnesses will be for first account some of the witnesses of second account  so i will then up subsequently while concluding the argument cough i will see that all those witnesses are i will  some arrange and then i will say that i will point out the exact interruption haan  then i will say therefore in this case this is the scene regarding this this witness is regarding this  that we can register afterwards  so therefore i will now start with the p w one cough  now the important point in this particular case is that this incident that taken place on the on the on sunday  it was on sunday third october   i'm sorry third april sir was sunday  interruption no third sir  it was third april nineteen eighty-eight interruption  haan nineteen eighty-eight  it was sunday and it was in the morning at about eleven ten  eleven ten or so morning time interruption  at an open place near harbour railway line shunting track  that was the interruption  so i am i am talking about the first offence of murder  interruption  so now was of the interruption masjid masjid  so now what i am giving is the first offence of murder took place first  so therefore i am giving this place interruption  at open place near harbour railway line  interruption matunga  harbour railway line shunting track  this track which was not operated except for shunting purposes  pragati nagar hutment at matunga sir one word  but interruption dharavi sir interruption no it comes in dharavi sir  and now as it has this is the incident regarding murder of  iyengar and now i'm giving the timing of the  other persons  that is uh kaju kadu   hosappa achari regarding three naught seven there the timing is about eleven thirty interruption  no because we have started with the evid i am why i am  tak talking about this because the p w one is kadu achari when i read the evidence i'll  be reading the the evidence of kadu achari  therefore i'm giving the timing sir   kadu hosappa achari interruption because we started with the evidence of kadu achari p w therefore  i'm giving this first these particular timing sir  so this incidence took place at the masjid dr ambedkar raod opposite some madras maderesa maderesa   ka kazi masjid ambedkar road matunga and this took place at about eleven thirty sir  now there is a connection between this murder and that murder in the sense that iyengar happened to be the  brother-in-law of achari   iyengar who was dead was murdered was the brother-in-law of the witness achari interruption  he is husband of his sister  i will tell your honour why i examined this achari  person 
as in the session ex ex ex is concerned against the accused number one  the prosecution has miserably failed to establish the charge p w one kadu achari in his uh evidence says  that i picked up a stone which was which which hit the rear side of the accused shoulder and the accused sat down  this statement this very version of the evidence has been contradicted repeatedly not twice but repeatedly by p w three and p w one himself  according to the p w one he picked up one stone and that hit that one word  according to p w three the p w one has picked up two stones  this is the contradiction  now the p w one p w three says the accused number one was at distance of at about twenty feet  yes  and above all your honour p w one himself does not say  that he was assaulted by n h s  your honour will see page number five paga page number five   interruption  yes your honour i'm coming to the cross examination  before cross examination i'm coming to the cross examination  before cross examination let us see what the p w one has said  he had stated in examination you see  interruption  sir here are the contradiction which i want to point out  in this examination you see at page number six p w one says i picked up a stone and threw it at that n h s  which hit him on the rear on the rear side of his left shoulder thereafter all of these five assailants surrounded me and  assault started assaulting me  he does not say the effect of throwing and hitting with a stone  he does not say anything that the accused sat down  he says all the accused surrounded me and started assaulting me   interruption  no no what he says against   interruption  no i have to i am pointing out from the p w one himself  that he does not say as the latter said he does not say that n h s  has assaulted me   interruption  no no contradiction not in that sense i'm talking  contradiction so far as his sta his own statement is concerned uh his own evidence is concerned  contradiction not between the statement and the evidence   interruption  there were inconsistency between the e between the evidence of p w three and the examination in d  i realized in the cross examination  now here he says i picked up a stone i threw it it hit the rear side of sh of shoulder  of the n h s  he does not say that he sat down  he says then all of them surrounded me and started assaulting me  now your honour your honour thereafter p w one  further goes on saying they surrounded me  they started assaulting me  how how ?  mota umesh assaulted me with sickle on my left forearm big umesh assaulted me with by sickle on my right wait wait   big umesh assaulted me on the right thigh  he does not say n   interruption  no no no   interruption  your honour i'm not on that angle i'm not on that angle   interruption  he says interruption  no sir what he says that he was assaulted by c d e and f  he does not say he was assaulted by n h s  he says he was assaulted by mr c with this  weap this weapon sickle d by sickle again d by this weapon and e by last e by  nothing no weapon is there  so he does not implicate n h s accused number one  that he assaulted him  page number six your honour top p w three at page number forty-six says that accused number one told the other assailants  to assault him  page number forty-six your honour  yes yes  so yo interruption  no your honour interruption i'm coming to that your honour  here i wanted to draw your attention on this this piece piece of evidence that he has not implicated the n h s so far as any weapon is concerned with which he was assaulted interruption  this achari's statement interruption  the three nought one coming to that  so far as this interruption  three nought seven also interruption  sir interruption  thirty-four interruption common intention  interruption  sir therefore your honour the common intention is to be proved  uh i'm coming to that also  first of all charge under section three hundred  interruption  not i want to prove the insistent inconsistency with the piece of evidences  now here interruption uh at page your honour at page number four he says that accused number  page number five your honour sir p w one says n h s  was armed with button knife  sir we had interruption  where your honour interruption  where your honour this is there is a lot of inconsistency with  in the evidence of the same person  your honour once approved that the case which is defective because of the infirmity of the evidence  no then there is no point question of common intention your honour  interruption  here your honour he says that all the accused assaulted me there he says that i was having the butto he was having the button knife  and what he has stated before p w seven came that m g r was having sickle  p w three says n h s was having sickle  nobody says button knife interruption  no i'm connect see i'm read it jointly  connect jointly connect  so that uh any uh any formal statement can be made before the court interruption  so your honour my submission is my submission is your honour  that the particular witness p w one has not stated any previous evidence that he was assaulted by p w uh he was assaulted by accused number one with any weapon  interruption  no your honour your honour has corrected my word can't i instead of contradiction inconsistent  yes your honour  aa at page number thirty-four your honour what p w three says about the stone  your honour if if that is so your honour then nothing remains  if the stone is hit to the accused then accused sat down  interruption  i am a interruption  i am on the point there once that interruption p w one sustained injury he sat down if he sat down  and if he sustained injury he cannot be expected to act  actually to assault the accused num of p w one is the means it's this acc aa accused   number one would have suspect is accused number one would have been  hit with that stone  and his commission was that he sat down accused number one according to the evidence of p w three p w one that he sat down and thereafter your honour he cannot be expected to act actually to assault someone to that extent  he could not bear even a stone  that was his health  so your honour your honour presuming the two days later as  interruption and sat down thereafter  thereafter what happened ? thereafter they went away interruption  your honour according to p w three thereafter accused number one respected accused was rest of the accused  according to p w three were assault  that means accused number one did not assault at all  para twenty your honour page number forty  your honour not only that he was simply hurt he shouted  in a expec interruption page number forty para twenty one  page forty interruption  here n h s was armed

accused was having  which weapon interruption  no mainly on the benefit of doubt it is not over yes which which arm interruption no no assault assault with what ?  interruption  the same witness interruption number p w three herself says at page number forty-five p w three says i cannot say as to who was armed with which weapon  when she cannot even see the weapon with which her own husband was assaulted in in her before her own eyes  she cannot see all she cannot interruption she cannot exactly say who has assaulted interruption  she cannot exactly say who has assaulted  just merely taking somebody's name interruption  sir blood mark on the knife though before before the court when you had pointed out the knife  he says there's there's no blood mark on the knife interruption  it was it was sealed in the wrapper interruption  it was sealed labelled interruption  if if if at all the blood was there it should be there  interruption  no no it is it is very risky to leave this type of evidence your honour when she says at page number forty-five i cannot say who was having what type of weapon interruption  then uh it will be very hardship if the portion of the evidence which goes in favour of the prosecution is to be selected  and the evidence the fortune of which something might even  interruption  yes there are contradictions your honour  here i will point out the supreme court judgement whenever there are two versions one goes in favour of the accused one goes in  fav against the accused the version which goes in favour of the accused or any version chosen by the accused interruption  no no here interruption  they have what interruption  yes your honour at page forty-five she says i cannot say  what type of weapon who was having interruption  why should i put that he he was having this weapon  interruption  sir how can i suggest that i was having weapon i was not having knife i was having sickle can i suggest him interruption yes your honour interruption  at last line paragraph thirty-six she says i cannot say as to interruption  cross examination interruption  forty-six last line i cannot say as to who was armed with which weapon  so that both the witnesses p w three and p w one  i have not established any particular weapon which i was having  either sickle or a a knife therefore the assumption is that i was not having any weapon either sickle or knife  at page number thirty-four your honour the p w three says  n h s and asami told to kill my husband   here here also your honour told  so your honour may say that there are having common intention  your honour here also the n h s is inactive  he does not inactive   he doe he does not act  positively by assaulting  after hitting with the stone interruption regarding

no sir i am not yet started page i'll i'll  give you the pages whenever it is necessary  my my line of argument will be sir that i'll be  dealing with a case against me  i have divided that according to my learned friend the case in two parts  one is scene two and one scene seven  same uh witnesses  i have uh i have divided  now sir according to i need not tell your honour your honour is well aware your honour is uh has read the evidence and well aware of the the prosecution interruption  yes sir i will be i will be giving a written statement argument also  interruption  yes sir i'll be putting interruption  yes sir interruption  no no sir e e interruption no no it is ready sir it is in my interruption  size sir it wil be sir i interruption  no no sir your  my handwriting uh my my my handwriting is very clear sir  alright sir i'll i'll get it typed   i'll get it typed i'll get it typed sir  doesn't matter sir i'll get it interruption   i'll argue orally orally also  on the same point interruption  your honour may at present your honour may not take  interruption  yes yes sir at present your honour may not take when i  when i am commenting on his argument from the note then your honour will take  because at present i am arguing from my own note which  i'm going to present to your honour yes interruption  now sir as as my learned friend has put it for three hundred and two four wi eye witnesses are there sir  the first eye witness is santosh iyengar pandu  who is the son of deceased  and the the rest three are there sir  the second is arif jauhar  third is kadu timothy and fourth is nasreem  shafi  these are the four persons now i'll i will take one by one   i'll take uh uh p w seven santosh  son of the deceased iyengar sir  my submission is sir that this witness is out to help the prosecution being the blood relation of uh iyengar  as well as kadu achari  so as his sister's son interruption  these are interested witness sir interruption  but sir unfortunately unfortunately yes sir  i i i'm not i am interruption yes sir  interruption  yes sir  i i'm not saying i i i am i am alluding sir few things i will have to admit sir  one one of these is the one the the uh iyengar  has been assaulted and his death has been caused  we don't dispute that  there is also no dispute interruption  who assaulted who assaulted yes interruption   haan accused number six one part accused number  interruption  yes sir so wha interruption  yes sir what and we have taken and whether whether these witnesses who have who have come here and deposed are  trustworthy witnesses in favour of accused number against  accused number two and three  this is way i'm i'm going to start  now the first thing is sir why he insisted witness  because sir they all are uh being close rela uh it is on their evidence that this uh santosh and his mother  after iyengar was removed to the hospital they also followed and went to the hospital  so in that case santosh was in the hospital on three four eighty-eight sir  as my learned friend has pointed out that officer were very alert enough they have examined the eye witnesses on that same day  but your honour will see sir that the evidence of this p w seven has not been re recorded   on on three four though he was available and present in hospital sir interruption   santosh though he was present and available to them in hospital and they were very alert enough to examine all the eye witnesses on the same day if not if uh in the hospital sir   in in in in the in the police station but same day  i am talking of the same day  but though your honour will assign that the statement of  santosh has been recorded on four four eighty-eight next day sir  why why this this uh has been postponed sir  my submission is sir interruption  time is not given  on on i have seen that the original time is not not mentioned sir  but date is date is four four interruption   santosh sir in marathi  the date is four four eighty-eight  time not mentioned sir  i sent to the return services there sir but i have seen it and uh i didn't find it  yes sir  anyway sir  now why this why this delay of one day sir interruption  my submission is sir that the officers when they recorded the statement of eye witnesses specially this arif  kadu and such interruption when they recorded the statement of these p w arif jauhar kadu timothy and  nasreen  in their statements they were not they had not emphatically  said about the assault on seven two and three on  iyengar  their names were not given  therefore they wanted somebody to give the names of these two assailants  further these these two assai  assailants there according to the prosecution  they were known to kadu uh achari and p w three kadamma  because they have seen them in that labour camp locality  and they were knowing the names and therefore they want to put  put these names of names of number two and three in the in the mouth  of p w seven and therefore this delay of one day sir  and therefore my submission is sir that he he is a witness  who being a blood relation is one thing he is out to uh uh say that this uh both these persons and another thing is is that he is under the thumb of the these these two police to say what they want to say  i specially name number two and three  and therefore this delay as i i have already told  yes beg your pardon sir interruption  so he has he has named it three persons only sir  because sir they wanted to in involve  these persons and therefore uh his uh statement has been delayed interruption  yes sir recorder is underneath  now sir let us see the e ev evidence  on record sir  what type of evidence on record has been recorded sir  now he has he has stated sir that the big umesh  assaulted my father by knife i do not recollect on which uh sir it is uh page page seventy-five line eighteen to twenty your honour  interruption  seventy-five sir  ha big umesh assaulted my father with knife  i do not recollect on which portion of the body of my father  was assaulted by big umesh  so i  now sir if if he if he has seen the assault then he should tell sir on which part  as sir your honour will will see sir here he has given  that accused number one assaulted iy   iyengar on chest stomach chest hands and legs  so he'd he'd given given definite part  in his case if he had really seen it sir my submission is sir that he he he should have given the part but he does not give sir he said i don't recollect  but recollection i mean uh that that can't be any reason  for whether whether he has seen it or not seen it that is these are the only two que questions we can we have to answer sir  now this this also sir uh uh is an imp   improvement and uh omission has been proved uh in the  in in the statement uh your honour i will tell one minute  it is one ninety-seven sir  one ninety-seven  page one ninety-seven your honour  no i'm sorry sorry is this this uh contradiction is not proved  this contradiction was not proved   i'm sorry  then sir further up uh at page seventy-five only sir line twenty twenty to twenty-two sir  he says sir   even my father was crying for help nobody from  from the neighbour aaa neighbouring area came forward to help  as n h uh n h s and his associates were threatening  the uh members of the public by saying that that they will kill them  they will kill them  this implement is is proved but yet i'm sorry sir  at page one ninety-seven line three sir from below one ninety-seven line three from below sir  uh uh p w seven did not disclose be be  before me that when when his statement was recorded that accused num uh that and that uh that the two absconding accused threaten the members of the pu   public while interruption  public that's all interruption   haan by that time sir  because it is not mentioned there interruption  yes sir  sir this this contradiction has been has been proved  that he has not said stated so  sir this this is this is definitely a improvement a before this honourable court sir interruption  yes sir  then further sir  i i narrated the the incident to them  this is this is at uh page seventy-six your honour  i narrated the incident to the to them that my father was assaulted  however i did not utter the names of the assailants  now sir if he has not given the names of the assailants  then immediately after the assault he goes to the mother and and tells this i mean part uh uh tells this information  so he has seen the incident if he had seen the incident he could have given the names  my submission is sir that time if he has not given the names that means either he has not seen them sir or he has seen some persons whose names he did not know  this this this can be only two possibilities  then sir page seventy-eight line eighteen to nineteen eighteen and nineteen your honour interruption  yes your hon uh lines were drawn on the ground by chalk  yes yes sir interruption  yes  so and now your honour will see will see sir that all other witnesses specially ka kadu   p w nine sir because he is the person who has who has produced that challa game board  it was cardboard  everybody says that it was a cardboard and uh specially this  kadu he has produced that cardboard  and therefore sir this man when this man says sir that knife is gone on the on on the ground and then in the square  that means this also shows sir that he has not sir he was not present at the at the scene of offence  because what is the fact he does not know sir  now about kadu timothy sir he has he has stated before  the this honourable court sir  for playing the game the the that is at ninety-seven line seven eleven seven to eleven sir in the in the statement of kadu  sir   for playing the game of challa eight  kaudis small stones and cardboard are are required the above mat uh above mentioned material which are required for playing the game were produced by me  he has stated  so actually it was a cardboard when this request states that lines were drawn on the ground that means he has not seen the  he was not at the scene of offence sir  then further up sir  then i come to the the the uh another eye witness p w eight sir  ar arif jauhar  he is a ra ra ra radiator  mechanic ra ready to repairer sir  he admits that he does not have any re  regular training in radiator repairing  he only learnt from his brother who is a who is a radiator mechanic  he is carrying on his business on pavement at karnaik bandar sir that is there in the evidence sir  he he does not he he does not possess any licence for his  business that is at page eigh eighty-nine   your honour  now sir if a person is carrying a business that too on on the path pavement then he must he must have at least a some some place to carry on business because it it can't be carried out on on just on the road sir  this is the in make making uh radiator radiator repairy if he if he has got a shop or a place then he must have a licence for that he doesn't possess anything any document  he has stated sir i will just point out interruption  he said i was he was carrying on the business on on he was carrying on the business on pavement interruption pavement  sir pavement also doesn't doesn't mean that he shouldn't have any licence sir interruption  he says carrying on the business sir carrying on the bus  any business sir anywhere that is licence is required  licence is required b m c licence is required interruption offence  oh yes sir  po po po policeman charged him  for not not not carrying the interruption  without licence interruption  on didn't say sir  so therefo therefore sir this man doesn't produce any evidence to show that he has he is carrying  interruption  he is carrying on the business  yes  he doesn't possess any document  therefore whether really he is carrying on such a business is not proved sir  now sir another thing about this witness i i wa  i want to say sir that he hasn't got any any uh uh regard for the truth sir because he changes the mat  version in just in a second or or sentence for  for that i'll i'll point i'll take your honour  he yes uh at page eighty-three your honour uh at uh line nineteen and twenty-two sir   iyengar was was also assaulted by three more  per associates of n h s  he said this  then sir interruption  of n h uh n h s interruption  now i said that then in the next he said now i say that two other re remaining associates of  n h s a a a also assaulted iyengar  so he make changes in this sir interruption  yes sir then then oh if he has he has seen a certain incident  then there is no necessity to change sir  i understand sir why it is changed i'll i'll   i'll tell your honour  because sir he must have got some some help or some uh audience and note carefully sir who just that you have you have  doing something wrong  so they must have put extra fingers instead of three  so he said two persons  why why he why he doesn't say in the same second line only  interruption  that is my argument he is you take it or or leave it interruption  then sir a question was put to him sir that the version na narrated by me in in yesterday day it doesn't effect that after after gateman refused to open the gate gate this is at page uh ninety-three your honour  the version narrated by me in yesterday's evidence  to the effect that after gateman refused to open the gate i'd  got down from the motor taxi and went to the shop of  yogendra  he is haan yogendra  he is incorrect  he is not correct  so he admits sir what he has stated yesterday was was not correct  therefore i want i am just pointing out sir uh what regard he has for the truth truth sir he himself admits that yesterday the uh whatever i stated was not correct  so my submission is sir that evidence of such a man sir who hasn't got any any regard for the truth should be taken with uh with pinch of  yes sir  then sir the about the inj about injuries to   kadu achari sir p w one  point is sir about the injuries he has mentioned  interruption  you are saying sir  i i i am reading when when i was standing there i i saw  ka interruption  line is like like this sir when i was standing there i saw  kadu kadappa achari kadu kadappa was being brought there on stretcher  so uh i just wanted to uh show these two lines only that he was brought on

umesh shelake  this witness has been examined by the prosecution in respect of the second charge and he has uh supported the prosecution to prove the second charge in para two of his evidence  p w number thirteen is one word bissar khan  in para three of his evidence he has stated that accused has committed this offence and he has deposed for the charge number two also the learned special p p has canvassed that after the incident the accused was not traceable  he was arrested at ahmednagar 
sir in this matter the prosecution has examined  prosecution has examined in all five witnesses to prove the charge  against the accused who is charged under section three nought two  that is for committing the murder of his wife  the presecution case in brief is that on eleventh of september nineteen ninety-two at about four thirty there was a quarrel  between the present accused and his wife  the quarrel was on the ground that the accused wanted  his wife to assist him in the job of his alleged job of pick-pocketing joint venture joint venture  and since she refused to do do that there was a quarrel it has further that she poured kerosene on herself to teach a lesson to him and the accused threw a lighted match stick on her set her on fire  thereafter the accused goes away from that place and this burnt lady is taken to the hospital by one of her neighbours  there the entire case is on circumstantial evidence in as much as there is no direct eye witness in this matter  yes the prosecution has relied upon dying declarations  namely the first dying declaration made before the special executive magistrate that is p w one  yes then the second dying declaration is in the form of the f i r which is recorded by the officer and obtained her signature now since she is dead this f i r will become a dying declaration  and then the third dying declaration which should be oral  is alleged to have been made to her mother who had gone  immediately to the hospital on being informed about the alleged incident   in marathi  the first dying declaration that is which is alleged to have been made or have been accorded by the s c m that is deposed by p w one who is the s c m himself who has stated that on eleven nine ninety-two he recorded the dying declaration in k e m hospital at about na eight p m  that declaration was made by one mrs binaka bakat who is deceased in this particular matter  she was in a possession to make her dying declaration  he asked a questions and she replied  now if your honour takes a look at exhibit five which is the dying declaration which is recorded by the s c m p w one it is in form of question and answers  written in question an answer form and it bears the thumb impression of this deceased  it was after it was duly read uh recorded it was read over to her and then her thumb impression is obtained  now it would be argued by my learned friend that there is no endorsement of the doctor on the uh alleged dying declaration to which my submission would be that p w three and p w four  specially p w four who is the doctor who had first treated this patient  has said that the patient was in a condition to speak  that would show that the patient was never unconscious and therefore coupled with that p w number p w number is four is miss ram who has  treated this patient  she she has deposed that the patient was conscious was in a condition to speak  then sir if your honour sees the cross examination of p w one  that is the s c m  sir a question has been asked to him that and he has answered  i did not obtain permission in writing from the doctor before recording this dying declaration  but then no other questions have been asked to this s c m  as to why he has not done it or was it his duty to do it  such questions have not been asked or no explanation has been sought from the s c m regarding this fact  the evidence of the evidence of p w four yes yes p w four has also stated p w three has also stated and p w number three  the doctor who has perform the postmortem  he has given his opinion that with fifty-six percent superficial burns the patient will be in a condition to speak  then and if your honour sees the evidence of p w four fourth line the pa the deceased binaka bakat had fifty to fifty-five percent burn injuries  the patient was in a condition to speak  p w four in the examination in chief the fourth line  then the other most important witness to this fact would be  p w two who is the mother of the deceased  who was had gone immediately to the hospital on receiving the information and the deceased has told her told her about the incident  then then sir was patient speaking to p w number two yes yes yes  i will come to that evidence  but p w one there is no suggestion to the s c m that the patient was unconscious  there is no suggestion or n no cross examination to the effect that the patient was unconscious  p w number one and to p w number one yes she herself told uh told her about the incident and as to how she got burnt so there is no suggestion to p w two also  sir as far as p w number two is concerned her evidence is to the effect that on eleven nine ninety-two at about four thirty she was in the house  at that time the accused came to her accused came to her  that is p w number two who is the mother of the deceased  accused came to her told her about that her daughter is burnt  and then and then at that time accused told her that he would bring money for medicine  and then he does not come back to the hospital  that is the conduct of the accused he told that p w number two  reported about the incident and asked her to bring money no no  and  he   two that   no no  he said that he would bring money  he would bring money   money to the hospital for medicine but he does not come back to the hospital  that is the conduct of the accused  yes that your honour will find on p w number two page  your honour will find it on the very first page paragraph one uh sorry  yes  page the first page of uh p w number two  paragraph three  your honour has got on eleven nine  p w number two that is maibai  yes para para number three on eleven nine ninety-two at about four thirty p m i was in my hut  at that time accused came to me and informed me that your daughter is burnt and he admitted her in a hospital  i immediately came to k e m hospital  at that time accused told me that he would bring money for medicine he did not return to the hosptal  at that time my daughter was in a position to talk  now further  yes the next page i asked her as how she sustained burn injuries she replied accused was demanding money for uh drinking alcohol  she req refused to give money to him  he started beating her and told her to assist him in pick-pocket business  so that two words  yes so that will show her position she was in a position she had people talk yes  incident two so this is the second dying declaration  again again if your honour sees she noticed the burn injuries on her part below the chest  on page number first page itself on the first page last line earlier page your honour is seeing paragraph three the earlier  earlier page earlier page  the last line i noticed burn injuries on her part below the chest that would show that this part is alright there is no burn injuries and doctor are  is when i come to that evidence i will point out to your honour that those burns were superficial  they are not those deep burns where the patient would be  uh sort of coma or unconscious  it is not the case  then this witness has also given the her in her evidence  as to how this uh her daughter was burnt  she has said that yes she poured kerosene on herself and the accused throw lighted match stick  there is no improvement if she wanted to improve she would have said that the accused threw the kerosene and set herself on fire  this is the most natural conduct of this witness of coming before the court and deposing the truth  the truth which has taken place and whi   which she has heard from the deceased  yes  the cross examination is nothing much to the effect to distort her evidence and there is no suggestion to her that  the her daughter was unconscious  then then sir the next witness is p w three doctor ramesh  ba bane who performed the post mortem  yes  he says that it was a case of homicided death  page uh paragraph two the very first line  due to burn injuries  then immediately the next line i noticed following external in uh in uh injured injuries   on the dead body superficial to deep thermal burns over the uh various parts  yes then internal examination fa noticed the following injuries  cause of death was due to the complications following fifty-six percent superficial to deep thermal burns  then the next next page would be i  important that is i notice burn injuries over dead body from the chest to abdomen  the injuries were fifty-six percent burn injuries nerves ends were damaged of the dead body  in the given case though the patient sus  sustained fifty-six percent superficial burn injuries she will be in a position to talk  yeah  then the cross examination  even the patient sustained fifty-six percent superficial burn injuries she can survive except if there is no toxamia developed  in this case toxamia had developed  both the hands of the deceased were burnt  i cannot say both palms of the patient were burnt or not  that has been clarified by p w four  in this case toxamia had developed  yes  yes if no toxamia had developed she would have survived survived yes here he has stated that toxamia has developed  then the next witness is p w four doctor maya ram   who was who's the doctor who had first treated this deceased  then she has stated as i pointed out the patient was in a condition to speak the fourth line  yes then she has proved cer  certain case papers of the indoor papers she has fairly stated that certain papers should not conversant with the writing or  she'll know does not know whose writing it is  that portion has been marked x  but the portion which she has said or which she had accepted  uh it is written by the registrar and there her signature or initials are there  so this doctor uh in the cross examination has stated in the last line left upper limb had zero percent burn  the last line  where ? the right uh uh the line above that the right upper limb of the patient have five percent burn injuries  sir this was asked with the purpose that the thumb impression which is on the f i r the thumb impression which is on the dying declaration because of suggestion was put to the s c m that that is not then the thumb impression  in order to uh support the defence story this question was asked which the doctor has opined that there were no burns or zero percent  therefore the thu thumb  impression is of the deceased  it is of her mark the s c m has obtained or the yes yes on the dying declaration on the dying declaration as well as on the uh f i r  yes  then we come to the evidence of p w five the  investigating officer who has recorded the f i r and drawn the scene of offence panchanama that is exhibit eight  now sir he has stated that he was on duty then on receiving the telephone message he he had left to k e m hospital  thereafter he called the s c m that s c m recorded the uh  dying declaration and then he himself again recorded her statement which he has treated as an f i r where he has obtained the endorsement of the doctor that the patient was in a condition to speak  that is exhibit fourteen given by doctor khubchandani   doctor khubchandani's e   endorsement has been proved through doctor ram p w four who's conversant with the uh uh handwriting of doctor  khubchandani  it is endorsed by  by p w four whose conversant with the handwriting and signature of doctor khubchandani and who has stated whereabouts of khubchandani is not known  yes then sir on the f i r the endorsement is after the  uh body of the f i r is written thereafter the endorsement is written  to which the officer has given an explanation and that explanation is on page eleven  the doctor was very much present while the complaint was being recorded  since the doctor was very much present while the complaint was being recorded thereaf therefore i have not obtained the endorsement of the outside of the complaint but at the end of the complaint  there is no challenge to that effect by my learned friend that  this endorsement has been subsequently obtained to that effect 
your honour this is a case where earlier the section was applied was three nought seven  but later on as the as the deceased as the pa as the patient was uh succumbed to death it was altered into three nought two ipc your honour  no  three nought seven to three nought yes three nought two  yes five p w's were examined by the prosecution  five prosecution witnesses were examined by the prosecution  but uh there is no eye witness in the whole case unh  whole case rested upon the circumstantial evidence and three dying declarations  as far as your your honour dying declaration by the s c m is concerned the the first dying declaration recorded by p w number one s c m is concerned there is no any endorsement of the doctor to the effect that the patient was in a fit uh fit there was no endorsement that the patient was uh despondent is in a fit state to make a declaration  then then as such it wishes it wishes the whole dying declaration  and then ans as such it wishes it wishes the whole dying declaration  because there is no endorsement of the doctor to the effect  that patient was conscious and was in a free state of mind what number but uh inspite of the fact that uh no endorsement of the doctor was obtained in evidence of p w number five on page uh your honour as far as p w number three is concerned he is a doctor who has uh he who has uh performed the post mortem your honour and what is relevant is at the time of the  one word  yes your honour it is very much necessary because as far as the doctor's endorsement is concerned your honour it is relevant because at the time when the declaration was made whether the patient or the despondent was in a condition to condition to depose  is very much material but the doctor is there   and and and and this this   when the doctor is present before them yes your honour and uh in this case apart from whether the con patient was in a condition to talk is not sufficient what is sufficient is the mental act as well your honour  a patient uh if it is a an incident as alleged by the prosecution then a patient can be under the mental shock  yes proceed and maybe due to one reason or the other his uh  reasoning capacity may be affected  she may not be able to understand the questions which were put to her  the  yes and uh here your honour it is a clear case that uh it is she herself it is not the case that i had uh gone and i had read the message but i fully aware your honour that it is a superficial when injury everything is there and your honour when uh even the i o also here says that uh doctor was very much present  even the evidence of p w number four was also there that he was very much present at the time  who ? your honour i am relying upon the evidence of uh p w number five upon two  here he has said this since the doctor was very much present  while the complaint was being recorded  your honour i am on a on the point that when the  pa condition of the patient was not serious as alleged by the prosecution  as far as your honour condition uh whether he is in a condition to make a statement or not that of course honour my honest submission is this that the make it clear  p w seven doctor ram who has first treated this patient immediately after the patient was brought to the hospital has deposed in words that she was a con in a condition  to speak  your honour my question was that whether at the time of admission he was in a condition to talk or not  i am not on that point your honour doctor miss maya  your honour but i am not on that point your honour i am not uh challenging the qualification of a doctor your honour i am also admitting that she is m s but i am only on the point your honour whether the time when the deposition was made it  doctor's endorsement was necessary to that effect and because  doctor's endorsement is not there your honour a reasonable doubt can be there your honour that he is not uh he may not be in a condition or uh or in a mental state to depose what she has deposed  yes  see the next point  yes your honour  my next point is in this incident your honour as far as uh  kerosene uh prosecution is silent as to from where the complainant or i'd say deceased has procured kerosene oil  different versions are before the honourable court  according to f i r your honour f i r is silent on this point as far as panchanama is concerned exhibit eighteen that a plastic bottle was containing kerosene uh kerosene oil as far as evidence of p w number three uh two is concerned mother of the de deceased but uh  number over six before the judge she has removed the yes it is exhibit  yes your honour but as far as the evidence of p w number two is concerned your honour p w number two says that uh yeah i am on page uh two upon two your honour that uh in anger she poured kerosene on her person from a lamp  and uh when i asked the same question in cross examination the uh witness says i didn't state in my statement before the police that my  daughter binaka poured kerosene from a lamp on her person  witness volunteered the lamp was made of a glass bottle  then what is there  that lamp was made of a glass bottle  that means she poured herse uh that means the deceased had poured kerosene oil uh from the bot uh bot glass bottle made uh lamp made of a glass bottle yes  and uh if that is so then there is a  contrad contradiction between the two that whether it is from the plastic bottle that she has poured the kerosene oil or from the lamp   as a fact what type of the bottle  it is from the lamp or from that plastic bottle exactly your honour but as far as the duty of the investigation officer is concerned your honour it is the duty to find out that exactly from where it was procured your honour  yes  thirdly your honour uh as far as keep the rest free yes your honour  thirdly your honour i i would uh like to submit that as far as the clothes under sealed the article under panchanama  is concerned your honour i am on that point  over this yes this point is over the kerosene is uh yes bottle or a lamp so yes your honour  article four article four before the court  yes now your honour my next point is regarding  my next point is regarding the seizure of article  what's that  seizure of article article  yes  now your honour in this case if we believe the prosecution case where there was a burn injury on the chest portion  from front chest to abdomen chest to abdomen  then in that case the blouse which was produced by the uh under panchanama seized in a seized and produce under  panchanama your honour that should be in burnt condition but here it is in torn condition your honour uh now this uh  now your honour in this case the only thing which i would like to say that now your honour as far as uh on this point your honour only thing i would like to submit that uh in forwarding letter in forwarding letter the officer has stated  certain queries in that queries your honour the first question was that whether the exhibit one two three contains any kerosene  and clear report to that effect is that on exhibit one two and three are positive  but no where your honour in clear report it is mentioned as a  blouse wa blouse was in burnt condition your honour  oh yes your honour and the a few words  yes your honour to have a kerosene on the article  and and your honour when the kerosene is sprinkled on the article uh like a blouse or any cloth material your honour then there is likelihood that uh it will burn your honour even it will not be in  this position secondly your honour i am on the point as far as uh cap   it nowhere the witness or the in f i r neither in the  at the scene of dying declaration your honour it is stated that it is sprinkled your honour there is difference between sprinkling and pouring your honour  here it is poured your honour but the  yes your honour but i am confining myself on the day of incident your honour  as far as on the day of incident is concerned your honour yes different version is versions are  there in the f i r and in the uh dying declaration your honour yes  as far as f i r is concerned your honour sh  she has stated that today that means on eleven nine ninety-two at about three pm my husband mahesh assaulted me  as i didn't go to collect scrap and further picked up quarrel with me  at about four pm that thing  there is a time gap of one hour  it means assaulting and between the quarrel  that means uh assaulted and picked up quarrel with me at three p m and at about four pm i poured kerosene on my own person ah  at about four pm i poured kerosene on my own person so so within article seizure of article seizure of very well your honour i will first confine myself to seizure of article your honour  as far as your honour seizure of article is concerned i will uh humbly submit that as far as uh this uh blouse piece is concerned  and if your honour will notice then i don't know whether uh  yes i think this is the first front portion  this is the front portion of the blouse your honour  and as per medical evidence your honour there was a  injury burn injury  i will say major burn injury on chest and abdomen your honour  in that case your honour this blouse would not be have been intact your honour  this is intact because if your honour will see ah this  if your honour will see the uh patti  your honour ha then it means this is a complete blouse  the only thing somebody has cut if your honour say that it may have cut uh by the c a uhm it is taken by the c a yes that's your honour  your honour my only submission is that looking into the condition of the bl this piece of cloth blouse your honour it is a full uh it is a complete one only it is in torn condition but not in burnt condition it is not torn here it is burnt  your honour but uh then i will submit that looking into the uh medical uh me me medical  evidence your honour  i will say that uh this is not a the  same blouse which could have been worn by the complainant on that day your honour  this is on that day  yes  and uh same is my argument as far as two sarees  are concerned your honour two sarees have been produced but  sarees  no your honour i am not on that point your honour  i am on different point now  as far as this is concerned i say it is not uh burnt but it is only in torn condition  but as far as this uh these two sarees are concerned your honour my submission is that that a person cannot wear two sarees at a at one time  and practically it is not possible to wear two sarees  uh on the time of alleged incident your honour  therefore so  it was one word  blanket blanket a few words  your honour if that is case then the prosecution has not brought on the record that uh why the two sarees  were used no no maybe sir there is as i stated that there is no eye witness in this case yes therefore i cannot say whether this saree  was worn by that victim only thing is that whatever the officers found there has been taken charge under the panchanama  but looking at the burnt saree it appears to be the saree which was worn by the  her victim  and obviously that because we have to see the  circumstances that strata from which this community comes  and  so strata society from which they are coming i know poverty  yes your honour i fully agree they come from different strata you have to explain that  to her two words blanket  no your honour i am not expecting your honour  but my only humble submi   a few words  yes your honour  and uh for that reason only your honour nowhere in the f i r nowhere in the evidence of the p w or the dying declaration your honour it has some   a few words if the articles are there the police have seized not uh yes your honour  yes your honour exactly this then why it is not the circumstance exactly the same thing your honour i want to submit that circumstances may not lie your honour  because two sarees are there why two sarees  are there your honour   a few words  your honour in that uh in that way i will submit about say your honour in f i r one gontat was there do you agree statement fully agree your honour and for that reason your honour i am submitting that uh because two sarees are there in f i r as well as in uh   one word  yes  a few words  no your honour as far as gontat is concerned because in f i r it is clearly mentioned that the  accused has tried to extinguish the fire by uh throwing a gunny bag or gontat on the burning person and therby he has tried to extinguish the fire and from where this saree has come your honour   one word

forwarding letter exhibit twenty-five collect recording broken  two signatures of uh p s i poi interruption  yes next para mr uh nanya appearing for the accused  has canvassed before this court that uh disposed that uh the accused is charged for the offence under section three nought two i p c  fullstop  he has canvassed three points before this full uh  before this court for uh consideration  they are as follows  point number one is whether this is a homicidal death second  whether that uh homicidal death was uh caused by the stabbing  the deceased by the accused and third if if it is so  what is the offence  full stop  next para  the learned special p p has uh canvassed before this court  prosecution has laid evidence of p w number one to seven and the documentary evidence to that effect in order to prove the point number one the learned uh special p p has invited the attention of this court to the evidence of doctor jaswant  tampure and p m notes ex at exhibit fifteen  according to the learned special p p the death was caused by uh haemorrhage and shock  therefore it was unnatural  he has also invited the attention of this court to the  postmortem notes and the opinion of the opinion express by doctor jaswant uh tanpure  he has also canvassed before this court that one injury over the uh  person of the deceased which which can also be prove fatal  according to doctor tanpure  in the instance case the injury sustained by the deceased  was perforated uh was uh eh has perforated the wall of the  abdomen  that is the reason why there was uh haematoma on both the kidneys because of the impact and force used in assaulting the deceased by the knife by the accused  full stop  the injury was uh caused by a rampuri  knife full stop  rampuri knife is not used for uh suicide by a person  a person committing suicide can commit suicide in the  house or uh at uh secluded place but not on the road  at uh ten pm  therefore suicide eh uh suicide in this case if  canvassed by the defence is ruled out in all possibilities and probabilities looking to the uh nature of the injuries nature of the injury sustained by the accused  full stop  even on fall uh falling on the ss some sharp cut shovel uh object is also ruled out to cause uh accidental death therefore all the probabilities and possibilities regarding of  injury by accidental and uh uh by accidental death is also ruled out  he has also canvass before this court that the defence  has not uh suggested to any of the prosecution witnesses in that respect that the deceased fell uh deceased met with an accident  in fact the learned sp special  p p has canvassed before this court that the defence of the accused is shifting the liability of this injury and the death of the deceased to p w number one two and three  therefore the learned special p p has canvassed before this court that there is there uh there is and in all probabilities the deceased met with the homicidal death  next para  he has further canvased in order to elaborate and uh  placed his reliance on uh second point is that that it is not the accused but it is p w number one two and three jointly killed  the deceased  full stop  in this respect the evidence of p w number one two and three is on the record  they support each other  they say that the deceased and the accused are known to p w number one two and three as there are uh from the same locality  therefore there cannot be mistaken identity  provocation in fact was given by the accused to the deceased by saying caw caw  full stop  also in this case cannot be make available to the accused  because he gave provocation to the deceased  it was not a sudden sudden quarrel  two parties at the outset were also separated by p w number one uh p w number one alone and uh and the same have cooled down as the accused thereafter went to his house and brought uh uh  rampuri knife article one from his house  he has also canvassed before this court that the offence  in this case was premeditated for the reason that the accused brought a knife caught hold o caught hold uh caught hold of the deceased by his uh one hand and pressed the neck of the accused and stabbed the deceased in his abdomen  he has also canvassed before before this court that there is no time to connect the uh sto uh to concoct the story  because p w numbers uh two and three came on the scene of offence after hearing the shouts after hearing the shouts caught hold uh  the hand of the accused in which knife was there and ask p w number three to call police  sufficient light was there at the scene of offence of the electric lampost of the municipal corporation uh on the road and from the shops in the surr uh in the surrounding vicinity full stop  there is no animosity between the accused uh and p w numbers one two three  there is no substitution of knife  p w number uh four in this case is examined for uh taking charge of knife and p w number uh five for taking charge of article numbers article numbers one and uh two shirt and lungi   the lear next para the learned special p p has also canvassed before this court that the the blood group of the deceased could not be proved as uh c a could not uh give the conclusive uh conclusive evidence  and uh the same the blood uh the blood file which was sent to the chemical analyser of which the result shows inconclusive  the blood group of the accused appears to be of o group  it also appears on articles one two and three cough  the same blood of group o was also found on the above said uh  articles  the blood found on articles one two and three and article five  is also uh is also the same  if the blood of uh the blood group of o was also found article five  then it fixes the liability of the accused that the accused had  accused and the accused has only committed the offence in the instance case  therefore the learned uh special p p has canvassed before this court that the intention of the accused was uh to assualt the deceased  hence the learned speical p p states that he was uh he has proved the case against the accused and he may be convicted  the learned defence counsel shri  chari appearing uh for the accused has canvassed before this court that that the blood group of accused is admittedly of o group she has uh c a has also opined that exhibit numbers one two three and five were having blood uh of blood group o  in this case the uh uh accused assaulted the deceased  with article uh three knife  the knife article three is having blood group of o  uh o category that is of the accused  the learned uh defence counsel then raised a query before this court and then uh and has canvassed before this court that in that case how is that that the blood of o group can be detected on article uh three  because according to p w number uh p w number one two and three accused assaulted the deceased by article three and that the knife had uh uh on its blade  full stop admittedly that blood on the knife can also of the deceased of o group  full stop it is possible that the deceased can have also the blood group  o  but iron of the blood sent to the c a for blood grouping of the deceased was analysed and the c a in his uh in this respect  uh in his report exhibit sixteen opined that the blood group of  uh exhibit uh one cannot be determined as the result results are inconclusive  he therefore uh doesn't say that the deceased was also having o group  but he says that the blood group of exhibit one cannot be determined as the results are inconclusive  next para then uh next question arises for the consideration  according to the learned defence counsel is that as to how the blood of the accused appeared on article three and five who was not assaulted by the deceased  no witness is saying that the deceased had uh also uh  also assaulted the accused  full stop  according to mr more therefore states that the accused is falsely implicated in this case and that he may be  acquitted  i have considered the arguments canvassed from both the sides  while considering the points raised by the learned by the learned uh special p p that whether this is a homicide death  full stop  looking to the evidence of p w number uh p w number six  dr jaswant tanpure and p m notes exhibit fifteen and the evidence of p w numbers one two and three is prima facie appears to be a homicidal death  it can be seen that from the p m notes exhibit uh exhibit fifteen it appears that there is only one wound one injury  on the person of the deceased that is incised wound over  right apochondrial region 
just wait uh  ah ha make this your honour uhm  your honour in this case the accused has been charged under section three hundred and two of the indian penal code  in this case clears throat the case is principally of  this is a case of what is called circumstantial evidence  this is a case of circumstantial evidence  in all matters the relevant definition is the definition of the word prove  the definition is the definition of the word prove and that definition is always relevant and i'm reading that definition  a fact is said to be proved when after considering the matters before it the court either believes it to exist or considers its existence so probable that a prudent man ought under the circumstances of the particular case to act upon the supposition that it exist  in other words the definition of the word prove in section three of the evidence act is a standard which is officially laid down for the purposes of highly given proof  this was later adopted in one case to which i will not come in this case i will come in a later case  your honour actually whether a given case is proved or not  has got to be admeasured with reference to this particular definition  in general sense this  in general sense  this particular definition section three  now section three relates to three types of evidence actually the evidence can be direct the evidence can be circumstantial  and the evidence can be partly circumstantial and partly direct  but the standard with reference to which the proof of a case has got to be assessed is in section three  the standard with reference to which the proof of a given case has got to be assessed is section three  on section three as i said there are three types of evidence  direct circumstantial partly direct and partly circumstantial now as regards circumstantial evidence the supreme court has  laid down certain guidelines  those guidelines are in the region of appreciation and not law  that must be understood  those guidelines are in the region of appreciation and not law  they're to be respected but they are not binding in the sense in which the interpretation of law is binding  they are to be respected  the reason is this what is the citation no i'm i'm coming to that citation is different  yes ci you know that that is year nineteen sixty supreme court page one nine zero  i will give your honour later on  page  one nine zero  my god this offence one nine zero yes  your honour one nine five  decisions even of the highest court on questions which are essential questions of facts cannot be called as precedents governing the decisions of other cases which must rest in the ultimate analysis upon their own particular facts  the general principles governing the appreciation of circumstantial evidence are well established and the and the broad  and beyond doubt or controversial  the more difficult question is one of applying this principles to the bare fact and circumstances of a particular case  your honour the point which we are trying to make out is this  those general principles are known  what is necessary is actually both application of this particular principles and taking the spirit of that particular principles and not the literal words   i'll come to that and explain  from the first ever case after the birth of supreme court in nineteen fifty-two was what is called the hanumanta's case  in year nineteen fifty-two supreme court page three forty-three now here he is going to use it against me and i know it  no no it's alright  continue it  supreme court  on page ? three four three  that was the first ever supreme court case which laid down the general guiding principles as regards circumstantial evidence  and what the supreme court in that particular case said was this   the main three principles which were laid down there in that particular case were that the facts must be first established  they must have what is called the conclusive tendency and they must be incompatable with any other hypothesis except  that of guilt  these are the three basic principles which were laid down in  hanumanta's case  and in the light of the principles which were laid down in  sup by the supreme court in that particular case clears throat we shall try to assess whether in this case the facts  cumulatively drive this particular court to the conclusion that the accused and the accused alone has committed that crime  your honour has followed  now let us go through the first case  so i will just  yes  your honour the first point is this p w six and p w seven were the office bearers of pushpavila's  co-operative housing society  yes  i have established  ah  have established that on the twenty-seventh of july nineteen ninety-one the accused was functioning as a watchman of that particular building  one  that is the first point  yes and being a watchman and being on duty from nine am  on that onwards he was expected to be on duty throughout the day  expected to be duty on  throughout the day  yes  number two  yes  being a watchman he had an easy access to all the tenements  of that building  now this is very important  yes  this is important for this reason that no lady who is all by herself in a flat will open the flat to an outsider  no lady who is all alone in the flat will open the flat to an outsider but will readily open it to a watchman  whose duty it is to protect them  yes third  since he was expected to be on duty throughout the day  he was expected to be available for help after murder not yet  after  supposing he has not committed murder someone else has committed murder and he is on duty  so he was not here it is he who is supposed to help that is what i am trying to say  being on duty he was expected to help  yes  being a watchman  yes  he was not only not available but was missing  and had to be traced through efforts  your next point  he was not only not available but was missing and had to be traced through efforts  yes  according to p w seven who is the chairman of the society  according to p w seven who is the chairman of the society  yes  this is at page twenty-three  yes he was wearing that check shirt which is article seven on that day   a few words  when he was on duty  both p w six and p w seven  this is article  seven  article seven  your honour this is very important i will give the list afterward  article seven was stained with group blood  a group a according to the c a report  what is uh the group of uh deceased ?  a your honour blood group of deceased was a because according to exhibit twenty-nine  yes twenty-nine is a exhibit according to exhibit twenty-nine  c a report c a report  the saree the petticoat the blouse the brassiere the curtain and the piece of curtain there are as many as  one two three four five six items which had a  group  your honour may take it down the saree  article three  blouse  the no no we'll go in order uh your honour   saree article three  petticoat article four  petticoat  blouse article five brassiere article six  yes and curtain article two all these items bore  a group and therefore i say that the blood group of the deceased was a although when the blood  was taken and sent to the chemical analyser independently he could not say  saree was wet no no no the blood of the deceased was taken by the doctor he could not conclusively say what group it belonged to because perhaps it had disintegrated  it happens sometimes that a given portion is disintegrated  but i say blood was taken yes also taken  but he could not express an opinion as regards the blood group  but i say that the deceased had a group by virtue of the fact that all these items had a group has your honour followed this  this is at twenty-nine exhibit twenty-nine will show this have you examine the group blood of the accused yes that is also a  that is  a  that is also a  that is exactly i will let let me complete the argument  one minute  your honour the point is although the blood group of the deceased according to exhibit thirty-one thirty-one is  a  deceased  no no accused accused his blood group the blood group of the accused is a  the blood group of the deceased also is a  according to this according to this you mean the mark  this is therefore of  yes that is the blood of the accused that is  a  i have taken care to ask the police officer at page thirty-eight para three i have taken the special care and  i'll read that  earlier on twenty-nine seven ninety-one we had sent the accused to the hospital for obtaining blood  when the accused was first arrested there were no injuries on the person of the accused   that's the point that is why this answer was taken  your honour i'm very vigilant about my duties according to  i'm very vigilant about my duties have you established no no your honour we'll go to him later on i mean  two words  otherwise my link will be broken  two words  no no   two words  your honour i'm not anxious to prove his blood lying on the saree i'm anxious to prove his blood lying on his own shirt that is what i'm trying to say  he could have well pleaded that he was injured and therfore he could have well explained but both on no no that is the main thing that is my argument that is not whole circumstances uh no no no your honour allow me to complete otherwise the whole thing will be  yes your honour article seven had blood group a  since he was not injured and since he was wearing that shirt the blood of the deceased has spurted on him that is what  i'm trying to say  the blood of the deceased had spurted on him the blood of the deceased has spurted on him on two items  according to the exhibit twenty-nine let me just add and it was here at page thirty-eight when he started the cross examination  my learned friend should have asked the police officer  yes  and cross examined this police officer on the point of there being an injury  he should have asked the police officer  and he should have put the case to the police officer that the accused was also injured  that is the main point in this case  and he did not do that  now the point which i am trying to make out there are two items on which the blood group is a article seven is one  and article  two two seven but it have no no  on article seven is a shirt shirt shirt no no we'll forget your honour the deceased the blood on the deceased we'll forget because since she is stabbed it is going to be full of blood  we are trying to book him and therefore the blood on him is relevant blood on the saree is not relevant at all it is bound to be stained with blood  total there are fifteen injuries on the lady so that is that presents more difficulty  the blood on the saree the blouse the petticoat and it is bound to be there  what about him  may i no no please please he says he has have had no no no you don't help anybody when i'm  i'm addressing i don't do you help yourself i can take care of myself  your honour there are two items let it be very clear  there were two items on which the blood group on his person was   a one is this shirt which he was wearing on the twenty-seventh when he was on duty at that building and when from which he ran away that is one  and the second is the shirt which he wore when he was arrested at bombay central police station and came back and which was taken on the mo taken charge of on the morning of twenty-eighth  which is article thirty-three 
it is duly proved by the prosecution beyond reasonable doubt  that is main point  my lord in this case that only this was there were  two witness from the society uh the p w six and p w seven now p w seven only he pointed out there are three watchmen are there my lord three watchmen  only he stated three watchmen uhn two  two two there are uh one he includes that the watchmens   watchmen are here in the society from the north no when i come to read this thing no ? so data should be of three watchmen  no that i come to look at and then that what idea in the mind you've got then i am going to come to that point my lord uh if there are three watchmen are there then i put the specific question mr pimpulkar did you recorded  record the statement of the if there were any watchman first point he says he has not recorded  secondly nobody has from from the society or watchman or p w six or p w seven this is a registered premises given to to   these three watchmen  they are residing together  and second thing they could the would be possibles have to prove the watchman should come and make a statement before the police officer or before the court that ke we are residing there along with this accused person  we are residing the this we are three watchmen of this building uhm  yes   nahi uh que que  question if we put up the whether you have recorded a statement of the any watchman he say no  so it is burden of the prosecution that to establish the guilt on uh accu this accused  here the watchman has to come say yes this accused was residing there when this article seven was seized then   no no not any watchman has pointed this is a shirt which belongs to accused number s this article belongs to this accused  there there is no evidence at all  only the only shirt was found and then only on suspect  they drawn the inference my lord  yes this is one aspect so there is no connection with the this shirt with the accused  when uh when this shirt was searched se   sealed with when shirt was taken under the  panchnama my lord  now now now next point uh next point my lord  only p w six and seven said when this shirt was shown to them  when this article seven i'll argue only on this point article seven  when this shirt was shown to them they identified so question was put up before showing this shirt whe  did you have you given description of this shirt  they said no we have not given description of shirt  now page twenty my lord  yes page twenty my lord pa para   six page page two two zero when he was cross examined i want that part my lord  para para two para two  yes  my lord may i read with your permission yes i have maintained a register of society employees the employees would not provide any any form  i will not give them the description of clothes of the accused  in my statement before the police  so i do not recollect whether article shown to me in the  possession of panchas known by the police  article shown to me i had not checked up the label of mark of shirt article and the article shown to me by police it was not taken out of sealed packet article seven not sealed in my presence after it is shown to me  with with great respect to my submission there are two things from the two things maybe gathered from this this evidence  before showing this there there is no description  second point when this shirt was shown he doesn't he doesn't he he do does not remember whether such whether shirt was shown in the presence of panchas   or not  so therefore it is inadmissable under section one sixty-two ci ci evidence act  because if it should be shirt was not taken in the hand of in the presence of two  two panchas  no no they did not when when statement was recorded  inst of the p w six and p w seven and shirt was shown but it was not shown in the presence of panchas  this this uh uh article seven this affects article  which it was not shown in the presence of panchas  therefore it is hid by under section one sixty-two  hence the statement must be seized and statement was recorded by by  it was recorded when the subsequent shirt was shown to them  so so that question is put whether this shirt was shown in the presence of panchas or not  whether these shirts article seven ah ha whether it was shown to in the presence of panchas what shown it shown shown disclosed whether this shirt sir was or your point is that this article seven shirt was not shown in the presence of panchas p w six and p w and seven seven yes my lord you wanted to prove that article should be shown in the presence of panchas   panchas yes my lord in the presence of panchas  if if it is if it does show on then it is hit hit by under one section sixty-two my lord  if it is sealed earlier uhm then it should be sealed should be opened opened in the presence of panchas  and then only it can be shown  uhm  yes  well uh we now that that is one of if it is this shirt now their case is there when this shirt was first taken under charge of panchnama by the panch  number two uh p w two  and it is their case it was sealed if it is sealed if it is so sealed the seal should be b br broken  in the presence of panchas and uh and this shirt should be shown in the pr shown to in in the presence of  panchas  that is that is one aspect  i sugge after showing this shirt there there was no sealing that is most important my lord  because this this shirt was shown to them there were no sealing and subsequently sent to c a my lord  after later days so many days  that is one point  my lord p w seven  after showing this shirt uhm to p w uh six and seven uh you normally your witness is one zero two  uhm   uh  only two six two is apart from p w number six and seven it was not shown to the others no there there other panchas were there my lord   one word  no they they would be just article seven apart from a few words interruption so only they want to they they established that the article seven in connection with three my lord  so with my respectful seven that the p w six or seven they admitted possession before showing this shirt they have not given description of article if it is not given description article and it would not show in the in the pre if it sealed if it is sealed it this seal was not br br broken   in their presence in so therefore we had doubt about this genuiness about this prosecution that is one aspect  now my lord whether further if i may take further evidence my lord  that if p w two is mo most  important of the prosecution witness p w two solid  now page nine my lord  page nine cross section para two  para two my lord  my l i if when question was put when this article seven is there any passivity mark man  manufacturing mark manufacturing mark this i'll  read my lord the fourth uh uh manufacturing mark of means there is need no label mark label mark this shirt was there is some marking on this  trade mark trade marks so that i i trade mark trade tra  if it is really taken under panchanama they might pointed out before in the panchanama this is nino  mark that it is not so mentioned in the panchanama  this there is no reference of manufacturing label nino  article seven in exhibit eight similar shirts shirts like this are freely available in the market  so this there is i now say panchanama was explain  now my lord the there is one point so similar question were put up p w six and seven whether there is any label or trade marks  whether did you point out in panchanama uh or in your statement or in panchanama they said nothing  my lord now  now my lord p w two further says when this shirt was found on the flooring it uh he further says the blood stains mark mark by police with the pen  the shirt was then sealed and packed and labeled  so it is presumed that the return must have must have done at that time in the premises my lord  that is one aspect  yes that is with uh why it is very important  this is a an incidence of the  panchanama on twenty-seventh july ninety-one yes  that is there case it was sealed mark everything, now my lord if it so my lord then this when they are searching at that time nobody was there only panchas  were there uh shirt was taken sealed  now with this we we come to evidence of p w one most important p w one  yes page two my lord from sixth line bottom  where  uh page two what page two page number two examination chief  where that  well nineth line from bottom  nineth line from bottom  yes police visited the watchman room seize the bloods  blood stained clothes from under the cot  these clothes were brought up before the police officer these clothes also packed which which were which were brought from the watchman room  if it is so if it is sealed how it is brought from the when this incident happened in flat  and this was shown to the this this part of panch panch at uh scene of offence  once if it is sealed if it is sealed then how it is being brought  yes it disturbs it get disturbs and i may be i am not clear  for the example my lord if this one packet here is sealed and if i point to that opened it if it if it is not sealed it is easily we may shown if it if it is if it is sealed it should be  so so their connection in this p evidence of p w one and p w two sir it is inconsistence evidence with regard to them  with if it is sealed then how it is shown it was already sealed that is that is one aspect  now my lord on the further point p w six  page number  page pa pa page number twenty page number twenty  pa page number page number   six uh page number two zero page number two   pa page page page

that blood stained clothes were taken they  by them blood stained clothes were were brought from the watchman room it was shown in the in the it was brought in the flat may i read my lord for that is

packed the curtain and rod also taken charge of blood stained   clap claping scrappings were collected in glass bottle they were packed  police also visited watchman room police visited room  seized the blood stain cloth from under the cot these clothes were brought up before the police officer and these clothes were also packed which were brought from the watchman room  so on the panchnama it

abolition of the gold control act has resulted in a fluctuation in gold prices  we have this report from our correspondent maya sharma  gold in our country is a precious symbol of wealth and security  but the gold market itself does not glitter quite so much  involving as it does inflated prices and large scale smuggling  the government's decision to abolish the gold control act  was followed by an initial drop in the gold price from pre-budget level  but the cost of gold in india continues to be much higher than in the international market  the domestic demands of gold is estimated at two hundred and fifty tonnes every year  less than two tonnes is produced by indian mines annually and about fifty tonnes is obtained from recycled gold  the huge gap between supply and demand is filled to a large extent by smuggled gold  those in the trade believe the current blanket ban on gold import  should be lifted arguing that this should bring down the gold prices  encourage export of jewellery and also curb smuggling  the government stand is that gold is not an essential item to justify expenditure of foreign exchange to import it  whatever the government's decision and regardless of the price the desire for gold is only likely to increase  mr sam petroda has been removed from the post of adviser to the centre for the development of telematics as well as vice-chairman of its

kerala is the southern most part of india  we are having many theatrical art forms and performances as a part of our culture  among our classical theatrical arts  kathakali is the foremost one  perhaps we may be able to point out chakyarkuta  and kudiyatam are the more ancient forms of classical art forms kathakali is more popular  we have got krishnanatam which might have  originated before kathakali  actually the first term used for kathakali   was aatam  and the first performance was based on the ramayana theme   ramanatam composed in seventeenth century or later sixteenth century by kottarakartampuran  at that time this ramanatam was not so sophisticated and it was not perfect in any sense   ramanatam is a story on drama  based on valmiki ramayana divided into eight parts just as   krishanatam is framed in eight days play form   krishanatam was popular in the south  northern part of kerala while ramanatam was popular  in the southern areas of the play uh land   ramanatam though was spreading slowly in throughout kerala gradually another composer  kotesampuran who lived in seventeenth century composed  four stories based on mahabharata  nivathakavachakalakeyavatham bhagavadham karmiri karmirivatham  and kalyanasaugandhikam  among these four plays kalakeyavadham became very popular  on the kathakali stage   kot kotechidambaran  composed these aatakathas and uh they are very popular of course but the major contribution to kathakali stage  by kotechidambaran is that he has stabilized the wa  method of presentation of this atam making much improvements on ramanatam technique  so the system evolved by kotechidambaran was popularly known as vettadda sampradayam  and from kotechidambran kathakali   became a sophisticated classical theatrical art of kerala and uh as far as the visual aspect of kathakali no major attempt was made to make a stabilisation in this art form  but in the later years there were many other styles just like kannadikot sampradayam kapling art sampradayam  etcetera  this kapling art sampradayam is the eighteenth century  modification made by one kapliknot nambudri which the then maharaja of travancore shri kartigeternol dyamavarma  kartigeternol dyamavarma composed not only  atakathas but he made a uh technical book a theatrical book a theoritical book balaramabharatam that is also  a very concrete evidence for the stabilisation of this art form  as far as the technique of kathakali is concerned it is a combination of the three forms of abhinaya nrita  nritya and natya  and in kathakali we find  padarthabhinaya in dense quality  as padarthabhinaya is there we find  bhavatmaka character also  every word is being depicted on the stage by the actor  according to the word and according to the bhava  for the relevant context  and we find natya aspects we find  nritya aspect we find nrita aspect also  there are four types of abhinayam aangika aahariya  wachica and satvica  this aahariya abhinaya abhinaya or action based on the costumes is very relevent to kathakali   the costumes are uh planned on the basis of  satvaguna rajoguna and tamoguna  there are different terms used for costumes pachha  minikka katti tadi kari etcetera  these are for various characters according to the story and uh in the uh aangika abhinaya context  we have to point out one very important aspect that is the gestural language  the hastamudras are employed in in a very  profused manner based on either natyashastra   or hastalakshnadeepika or balarambharatam   perhaps all these steps might have used by the uhm foremost compositors and actors   hastalakshnadeepika contain of course it is a kerala text on gestural language uh this hastilakshnadeepika  gives a very good evidence for the aangika abhinaya technique employed in kathakali  and all the actors see that they are basing on uh  hastalakshanadeepika where the twenty-four  hastamudras the samyuta mudra the  asammita mudra etcetera are uh used and utilised for each purpose  for example pataka tripatakam mudra kadagamugham uh shukatundam all these mudras are uh employed in this gestural language  likewise the rasabhinaya the  satyakabhinaya for that the navarasabhinaya is very important for each and every character  we take valour singara karuna uh shoka  or uhm hasya all these rasas  are being depicted in kathakali  but the presentation is on basis of bhavas   padarthabhinayatpada and bhavatmaga  is kathakali  so bhava is being conveyed through each and every word of the composition  the actor is presenting his action on the basis of this   pada   pada is sung by or the wak  wachikyabhinaya is performed by the musicians  the compositions are written in various ragas and  talas restricted to the kathakali style  the that style of singing is often called as   often called or referred as sopan sangeeta   sopana is a word used for a particular method of singing songs especially the geetagovinda songs on the steps of the shrine in every temple in kerala  so that is called sopana style  this sopana style is being adopted in kathakali singing uh eventhough there are ragas common to carnatic music and sopana style of singing the method of singing the rendering of singing is very different in sopana  style  uh kathakali composers uh adopting the  sopana style and there is an evidence in the  kathakali that uhn they incorporated item  manjutala  it is also called as melappada  this manjutala is a first portion of a  pada in uh geetagovinda manjutala kunjatala kelisadane that portion is being sung at the beginning of every performance of kathakali  and that denotes the adoption of kathakali style from the singing method of a ashtapadi or geetagovinda in the kerala tradition  so in the actor is performing his action on the basis of the wachikabhinaya performed by the composer the musician the main musician is called ponani the second musician is called sengadi  ponani and sengadi with uh instrumental music cymbals  chengala or eluttalam are being used by the singers  and on the basis of the wachikabhinaya the actor acts on the principle of padarthabhinaya and  bhavatmaga  he has the freedom to uh present his uh quality and efficiency in manodharmatam or ilagiyatam  while in chuliyatam he actually imitates the words through expression and uh conveying the meaning through the gestural language just like pataka mudra kadagamughum  shukatundam sarpashirsham uh mrigashirsham etcetera  so the gestural language is very important in  kathakali as it is important in kudiattam also  but in krishnanatam we don't find so much employment of gestural language there the dance technique is more important the nritya  and nrita are important while in  kathakali natya nrita nritya are also uhm equally important  the another aspect of kathakali we have to point out that we are seeing imitative action we are seeing  descriptive action we are finding symbolic action in  kathakali  all these techniques are employed together in kathakali   kathakali actor will have to undergo a training  a rigorous training for six or more years under an able guru  to become a good actor  uh and for that in kerala the gurukula  system of coaching was pre prevalent    now it is almost faded and we are having certain institutions like kerala kalamandalam instituted by poet laureate wallatol  narayan menon  he is the chief personality who worked behind the popularisation the modern popularisation of kathakali  in modern times  the kalamandalam margi in trivandrum and some other institutions are also giving training in this particular art form as well as it provides training in kodiattam mohiniyattam   uhn and other similar art forms of kerala  with regard to the literature of kathakali we are having about five hundred stories based on the puranas   ka ramanatam of course is based on valmiki ramayana and uh kotechidambaran stories  unnai's nalacharitam iraimentam stories are based on mahabharata and similarly we are having many stories based on ramayana  mahabharata and other puranas  yet dakshayagam is a very popular story connected with  shiva  lord shiva is punishing his father-in-law daksha  and a quarrel between father-in-law and son-in-law takes place in a very dramatic manner  this theme is adopted by a poet composer of eighteenth century iraimantambi  iraimantambi was a musician a musicologist a  kathakali composer and uh a very good art connoisseur who lived in the period of shri sadatinha maharaja who was the  doyen of karnataka music as far as kerala is concerned  and uh iraimantambi was a court musician court poet and uh very popular figure in the cultural arena of kerala of the ninteenth century  before that we have got unnai wadiyar who composed naliyadadamaatakatha which is a four uhn days play uh based on mahabharata  the nala damayanti katha is beautifully presented in the nalacharitam uh with musical skill with literary skill as well as sufficient scope to action also  after that we can point out only this personality iraimantambi  uh for his three plays keechakavadham uttaraswayavaram and dakshayagam  uh very popular stories on the kathakali stage  beyond that we are having ravana vijayam by tilimanur vidwangoitambran and uh duryodhanavadham by waikkarmusud uh tadagavadham by weekasindambi who is the originator of the kathakali club system in kerala uh who has uh written some kathakali plays also uh modified some techniques evolved some uh evolutions in the  methods on the kathakali stage  uh similarly we are having some later period composers also for example one man who lives till now mali madhavanna has composed a story on karnashapatham that is also based on mahabharata modern writers uh try to adopt foreign stories in kathakali stage  for example kerala kalamandalam presented this year a story on the basis of shakespeare's king lear  uhn it was appreciated by foreign audience but i don't know  whether this will suit kathakali stage fully well as the mythological  themes of our traditional style and we can not think of a a shakespearean character with this pachha or  other costumes on the kathakali stage  another aspect we have to account with regard to  kathakali is the musical aspect of uh this theatrical art  we have got in kerala three major instruments of music   idakya chanda and muyav   idakya is used for sopan  music or ashtapadi singing and uh muyav  is for chakyarkut and kudiattam  alone  while chanda and maddalam  are used in kathalali   idakya has got some relevance in  kathakali very rarely also  and this chan chanda   and uh maddalam iluttalam and  kaimani this combination of kathakali in  musical aspect is very important and just like aharyabhinava  this musical instrument also gives a very good impression on the whole art   kathakali is a total theatre  it is dramatic  it is musical  it is rhythmic  there is dance technique there are there is natya technique  there is nrita technique everthing is combined in there  and the total story is being present  another aspect of the story is in kudiattam  and kuttu we find vidushaka  character  but there is no vidushaka or comic character in kathakali  we are having dhirodatta dhirodhadata dhiralalita  and dhirashanta characters  these characters are ba coming from our puranas and  uh epics  so uh this type of nayaka characters uh  heroines like damayanti or uttara or draupadi uh women characters they also uh participate in the action but the women characters uh are represented by men only  major actors are men  they take the role of uh female characters  that is a peculiar uh aspect of kathakali there are very few ladies who participate in  kathakali  and there is a troupe also ladies troupe also  but that is not so popular  mainly the main men take female role also  because uh kathakali requires very rigorous training in uh aangikabhinaya aspect  uh female dancers or actors do not undergo such severe training  men only can face that uh annual training physical training  so kathakali is a performance  mainly acted by men and this is very popular  this is almost a temple art but it has come out of the temple walls and it is presented for social functions cultural functions and other uhn celebrations also  every temple festival will have a kathakali performance  one or two or three or any number  similarly uh this costume makers the  productions everything of katha every aspect of  kathakali has become a predominant uh factor of our   k kerala culture  just like we had krishnatam troupes in ancient times we are having kathakali troupes in modern times also  uh it is almost a non-secular performance now  and we are having kathakali pada kacharis  now  we are having individual presentations like putanamorcha  or some other story  individual characters are being presented now we have got a youth festival stage in kerala school youth festival and college youth festival  there also uh there is much competition is going on between youngsters to present kathakali in a beautiful way  so kathakali is getting its popularity day by day and wallatol has contributed much for our  uh present popularity of kathakali  this classical theatre is uh progressing even though we have lost so many uh distinguished actors  the style of acting and the presentation of the art the standard of art is maintained almost in a very uh attractive  method  thank you 
archaeology is said to be concerned with the digging of the past  of its find coins form an important source of knowledge  indeed several kings and chieftains would have remained unknown but for the unearthing and study of the coins issued by them  further coins reveal the socio-cultural economic  religious and political life of those times  and hence the importance of numismatics that is the study of the coins to the understanding of our ancient indian history can not be over emphasised  my talk is about ancient andhra coins  in the evolution of the ancient indian coinage earliest to be issued was punch marked coins which was first succeeded by  uninscribed cast coins and the later by the inscribed coins  the punch marked coins were in circulation between eighth and second century b c and these coins were probably in circulation for a little longer period in the south india  these coins had no dates and no inscription denoting the name of the king or the dynasty to which he belonged  these coins had only symbols which were marked on them by punching technique and hence the name punch mark given to them on the basis of the method of their manufacture  these are some of the punch marked coins except one at the top which is made of copper rest of the coins are made of  silver  majority of the punch marked coins are made of silver and very rarely copper and lead was used for making these coins  the punch marked coins were manufactured by two methods one is the cut-sheet process in which the metal was beaten into flat sheets of appropriate thickness and width and then the coin blanks were cut  when the metal was still soft the symbols were marked on them using different punches then the coins were weighed and if they are found to be overweight edges were clipped and hence majority of the coins ended up being irregular  round and oval kinds were made by different technique  weight globules of molten metal were fold into moulds and then were beaten flat and then the symbols were marked on them by punches  hence the shapes of these coins varied from round oval  squarish rectangular to irregular  and what you are seeing is the obverse side of the coins  and punchmark coins have only symbols imprinted on them on the obverse side where as the reverse side is always blank  what you are seeing now is the reverse side of the three of the punchmark coins  this side is blank except for few indistinct  symbols which came to be called as the bankers or officials marks  next let us consider when coins came to be issued for the first time in our country ? majority of the numismatists are of the opinion that coins originated somewhere around eighth century b c  this assumption is based on two kinds of an evidence that we have got  one is the archaeological other literary  whenever punchmark coins were found during the excavation  archaeologists determined the statigraphic level at which these coins were found  and next they find out what other material was found associated with them such as the northern black polished and polished gravier pottery and so on  these can be dated by radio carbon method all the available archaeological evidence confirms that coins were in circulation in our country from fifth century b c and later  but the literary evidence reveals that coins were issued in our country much earlier   arthashastra of kautilya which was written in the fourth century b c mentions about punchmark coins   pana and its fractions  it also mentions about ways of detecting counterfeit and forge coins  it is clear that coins were made in india prior to fourth century b c   ashtadhyayi of panini was said to be written in the fifth or sixth century b c  it also clearly mentions about various types of coins like  pana nishka and satamana  hence it is clear that coins were in circulation prior to sixth century b c  the earliest literary evidence that probably suggests about coins is maitraini samhita of yajurveda  this text is said to be written somewhere around thousand b c there is a particular reference in this text about a lump of precious metal which some scholars feel that it was referring to coin  satmana  but not all scholars are agreed on this  from the literary evidence one could not be certain about the exact period when coins came to be first issued in our country  but the consensus seems to favour eighth century b c as the most likely date  next i will say few words about the symbols that are found on the coins  no less than three hundred different symbols were recorded on punchmark coins alone  the symbols on the coins probably represent the king his dynasty the kingdom the capital city main town and so on  but at these length of time one could never be certain  that what each symbol represented  roughly these three hundred symbols can be grouped into six broad catagories  first depiction of human figure either occuring singly or in groups  second group consists of animal symbols  four common animals depicted are the elephant bull horse and lamb  other animals seen are the camel rhinosorous dog bear  peacock reptiles fish frog and so on  third group consists of implements such as bow and arrow  ladder and ship  fourth group consists of trees and flowers  fifth group consists of astral and religious symbols  last group consists of miscellanious symbols including ujjain  and six arm symbol and so on  one general observation that can be made here is that the animal symbols are much more common in early series of punchmark coins  whereas the hill symbol occurs commonly in later coins  there are two main types of punchmark coins local and imperial during eighth to sixth century b c our country consisted of many tribal states or janapadas  local rulers of these states have issued coins for circulation in the respective regions  magadha too started as a small tribal state with rajgir in bihar as the capital but later this state has become very powerful it expanded its territories then shifted its capital to patna or patilaputra and by the time this state came under the rule of nanda and mauryan dynasties almost the entire country was under their rule  and coins issued by these dynasties were in circulation throughout the country  and these coins came to be called as imperial coins  both type of these coins local as well as the imperial  punchmark coins have very distinctive features  local coins or the early coins and naturally they are very rare to find  they were of crude design and fabric  the symbols marked on these coins too are crude  weights of these coins too varied from one gram to over twenty grams  the number of symbols on the obverse were usually one or two  but never exceeded four  in contrast imperial coins were of uniform weight of three point four grams or fifty-four grams in fresh mint condition  obverse had only five symbols and the reverse was blank except for bankers marks  occasionally these coins had counter marks of subsequent rulers out of the five symbols two symbols were common to all these coins that is sun and the six armed symbols  hence they are called as the first and second symbol  third fourth and fifth symbols were from any of the three hundred and odd symbols found on the punchmark coins  these are called as the class group and variety symbols  what you are seeing now are the drawings of the symbols depicted on the obverse side of the two punchmark coins sun and six armed symbols are common to both these coins though the design of the six armed symbol does vary  one has four arrow marks whereas the second one has three arrows and three dot symbols marked inside the triangle  third symbol on one coin is the one word whereas the tree and railing symbol with fish below is seen on the second coin  fourth symbol on one coin consists of the four fish symbols  around a square with a dot inside all enclosed inside a large square  whereas ankusha thareen and straight line are seen on the other coin  elephant forms the fifth symbol on both these coins  one coin belongs to one variety whereas the second forms another variety  six hundred such varieties of punchmark coins have so far been described  i will now show you the various designs of sun symbol  sun is depicted with varying number of rays varying from twelve to eighteen  in early coins rays are shown as oblique whereas in subsequent coins they are seen as radial or straight or horizontal lines  the second symbol came to be known as the six armed symbol  this symbol consists of a dot or a circle around which six symbols are marked  these could be either six arrows three arrows and three other symbols which may vary from fish oval rectangle tureen or any other kind of a design  ninety different types of the six armed symbols have been  found on the punchmark coins  one more common symbol in later punchmark coins is the tree and railing various designs of which are shown in this chart  another common symbol is the hill symbol  this is depicted as either showing three arches or arches vary from anywhere from five to ten  but three arched hill with a crescent at top is considered to be the ashokan or late mauryan symbol  i will briefly tell you about the characteristic features of the local and imperial punchmark coins that were found in andhra region when it comes to the local punchmark coins one interesting observation was that all these coins were made of lead and the weights of this coins too varied to from one gram to over fifteen grams  the make of this coins too was somewhat cruder  but as for the symbols various symbols were found on them  but three common symbols that were there on these coins was a crudely designed sun symbol with lesser number of rays  second chakra or a wheel symbol  thirdly a crude design of a branch with leaves  these were the features of the early local andhra coins  when it comes to the imperial punchmark coins that were found exclusively in andhra region i would like to mention about the amravati hoard of the punchmark coins  there were no less than seven thousand six hundred punchmark coins found at this site  it had two hundred and eighty-four symbols on them  two hundred and thirty-five varieties of punchmark imperial coins  were found in this hoard  but what was interesting was that forty-eight varieties of this kind of a punchmark coins were only found in andhra region  this means that even though punchmark coins of the imperial type of uniform weight and size with common symbols were there throughout the country but certain varieties were exclusively minted in each region  the second series of coins which were issued in our country after the punchmark coins were the uninscribed cast coins  these coins were in circulation between sixth to the third century b c  in some parts of our country these coins were the first to be issued and not the punchmark coins  in the rest of the country these coins were exclusively made of copper and hence the name uninscribed cast coins was applied to them  but majority of the coins which were issued in andhra region  were made of lead  even though these coins had various symbols four common symbols that were found on these coins are the hollowcross tarin  swastika and the one or two words  surprisingly the hollowcross which was  very common in the uninscribed coins of this period does not figure on the coins which was issued immediately after that is on the inscribed coins which was issued in this part of the country  seventy new types of previously undescribed  uninscribed coins found in andhra region were discussed in our book  one message that comes through from this study is that though this region was under the nanda and mauryan empire still there were local rulers or authorities who issued a variety of such coins  another important fact to be noticed is that with the introduction of uninscribed cast coins symbols came to be marked on either side of the coin whereas punchmark coins had only symbols on one side and reverse was blank  after the uninscribed cast coins came the era of the inscribed coins that means this coins mentioned the name of the king and the dynasty to which he belonged  but like the punchmark and uninscribed coins these coins too never mentioned the date of issue of the coins  and for that matter none of the andhra coins prior to the medieval period ever mentioned either the mint's name or the date of issue of the coins  first inscribed coins that came to light in andhra region belonged to king gobhadra  he was a small local ruler in the telangana region  if this is a copper coin issued by king gobhadra obverse side shows the script in the centre a bow and arrow symbol at the top  and right lower part shows the arched hill symbol and tree and railing symbol to its left  these coins were followed by such kings as naranna  khambayasa and samagopa  there is no literary or historical evidence of the existence of these four rulers gobhadra naranna khambayasa and samagopa  only through coins we came to know the existence of these rulers these are two samagopa coins one on the left side shows the obverse side of the coin whereas one on the right side shows the reverse side of an another coin  coin on the left side shows the script in the centre and at the upper part you see a bow and arrow symbol and slightly to its left you see a part of the sadachakra symbol  at the lower right hand corner you see the symbol of tree and railing and to its left you see the tree arch hill symbol with dots inside  on the right hand side you see the reverse side of the coin showing the nandipatha symbol  similarly coastal andhra region was ruled by meghvahana dynasty of kalinga  there coins too have been discovered in recent times  except for one inscription mentioning about the existence of the meghvahana ruler there is no other literary or any historical evidence that how many kings ruled or became part of this meghavahana dynasty  in recent times coins of these kings who ruled northern coastal region were found and coins give a clue of the names of five kings who belong to this dynasty 
in the recent elections we have seen that  sociologists are those people who forecast election results  have become even more important than astrologers  this is a welcome sign because it speaks of rationalization of social life and a an increasing recognisation of the need to ascertain public opinion before certain decisions are made regarding the life and future prospects of a number of persons living in a country  this is very important in a country like india where the size of the population is uh going to exceed a hundred  crores soon  and it is not enough that we have elections every five years  but we must ascertain public opinion at regular intervals on a number of issues  now decision makers require a lot of information  for making decisions regarding planning of social change  regarding implementation of accepted policies and moreover  due to increasing democratisation of social life  we need from time to time more and more data as to what  people think on a number of issues concerning their interests  of course elections are held every five years but then  the decision makers must know what exactly is to be done under  situations certain situations by doing social service or   resorting resorting to what they say is one word or the measurement of public opinion  in other words social surveys are becoming more and more important these days uh in order to make decisions before certain policies are made  and students of social sciences especially those of sociology  political science economics etcetera must know what social surveys are and how they are done  today we are going to discuss the broad outlines of what social surveys are and how they are done  in our social surveys a representative sample of the population or the universe uh about which we want to make  general statement is taken  they are interviewed in a proper manner  the data thus collected from the representative sample of the population is tabulated  these tables are uhm interpreted and then a report is given showing the results of the social survey  when we want to do research on a topic this uh topic is divided into aspects or dimensions or sectors  these sectors are further analysed into variables and when we want to do research in a subject we have first of all to identify the relevant variables  after identifying these variables we have to do social surveys that is social surveys are started only if the  releve relevant dimensions and variables  in a problem have already been identified  social surveys are done in order to ascertain how big  or how small the effect of these variables is  that is what is the magnitude of these variables  then social surveys also enable us to ascertain the relationship between these variables and also to uhm formulate or to and to test uh hypothesis  about the relationship between these uh uhm uhm variables as also which of these hypothesis is to be accepted uh and which of these is to be rejected and which of these can be modified in order to come to certain conclusions with a known degree of confidence  now the question arises what a variable is ? let me explain it with uh an example  suppose we are doing research on social tension  prevalent in uh many parts of india  this is our problem for analysis that is social tensions in india  now there can be several uh sectors dimensions or aspects of social tensions in india  and these may be due to the due to factionalism  one factor of social tensions another factor uh factor of social tensions may be uh religious inter-religious and inter-caste rivalries  still another factor of social tensions may be for example  uh widespread unemployment  now factionalism inter-religious and uh  inter-caste tensions and thirdly unemployment these can be said to be the three factors of the problem under study that is social tensions in india  each of these factors is further composed of or can be analysed into a number of variables  and these variables may be for example age may be for example gender may be for example rural urban background or may be for example uhm exposure to mass media and so on and so forth therefore a problem can be analysed into factors and factors can be further analysed into variables  the task of social surveys is after we have identified these variables to find out their magnitude their mutual relations and if possible whether they are closely connected or not the social anthropologists often use participant observation for this purpose  and some others may use the case study method for this purpose then social surveys are done but be sure that the survey method is not suitable for ascertaining the cause and effect relationship between variables  for that we have to go beyond the survey method to  perform experiments in order to ascertain the uhm relations  cause and effect relationship between variables and to say uh certainly that certain variables precede certain other variables invariably  and some vari uh and the relationship between  the these variables is asymetrical  that is when we want to say that x is the cause of y  then uh we must be able to produce evidence with the experimental method that x invariably precedes y and x and y cannot occur unless x occurs in other words social surveys like between uh the experimental method which is used to ascertain the cause and effect  relationship between variables and on the other hand the case study method or the method of participant observation which is used to  identify the relevant variables involved in a problem  a social survey cannot do all these things uhm but then  the survey method is the grant trunk road or the most important method or the raajpath of social research  and it can uhm this is one of the several methods used in social sciences  be sure this is the not the only method but the most important method of social surveys  as i said earlier social surveys are done with the help of a representative sample of the population or the universe under study what do we do ? we formulate or we prepare a an interview schedule or a questionnaire or an interview guide and either we sent the questionnaire by post to a representative sample of the population properly selected by using statistical criteria or we go ourselves or send our interviewers to interview these people on the spot in a face to face situation with the help of an interview schedule or an interview guide  in the western countries telephone surveys are being used  more and more frequently more and more often  but in india since many people do not own telephones  surveys can hardly be done with the help of uh telephones except  on a few problems where the upper middle class is being studied  and the problem is such that interviews with those uh who possess telephones are enough  in practice most surveys are done with the help of interview schedules  a researcher uh sends his interviewers to say two thousand uhm persons around the country these are known as respondents and the interviewers ask them a number of questions  now an interview schedule has to be prepared in a proper manner  since we have to make generalisations make general statements about a large number of uh people what we have to do is to ask them the same questions in the same situa   in the same sequence ensuing that not only the wording of the question is standardized not only the sequence in which the questions are asked is standardized but also the situation in which these uh questions are asked is standardized so that we can be sure that all the respondents all the persons being studied have been asked the same question and not a slightly different question  after the interviewers or the research assistants have filled in the interview schedules these are sent back to the institution  or the university department where the researcher is situated  the data from the interview schedules are coded on uh code sheets then these are punched on code cards or otherwise transferred to a computer readable medium like a uhm magnetic tape or like a floppy disk  these are fed into the computer  the computer enables us to process these data and prints out uhm a number of tables  these tables are then uh interpreted by inspection or by applying certain statistical measures like the chi-square or several other types of statistical methods  and then these interpretions pretations are put together in the form of a research report  the research report provides us answers to the questions  we started with that is uh the questions which are to to which answers are needed by the researcher as well as the sponsor that is the person who or the institution who have uh or has financed the conducting of this uh survey and has uh made it possible for the researcher to perform all the operations and take all the trouble of going through from the process of preparing the research design collecting the required data with the help of an interview schedule processing the data analysing the data and uh  uh writing the research report  the research report may provide us answers as to for example what is going to be the outcome of the coming elections ? in other words social surveys are becoming more and more important these days uh in order to make decisions before certain policies are made and in order to implement these decisions make the implementation of these decisions easier and and  so on and so forth  the survey method is as i said the most important method of social research 
familiar incidents do not usually excite our curiosity  we look at them and we take them for granted  we do not ask what makes them happen ? how they are connected with the rest of the universe ? it was one of these mundane incidents which excited the curiosity of issac newton  he saw an apple fall from a tree  it made him wonder whether the law of nature that made the apple fall would also make the moon fall towards the earth  he was taking a great intellectual leap from the apple to the moon  he was not content with having seen this event with his physical eyes alone  he was trying to see a hidden connection behind the phenomenon  with his intellect the third eye  what is the connection that newton saw betweeen the apple and the moon ? let us look at the moon  if the earth did not attract the moon the moon would have travelled in a straight line and escaped to infinity  the earth's attraction provides the centripidal force  that bends the moon's projectory continuously from its linear projectory  one can therefore say that the moon is continuously falling towards the earth's centre  it is exactly analogous to the case of the spacecraft that we talked about in an earlier episode now if the earth's gravity extends upto the orbit of the moon and this force decreases as the square of the distance from the earth's centre  it is easy to calculate the acceleration of the moon as it falls  from a knowledge of the acceleration of the apple  since the moon is sixty times as far from the centre of the earth as the apple its acceleration should be sixty multiplied by sixty that is three thousand six hundred times smaller than the apple's  acceleration  the remarkable thing is that this gives the right answer for the moon to go once round the earth in twenty-eight days exactly as observed  this was newton's famous moon test  in fact in the beginning he used a slightly wrong value for the distance of the moon from the centre of the earth and therefore got a slightly wrong value for the lunar month that made him wonder for a while as to whether there was something other than gravity which affected the moon's motion  he therefore didn't publish his results until much later  the primitive concept of forces arises from our experience of  pushes and pulls  newton made a tremendous intellectual leap from such a concept of contact forces to the concept of forces such as gravitation  which act over a distance through empty space  this is how he made the leap  consider the uniform inertial motion of a body in a straight line covering equal distances ab bc cd de and so on in equal times  let the points a b c d e etcetera be joined by a straight line to the point p not on the line of motion then the successive triangles all have equal bases ab  bc cd de etcetera and the same height h from the base  therefore they all have the same area  since these equal areas are swept out in equal times this is clear that inertial motion traces out equal areas in equal times  now newton supposed that the body received a succession of blows at regular intervals  all directed towards a common point p  then the direction of motion would change at every blow and the body would coast along inertially in a straight line between these blows the linear path would thus be converted into a polygon whose sides would still determine consecutive triangles of equal areas with respect to the point p  now says newton let the time between successive blows become smaller and smaller then the number of blows and triangles would increase  and the width would decrease  in the limit of arbitrarily small intervals of time the projectory would be a continuous curve  this is the crucial point  it lies at the very heart of calculus  this limiting procedure enabled newton to make a transition  from a succession of discrete blows to the concept of a continually acting force directed towards a common point a central or centripidal force causing curvilinear motion  and he discovered that bodies moving under the action of such a force would trace out equal areas in equal times  this is keplar's second law of planetary motion  notice that newton arrived at the concept of an attractive force acting over a distance as a mathematical limit of a succession of direct impact  he wrote what i call attraction may be performed by impulse or by some other means unknown to me  i use these words here to signify in general any force by which bodies tend towards one another whatsoever be the cause   he didn't pretend to know the cause of gravity  could it be due to a shower of ethereal particles or was it is as descartes had imagined ? newton was curious but he couldn't decide  he left the question open  but what is important is that he didn't stop there  he simply assumed the existance of gravity and proceeded to work out its consequences  this pragmatic approach was essential for the progress of science in his time but it was completely misunderstood by many of his eminent contemporaries  it led to a lot of unnecessary and bitter controversy  having shown that a centripidal force acting continually would make a body move in a curve that traced out equal areas in equal times he also proved the converse namely that this area law employed a motion in a central force speed  since the area law held for planets it became clear to newton that the force acting between the sun and the planets must be a central force he had earlier deduced from keplar's third law of planetary motion that a circular orbit employed a force that decreased as the square of the distance from the centre  armed with the discovery of calculus he was now able to show  that under a central force that decreased at the square of the distance a planet would describe an elliptic orbit  in other words he derived keplar's first law of planetary motion from causal principles  now this derivation of keplar's empirical laws  held only for an imagined system a hypothetical point particle moving around a centre of force in a perfect vacuum  the real world is of course much more complex  newton therefore didn't publish his results  in the mean time robert hook quite independently hit upon the idea that the attraction between the sun and the planets fell off at the square of their distances  however he couldn't work out what the orbits would be under such an attractive force  he tried to get newton interested in the problem and wrote to him in january sixteen hundred and eighty  but newton didn't reply as an earlier controversy with hook about the nature of light had offended him  in london there were two other men who were also working on hook's problem  christopher wren the famous architect of saint paul's  cathedral and edmund halley  in august sixteen eighty-four halley who was younger than hook and more tactful went to cambridge on horseback to find out if newton could help  a contemporary account states without mentioning either his own speculations or those of hook or wren he at once indicated the object of his visit by asking newton what would be the curve described by the planets on the supposition that gravity diminished at the square of the distance  newton immediately answered an ellips  struck with joy and amazement halley asked him how he knew it  ? why replied he i have calculated it and being asked for the calculation he could not find it but promised to send it to him  this was the beginning of the writing of newton's  principia  perhaps the greatest book on physical science ever written  it took him nearly three years of incredible labour  he submitted it to the royal society on twenty-eighth april sixteen eighty-six  one of the greatest days in the history of science  it was finally accepted by samuel peeps the president of the royal society and published in sixteen eithty-seven  it would not have seen the light of day had it not been for the constant coaxing and persuasion by halley who even paid for its publication  it consisted of three books written in latin in which  newton developed a full dynamical theory encapsulated in his three laws of motion  the third law is the most original of his three laws and appears for the first time in the principia  newton generalised the experience of direct collisions of bodies like billiard balls acting mutually on one another to the case  of four types of forces including attraction  the third law is not however applicable to every case  nowadays we believe that all signals or forces have a finite velocity of propagation  it is therefore not applicable to them because it talks about forces of action and reaction being equal as measured at the same time  we therefore don't expect it to be very good say in the case of atomic category  it is however perfectly applicable to the collisions of billiard balls cars and so on  as i have said earlier newton's derivation of  kepler's empirical laws held only for an imagined system a hypothetical point particle moving around the centre of force in a perfect vacuum  a physically impressed force must be directed towards a real physical body  so newton next introduced a second body in place of the mathematical centre of force to simulate the sun and a single planet and he assumed that they were both spherical in shape and attracted each other with equal and opposite forces  after much effort lasting over a number of years newton obtained the remarkable mathematical result that a gravitational attraction of a homogeneous spherical body or shell on a mass point outside it was the same as though its whole mass was concentrated at its centre provided gravity fell off at the square of the distance this justified his earlier treatment of the sun and the planets as  point like objects  he next showed that in such a system each body would move in an orbit around the common centre of mass  if one of the bodies were much more massive than the other as is the case with the sun and most of the planets the centre of mass would practically coincide with the more massive body  since nearly the entire mass of the solar system was concentrated in the sun the planet would really move around the sun which would remain practically stationary  a dynamical justification of the copernican system that galileo was unable to provide  the final feature was the introduction of other mutually interacting bodies to produce a system like the sun and all its planets here his third law about the equality of action and reaction played a crucial role  the discovery of this new important principle almost inevitably led to universal gravitation  newton systematically showed that the same force of gravity that acted between the earth and the moon also acted between jupiter and its satellites between the sun and all the planets and between every pair of planets and that every action was mutual by the third law of motion  he was thus led to the concept of universal gravitation a force that acts mutually between any two samples of matter anywhere in the universe  newton applied his powerful theory to show that the tides on the high seas were caused by the gravitational pull of the moon and the sun  he argued that the gravitational force exerted by the moon  on the ocean waters on the moonlit side of the earth was stronger  than the pull on the moonless side because gravity decreases the distance as a result of this the ocean waters assume an elixoidal shape  with two bulges one on the moonlit side and the other on the opposite side  the sun has a similar effect on the oceans but being much farther away its effect is weaker than the moon's  also the solar and lunar tides do not always coincide  the sun and the moon act in the same direction whenever the moon is either new or full and then we have exceptionally high tides  at other times the total effect is much diminished  with the powerful tool of calculus at his command to give shape to his daring imagination newton demonstrated convincingly that  gravity held sway over the entire solar system  in one sweeping stroke he unified celestial and terrestrial motion under a single concept  the great irish philosopher george bernard shaw once made  the following mischievous remark about newton copernicus proved that ptolemy was wrong kepler proved that copernicus was wrong galileo proved that aristotle was wrong but at that point  the sequence broke down because science then came up for the first time against that incalculable natural phenomenon and englishman to explain why all the lines in his rectilinear universe were bent  he invented a force called gravitation and thus erected a complete  british universe and established it as a religion which was devoutly believed in for three hundred years  that was george bernard shaw  but the famous english poet alexander pope wrote   nature and nature's laws lay hidden in night god said let newton be and all was light 
  graham greene recently celebrated his eighty-fifth birthday  he can now look back on a career in writing which has covered over sixty years  this programme pays homage to graham greene whom many critics regard as the finest author never to have won the nobel prize for literature  in order to understand what a writer or a poet is about  it is most important to know something about his background and his life  graham greene was born on the second of october nineteen hundred and four at birkamstate  uh his father was the headmaster of birkamstate school and that is where graham greene did his earlier education  he won a scholarship to go to belliol college oxford  and it was at oxford that he first started writing  uh his first work was a collection of poems called  babling april  soon after he left belliol he converted to catholicism  married a catholic lady  the marriage wasn't very successful and it ended in a divorce uh greene went through a very long period of extreme depression he continued writing  he wrote three novels none of them which he rated very high and although they were published he later disclaimed having done them and refused to allow them to be reprinted  he worked for a time in the times of london  and the spectator and did a lot of journalism and then he began his travels  he travelled extensively  he is one of the most widely travelled authors uh in the world today  uh he went specifically to look for material for his books  he stayed a long time got to know the people and got whatever he wanted for his novels  uh his first successful book only in terms of uh sales was  istanbul train uh based on the orient express  it wasn't very uh outstanding but it gave him a break he got recognised and was taken a little more seriously then he had been with his first three novels  then followed a veritable flood of books and of all kinds  books of poetry books of travel adventure detective stories essays  childern's books you name them and graham greene was writing them  uh it really in the sheer output it is hard to find anyone who did such a vast range of writing  therefore it is really very difficult to put any kind of lable on him because he wrote on just every single topic that even you can think of  however uh three or four of his books were really taken very seriously and uh one can see in those uh novels uh particularly the ones i will mention later were some kind of his philosophy of life comes through  now what kind of uh belief did graham greene have ? as i said before he is a catholic but in politics he was pretty close to being a communist  he is an extremely extreme leftist uh knew and admired people like fidel castro of cuba  uh he was denied a passport uh a visa to the united states because of his leftists leanings  it was again very wrong to try and lable him even in politics  he is convinced in his writings that you cannot really make black and white decisions or black and white distinctions there is a vast grey area uh which really has more truth in it  in his first volume of his autobiography called a sort of life which he uh wrote in nineteen seventy-one  he talks of what he calls an epigraph to his earlier novels and quotes bishop bagrum's apology and goes something like this our interests are on the dangerous edge of things our interest are on the dangerous edge of things the honest thief the tender murderer the superstitious atheist  now you can see the contradiction in terms here  and in the second volume he makes it even clear the second volume being known as the ways of escape   he talks of the appalling strangeness of the mercy of god  so you can see that there was no distinct line between right and wrong goodness and badness  while i was looking through uh uh notes making  preparing on graham greene to talk about him i was struck by a strange coincidence that he was born on the second of october which also happens to be mahatma gandhi's birthday  uh i don't believe in astrology but i was very curious to know  if there was anything in common between these two men as is maintained by astrologers that people born under the same combination of stars have similar careers  now obviously there wasn't really a to the outword eye very much in common  uh gandhi was a devout hindu a pacifist who only wrote because he wanted to convey his message  greeen on the other hand was an englishman a catholic and his primary interest was writing not a mission that he like gandhi had but there was one thing very common between the two  both were deeply concerned with the lowest of the lowly   gandhiji's interest was with harijans  landless peasantry and those who had been indiscriminated against in  his own country  he didn't bother about rest of the world very much  he travelled very little apart from his studies in england and this couple of years he spent in south africa as a lawyer and then once as the member of the round table conference this uh  representing the congress party all his travel was rest of his travel was in india  graham greene hardly ever lived in england his native country and he was travelling all the time  but while gandhiji looked to the poor in his country graham greene was most concerned with drop outs in of society in all parts of the world  his main characters are uh thieves robbers uh drug-pedlars the scum of society  now the other thing uh where the two have some kind of contrast gandhiji believed in the innate goodness of man  he believed that there is something fundamentally good in every person and if it appealed to uh the man could be changed completely now greene was not so naive  he does not believe in the innate goodness of man he believed that something good in the worst of us and something bad in the best of us  and he was closer to the reality  third thing which uh is of interest is that uh both were concerned with the struggle between good and evil uh the eternal battle between right and wrong  gandhiji uh being devoutly religious uh belief  believed that ultimately goodness always triumphs over evil   satyamev jayate  now again greene was not so naive to believe that uh the good always triumphs over bad that uh truthfulness always scored  over evil because he saw that many times people good people suffered and evil people prospered  uh i think these were the things that i think one should bear in mind when comparing the careers of these two people  now i come to some of his books to illustrate  i think the three best known uh and most seriously taken by critics are brighten rock is one and  power and the glory is another one and heart of the matter is the third i think they are the three most outstanding works of graham greene now brighten rock concerns itself with the career of a young delinquent a catholic pinky his one ambition in life is to get the better of olioni a bigger racketier who has made a lot of money  uh pinky has a catholic girl friend called rose  he is a drunkard he is a violent man  and in the process of trying to become the leader of the gang  he kills an innocent journalist  then he picks up the young protestant girl ida and they have an affair for a long time and ida ultimately really brings him to justice and he is taken arrested  here you see although greene was a catholic and his main character pinky is a catholic uh the person who betrays him but for the goodness for the right cause so that justice is done is a girl of loose morals a protestant girl called ida  you see this even in more uh clarity in the what i think is probably is very best novel the power and the glory this is set in mexico at the time of uh severe persecution by the state of the catholic church uh the police were hunting  for uh catholic priests murdering them bringing them putting them in jails  and here we have two characters uh catholic priest one is a drunkard uh he has a mistress he sired a bastard child through her  the other has taken a vow of chastity and yet gone and got married so both in that sense have defied with the basic tenets of catholicism  and they are on the run from the police  this priest who has uh sired a bastard child and is drunkard is successfully getting out of the country in just as he is coming close to the border and to freedom he gets a message that a poor peasant catholic person is dying and he would like his last sacraments to be performed  he takes the risk of turning back to go and perform the last sacraments is caught and executed uh by a police man who is also a good man but he wants to do justice  here you see the mixture of characters uh catholic priest drunkard uh siring illegitimate children and yet when it comes to the final test atleast giving up his life and becoming a martyr  and the third novel uh heart of the matter   it is set in west africa  here we have a character uh deputy commissioner of police uh scobie who is a good upright man  uh he has a rather eccentric wife louise who dabbles in writing uh he has a lady friend a young widow called helen  and it is going on alright till slowly he begins to uh get caught in a whole plot where a innocent journalist is murdered and scobie in trying to investigate is uh laid up wrong making wrong decisions and ends his life ultimately in suicide  uh scobie also is a catholic and suicide is a sin by the catholic church  and here once again clearly you see the dichotomy the conflict between good and evil between belief faith and uh reason and the way greene mixes these characters is absolutely masterly  graham greene undoubtedly is the most famous and highly respected english writer  in nineteen eighty-six he was appointed to the order of merit  in nineteen eighty-eight he received the british film institute award for his services to the cinema that he has not yet been awarded the nobel prize for literature is a puzzle to most people outside the british academy  people have asked why hasn't he been given the nobel prize for literature the greatest award ? well the answer i think is pretty simple  uh greene is essentially a story teller in the mau  somerset maugham's tradition  uh not one of his description really rises above straight writing  he hasn't got the turn up phrase  he is really a master craftsman only in as much that his writing is very constricted and there are no spare words that he uses  nothing embellished  and perhaps the people who decide on these things are more impressive with smart writing turn up phrase memorable description  or sometime the philosophy  as far as philosophy is concerned graham greene is far too subtle uh for people of who form the decision making body of the nobel prize committee 
hello viewers  all of us are interested in developing the ability to speak english fluently and expressively  but many of us are unnecessarily diffident about it  you will find that with a little guidance and constant effort it's possible to make remarkable improvement in the ability to speak english  the aim of this programme is to highlight some of those aspects of speech which contribute to better spoken english  i am sure all of us refer to a dictionary whenever we don't know the meaning of a word  but we quickly have a look at the meaning and then close the dictionary  there is one important bit of information which we generally don't use and that is pronunciation  every good dictionary gives the pronunciation of a word  whenever you refer to a dictionary you will find that immediately after the entry of the word its pronunciation or transcription is given in bracket   let's have a look at one such transcription given in the dictionary  this word is to be pronounced as agreement   listen carefully agreement  we are aware that many of us say agreement  and this pronunciation seems to be influenced by spelling look at the first symbol in this transcription  it is rather a strange letter because that doesn't appear  in the ordinary letters of the alphabet  that sta stands for the sound  ipa symbol the weak sound ipa symbol in english the next three symbols give us the sound gree  and the next four symbols give us the sound   ment  if you put this together you get agreement   you will find that there are about fifteen such strange looking symbols used in most dictionaries  and it is a matter of a few minutes to get familiar with those symbols  you will find that once you know those symbols you will have the ability to read the correct pronunciation given in a dictionary any dictionary gives a list of phonetic symbols right at the beginning  for example have a look at this table  in this table you find that on the left there are some symbols phonetic symbols as we call them  towards the right there are some words which point out what are the sounds represented by those symbols  if you go through this carefully you will find that in fact you already know many of the symbols  as i said there are only a few symbols that you will have to try and remember  let us move on to one important aspect of speech  as we all know there are vowel sounds and consonant sounds  let's consider two important vowel sounds  first let's take up these words lip  leap  listen carefully again to these two words lip  leap  you will find that there is difference in the vowel sound  of these two words  the first sound is a short sound the sound is i   the second one is a long sound i: and that gives you lip leap  have a look at the next pair of words pull  pool  listen again pull pool   the contrast is between short ipa symbol and long  ipa symbol  i would like to give you a simple hint  in case of short vowels try to make your vowels as short as possible  and in case of long vowels try to make them as long as you can this will help you retain the distinction between the short vowels and long vowels   let's briefly talk about some consonants which are problematic to many indian users of english   let's have a look at the next pair of words  fan finish  listen again fan finish   many indians have a problem in articulating the first sound instead of saying fan they say  phan instead of saying finish   they say phinish  have a close look at my lips now  the english sound is fa fan  finish  and you will observe that there is a contact between the lower lip and the upper teeth  please observe again fan  finish  in the indian equivalent you will find that there is a contact between the two lips  look carefully pha  many indians say phan  phinish instead they should say fan  and finish   let's have a look at the next pair of words  think and thank  again note carefully the first sound  the first sound is ipa symbol and not  tha  many indians say think and thank   i hope you hear the difference between the english sound  and the indian equivalent  listen again to the difference  the english pronunciation ipa symbols the indian pronunciation think the english pronunciation  ipa symbols the indian pronunciation thank   what really happens in the articulation of the english sounds is  that the first sound in these words is a friction sound the air comes out between the lower and the upper teeth  look again think thank  and if you are a little aware of how these sounds are produced  that will make a lot of difference to our spoken english  we have to take one important piece of care  many of us are exposed to spelling first and then to pronunciation  this gives rise to what some people have described as spelling pronunciation  look at the next three words on the screen  the first word is immediate  some of you might wonder that this word has another possible pronunciation immediate   that's right  some words in english have two or more acceptable pronunciations  this word is either ipa symbols - immediate or ipa symbols - immediate but not ipa symbols - immediate  many indians think that because there is double m  in spelling there must be two ipa symbols sounds  and therefore they think that the pronunciation must be immediately  but let's remember that there is only one m  there and therefore the pronunciation is ipa symbols - immediate or ipa symbols - immediate  the next word is often pronounced by indians as  ring  listen again ring  but the british pronunciation would be ipa symbols - rin   the difference is in the last sound  in the british pronunciation there is no ga  at the end   it's ipa symbols - ring and not ipa symbol - ring  similarly in the next word it's not ipa symbols - ringing but ipa symbols - ringing  again there is no ga  there is a tendency to go by spelling and this is one important piece of care that we'll have to take about english pronunciation  in the pronunciation that we showed you from the dictionary  there was one mark which i didn't explain earlier  before g you must have seen a short vertical stroke on top of the word and you might have wondered  what it was  in fact that is called the accent mark or the stress mark accent or stress is a very important feature of english speech  and it has been proved that that lead to intelligibility of english between the correct articulation of vowels and consonants and the correct accent what is definitely more important is the right accent  and therefore all of us should be bothered about this feature  of english speech  you will find that in any dictionary the accent is indicated by certain kinds of strokes  most of them use a short vertical stroke before the accented syllable   let's have a look at some of these words on the screen the first word is character  now this word is made up of three syllables or three parts   cha ric and ter   remember that all these three parts are not said with equal emphasis  listen again character and you will find that i am emphasising i am somehow highlighting the first part cha character  i must not pronounce the word as character or character  because this would be a shift in accent  it has been found out that english is often understood by the right accent  and there has been an experiment an interesting one where it was found that if indians pronounce the word as character  english speakers heard the word as director  you might wonder why this happened  look at the next word on the screen and you'll find  that that has accent on the second syllable  therefore the english listeners thought that if the word character had accent on the second syllable it couldn't be that word  it has to be a word which has accent on the second syllable and therefore they thought of the nearest word which has accent on the second syllable  in the word director there is accent on the second syllable again as i told you before this word has another possible pronunciation you might pronounce it as director  in whichever way you pronounce it the accent must be on the second syllable   let's have a look at the next word which is often mispronounced by indians employee  there is accent on the third syllable neither on the first syllable nor on the second but on the third employee   whereas many of us tend to say i am an employee of this institution  the correct pronunciation would be i am an employee of this organisation  the next word is an interesting case  all of us know this word and we know that this word functions as a noun an adjective or a verb  depending on its grammatical role there is a change in accent when it is a noun or an adjective there is accent on the first syllable and therefore the pronunciation is present  when it is a verb the accent shifts to the second syllable and the pronunciation is present   let's try to use this in sentences  first of all the word present as a noun  he gave me a nice birthday present  the word as an adjective thirty students were present in the class yesterday  the word as a verb we are going to present a play tonight and i hope you have listened to the two different pronunciations  of the same word  the main difference was that of accent  in english there are a few words pairs of nouns and verbs  which behave in this particular way  if they are nouns there is usually accent on the first syllable and if they are verbs there is usually accent on the second syllable   let's consider one more example like this  the next word on the screen is both a noun and a verb  if it is a noun it can be pronounced as produce if it is a verb it should be pronounced as produce  and i hope you hear the difference in accent   let's use these words in sentences  the agricultural produce in india has gone up  india produces a lot of wheat  therefore whenever we use words which can function either as nouns or verbs we should be careful about the accent  when we move from words to sentences there are certain problems   let's have a look at the next two sentences on the screen  each sentence consists of a few words and many indians try to give equal emphasis on each word  for example many indians might read the first sentence like this my friend has finished the job  whereas if you are a good speaker of english you might read it in some such way  my friend has finished the job  listen again to the difference between the two  my friend has finished the job  and my friend has finished the job  in the english sentence properly said you will find that certain words stand out as more prominent  in this sentence the words that stand out as prominent are  friend finished and job  the words my has and the are relatively unimportant  and therefore you can speak them faster and more weakly  listen to the sentence again my friend has finished the job  consider the next sentence   the machine is being repaired  many indians might read it as   the machine is being repaired  compare this with   the machine is being repaired  look at the first phrase the machine  now you hardly hear the article the  i am not saying the machine but i am saying the machine the is relatively unimportant in this sentence  if you remember this simple fact that content words that is nouns adjectives adverbs and main verbs are usually more important than words like conjunctions articles auxiliary verbs  you will find that it will make a lot of difference to your speech  it's also necessary to have proper pauses at the right places  because if you don't pause at the right place you will find that the sentence can convey a wrong meaning  many of us are also aware of the necessity of using the right tone or the right intonation   let's have a look at the next two sentences  the first sentence she is beautiful  in a sense is not ambiguous  the word beautiful has one meaning here  but depending on the tone that you use in order to say this  it can convey different meanings  i am going to say this sentence in three different ways  and listen carefully to the difference  one she is beautiful  two she is beautiful and three   she is beautiful  i am sure you have heard the difference between the three sentences  and you'll find that all these three sentences said with three different tones convey three different meanings in english  let's consider their meanings  number one she is beautiful  this is a matter of fact statement  the speaker really appreciates the beauty of the person that he is talking about  but if he says it with a different tone as in number two   she is beautiful you might perceive it as a question or you might think that the speaker wants to add something after this  this might convey the sense of incompleteness  consider the third way of saying that she is beautiful  this in english indicates that there is some kind of implied meaning and that is left to the imagination of the listener  this sentence she is beautiful could mean okay she is beautiful but foolish or unreliable or something like that  so the praise the appreciation is not really unqualified there is some kind of implied meaning that the speaker is trying to convey   let's consider the next sentence   close the door  this sentence in isolation is a command  but if you use the right kind of tone this can be perceived as a request  let me point out that there are different way of making requests in english  you can add words like please or kindly  you can change the sentence construction and say  would you mind closing the door or may i ask a favour of you and then you ask the person to close the door  or a third possibility is to use the right tone  for example listen to the difference between these two sentences   close the door   close the door  the first sentence is perceived as a strong command whereas the second one is seen as a polite request  this indicates that intonation or tone plays a very important role in speech  a wrong intonation can sometimes convey wrong meaning  and this can cause a lot of misunderstanding  as we said at the beginning all of us would like to speak fluently and there is a common misunderstanding that fluency means fast speech  this is not really right  you can be slow in speed and yet be fluent because fluency depends on the kind of flow that your speech has  the speed must be controlled by what you are talking about and it is also directed it's also controlled by your personality  to some extent  even if you take into account all these aspects of speech  which we have discussed there is one extremely important thing and that is confidence  unless you feel self- confident you will not be able to make significant progress in spoken english  of course your confidence must be supplemented by hard work and patience  at the end let's try to sum up the important aspects of speech to which we must pay attention  one the correct articulation of vowels and consonants  two the right accent  three the right kind of rhythm depending on accenting important words  and lastly intonation  as i said all these should be supplemented by confidence  and hard work  thank you 
photogrammetry means making measurements on photographs  when direct measurements are not possible as in the case of  very intricate objects or moving objects we make  photograph and from that photograph we make measurements  usually we take photograph from the air to make map of the topography  in this case the branch is known as aerial photogrammetry if the photographs are taken from the ground then the objects are surfaces are at a distance less than three hundred metres we call the branch as close range photogrammetry where do we make use of close range photogrammetry in ? there are a number of applications  we can broadly divide these applications into two parts  the first part the objects will be static  for example historic monuments temple one word   a train accident  in all these cases the objects on the surfaces are not moving they are all static  in the other case the object will be moving or the surface will be dynamic  to cite some specific example we can take the case of a wave form  when the waves are moving if you want to make measurement about the characterstics of the wave it is not possible to record the measurement directly  we take the photograph of this wave which are dynamic and later on we analyse the photograph to derive that information we desire to cite another example we can consider a running athlete  if you want to analyse the movement of the athlete it is difficult to make the measurement directly  we make use of close range photograph to record the movement of the athlete at various instance of time and later on from the photograph  we can analyse the movement of the particular sportsmen to find out their deficiencies  there are a number of applications of close range photogrammetry in the medical field  one such application is plastic surgery  for example if we want to make some alteration in any part of the human body we should know the present position of the particular part  we take photograph of that particular part by making use of  a special camera  the doctor can then simulate by making use of computer  how the particular part would look like after the surgery is made  the surgeon may decide how much of tissue should be taken  from another part of the body where the tissue should be placed and how it should be placed all these required measurement can be analysed by means of the photographs taken of the particular patient  another interesting application is in recording crime scene and traffic accidents  imagine the nature of the traffic in a very busy highway  when a traffic accident takes place  immediately the vehicles pile up one after another for kilometres together if it is a very busy highway  we will normally wait till the police people come to make the necessary measurement and the signal from the police people  to clear the traffic it takes about half an hour or so to record all the measurements the police people need to present the case before the magistrate  consider the delay in the movement of the traffic in this case to all the people who are waiting in their vehicles to clear the traffic  if you have here close range photogrammetry camera we can rush the camera to the traffic accident site record the scene by means of a few photographs taken from two or three vantage position  what all measurements we need about the traffic accident we can later on derive the same by analysing the photograph taken from the close range photogrammetry camera  another area where close range photogrammetry would be more useful is in the recording of structural movement of massive structures  to cite a specific example we can consider a massive dam if we would like to know how much the dam is one word   over a period of time or how much the dam is getting deflected over a period of time we can make use of this technique  we will make special target on the surface of the dam  at various points  we can record the dam site alongwith the target mark making use of the photogrammetry camera over a period of time  normally we may take pictures at intervals of about a month if we analyse the photograph of the dam taken periodically  making use of special plotting machines we will come to know  how much that targets are getting moved either in the vertical direction  or in the lateral direction or in any direction of deformation  because we will be taking measurement to a very high order of accuracy to about one by thousand of a milimetre we will be knowing how much the structure is getting deflected over a period of time  very very accurately  same is the case when we want to record structural failure  for example if a beam is loaded by external load  gradually the beam will be deforming until the beam fails  if a structural engineer would like to record the behaviour of the structure due to various types of loading he can make use of the close range photogrammetry camera to record how the structure is getting deformed instant after instant  after the recording is done he can analyse the photograph  in the special photogrammetry plotting machine to find out their nature of deformation and the extent of deformation very very accurately another field of application is the field of anthropology  the anthropologists are interested in classifying the skull  to find out to which race a particular skull belongs  the anthropologist will be recording the important dimensions of various skulls belonging to different races  there will be some characteristic measurements for a particular skull  if a skull is to be analysed we can take photograph of the skull  find out the characteristic of the important measurements and from the measurements we can find out whether the skull belongs to a chinese or a nepali or an asian race  we need a number of equipment to produce map making use of the close range photogrammetry technique  the first equipment needed is an electronic distance measuring equipment  an electronic distance measuring equipment is known as e d m this is a sophisticated equipment to measure the distances  and angles  an infra range beam is generated in the e d m and it travels to the point to which you want to make measurement and it gets reflected back to the equipment  by analysing the face shift we can find out the distance between any two points to a high order of accuracy usually fractions of a milimetre  in the case of close range photogrammetry we establish a few control points as target in the field of view of the photograph  the e d m is made use of in the field to record the rectangular coordinate of the various control points  by analysing their distances and angles we will come to know  that x y and either coordinate of the control point situated in the field of view  when we analyse this photograph in the plotting machine the control points are very essential  the coordinate of the control points which were obtained from the e d m are fit into the plotting machine  the second equipment needed for the close range photogrammetry  is a special stereometric camera  this camera essentially consists of two independent  highly accurate camera separated by a known distance of hundred and twenty centimetres  the lenses are having a focal length of sixty milimetres  a speciality of these two cameras is that the lenses have been so refined that practically no lense distortion occurs in the pictures taken from this camera  since we will be making measurement on the photograph to a very high order of accuracy we have to have the images of the objects  positioned in the geometrically correct location  if there is need of specially refined lenses required for this stereometric camera we we should have two cameras instead of one in the case of close range photogrammetry  if we take twin pictures simultaneously we will be able to see their actual field in three dimensions in the plotting machine which we will be using later  because the two photographs are taken simultaneously we are freezing the movement of the objects as well as we are able to get a three dimensional true to scale model in the photogrammetric plotting machine  this machine is so constructed to have simultaneous pictures if we operate a single button both the pictures are taken simultaneously  because we will be taking measurement very very accurately this camera takes only glass plates  the glass plates are sensitized with the photogrammetric emulsion the emulsion are sensitive to the light and the processing which takes place after the exposure is made  during the development stage during the drive stage no distortion of the pictures occurs  thats why we are making use of glass plates to arrest all distortions of the negative  another special feature of this camera is the various possibility of orientation of the camera  if we need the shaft of the camera containing both the cameras can be rotated in the longitudinal axis or the camera can be brought one over the other  the camera can also be swivelled about the vertical axis  why should we need all these types of movement ? we may need to take photograph from the high point such as the top of a mountain but the object may be far below  once the photographic processing is over the original glass plates containing the emulsion are converted into the dipositives  in the plotting machine we keep the dipositives  one on the left side and one on the right side  we measure the coordinate of a particular point in the machine  through the binocular kept in front of the observer  the observer finds a fourteen mark in the field of view  he keeps the fourteen mark over a point of interest as he measures the coordinate of the point making use of the photogrammetric machine the computer controlled part takes the x and y coordinate from the left image and the right image and they are processed through the computer to give the x y and either coordinates  with respect to a given origin  the ground control points which are measured earlier they are also made use of to calculate the actual position of the point measured  the computer after recording all the photographic coordinates  converts them into graphic details  the graphic details are then passed on to a special plotting table  in the plotting table the plotting pencil according to the command of the observer converts the details of the scene into a picture  that picture may contain all the details appearing in the field of view in the form of live feature  the operator may choose special symbols and special colours  to codify the different types of features appearing in the field of view  a user by studying the map coming out from the plotting table  will be able to get all the measurements he needs without any difficulty  if the observer needs only the coordinate and not the map he can take all the required coordinate from the screen of the computer itself or if the operator would like to keep all the measurements in a magnetic tape or a floppy he can store all the information of the field and keep them in a special plate  if you would like to record the changes in a particular field over a period of time the same type of measurement can be repeated and from the repeated measurement it is possible to find out the changes which have occured in a particular field or a particular object  concluding i would like to remark that whenever you have a situation where the direct measurements are not at all possible  the stereophotogrammetric technique will be coming handy to you 
 music   music this is the most essential factor in the very existence of man  but what is music ? dictionary defines music as the art of expression in sound in harmony and melody  so music is not mere noise it is a series of melodious and harmonious sounds very pleasing to the ear  so melodious and harmonious sounds very pleasing to the ear  make music  these melodious sounds also have rhythm in it  music must have been born even before the language  when man came into being on this earth he must have heard many melodious sounds around him the rippling sound of water  waves of sea chirping of birds rustling of leaves  all these sweet sounds probably gave him the knowledge of musical note he must have later on given names to these musical notes  every human being is born with an ear for music and loves to sing singing  little children illiterate adivasis village women and all those who sing but have never made a proper study of music are hardly aware that the sweet melodious sounds that they are producing  are composed of seven musical notes  folk songs devotional songs film music gazal  thumri classical music even western music all these different types of music are composed of seven basic musical notes  call them do re mi pha so la ti or  sa re ga ma pa dha ni  whether it is eastern music or western music these seven musical notes are universally accepted  after the completion of these seven notes the second octave begins  let us talk about indian music sa re ga  ma pa dha ni are basic seven notes called  shudha swaras  there are five more notes in between these basic notes  called komal and tivra notes  thus all music has these twelve basic notes  let us take an example of a very popular but very simple  bhajan that every indian can sing raghupati raghav rajaram  how many of us know of what musical notes this simple  bhajan is composed of ? let us see bhajan  let us hear the same tune now on guitar guitar being played  the same musical notes are either vocally produced or they are played on the instrument to produce the same tune  it is indeed very interesting to know who created these musical notes  about the origin of music and the seven musical notes there are many stories all different stories in different countries  different languages and different religion  hindus believe that brahmadeva created music gave this art to shankar who handed it over to saraswati who is considered  as the goddess of fine arts  later narad did penance or tapascharya and received the art of music from saraswati  narad then taught music to gandharvas kinnaras and apsaras bharatmuni the great sage is responsible for bringing music on this earth  even in the oldest of scriptures we find the mention of music according to one european story this world was originally created without music  this world was dry drab and very uninteresting  man and woman were unhappy and could not make love in this atmosphere  so god created seven beautiful melodious musical notes to make this world enchanting and lovable  in arabian history it is believed that music originated  from the bird bulbul  according to the african sage ifari man and woman were bathing in a beautiful lake and their movements in the water created lovely sweet sounds  these melodious sounds created in the water are the origin of music  well known musicologist rinsobols also believed that musical notes have originated from melodious sounds created in the ripples of water  the japanese scholar shikoba says in his book that music is has originated in heaven not on this earth  when man and woman were created by the god they already had the knowledge of music  so music is always considered to be divine  the western scholar freud always believed that origin of music has its base in the psychology of human being sounds the sounds uttered by the child sounds  crying laughing shouting are learnt by the child itself  nobody teaches the child to cry or to laugh  similarly the musical notes are created by the man himself  when he was feeling happy and relaxed sound  another western historian says that man has created music  through his wisdom and intelligence  man has always been searching different ways to entice the woman  so he has tried to attract her by creating different sweet melodious sounds and thus music came into being  well known indian scholar damodar pandit says that the seven notes of music are created by imitating the sounds of different birds and animals  the basic note sa is taken from peacock  re from chatak ga from sheep ma from kraunch or crane pa  from koel dha  from frog and ni from elephant  it is also believed that as seven colours are emitted by sunlight so the seven musical notes are emitted from om    om is one letter word containing three letters a oo and ma  these three letters symbolise energy   a symbolises creation or creator brahma  oo symbolises protector vishnu and  ma symbolises destroyer mahesh  all these three energies together form the trinity or trimurti parameshwar  the basic original sound used in vedas is om   the vibration produced by the correct utterance of this word  om are very very powerful and the correct utterance of om can awaken the latent energy of the man  the seven musical notes emanate from this one letter word  om  and the correct utterance and repeatedly utterance of  om and the pursuit of om can give the enlightenment of music  in indian music the seven musical notes are called  shadaja rishabha gandhar madhyam pancham dhaivat and nishad  who gave these names to these seven musical notes is really a mystery   shadaja means creator of six notes  the vocal singer fixes his basic note sa  according to the capacity of his vocal cords and from this basic sa he gives the ascent in ascending order  the next six notes re ga ma pa dha  and ni  before fixing the position of the seven notes one believed in twenty-two shrutis  sounds useful to create music were first called  shrutis  from the twenty-two shrutis in one octave  seven were chosen and names were given to them   shadaja madhyam and pancham   have four shrutis each nishad gandhar  have two shrutis each   rishabha and dhaivata have three shrutis each  during the vedic period only three musical notes were used  they were called udaatta anudaatta and  swaritta or prathama dwitiya and  tritiya  they were equivalent to gandhara rishabha  and shadaja  a little later one more note a little higher than these notes was used while chanting the vedas  it was equivalent to madhyam  later on three more notes equivalent to pancham  dhaivata and nishad were added  during panini's time these seven shudhha  musical notes were already accepted  later on five more notes were added  they were in between these seven notes  no new names were given to them but they were called   re komal ga komal ma tivra dha komal and  ni komal  thus these twelve music notes were accepted and all music is composed of these twelve musical notes  they are little lower or little higher than the shuddha  notes  so today we have these twelve basic musical notes  music is normally composed of three octaves each containing twenty-two shrutis  the middle octave is called madhya saptak the lower octave is called mandra saptak and the higher octave is called tivra saptak  different permutations and combinations of these musical notes  produce different moods different ragas different music all very pleasing to the ear  musical notes are like flowers in a garden  each flower has a different colour different aroma  different beauty and different splendour  each flower is beautiful  one can choose different flowers from this garden of musical notes  and form thousands of varieties of beautiful bouquets  this music bestows upon the human mind the heavenly bliss  and creates a harmonious and peaceful atmosphere for which the human being strives music 
in the last programme we had seen four basic consumer rights right to safety right to information right to choose  and right to redressal their concepts and connotations  in this programme we propose to concentrate on  consumers' right to safety which is the most paramount of all consumer rights  now when we think of consumer safety where wide range of goods and services to which the consumers are exposed in relation to health hazard or even for that matter life and death  take a small item like detergents and drinking water  if the drinking water is not wholesome and potable and free from germs and bacteria there are cases where the people run into cholera or gastroentitis and succumb to death  we had the situation last year in ahmedabad where three hundred and fifty people died on that account  take uh detergent  we do not realise but it's the poor or unsafe quality of detergent adversely affect the human skin and it also affects the life of the garment  now take the larger cases of uh aircrash where all the passengers flying by the plane might die  or take the still worse running out of the hazardous chemical industry  the most known example could be of the bhopal gas tragedy  where three thousand five hundred people are report to   reported to have been dead because of the leak of m i s  now therefore in this context it becomes very relevant as to how the consumers can and should protect both their health  as well as life  now here when we begin with the story we should look at some of the other items of domestic or day to day use  take for example domestic gas cylinder  there are cases where the gas cylinders are exploded and resulting into death of the house wives and sometimes with even  the babes in their arms  take other areas domestic electrical appliances   these are of day to day use and there are cases of electrocution that because of some defect somewhere person gets a shock and he gets killed  now take the other situations where uh the hazardous chemicals are involved  when because of fire explosion leakage or spillage  the people in the neighbourhood so far the factories are concerned or people travelling on the highway when transportation of hazardous chemicals is involved  or people living in far away distances where the hazardous chemicals are stored for marketing or distribution and something goes wrong  or take another area housing  if the housing is not properly designed and the construction or  workmanship are not of proper order then they result into  unsafe housing  apart from the most obvious one like the collapse of the house  there are more subtle forms of safety like from the   fl from the uhm floors above you if the water or the fluid from the sanitary blocks latrines or urinals begin to uh drip or begins to uh percolate then that leads to a different kind of health hazard arising out of dampness  and arising out of the discharge  now more obvious known cases of safety of housing happen to be  one where because of either the poor workmanship or a bad design  where a part or whole of the house collapses and as a result of which large number of people can die and do die  and this kind of things we have to see even more often in case of public buildings or public works like bridges dams and things of that kind  so therefore the question that arises is that if this is the  manner in which the consumers are exposed so far as their health  and safety are concerned how does one go about it  now one can talk of some measures that the consumers can take  for example if you are using a hair dye you should ensure to see that the chemicals used therein are not likely to cause cancer  or if you take the examples of domestic electrical appliances  whether do they carry i s i mark given by bureau of indian standards in the country  or if you look at the detergents whether they happen to be of a good quality and as a result of which neither the skin nor the life of the garments are likely to be affected  so there are some areas where the consumers themselves can take care in both ways either in terms of the following the instructions that are given for the use of these products or  even before buying the products one can take certain measures to see that  they do not run into unsafe goods  there is another area of consumer safety namely the adulteration of food  and there are cases reported time and again in the news papers  where because of the food poisoning people tend to die or run into far more serious physical ailments  there are also very subtle kinds of cases where there are some articles or some components in the food to which certain people might be alergic and as a result of which they tend to suffer a great deal  take another area for example medicine  now ordinarily all of us understand that medicine is supposed to help us in terms of the treatment from which we might suffer  but there are two kinds of serious problems with medicine  take those medicines which are available across the counter  without doctor's prescription  so in a sense the patient becomes a doctor and  when these medicines are purchased across the counter the concern is  how much information the patient has and is he able to take care  when he uses those medicines as such  you must have seen the reports of couple of years back when because of the adulterated or toxic substances in the glucose saline  about fourteen children died in bombay  now some of the medicines across the counter which look very innocent they themselves can become hazardous in respect of certain categories of patients like children pregnant women or aged people suffering from blood pressure or heart trouble  so therefore uh even the medicine which normally supposed to help us can cause this kind of health hazards or the problems of safety  now let us take some areas where you are not able to immediately connect the use of the product or the existance of the product with the safety  take for example asbestos  now the people who have been working in the asbestos factory  there has been situations where after five years of the retirement or ten years of the retirement the disease of asbestos comes on the surface  and by that time they might have not only left the factory but they might have left even the city where they were working and might have gone to their respective villages and they are not able to connect that this particular health hazard has a reason because of their exposure  to the factory where they worked  not only that even the people who happen to come in contact with the workers they carry those fibres from them  even take the consumers for examples where the asbestos  material is used either for insulation partition uh or  roofing or piping and all that and in the course of time they disintegrate and they affect the consumers as well  and this is such a slow process that it may take place after six months after five years or fifteen years and one is not able to realise the cause - effect relationship as such  take another example namely the disposal of toxic waste or disposal of uh chemical effluents  they might take place in one city and the effect on the  underground water in the wells or in the springs might be found thirty forty miles away from the place where they were discharged or the toxic waste might have been dumped today and may be after fifteen years some disintegration takes place and the ground water gets affected  so therefore you can see now from the various examples and  kinds of situations that i have described that the area of consumer safety is so wide and so large that one has to be extremely careful or cautious in ones own life  now there obviously will be a question that all this is fine but what can be done  now there are number of things that can be done and one can only illustrate as to how far you can succeed in getting things done  say for example take domestic electrical appliances and some of the items that we use in our homes day to day  because of the public opinion pressure ultimately the government of india came forward and they not only made the i s i standards compulsory uh i s i standards mandatory for these domestic electrical appliances but now in respect of some items for the country as a whole even the certification by i s i now called b i s has been made compulsory and those items happen to be like  these electric irons emersion heaters radiators uh then take  a the switches two pin and three pin plugs  now those about eight items for which no   not only the b i s standards are mandatory but even certification has been made compulsory which means that unless these items carry i s i certification mark they cannot be sold in the country  now at least one thing that i s i certification assures you is  that if the certification is done rightly at least they are safe products  they may or may not be of extraordinarily high quality but certainly they give you an assurance that they are the safe products  if by chance some manufacturer though he is carrying an i s i mark but those products don't confirm to i s i standard then his liability becomes much bigger  and in any case bureau of indian standards helps you in respect of dealing with that kind of situation either in terms of replacement of goods or any other remedy that may become available  uh in case of gujarat the state has gone even a step further  that all those faulty electrical appliances for which i s i standards were made mandatory way back in nineteen seventy-six and further amended in nineteen eighty-one all those appliances now are required to carry an i s i certification mark before they are being sold or marketed marketed in gujarat  uh one option is given that either they carry i s i certification mark or they carry a certification mark provided by chief electrical engineer  so this is one measure where the consumers can feel reassured that if they use the i s i certificated marks electrical goods in the home or appliances in the home they may be reasonably safe  another example that i want to you give is very interesting one  uh but is a foreign one where again it deals with the drugs  this happened in united states and particularly in the state of california  uh somewhere around nineteen seventy-one or meaning around that decade a drug was introduced in the market uh in the short words it was called des d e s and its full name is dyfile solbitrol  now this particular brand of medicine was introduced in the market to help pregnant women to avoid miscarriage or abortion  the drug was found to be effective so far as prevention of miscarriage or abortion was concerned  but it had an unusual kind of an fact not on the pregnant women who took the medicine but of the daughters born of those pregnancies and that too after the daughters reached the age of puberty between fourteen and eighteen  and those daughters were found to suffer from cancer and an interesting question of law arose that whether these daughters born of these pregnancies have a remedy against the pharmaceutical companies  you can imagine the difficulty involved that the daughters who are the victims are not are not the consumers of the medicine  and their mothers had consumed this medicine before fifteen twenty years when they were in their mothers wombs  and the matter went to the califor  california state supreme court and the court found a solution to this problem since this medicine des was manufactured and marketed by a large number of pharamceutical companies  so what the court did was that court asserting the total sale of the medicine and in this way total market for this medicine how much was the share or the market share of each of this particular products by each of the pharmaceutical companies and depending upon the market share of the pharmaceutical company for this particular drug  during seventies the court awarded a total damage let us say may be a million dollars or half a million dollars  and and then the court said on the principles of apportionment linked with the market share as to how much money shall be paid by each of the pharmaceutical company to these daughters who had suffered from cancer because of the adverse effect of this medicine as for a statistical information i can tell you that there are about one thousand such suits filed in the u s courts  now of course this particular drug has been withdrawn from the market  so what one would like to look at or look back and see that there are preventive measures which can be taken by the consumers and or the authorities concerned at the same time in the unfortunate event of loss or injury sustained by the consumers there are remedies available  and american example goes to a large extreme or a large unusual kind of condition where one is not able to prove the cause effect relationship between the particular product and its consequence and yet the victims were able to recover substantial amount of damages from the pharmaceutical companies  let us now come to the indian scene  if on account of use or consumption of any unsafe goods or  unsafe services of which i gave a number of illustrations or examples if the consumer suffers loss or injury what remedies are available to him ? under the consumer protection act of nineteen eighty-six  three tier quasi judicial machinery is being set up consumer grievence disputes redressal district forum state commission and national commission  now if the consumer is able to prove that the loss or injury suffered by him on account of unsafe goods or unsafe services  was on account of the negligence of the people who provided the goods or services the consumer will be able to claim damages in respect of loss or injuries suffered by him  so therefore this new machinery not only provide the remedy  but that remedy is likely to be most inexpensive and least time consumings because they are starting on a clean slate and they are specialised tribunals 
reproduction is essential for continuation of species in nature for this to occur sperm a male gamete and the ovum the female gamete are necessary  a proper understanding of a male reproductive system is essential to understand the intricate mechanisms of nature  the male reproductive system provides for the production and subsequent delivery of a highly specialised male gamete called sperm  which is produced in the testies   the ca the cell consists of paternal genes and this genetic complement is transferred to the female gamete during the act of fertilisation  to facilitate the essential function a male reproductive system forms a complet complete structure the organisation of the male reproductive system comprises a pair of testes epididemus vasaeference a complex array of accessory male genetic glands penis  in many animals the testes is a scrotal imposition just as in the case of man  but in some species testes occupy abdominal positions  there are wide spectrum of variation in the location of the testes the position of the testes in different groups of mamal shows enormous variation in terms of its location  for example in the case of elephant higher access the testes lies just behind the kidney  in the case of hedgehog and some other insectivores the testes is located against the ventral abdominal wall  in the case of pigs rats horses rabbits dogs and cats the position of the testes is in non pendulum scrotum is underneath the anus  in dolphins armedillos cavity slogs the testes is located at posterior end of abdomen  in the case of moults shoos and some species of birds the testes is located at the base of the tail  in sheep cattle and other ruminants also in some primates  the scrotum is pendulous  the typical male reproductive system consists of pair testes  which may be located in the scrotum or may be present in the abdomen the testes are uh provided with a thick fibres cover  called tunica alveginia  the testes is divided into many compartments and consists of many coil tibules which are called as semeniferous tibules  in between seminiferous tibules lie special type of cells  which are called as interstitial cells or the cells of leddes  the semeniferous tibules in a section consists of large number of cell types  basically these cell types are two the germs cells and the cells of sattory  the germs cells are concerned with the production of spermatozoa  while the cells of sattory basically have the nutritive function  if the cross section of the semeniferous tibule is examined  one would find the upper pair of cells to be spermatogonia  these themselves are of several types  they have been classified into spermatogonia of the a b and intermediate type  even the a and b type of spermatogonia are of several subtypes  which are classified on the basis of their cytological characteristics  the first generation of primary spermatocites cells these undergo myosis  the myosis itself is of two types reduction division where a number of chromosomes is reduced to half and myosis two which is an equational division where there is an increase in the number of cells  unaccompanied by further reduction in the number of chromosomes  a primary spermatocites give rise to secondary spermatocites  which i have n number of chromosomes and are therefore called as haploid cells  the secondary spermatocites grow into round spermatics  these spermatics undergo a process of differentiation which is called as spermeogenesis  there are essentially four basic steps in this process one is called as gorgie followed by a cap phase and agrosome phase and a maturation phase  the spermatozoa which are derive from spermatics are highly organised cells  from a genetic point of view these sperms are half cells because they contain haploid or half the number of chromosomes  if you take the example of human the deployed number for dual number chromosomes is forty-six  at the end of spermatogenesis therefore the sperm contains  twenty-three chromosomes  these sperms may contain either x chromosome or y and genetically therefore they are dimorphic  this text just enumerated above describe a typical structure of the seminiferous epithilium  however this should be understood that the cells present in the seminiferous epithilium are in a stage of progressive development all seminiferous epithilium cells do not show the same  associations  that is that the arrangement of cells in each seminiferous tibules is different  sometimes a large variety of cells can be seen in successive stages of development  the cell association is the term used to describe the arrangement of cells that is spermatogonia the primary spermatocites  despermatates and the differentiation process that is seen in the process of sperm formation  in the case of man there are six cell associations and fourteen different cell types have been identified  the cycle of development in the seminiferous epithilium  which leads to the formation of a completely differentiated sperm is called as sex cycle of the seminiferous epithilium  it takes about seventy-four days for a sperm to be derived from  the spermatogonia  the sperm formed in the testes are incapable of  fertilization and therefore they have to be uh they have to transit through o other  parts of the reproductive system particularly the epididamus  the root of spermatozoa is quite definite  from the testes they go into the retitestes and from where they go through a small ducts which are called as vasaefeverence  the vasaeference lead these sperms into the epididamus  the epididamus itself consists of three main parts  the top part which sits as a cap on the testes is called as cafort epididamus  the second part which forms the main body of epididamus is called as corpus and the terminal or tail part of the epididamus is called as corder  during their transit from cafort to corpus and finally to corder this sperm undergo vast and complex maturational changes  it can rightly be said that the epididamus is the main point  where the sperm undergo morphological biochemical and physiological changes which endorsed and the property of fertilizing the egg the sperm principally uh undergo changes in their membrane property in the maturation of uh the acrosome in the  uh ability to be more motile as they come into the corder  it has also been seen that the sperms on the cafort are incapable of fertilizing the egg and at best the rate of fertilization is about five percent  corpus sperm usually are better about twenty percent but by the time they reach the corder epididamus they their fertilizing potential is about ninety-five percent  from the corder they are transported to vasaeference  and from there they are mixed with secretions of the essentially male genetic glands the prostate the seminal cycles the valbo electral glands also called as scoupers and some other minor glands which are found in some species but not in others  the mamalian spermatozoa is a highly differentiated cell  the typical mamalian spermatozoa consists of three main parts the head the mid piece and the tail  the head is not itself a simple structure  it contains on its interior aspect a structure which is called as acrosome   the under the acrosome lies the nucleus which takes on the same shape as the head itself  the second part of the sperm is called as the mid piece  which contains the powerhouse of the cell called mitochondria  these mitochondria helically arranged and contains the necessary enzymes which can use the nutrients of the seminal fluid  for maintaining the integrity and functional abilities of the sperm  the acrosome itself contains three different types of enzymes  which are used in the process of fertilization  the tail consists of three main parts  the principal piece the end piece and a place where the mid piece joins the tail  the tail structure consists of two central filaments and nine peripheral filaments  the shape of this spermatozoa is very variable in the animals the number of sperms produced is also highly variable  for instance in the case of humans the number of sperms produced in one ejaculate is of the order of two hundred to four hundred million  the physiological function of the testes depend on a complex interplay of not only environmental factors but also on endocrine secretions  in principle extrinsic as well as intrinsic factors are involved with the stimulation of the nervous system  a part of the nervous system called hypothalamus contains special type of nerve cells which are called as neurosecretary cells  these cells secrete hormone which is called as  gonadotropin releasing hormone  these hormones can be transported to the pituitry by a vascular root or thorugh nural connections and it stimulate cells of the pituitry which in turn produces two types of hormones f s h and l h  the f s h act from the seminiferous epithilium and brings about  the development and differentiation of various egg cell types namely  from spermatogonia to spermatocites of primary and secondary type to spermatits and the formation of a differentiated sperm by spermatogenesis the f s h also acts on the certoli cells which are the nongerminal elements and these in turn secrete certain proteins which bind with the androgene produced in the ladic cells  such bound androgene proteins androgene bound proteins hormones are again carried to the testicular germinal epithelium where they bring about sustenance of spermatogenesis  the second hormone which is produced from the pituitry is called as l h  but in the case of male it is called as interstitial cell stimulating hormone  this hormone acts on ladic cells of the testes and   cau causes the release of androgene  androgene are important for large number of functions  for instance androgene which are bound to androgene binding protein produce certoli cells are important for spermatogenesis  androgene are also important for accessory male genetic gland functions  androgenes are also involved with the development and differentiation of secondary sex characteristics and they are also concerned with libido and sexual behaviour in the case of animals  in many animals the these events of endocrine secretions occur cyclically  for instance there are many animals in which these phenomena occurs only once a year  in others where this events may occur twice a year or in still others this event may occur several times in a year  in the case of man the process of spermatogenesis once it has started continues for a very long period of time to the age of seventy or even eighty years  however the limiting factors in the start of reproductive activities in the endocrine elements as well as in the testicular and ladic cells depends on the attainment of puberty which are complex sexual maturational changes that are time dependent  in the case of human male they begin to occur at the age of fifteen years  the testicular spermatozoa thus produced find a way into  the epididamus where sperms undergo maturational changes  described above as well as they transit into the vasaeference   the flow of sperms from epididamus to the vaseeference is partly by hydrostatic pressure as well as by peristaltic motion  from vaseeference the sperms are mixed with the seminal secretions contributed by the accessory male genetic glands  they come into the urethra and uh the terminal part of the urethra is the penis  this penis is of two main types  in the case of humans the penis is described as a vascular type  because the erection of the penis depends on congestion of blood  there are two main mechanisms for this erection  one is reflexogenic by spinal stimulation and the other is  by vasocongestion  the vasocongestion in this case may be psychogenic in  in the case of man  the second type of penis which is found in dogs and many other carnivores is called as the vibroelastic type  for copulation the sperms are deposited in female genital tract  the sperm uh with the seminal fluid constitute the semen this has an alcaline ph  the place where the sperms are deposited also shows variation  in the case of humans the sperms are deposited in the vagina  but in the animals like horses and others the sperms are deposited in the uterus  irrespective of the site of deposition the millions of sperms  face very hostile environment in the vagina and in the cervix  the ninety-nine percent of the sperms or even more are destroyed  in the case of human female the sperms are able to reach the felopian tube where the egg awaits them and nearly one thousands to three thousands such sperms may surround the egg  of these only one will one fuse with the egg and this ensures the beginning of a new life 
if you want me to talk on uh yakshagana   i can only talk on things that i have concerned myself with   yakshagana is an art form  i have been very much interested in popular folk art as well as the theatrical art of karnataka  that means the commercial theatre with their  music-cum-prose scenery and spectacular elements on the stage  as a student as a youth we had so many of the theatrical companies  i was exposed to them  i had a fancy for these things  later on i had impressions of the maharashtra theatre  its music its social place and all that  here one particular element interested me is this  you speak prose you get angry and then you sing a song  the same substance is carried the same object is carried through two different mediums  in dance you do foot work you sing you gesturise  and so many things  this put me into the problem  what can each do ? what can prose do ? what can music do ? what can dance do ? and what can they not do ? therefore for a quite a number of years i experimented in pure prose plays pure mime plays pure musicals pure folk musicals and so on  with this element i began to tackle the yakshagana theatre as such  for i felt it was very very rich in music  in the sense the words that they speak out in music is so rich and totally relevated relevant  to the subject matter  what does not appeal to me is the cleverness of the display of a  raga or a tala or any technical element  just as grammar is not literature so technique is not art technique is meant for a purpose  you use it for giving it a shape to your emotions  here what are the emotions in yakshgana ? what are the topics ? when it comes to the question of tapic topic   you know we are taking mahabharata plays we are not concerned with karna or kaurava or or any  rakshasa any saint  we are common people our experience for  so naturally you have to imagine these characters from how do they think  so how do you dress them ? do you bring them in your modern day suit or something else ? in that way yakshagana had one of the very richest element from nineteen thirty onwards  and many european scholars come and see the costume and make up  of yakshagana  it was so interesting  even in those days there were old people who could give  show any rakshasa chara   character in a different type and valourous character in a different type and common people in common dress  this was the element that attracted them that attracted me too  on the stage  but at the same time i felt so many things jarring  there are the female characters  say in a play satyabhama and rukmini come or  panchvati play the seeta comes  seeta comes in an ordinary dress along with rama coming in a different old time costume  this disharmony again disturbed me  it is not only that there were so many other questions raised we have got musical instruments  there is the drum there is the bhagwat and there is the dance  bhagwat is there narrating the story in so many ragas  and beautifully written songs  but sitting down on the stage can you make sense out  of even one word that he sings  he shouts he screeches and to outwit him there is the himmela  the himmela in most of our dancers are mummela they dictate terms to a dancer they do not follow him  so naturally what happens is you don't even hear a single word of the bhagwat  you hea hear him screeching  and you hear the drum play and all these things  this irrelevence with enough material of our own enough  ragas enough instruments enough judgement what is wrong with us ? we have begun to admire technique cleverness for its sake  shrieking for its sake the drum beating for its sake not for application of these things to give one word i want you want me to talk why ? to show that i am clever in talking that i can use bombastic words  or to show that i have something to say about the proposed subject yakshagana  that means reference of the content the form is every thing in art  by itself things may be beautiful but you are using certain things to project to communicate a story of the mahabharata  and all these things  naturally when we take these things when you come on the stage with uh a monstrous character a ravana and other characters and if you bring in seeta in ordinary dress i should feel that he has stolen the  girl from the audience there and she doesn't form ? similarly in costume  in old costume they strict some great man created the rakshasa costumes and these so many beautiful things in terms of colour in terms of painting some clever fellow did it  there is a harmony between what colours they have chosen  it doesn't the belong to the type of uh thinking as in kerala the satvik rajsik and tamsik forms colour harmony is a different element combination of light elements pigment elements and  on that basis they have done super work so far as many characters are concerned  but no costume no ornament for the lady character  the lady character brings the is brought   to be coquettish and woo the audience  she may be the seeta in talk and these things you are the men audiences to be wooed by shiny or very cinema like fans on the screen so they begin to come with the most beautiful gaudy  with make-up powder lipsticks and any silk now today you have got glaring dresses of any sort you begin to wear it  in kathakali we've got a fine breast plate you have got a heap of beads on it  why do you want the breast plate ? that means you have lost the eye for judging ornaments and colour harmony in costume itself in dress one word  our yakshagana dresses i have got certain things like this over  a grey or red jacket one is complementary to the other in terms of colour harmony  then you put garlands you put beads and glass tubes and then if somebody presents a a jasmine you put that also more the merrier  absolutely there is no sense of the stage colour harmony a stage is a painting where characters have to stand in respective places  each man has to balance somebody else forward backward in terms of colour in terms of form in terms of emotion  suppose you have got the pandavas sculptured out by a a great chola artist how would he make them stand one another not figures like this not presenting the characters in a form that all the forms blend together  an artist like rodan in building the hell gates of paradise  brings in a hundred forms one is harmonious to the other so the stage has to be conceived in terms of people who is there i drive away the musician there  i don't want the musicians behind to distort the shape of the beautiful characters  they may be very important but their music could be heard  so these are the elements form and content in terms of music and these things  one big thing came to me is you take the raga  and the tala elements your beat you are very perfect you are great artist in training you never go wrong  but do you sing the same thing ? i remember one day a play like a a gypsy comes and asks seeta did you see ravana ? no i have not seen him i might have seen his leg  alright draw a picture of the leg  then she completes and makes it a ravana and rama comes he says you are still unfaithful you are still dreaming of ravana  then the punishment  summary is laxman take her and chop her head off  she is taken most pathetic situation the drum beating chandi is as if you are taking a number of sheep to the kali temple  this is what happens in every thing  in every classical form you see thai thak thai thai thak thai thai thak thai and the song is shringara  is it shringara ? it is terrific shringara then  this is what made me think how to sing ? how to dance ? this is the step work maybe same tala  she is in a sorrow position wailing all through how does she present herself  we confine tala rhythm to the leg  emotion is a body element there is the child that can get angry joyful every element of the body is seen  leg and tala is not confined to the legs alone  to every moment of the rhythm  the whole body has to respond to an emotion  so in a greater sense you mean to say what is more effective on the stage in terms of voice in terms of so many things  is there no individuality ? have you to repeat it ? then there are so many things on the stage which we think of  where emotions are strife  all yakshagana plays are epical plays mahabharata  plays or conflicts of emotion  they can give you a full range of things on the stage if you want to do it if you want to feel it  but how would you do it ? our guru taught us like this to hold the hands and go like that  the guru seems to be a ghost for chasing people and artists to the length of her entire transformation of souls  you are there to feel as an actor evoke what best is there what best do you give ? now i take it a question that is posed to yakshagana  and our music also  our music is in yakshagana  may be classical music  why do you sing ? does it contain words ? for what was it created ? what are the words ? the words say something your tala says something your raga says that you are very clever you can sing for half an hour or even one hour a raga  but what is the word that you say ? this is everything i can uh there is a hindustani song  who is as great as rama  the word is aiso koudara jagamai in the whole world  there is none to beat rama  why ? because whatever greatness blessing they wanted to know these people for years together prayed rama  without praising anything doing anything he blessed the  vaccha jatayu he blessed the kubja  so there is none like rama  if i say the word aiso koudar jagamaai in the whole world koudar it's acclamation in sound  jagamaai  why ?  vinuseva jodravaidinapara vinuseva jodravaidinapara ramasarisakonahi koudar  every good composition was a reflection of a thought from a saint or somebody else  similarly yakshagana songs or every song is a reflection of an emotion  how do you mouth it ? yakshagana is very heroic  i thump the beat and i show that i am very rigorous  are you heroic even in death even in pathos ? means even if before your child dies there  it should make sense  in which case yakshagana is an element  i think to me it is greater than classical element  for this one thing classical music was written by savants  who were mostly saints mostly saints  they were reclusers  they were sorry for the birth of man they were sorry for any anything everything   so they used to either sing the praise of the lord or say o lord why did you bring me to earth  but a drama contains ever so many other emotions joy valour jealousy and all these things it must lend them  it is there  i can i end end end my short talk by giving one note of the yakshagana song  in the battle after the third battle third day duryodhana begins to weep  we have lost all rounds o dronacharya where is the hope for us  there is no hope  because the great demon killer krishana is  arjuna's charioteer  the man whom i had trusted vidura has given away and gone away the great commander my grandfather bheeshma is lying on a bed of arrows  what shall i do ? now i will give you the kannada word yena madali nanu  ? what shall i do ? for what purpose ? to defeat the pandavas pandavara solipade  why ?  danava takanavanu avage sarathiya agianu  the great demon killer krishna is a charioteer for arjuna then my friend vidura broke his bow went away then bheeshma is lying there almost dead  what shall i do ? this mood for an actor can come in ten different ways  it depends upon his liking of somebody else his hatred or jealous his despondency his sorrow for this sake yena madali nanu pandavara solipade yena madali nanu pandavara solipade yena madali nanu pandavara solipade danavantak-navage sarathiya agianu  ten different moods can be depicted do you beat your drum to suit the mood or anything  so we can build up a great art even today we have got enough material from the past why our tradition to be preserved is though we have not used it sensibly we have enough materials  in music we have a thousand ragas  how many emotions have i given expression to  sometimes we are perverse we are praying vinayak in what manner ?  vatapi ganapatim bhajihum va  you are clapping ganapati it is a praise  this perversion why does it happen ? you are a votary of grammar thinking grammar is art  grammar is that art  it is this way we can do a lot and a lot can be done to preserve or show the greatness of our own art  showing by our skill about art is totally different  you can admire me you can admire anybody  but show the potentiality of the indian art how it relates to the expression of the human urge in ways of art i think i have bored you enough 
to most of us the term map is quite familiar  but still we do not understand the exact meaning of a map  perhaps we are not sure what a map conveys or what a map is likely to present to us  that shows there is a need to define the term map    map is nothing but representation of  the whole surface of the earth or part of the surface of the earth according to scale  when i use the word whole surface of the earth i mean the world  when i say a portion of the earth that means it can be a town it can be a village  now when i use the word scale the scale means that all the things that we find in the reality cannot be transferred on a map  you have to represent that's found in the reality  in other words that one inch if you draw on a map perhaps it represent sixteen kilometres on the ground  that shows the scale is one inch to sixteen kilometres  now if one has to explain the concept of a map let us take a very very simple example  you are calling your friend home for a dinner and you have given the address too to him  but he finds it extremely difficult to locate your house  after a few queries perhaps you feel that your friend is not confident to reach your home  may be you would like to take a small piece of paper and draw a few lines clearly indicating what is a road on which your house is located  what's a land mark which is quite simple to identify and how to reach your place  well this sketch makes the man more confident and he is able to get himself acquainted with your area and he will be able to reach home confidently  now what does it mean ? it means that you have drawn a part of the city in a small sketch to convey the message to your friend  i call this as the concept of map  well if you agree that any message can be transmitted in the form of a map  now we would like to know how often we use map  well how old is this concept ? you would like to know whether we came to know about maps only recently or it has a history behind  i would like to say that the concept of map was dates back to six hundred b c  greeks and romans were the pioneers to introduce the concept of map  perhaps you would like to know that in second century a d  it is ptolemy who brought the concept of the map for the whole world  however the accuracy of the map is not that encouraging very rough idea of the world was given  but very accurate map dates back to sixteen seventy-eight i would like to show now a map which is quite  accurate accurately drawn during the historical period here you have a map which was drawn in the year sixteen seventy-eight  and it is the history's first accurately drawn map it represents facts which is drawn with true to scale and the colour which you could see here is nothing but hand painted colour  after watching the historical map which is hand painted  the maps have gone a revolution in terms of painting and production   today's maps are multicoloured and looks  pleasant and more informative  but the maps have also incorporated concepts like  direction distance and location  these three concepts have been given more importance in the modern maps  i would like to show a map of tamil nadu wherein  the concept of location direction and distance could be  easily seen  we have a map here which is a representation of  tamil nadu state  if you look into this map very carefully the first thing that comes to your mind is the location of places  here i have the location of bangalore which is given in the form of a black dot and this is exactly known as location of a particular place  our next concept is the direction  i have here marked a red arrow line facing towards the top which is nothing but the northern direction  in other words most of the maps are prepared towards northern direction on the top of the map  well from the direction we move to the scale  the scales are given at the bottom sometimes both in the form of figures as well as in the form of equivalance roughly six point eight miles on the ground represented on one centimetre in the map a map contains two important components  number one it is a skill in art  number two it is the technical skill which is needed to draft a map  skill in art means the designing of a map  positioning of letters symbols title writing and drawing the  components inside a map which should be more pleasing aesthetic  to the viewer or to a map user  similarly the second part of it which i call it as a technical drafting is a very difficult job because the maps have to be  drawn according to scale and the information have to be transferred into a map in a systematic manner so that the minds idea follow the things in a very very systematic manner  it is very difficult to understand what is the step by step  movements  because a map is a highest form of graphic it is in a position to create a visual image in your mind  you will keep things in your mind for a long time to come  its quite easier to understand that map is a very powerful tool of communication  i would like to now explain how a written text and a map if they are together how do they convey the message to you let us look at a small piece of information which i have taken from a newspaper  we will look into that in a more systematic manner  here is a small cutting wherein you will be able to see the text which is written over here and simultaneously on the other side a map is drawn  perhaps you will understand that this map is complementary to the text  i do agree  but if you look into the text very carefully you will know that as you read the sentences it will go into your mind and you will be able to understand the news in a systematic manner  perhaps if you read only the first sentence and jump into the last sentence you will miss the message  you will not be able to receive anything  therefore you are required to move sentence by sentence to understand the message  so is the case with the map  if i have to say today i am going to deal with kuwait   that means first i should know where kuwait is located in the middle east  and here is the small insert map which gives an idea that where is kuwait located  from that you move on to the kuwait and its surrounding countries with physical as well as cultural features  so your eye and mind goes step by step from one message to another message  all these messages are slowly steadily kept in your mind  and you can retrieve this message in a more systematic manner  in addition to this possibly you not only store this message in your mind you will be able to interpret the news in a much more scientific way in order to understand the situation better  therefore i would say that map is a very powerful tool of communication  let us look at the map in the form of a globe  you are able to see this globe now wherein the land  sea are distributed in aesthetical manner  this is more or less true to the reality  but you will be able to see that the size of the land  especially if you could watch the greenland which is quite small in size as compared with the canada united states  etcetera  but if this globe has to be broken into several parts  and then represent in a plain sheet of paper how difficult it will be it will be definitely difficult to represent this on a plain sheet of paper because this will be distorted  once it is distorted the figures will not appear clearly  the shape size scale will all vary  therefore there is a need of mathematical calculation of  latitudes and longitudes to be corrected in such a manner so that entire thing can be transferred on a plain sheet of paper  for this process we use a technical term known as projection the projection is nothing but arrangement of latitude and longitude in such a manner so that you represent the surface of the earth any part of the surface of the earth according to correct shape  and size  here is a world map wherein the entire land and ocean is represented in a plain sheet of paper  you are able to see the greenland which is bigger than  canada  whereas in the previous scene we have seen in the globe that greenland was much smaller than canada this indicates that the representation of the sphere on a plain sheet of paper necessarily brings distortion of shape and size  now symbols are the most important components of a map  i would like you to look at the symbols which are given in a map drawn for india  if we look into this map it is a tourist road map  of india wherein the symbols are given in different forms  the first and the foremost symbol is the administrative symbols in other words the administrative symbols are nothing but lines  drawn to show the administrative boundaries  now this particular line is a line which separates india from nepal  and this administrative line is known as international boundary when we come down you will be able to see the boundary line which separates uttar pradesh from madhya pradesh  again this is another symbol which represents the  administrative set up of the country  after that the most important symbol that we would like to look into is the physical symbol  physical means that the representation of the physical details of a map  here we are able to see the river which is given in the form of a blue line  now usually the rivers are given blue lines mainly because one is able to perceive the reality in without much difficulty  after the river symbols probably the next one which attracts most us is the cultural symbols  the cultural symbols the good example will be a road  now the hyderabad is connected to nagpur via highway  which is given in the form of a red line  like this almost all the symbols are carried out in a map in a sophisticated manner so that each symbol merges with the map in a systematic manner the next important component is lettering  the size style direction of letters do indicate  different type of messages  the size of the letters do indicate the hierarchy of place names  the direction of letters also indicate the style as well as the slope of a river  similarly if a group of islands have to be shown they are written in such a manner so that it covers all the distribution of islands now in this map the first thing is that the title is written in a corner below which you will find the scale is written below the scale you will find the term legend  indicating that all the details which have gone into the map are given  in other words that in the format one should be in a position to read first this and then familarise himself with the details then go to the map to read the map what it is all about  the second most important thing that you have to keep in mind is  the design of the total format wherein you will be able to see  the inner line will give you the latitude and longitude boundary the outer line will give you the finishing for the entire map  all the details should come between these lines which are known as neat lines  in the black and white map you are unable to distinguish  between one region to another region and different symbols  whereas in a colour map the eye catches the difference at much faster rate  in other words from the point of your communication it appears that colour seems to play a most important role  if we look into these maps you will be able to see that  this is the map of the city of madras  it is a large scale map  but here we have the tourist map of tamil nadu which is a small scale map  so maps can be classified on the basis of the scale so that it is easy to identify the specific purpose for which the map is prepared  we could see today in the world the educationists school children scientists planners administrators politicians  business people all of them are using the maps in some form or other the man who draws this map usually called as a cartographer  the subject which deals with designing drafting and printing of maps usually known as cartography  well today we could see that the developments in the field of cartography or in the preparation of maps have reached such a high standard that computer technology and satellite imageries have come into a great way in expanding the scope of mapping the earths surface  maps are part and parcel of life  one is able to convey the message more effectively accurately  scientifically through maps  and it reminds us a graphical age in your mind the years to come  i am sure you will also agree with me that there is a need to create this awareness in the utility of maps in the man's  life 
in today's programme we bring you a talk on the british policy towards the tribes of north east india in the nineteenth century the talker is dr anwar hussein lecturer in the department of history dibrugarh university  after the first anglo-burmese war of eighteen twenty-four  twenty-six the british established themselves in the valley of the brahmaputra expelling the burmese from the country  then they now face the new problem the problem of the hill tribes in the north east frontier  so the reason to formulate a policy which was not a static one  but it had to be geared up to beat the exigencies in the frontiers the aim and object of the policy was to control the tribal areas for the excercise of limited administrative authority  the political aspect of the policy and all states was to use the tribes on the eastern fringes as a screen between the newly acquired territories and the kingdom of burma was initiated  with a view to using the sinko's tracks as a screen  east of armies treaties were signed between sinko chiefs and the company chiefs  the mamoir tracks were also kept separate from the upper assam principality of purander sinha who was enthroned in eighteen thirty-two and allowed to rule till eighteen thirty-eight  for securing ready supply of provisions for british troops passing through the region  but exodia and jaitu contingence of british army  were deployed to observe the in what activities of the frontiers  the austro mongoloid hill tribes in north eastern india on the other hand had maintained a potential isolation for centuries the mountainous character of the territory linguistic variations inter-clan feud and inter-tribal warfare had prevented political union among the hillman  while the superstitious customs of head hunting and sorcery practised by some of the tribes engendered that  a policy of indifference on the part of the neighbouring rulers  in the plains  the hills were clotted with dense forests and bordered by patches of hollows and swamps  the physiographic conditions rendered inter-communications  almost impossible  and while the climate was extremely innovating and the people of the hill areas had to live in seclusion  so the tribes except towards the west outside the western boundary of bhutan there was no organised kingdom hence they were not capable of resisting the british arms  beginning with the bhutias of bhutan a series of engagement enter with the tribes by which they undertook to surrender their rights in these territories for a consideration of regular payment of compensation by the company's government but the government in return intended not to interfere in the internal affairs what were left alone in the hills  in primitive times the payment of compensation in the form of pasa or assignment of a part of revenue was a system interlift by ahom to reoncile the hill tribes on the frontiers of the kingdom  but british made a substantial change in the system which was existed during the ahom time  it stopped a direct collection of the dues by the tribes  themselves from the rayats because it led sometimes to quarrels  instead of it begin to pay them some cash which was known as black mail and it was collected at the same time through dues from the rayats who were exempted from payment of dues to the tribesman  this system actually cut off the direct link between the  rayat and the tribes  to begin with the attitude of the tribes towards the british government did not seem to be hostile  the kamtis and shintos accepted the british overtures of friendship and their by british was successfully the entering  into sort of ties with them  abars was also friendly till the middle of the century  the dafalas and aakals agreed to accept the money payment in lieu of their right to collect their pasa   in the due in the doers  but after the consolidation of the british rule in assam  the tribes became alive to the ensuing danger of the new system and became restless  though the kamtis revolted with the assistance of shintos  or in the pandal was suppressed by the british arms and divided the whole country areas into four tracks which was under the direct control of the government  like the shintos the abars the aakal the dafalas  created problem during the british regime  the nagas of the tira district continued to committ petty theft and loot for a quiet long time  so the guzzling feast of rich and other tribals had to do  due to their frustration and poverty in their economic and political reason  so the british government had gradually begun to substitute cash payment in lieu of articles and the money payment  which was fixed with the then market price remained fixed all through the british period  in order to solve the tribal problem the british government  introduce certain policies  for example number one to set up out-post along roads of the tribal movement to set the encroach of the tribe  number two restrictions on plains people entering into hills for which the innerline regulation was passed in eighteen seventy-three  which restricted the entrance of the plains people into the tribal hill areas  and thus minimised the contact between the hills and the plains  number three to popular popularise  the british manufactured products in the tribal hill areas  in popularising the european products all good  and promoting their sale they first had vital importance  as a result tribal products mainly raw materials  came down in the market and european good powered into the tribal territory etcetera  apart from this it is predict if we see the character of the british policy then we'll find that the hill areas in north eastern india enjoyed a distinct feature in the administrative map of british india  the system innovated tended to serve the colonial interest anxiety for the difference of imperial frontier with china and burma protection of villages in the plains from tribal rage  and exploitation of economic resources of the hill had prompted the british authorities to abandon the earlier theory of non- intervention  the traditional institution were not disturbed and the tribesman were allowed to feel that they were still governed by their hereditary chiefs  but the concept of a free man was completely lost and the chiefs were no better than government servants  the excluding regulation created a gap between the people of the hill and the plains and even in the hill areas there were several administrative blocks like excluded area and control area a series of the administrative borders were created in the region and stringent restrictions were imposed upon the outsiders in this area  tribal and non-tribal were infused as new social term  in indian social structure  the lost balance of unrestricted trade in the hill borders  and a process of social assimilation was began in the foothills  the seat is set back due to the segregrain  policy of the british  the other factor was education which was left entirely to western missionaries who were invited by the government to undertake  post le postalisation and the schools were supported under gram scheme aid system in the beginning bengali was the medium of instruction and tribal languages were written in bengali script  but subsequently english became the medium and bengali script was replaced by roman  the integration of the hill people with the rest of the country  would have been accomplished as a natural process but the colonial attitude of the british segregating regulations and creations of the administrative artificial walls create a big vacuum large number of hillman converted into christianity but those who believed traditional religion and practices the age old customs were reformed as non christians as if they had no religion  to be mentioned  there is no reason to accept the western science of civilization as in a wastage  while some traditional customs are highly scientific  and many in indian situation  so the aim of the british was to safeguard their imperial  interest and try to justify the colonial control by projecting  some wrong understanding about the indigenous system of the hill people as backward unemployed their own way of administration  in the hill areas of the north eastern region 
radio sangli  the time is eight fifteen p m  tomorrow is to observe this event we now bring you a talk entitled higher education and women  the speaker is dr vasanti rasam  and she is highlighting the factors responsible for such a low female literacy and makes certain recommendation  problems of women can be visualised in almost all forms of system with varying degrees  neverthless women in socialist nations seem to have come a long way in achieving equal status to that of man  on the other hand indian women have been oppressed in all the fields at two levels at the caste and class level  in educational sphere too women have been opressed under the traditional set up of our society  recently there is a growing tendency towards improving the conditions of women in india considering them to be a part of national development process  the major thrust of the seventh five year plan   was on the development of women  the basic approach would be to enable women to acquire confidence in themselves and to develop a sense of responsibility  towards the overall development and betterment of society and their individual personality  all this comes in a country where horrifying atrocities have been committed against women since ages  even fifty years ago female infanticide child marriage  and subsequent widowhood sati devdasi etcetera were widely prevalent and are still heard of in rural areas  with independence came the age of social reform to eradicate the evils against women  but still today even if you just scratch the surface of indian culture we are exposed to the male dominated society  where did we go wrong then ? why does the indian women still reveal in stereotype role of self sacrifice rather than those of self awareness ? the blame must surely lie at the doors of our educational system which is nearly a ritual rather than an effective means of equalising opportunity and erasing the sex bias  education for girls was and is still influenced by a wide range of factors which are considerably different from those that affect boys education  it can be noted that girls education at large was encouraged  and tolerated after an age or after certain standard at which it can do little good or little harm  the notion that education itself whether primary secondary or higher is harmful was prevalent upto yester years and is still relevent as far as higher education is concerned  this notion limited the exposure of women to the external world and influences  the basic conviction that there is something special about womens nature which could be destroyed by excessive education portrayed the uniqueness of women and hence the difference in the syllabii of boys and girls  the rudiments of reading writing a little arithmatic hygiene needle work embroidery and vernacular language were being regarded as more than adequate for girls  once a demand for women's education came from the social reformers for their emancipation there was also demand for educated bride for a new western educated breed of men  thereby expanding the aim of education for girls from competent wife and mother to intelligent companion  the liberational role of education emphasised by the radicals had been subordinated to the social goal of willing admissal and not a questioning and an enquiring mind  here one can note the conflict between the ideals of womenhood of our society and the ideals of education which lead to creation of a certain measure of independent thought a spirit of enquiry and of objectivity which as a bind by men of our society could threaten  the well maintained differences between the sexes  and they also feared that their control over women would be marginalised with too much of education of wrong kind  this ideological difference continued to be preserved today  despite the efforts made by various planning commissions for the improvement of female literacy   mrs durgabai deshmukh committee put forth the view that in no way was education a threat to family life and that today  there was a need to break the barriers of the gender based division of work  this opinion was reiterated by the kothari commission  also   the hansa mehta committee holds that inequality of sexes is built in the minds of men and women through socialisation which continues to be extremely powerful  which was also accepted by the committee on status of women in india in ninety seventy-four  of recent the seventh five year plan  threw the challenge to education a policy perspective listed some laudable goals of education for women also  despite the above effort and an increase in the girls enrollment at primary and middle school level the percentage of absolute  or absolute magnitude as compared to boys is still low  further even though the performance of girls compared favourably with that of boys only a limited number of girls seek admission into higher education or professional courses other than those pertaining to medicine teachers' training and nursing  the drop out rate also in case of girls at middle school level is much higher than boys  what then are the specific reasons for such low female literacy  ? one of course is poverty where a family's economic  and financial problem do not give an opportunity to girls where preference is for educating a son rather than a daughter who is to be married off and sent to some another family  the second reason could be classified as ignorance or cultural biases of society and the consequent belief that education is irrelevent to the future role expectation of a wife and a mother  it may be observed that many parents still hesitate to send girls to distant or coeducational institution and are averse to those in which there are no women teachers  while for the rural women education is considered unnecessary  for an urban women it is merely a value wager in the competitive marriage market  despite the fact that the system has the attitude the brother is encouraged to take up higher education at all cost  this is due to the influence of nonacademic factors related to social and familiar expectation as to what a girls basic role in life is to be a good bride intelligent companion but not an enquiring mind but a devoted mother and who may if she has time work at most as a teacher or as a clerk  it is also unfortunately true that even girls at large choose to believe that there can be no fulfilment in combining many roles or to compete in the male dominated area  interesting factors that the proportion of women to men at the post graduate level is higher than at the undergraduate level which shows that once women in certain areas are able to break the barriers of prejudice they proceed to acquire further degree and perhaps a job  not doubting their aptitude but have mental ability of her mind  indian woman today is caught up in the terrible cross current  on one hand she is a best by model handed down by our traditional society and on the other she is being communicated by various agencies negating these morals  woman therefore is responsible themselves partially as she does not take a stance even when she is badly pushed  those who have an opportunity to get higher education even as far as post graduation and doctorate are not able to decide for themselves to make a career as it would depend once again on the man her husband or in-laws to decide for her future after her marriage   there's no doubt state of women literacy is improving  yet as compared to that of male literacy is still low more so in rural areas  moreover even today educational institutions are not regarded as institutions for acquiring knowledge and for providing training for a good vocation but as respectable waiting rooms for girls who are to be married off  thus the function of education also will relatively be  different in case of girls and boys to date  the dilemma casued by the exposure to the external world  coupled with a need to keep in touch with the notion of female dependency is result by choosing well demarketed suitable areas or otherwise called the safe educational realms of study for girls and avoiding others  the major efforts of the libera liberal  forces to improve womens educational status by raising the age of marriage and emphasising education as an important means of emancipation cannot be denied  yet the liberal view of education as a liberating force  is however undermined or the limit to access to education posed by womens role in the family  for all the classes of women the content in role of education victory a deep ambivalence between womens role and individual growth  thus if education is to play a due role in translating  women's equality from the pages of the constitution to actual reality then education policy must introduce basic issues like as access or reduction and later elimination of gender disparity within the educational process which also reflects in employment socio-political participation opportunities for personal growth and competence which alone can build defences against degradation exploitation or oppression and lead to self confident individual  this requires educational system to take up the task of changing the attitude and values regarding womens role and rights in society  to one of the equal participation in all socio- economic and political processes and national and international development  for this the educational programme for female literacy needs to be re-evaluated and formulated a new in the light of experience of the bygone years  a general plan for education which is not taken into account  the specific problems faced by women fails to benefit them  thus a kind of grassroot input is necessary so that  the programmes planned at the ministerial level translate themselves into meaningful developmental input 
all india radio panaji  title economic imparities of the new government   the speaker is shri prabhakar angre  never in the post-independence history of the country a government has had to face massive challeges such as the one  which is two weeks old government of india had to endure with  though the government is solidarily responsible to find a solution to economic problem a lot depends upon the present finance minister in formulating policies which will take care of the situation  our main concern today is to retain the status of non defaulter  in honouring our financial committments  for the first time after independence our pay deficit has crossed rupees ten thousand crore  our balance of payment position is critical mainly due to our sluggish growth in export which have been below the set target  and also a declined in n r i remittances  we have had three successive good monsoons inspite of these  even the usual seasonal decline in prices of food grains has not been experienced and the inflation has already crossed double digit mark  the economic imparities before the new government are  containment of fiscal and revenue deficit servicing of foreign debt  contracting additional foreign debt to tide over the crisis  improvement in our foreign exchange reserves and bringing down the inflation rate to four to five percent within the next two three years  if politician colleague of our finance minister allow him  to adopt pragmatic policies and do not pressurise him for adopting populace measures he may be able to present a budget which will be indicative of his resolve to take up the country from its present morale  according to official estimates the gap between government revenue and its total expenditure represent eight point five percent  of countrys gross domestic product which is estimated in the region of rupees five and eight thousand crore  only the revenue deficit which was just rupees   one thousand six hundred and sixteen crore in nineteen eighty eighty-one shot up to rupees twelve thousand four hundred and thirty-six crores in nineteen eighty-nine ninety  our foreign exchange reserves which were above seven million dollars in nineteen eighty fell to four million dollars in nineteen eighty-nine and today they are just sufficient to cover two weeks import of the country  our debts service coverage issue which was eight percent of export earnings in nineteen eighty eighty-one is now estimated at about thirty percent whereas this debt level should not cross twenty percent  according to a recent world bank report india's   trade regime is restrictive discretionary complex and most difficult to administer and hence it needs to be drastically over hauled  the world bank has recommended among other measures  abolition of quantitative restriction on import cutting custom tariff  from an average of hundred and seventeen percents to not more than twenty percent jacking up of excise duties to make up the short fall etcetera  the recommendations do not appear to be palatable to many  but in the absence of a more acceptable alternative there is no escape  from accepting the recommendations of the world bank  it will be necessary for the country to change its economic policies relevant to the nineties and make a departure should have an extremely close allies of among themselves so as to make the maximum use of the available resources  the whole world is vying to attract foreign investment  the developed world is waiting for india to open up but it will not wait indefinitely  foreign equity is recently pre  preferable to foreign loan and we should loose no time in evolving a clear cut policy conducive to attract the foreign investment  in our country  such a step will reduce our interest burden on foreign loan  and to that extent our balance of payment position will improve  in view of the establishment of european economic community   india's export will have to face a fierce international competition in terms of prices quality specification and delivery  the country will have to evolve positive policies to boost export including those considering the trade union which sometimes takes some action detremental to keeping delivery schedule our present export are only five point five percents of gross national product whereas china and indonesia have achieved the percentage of fourteen and twenty-one percents respectively  the recent devaluation of rupee is expected to give a big boost to export though other consequences will have to be considered  other important conditionalities prescribed by the world bank  are export of nine percent in government expenditure and a drastic reduction in agricultural subsidy  for a popularly elected government these are going to be hard decisions but its reduction in agricultural subsidies is accompanied by an upward revision of procurement prices so farmers lobby could be quitened  it is estimated that the annual outgo on various subsidies  including the concealed one at the centre and state level is nearly  rupees sixty thousand crores which represent twelve percent of our gross national product  state electricity board has huge accumulated losses  essentially because they are not allowed to charge commercial rates to the consumer  in in case of agriculture we loose about forty-five  paise per unit  this is the reason why the policies of the government they are not economically viable  if populism is persued beyond the point it would become counter productive and frustrating  investment made from borrowed capitals should yield return  higher than the interest rate so that they can take care of payment of interest and one word of the principal amount  greater and rising productivity alone can lead the country  along the path of stability and progress  all these years the policy makers have found it difficult  to politically follow what they should have economically followed  and as a consequence of which our country has turned now to be a high cost economy and we are outcast in the global market  in nineteen fifty india steel price was the cheapest in the world today it is the costliest   coal india limited is over staffed with about one lakh workers and there is no political will  to deal with redundant labour  food subsidies are given to every one irrespective of his income bracket  payment as resources are vested in keeping loss making public sector units alive  a big chunk of bank funds is blocked in sick unit which are not allowed to die their natural death because of labour conflict  the purpose of world bank suggestive reforms has been to increase the productivity and efficiency of indian economy upgradation of technological base and improve its international competitiveness  these are the objectives all of us want to achieve  the suggested reforms package is also gradual and safe  making the state regime more transparent less bureaucratic and more liberal  thus it is not to be rejected only because it has a conditionality of the world bank  the world bank will consider a further plan of five to seven billion dollars after examining the austerity measures initiated by the government of india and hence there appears to be no escape from choosing the fiscal course that is a part of international monitory funds standard prescription for countrys having serious balance of payment problem  in the light of economic imparities we have to address ourselves to the forthcoming budget formulation and its provisions must give clear signals to assess international situation that india is serious and has the capability to implement some of the harshest measures to correct fiscal anomolies in the indian economy system and reform the situation on all fronts  this will convince international creditors international monetary funds and the world bank the need to support india by providing the necessary cushions against precarious balance of payment position  the budget will have to spell out a long term integrated economic policy covering digit matters relating to monetary  fiscal industrial in which would need a loan of about ten to fifteen billion dollar to plan a definite programme  piecemeal assistance may not help much  the budget will have to lay a special emphasis on export promotion  presently export documents have to be signed at two hundred and fifty places and hundred and eighteen papers have to be completed  in the estimated time involved in this operation is twenty-two hours  the paper work as ten percent of the cost in united states only five documents are enough for export clearance   india's external sectors have seldom seen the type of problem which it is now witnessing and overcoming the same will need  some very committed action from the government and unflinching support from the opposition parties in the parliament  that was a talk in english entitled economic imparities of the new government  the speaker was shri prabhakar angre 
 recording broken  the journey was by itself not attracting much attention seem to take longer than usual at last i was at the door step and on entering the house first thing that i learnt was that my cousins had not arrived  suddenly the journey that i had just completed appeared to be much more troublesome than what it actually was  every part of my body began complaining loud and clear not being much interested in the delicious food prepared my by by my aunt i slept hoping that this brother of mine would wake would wake me up in the morning  the dawn passed and so did the noon and the sun had  began begun to set the phone bell rang having grown tired of waiting and having cursed him for what would be enough for a life time to bear i was convinced that the phone carried a message saying we would be arriving on twenty-sixth  but no my spirits were once again reaching sky high when i heard that raju had rung from the pu pune  railway station itself and in no more than half an hour there we were all beholding this great man  he was indeed given a rousing welcome under my leadership  after having sufficiently aroused the emotion of other family members i was not much surprised to note that his knowledge about this whole affair  was not as much compared to mine  trying to defend ourselves of this adventure or misadventure  that was to follow bearing the brunt of all the criticism which was whole heartedly poured on us we realised that it was just a couple of  hours before the departure of the jhelum  jhelum did depart sharp at five thirty from pune as scheduled  and the two of us sitting facing each other deeply  engaged in studying the railway time table where we were to go and how the train sped fast and this was one of my first journey  in a vestibule train which had an attached pantry car and the sun  was preparing to make way for the bright star of the night  we decided to have our dinner courtesy indian railway  hardly a few hours passed we thought of stroll through the compartment and believe me what a sight it was with the new considerations to our ages there was enough happenings around that made us a little uneasy  for a moment there seem to be a variety of different cinemas  being screened all around when the noise of food being served made us rush back to our seat  the food was interesting not delicious as such  my cousin had never ventured to call anything edible bad  sleep thrust in with a mixed feelings having decided to make all the purchases that were to be done at pune we reached delhi  the train was to halt there for three hours  the experience in travelling in a vestibule train with an attached pantry car the unknown destination and happiness or hardship that were to be part of the journey  both my cousin and myself are always used to sound sleep  in the night immaterial of the time place etcetera  when the dawn broke we were amidst what was known as the heart of india  we were travelling through the terrain of chambal valley  the numerous hillocks with tricky passages in between we believed were the most apt for hideout  admittedly many had discovered this fact much before us  the vast expanse of such similar pattern did indeed put up a scenery quite unforgettable  suddenly this gave a an instinct to my  cousin's mind why not plan the return journey  we were to reach delhi by eight p m and the train was to halt there for full three hours  if the journey through central india is so beautiful how would it be to return along the west coast  brilliant idea indeed and the railway time table was once again searched  before all this was completed we reached jhansi station  on the adjacent platform there was something really extraordinary  a beautiful blue and yellow colour train the engine shaped like an aeroplane   o yes it was indeed the two thousand one up  shatabdi express the fastest train in india  and as though to remind us all about the journey we had a glimpse of the derailed bogies of the unfortunate karnataka express little further  all this time the pantry car had kept us happy and satisfied  as if to prove the station master right when he writes below the time table in station trains are liable to gain or lose time  jhelum express screeched into the new delhi station only three and half hours late  off we were hunting for the reservation counter only to be enlightened by the vendor that the counter in the station closed by five thirty p m  all our hopes were dashed  we had expected a twenty-four hour booking counter at new delhi station  we were to do a lot of purchases and this was now hampered and transferred to jammu tavi  we had not opted for the pantry car dinner in anticipation of the food at new delhi  midnight vendor and some fruitwalas made our appetite full  the halt was cut down by an hour and a half  and by one in the morning we started advancing further north  the crowd in the train was gradually growing less in number  with large group detraining at various stops  the last of our companions got down at jallandhar leaving only two of us from the original pack  the pantry car too was disconnected at delhi and when we woke up in the morning my goodness what a sight it was with green lustrious inviting plains of punjab   far as far as the eyes could see spread over from one horizon to the other the vast stretch of land as though somebody had levelled it totally green thick with vegetation with a lot of streams running in between  oh what a place it was  as the arrival time at the jammu tavi station neared we were both anticipating to watch the foot hills of himalaya  after chhole parathe at pathankot the train did come to a halt on a platform which borne the name jammu tavi   but where were the hills ? sense dawned that they were to begin further north  trapped by a local commission agent we were about to reside in a lodge when yet another person showed us a bus standing right in front of us which was bound to shrinagar  it has the name board in urdu  thanking the second one heartedly we were in the bus and the final leg of the journey had begun  in sheer contrast to all that we had seen till now this part was unique the hills for which we had been longing for so long were right in front of us  and our bus began its quest towards shrinagar about two hundred and forty-eight kilometres drive roughly five hours by our calculation the bus began to turn right left right and i lost count at the number of turns  there was a range of mountains in front of us and slowly the bus began to scale its height and just as the last curve took us to the upper most point of it and there was yet another range of mountains taller than that  of the previous one  at the end of it again there was yet another range it was as if the himalayas were unfolding themselves layer by layer and you never knew what was beyond that curve  there was no let up and we kept on climbing the mountain that were seeming sky high now began appearing reasonable and as night approached we reached baltal  just as we were lamenting that we would be deprived of the sight of remaining journey in darkness the driver announced that the bus was to halt overnight at baltal and begin the quest early next morning  we were all the more overjoyed and slept in the hotel  the next morning as the mountains continued to show their great might and energy with roaring of streams in the valley getting louder around each curve and streams themselves becoming smaller in size the bus then was halted in a queue and a curious stroll gave us the glimpse of the one of the great engineering marvels of our nation the jawaharlal nehru tunnel the longest of its kind and appropriately it was insc it was inscribed   may your life be as long as this tunnel  photography was prohibited and the journey through this twenty-six kilometre long tunnel brought us out in front of another amazing array of mountains each of them trying to make the other appear smaller  the clouds were almost with us now and we did still keep climbing higher and higher  it was almost began to seem endless  i had in my school days seen ooty but by now we must have travelled the road to ooty say about ten times  almost every inch of these mountains had tall trees trying to out do the mountains in reaching the sky  following this was again a long stretch of plain road  impossible we had thought that there being such a long stretch of plain land after this climb but then it was the kashmir valley  admiring beautiful nature we never realised that our bus by now was standing in the compound of the tourist reception centre at shrinagar oh god what a journey it had been not a bit of this kind had ever occurred to us  no not even in the wildest of our dreams  from there we proceeded straight to the youth hostel camping grounds  thus if you look into the journey itself a lot of things do happen that teach us lessons in the philosophy practicability etcetera only it needs a willful learner 
festivals are rightly said to be the living history of a nation  they are inextricably linked with the culture religion  philosophy and literature of a people  and are thus connected with the innocent of man  india is a unique country in the sense that it has such a large number of festivals which have become living traditions of a unique nature  they carry rhythm the entire story of the growth of our culture  mostly in a condensed form  so much so that it has become almost impossible to single out an incident or factor associated with a particular indian festival  it's equally futile now to say that a particular caste or section of society is primarily responsible for a particular festival in the modern context   raksha bandhan is one of such unique festivals  of our country   it's a cultural festival of the aryan race  it is celebrated on the full moon day of shravan  and that is why it is also called shravani  a very old name of this festival is rishi tarpan  also  on this particular day brahmins used to put on new sacred threads or a one word  the rituals of yadnya were performed and the heads of ashramas tied sacred yellow thread around the wrists of the people while chanting vedic hymns  subsequently this thread itself came to be known as  raksha bandhan or rakhi  as said earlier quite a few stories are associated with this festival  one of them reminds us of the great daitya  king bali living long long before ram in the treta yug   bali took a vow of defeating indra and ruling over the entire universe including swarg lok  he went to his guru shukracharya bid to him his compliments and sought his blessings   daitya guru shukra gave his blessings to bali  with a holy tilak on his forehead and a sacred thread  or raksha sutra around his wrist this made bali strong and invincible on the battle field  he wiped out his enemies and became the supreme power in the universe  during the later feudal ages the kings and warriors used to obtain this sacred raksha sutra from their gurus  purohits or other brahmins before going out to the battle fields  gradually it became an annual ritual and then a public festival  even today a purohit can be heard chanting  yen badhwa bali raja danvendra mahabalaha ten twam manbadrami rakshe ma chal ma chal  which means i tie you with the sacred thread with which  daitya raj bali was tied by his guru  your protection may be sure and firm  well there goes another story that when the demons attacked indira's kingdom he prepared to fight them out  before he set out his queen shachi put the sacred  tilak on his forehead and the sacred thread the  raksha sutra or rakhi on his right wrist  which made indra unconquerable on the battle field  even during the rajput period history tells us wives used to send off their husbands to the battle fields in the same manner after tying the raksha sutra to their wrists  subsequently we do not know exactly when and how sisters started tying this sacred raksha bandhan around their brothers wrists  and the whole thing got converted into the modern festival of  raksha bandhan  despite these changes in the form of the ritual the importance of the sacred thread has stayed  this thread has always been reminding man whether a  gurus deciple or sisters brother or wives gallant husband or any other common man of his obligations  even people from outside indian context have been influenced by the holy feelings inspired by this sacred thread  when alexander came to india he perchanced saw an indian woman  offering a sacred thread to a river on this particular day  surprised when he asked her what she had done and when she told him the significance of this ritual he requested the woman to tie the  sutra to his wrist also  and she gladly did so  similarly the great mughal emperor humayun stood against the muslim ruler of gujarat in order to protect karmavati the queen of chittor who sent the raksha sutra or rakhi  to him and requested him to protect his sister  in fact this festival of raksha bandhan has been a unique indian tradition cutting across all the ages and all the sections of the indian society  any man feels proud of the holy thread his sister puts on his wrist and does everything within his power to protect her honour  in the present context the thread puts the burden of the sisters protection on the brother  in this way raksha bandhan has acquired a new social meaning and a new social purpose  but the tradition goes on and on restoring a gleam of fresh love and assurance in the eyes of brothers and sisters on this unique day  some time ago i saw in some friend's house i don't remember now in whose i am the master of this house and i have my wife's permission to say so  to my mind the statement is has acquired the value of a powerful platitude  all the honourable members of the fraternity of the henpecked  would probably assert that a married man can do anything he likes  if his wife doesn't mind it because freedom is compulsory for him he must enjoy this freedom when his mistress is favourably inclined after all the labours of love and household  after all as arnold banard declared long ago being a husband is a whole time job and as per the globally accepted labour laws  every worker is entitled to personal freedom and entertainment  of course without any detrement to his marital duties of all sorts what he says is also occasionally listened to and honoured by his wife who is very gifted that is young and beautiful  he has no cause to mourn if she sometime discards his proposals or even dictates  isn't she his better-half obviously therefore she often gets better of him and his arguments  thus what she hits becomes history and whatever she misses remains mystery  she frankly admits that there are two sides to every question  her own and the wrong side  precisely for this reason very often he proposes and she disposes  it is a matter of common knowledge that the greatest philosophers  poets administrators and rulers have seen the tyranny of their wives  plato and aristotle ruled the world in their own way but could seldom have their own way with their wives who believed that the road to success is sealed with women pushing their husbands along  isn't their belief upheld by history ? who made kalidas one of the greatest poets and playrights of the world ? who pushed tulsi to the world of immortality and undying fame  ? modern poets are not less obliged to their mistresses and wives for experiencing real pathos in life and then enriching their literary output with this ennobled sweet melancholy   fanny's no put into keats' throat a number of sweetest songs that tell of saddest thought  i pity dryden who couldn't realise how unjust he was when he suggested that he would be greatly relieved when the wife was gone  he suggested his epitaph for her grave   here lies my wife here let her lie now she is at rest and so am i  even today such a sick exclamation can sometime be heard somewhere  but that's just unfair  generals and great politicians are no exceptions to this general observation  one day when a grocer complained about mrs lincoln's burst of temper mr abraham lincoln the great american president laid a comforting hand on the grocer's shoulder and murmured  can you not stand for fifteen minutes what i have stood for fifteen years   well president lincoln knew the time heals all wounds  although he had to ignore another significant fact in order to keep his cool the time also wounds all heals  this would explain charles haddons pergent humble supplication  god save us all from wives who are angels in the street saints in the church and devils  at home  we must give them their due musn't we ? with sincere apologies to oscar wilde it can be said that the only way to get rid of a wife's callous rejection is to yield to it  all you need in this life in order to escape your wife's  summary rejection of your proposals is ignorance and confidence  you must drive out from your life all superstitions like science and medicines  as george bernard shaw would put it because a woman cannot put up with these unhealthy things  a woman is like an empire in a way  she makes quick decisions never reverses them and doesn't think you are safe when you are out  in these things as in most others a woman's wit is often better than a man's arm and fate with her is often at his wit's end  it must not be however concluded that i am a misogynist  far from it  although some left balanced male thinkers describe a balanced woman as one with a narrow waist and a broad mind  i do not subcribe to this view   it's true that in some parts of the world even today women do not enjoy as much lead of freedom as men do but women are not handicapped on account of this legal flaw  thanks to the generosity of nature they are blessed with so much of irresistible natural power that no discriminatory laws can harm them  however there seems to be some gross misunderstanding among some misguided husbands who recently formed an association in new delhi  to press for their deliverance from the tyrany of their wives  i don't understand this because wives in india hopefully  have not yet taken to husband battering  they do and probably justifiably so assert that an ideal wife would be any woman who has an ideal husband  this however raises a very feeble doubt in my mind that whoever it was who first called women the fair sex didn't know much about justice  i hope my wife isn't listening to me now  sometimes my doubting nature drives me to think that any fool can have and hang the wisest man in the world and so any wife can drive even the most sensible husband to desperation by just using a disasterous word no  i think it will do everybody good to analyse the situations  in which she disposes as soon as he proposes  the wife's genius is the first factor that makes her avert to her husband's initiative  do not therefore pity the unsuccessful lover of a women of genius save your sympathy for the man who marries her because not before long all is real and imaginary weaknesses and failures puts spread in the world like wild fire  in such cases the brilliant wife may not only dispose but go to the extent of disposing him off  nearly the same thing holds good about women who are uncommonly beautiful  such a beautiful wife may not only come forward to edit her  poet husband's poem but may even venture to edit him personally an ugly duckling might not display such a fiendish talent and other invitation to a possible catastrophe may result from marrying a woman with relation of whom she would always boast  there may be extremely successful people in society because of their wealth power or excellences in some art  the wife would tend to pity her husband and pity herself  secretly but whenever an opportunity is is there she would spontaneously reprimand her husband directly or indirectly for being an inferior soul or lesser mortal  finally the husband's indiscreet and total submission to his better half usually corrupts and converts her into his bitter half  the husband must realise that his wife is a shadow who will turn and run ahead of him never to be caught  if he runs after her but who will follow him tirelessly if he even pretend to move away from her  anyway do not grieve friends if she still disposes as you are on the surest way to greatness  behind every man with pull is a woman with a push but quite naturally he proposes and she disposes 
conversation with dr uma chakravarty we have have  been trying to understand how history shaped by the selective interpretation of past events  this particularly has affected the representation of women in history in part one of the series dr chakravarty discussed the inherent biases in historical sources looking particularly at women in the vedic and buddhist periods  in the second part we went on to look at women in mythology and the epics  in the third we discussed the bhakti tradition and the medieval period  today in our concluding session we would look at the representation of women at the turn of the century and soon after  now uh coming to the nineteenth century and the socio-religious reform movements that we see at that time uh would you like to comment on the context in which suddenly we so called woman question acquires prominence suddenly woman question is foregrounded what is the context in which this happen ? well actually this is uh this is the question and this is an area which is com tied up completely with our uh the the rewriting of history  uh the enterprise of uh writing history  uh what you get in the nineteenth century is a uh a rather dramatic confrontation between two different cultures  uh with what appears to be a visible difference in way  in which the colonial power uh structured its gender relations and the way in which the uh the colonised power uh had structured its gender relations and this is not a confrontation which is on an equilitarian basis but on clearly on an unequal basis  so what you get is uh the british as the conquerors uh  with their understanding of both of their own culture as well as of the culture that they are now uh exposed to  and the uh indians who were reacting to uh a certain kind of construction of their culture being uh made by the colonial power  now what is interesting is that the colonial power tends to look at this in two ways  one is to discuss what they consider to be a uhm you know the  the positive values of this the culture that they had come into confrontation with and a certain kind of uh uh recognition that this was uh an ancient culture with various defined rules and so on  and this more or less uhm coincided with the orientalist enterprise that is the orientalists who you know uhm translated the sanskrit text who uh who collected works who uh uhm you know discovered new works and so on and so there was a certain understanding about the past which began to be constructed but it was done clearly from the point of view of the uh of the british who needed to know these uh all these in terms of being better administrators  simultaneously there was a fairly strong and noticeable reaction by the british uh which ended up in in in a sense condemning the culture that they had uhm uh come into uh contact with and this is done partly because uh it also would indicate the moral superiority of the conquerors and the and the legitimacy of their enterprise but at the same time it also ended up in uh making sweeping condemnations of the entire culture now what happened during this period is to begin to identify the status of women with the civilisation as uh it it became the  uh index of a civilisation  so the status of women uh would then decide whether the civilisation was ha something that was valuable or not  and this is what happened during the nineteenth century now it also tied in with the the understanding of a how one needed to reform the structure of relation  uh what practice is needed to be uh stamped out or uh what kind of changes needed to be introduced  and uh here again there were two different ways in which you can look at it  there was there was the british uh view point  there was also uh development from within the uh indians which was also similarly interested in certain degree of reform  there was for example a woman like pandita ramabai who was writing  uh a little later uhm little later but early on for instance in the early uhm nineteenth century you have some uh  say the whole discussion of sati and the need to legislate on sati bringing forth the kind of literature that rajaram mohan roy and his adversaries generated on the women's  question and here here the women's question became central  because uh you and and the use of the text also became central because it was important to try and establish that several traditions were authentic certain were certain traditions had been interpolated so the reformers used the shastras to indicate that uh certain practices were not there in the ancient hoary past this is the period in which the beginnings of the vedic the construction of the vedic uh period as a golden age for women actually  began uhm uh because it was important to try and say that at some point in the hoary past uh the status of women had been high that certain aberrations developed and that these needed to be stamped out  uh at the same time the adversaries also used the shastras  to state that the uh the practices were actually indigenous they were an inherent part of indian tradition all this resulted in a tremendous historical consciousness being uh  generated or about the past in in which a lot of people were   into uh involved uhm and  la later the nationalist came into the fray and they needed again to reconstruct the past along the lines that they wanted and they did this with a particular point from a particular point of view because they restructured gender relations but they also   restructure restructured the images of men and women means they created a uh uh a kind of a new man who  was vigorous who was uh dynamic who was not at all a an effete person  which is how the britisher cast indians  uh uh effete emasculated kind of person but someone who was  uhm was strong who've who's marshall who was who was capable of uh the highest courage  and the vedic period died after that because the aryan uh was a militant marshall uh person  simultaneously they did this the same thing for women so women got developed in two ways  uh one was to look at women from the point of view of the uh uh  practices that they had be been familiar with so gargi for instance and the episode of gargi becomes very very important at this time one to say that women had should have access to learning now  and there was a debate raging on whether women should study or not  in bengal  at the same time uh it did indicate the status in their minds of women in the past  and so one would get for instance a certain half baked half information for instance gargi the gargi narrative was always used to say that gargi was learned she could debate yagnavalka but they didn't complete the story and they wouldn't tell you that uh the debate had been on uhm  unfair grounds and had been terminated on unfair grounds that when uh gargi uhm fixed uhm yagnavalka with two subtle questions which he would not be able to handle and which he was not able to handle he simply said uhm shut up woman otherwise your head will fall off  and uh he ended the debate on that note now the nationalist obviously could not bring the later part  because this would be a reflection on their ancient past  but in any case this kind of enterprise went on simultaneously they also highlighted uh a certain  kshtriya values for women  and so they created new kind of men and a new kind of  wo womam  now ramabai uh interestingly didn't quite fit in with this whole reconstruction of the past  uh ramabai's was unusual because she was one of the few women who knew sanskrit had been taught sanskrit by her father uh in fact by her mother  uh who then studied the the text and who obviously was not satisfied with the kind of answer that she found in her text  so that ramabai became a little bit of an embarassment to  the uhm to atleast one section of the nationalist not to all of them now ramabai is is extremely important from our point of view because if you if we were to say who's who's one uh  one of the first uh women to be perceptive about the uh status of women  uh one of the first investigator as it were into the past as well as into the present would be ramabai she travelled extensively but uh during one word  she was exposed to a number of practices and uh she uh evokes this in the text that she wrote which is called the high caste hindu widow   now here she talks about the low status of women  and she is really interesting because she turns the arguments of this both the uhm english and the nationalist in a sense a section of the nationalist uh wrong  now whereas people had judged the uh index of civilisation  by the low status of women and this is what the british had done  uh simultaneously someone like dayananda had turned it around and he talked about the status of women being high in the vedic period and therefore this in civilisation being uh fine ramabai actually talks about psychological fear and she says that the reason why we are a subject nation is because if women are subject how can they produce sons who are not psychologically uh cowards  and so she turns the argument fully around now hers is a really fascinating enterprise uh she uh was both reformist as well as knowledgable  and uh her handling of the women's question has a kind of sharpness and it it extraordinarily moving i mean uh for instance  uhm there is this marvellous passage that she had on the uh  completely unequal uh relations between men and women so she talks about the situation which pertains to a widow and the situation which obtains to a widower and she uses manu she says let her emi emaciate  her body by living on pure flowers roots and fruits but she must never ever mentioned the name of another man after her husband has died  until death let her be patient of hardships self-control and chaste  then she goes on and she says the rules for the widower  a twice born man versed in the sacred law shall burn a wife of the equal caste  and having at the funeral given sacred fires to his wife who dies before him he may marry again and again kindle the one word  fires  and the way she juxtoposes the two you know indicates the directness with which she is confronting the problem here are a set of rules for men here are the certain  certain set of rules for women and the uh double standard of morality something that she exposes marvelously she does this as far as uh infanticide uh she in a sense she is one of the first recorders of statistics because she talks about female infanticide and so on so her experience is actually uh quite unique and is something that historians all historians uh should this you know should open themselves upto but certainly she is very important for rewriting history to include women  uh in in an early conversation with you you had mentioned that dayanand saraswati has some very interesting things to say about women as mothers yeah would you like to talk about that ?  yeah  yes sure uh well you know uhm dayanand goes back to the vedas for uh for uhm a lot of the uh kind of practices that he would now write like to bring back  so he he gives to women a very central role in uh creating a new race of heroes  now in doing this he is able to simultaneously deal with the uh women as wife but also deal with the widow who is a  is a problem in nineteenth century and who is an embarassment to many of the reformers he uh brings back and he talks about the practice of  niyoga which is very interesting because niyoga  uh in the vedic time had been the possibilities of uh uh rearing a son for the dead husband uh by appointing somebody else in his place  now this is a practice and uh lot has been made of  niyoga as a positive right that women had but uh uh in the vedic period let's not make any uhm  let's not confuse the issue uh it remains a prerogative uh  which is available to the kinsmen of the household to ensure that reproduction uh is uh continues  it's it's the right to remarry or to co-habit but  under rules which uh which previleged men and the cultural norms that they would like to perpetuate now dayanand uses this  and he suggests that uh that uh widows can use  niyoga to have a series of son so he does that on the one the hand  but he also because of concern is very strongly for a a new race for a race of people who are strong and rigorous  he uses the biological power of women uh and regulates  for it  now for instance he suggests that women uh must not uh  actually feed their own children because these should be handed to a wetnurse because a woman should return to uh uhm as quickly as possible to a situation where she can conceive at the time when she is  best equipped for it which is between the years of sixteen and say thirty or whatever or whatever which will which is the best time from the point of view of reproduction so he uhm he uses both traditional knowledge as well as medical knowledge to uh propose a set of rules which does at one level apparently raised the status of women but which in in a sense actually it is seeing women as stock breeders 
co-operation today is an economic system as a peaceful reaction against capitalistic economy which has resulted in the concentration of wealth mass poverty and decay of men  indian co-operative movement is probably the strongest  and the oldest movement among developing countries  the co-operative movement has been in existance for more than eighty-five years and would be hundred years old soon  the movement was introduced with high hope and big expectation providing a solution to india's rural problem  all the committees from the times of mr nicolson to this day  have constantly emphasised that the co-operative sector is a fundamental solution to the ills of the rural economy in general and agricultural economy in particular  in the first few decades the movement was not a significant movement but after independence due to government's  encouragement and the reserve bank's participation the movement began to spread  since nineteen forty-seven the number of societies have increased from one point eight lakhs to about three point fifteen lakhs  and the total membership has also gone up from one point thirty-seven crore to fifteen crore  the co-operative sector has provided loan to the extent of eight thousand crore during eighty-nine ninety as against rupees six thousand crore  provided by the commercial banks  the development of consumer store and industrial co-operatives has also been significant  thus the co-operative sector in india made a tremendous progress in various directions and has reached a stage when it can be said as an important factor in economic social and political development of india and has now become progressive and diversified national level statutory organizations like nabard l t d c n d d have been set up to promote new co-operatives in india in nineteen eighty-seven eighty-eight the co-operatives attended further heights  agricultural credit disbursed was around rupees  three thousand five hundred crore and the value of the credit marketed was around rupees five thousand  crore  the co-operatives distributed forty lakh  tonnes of fertilizers amounting three thousand five hundred  crore rupees and the co-operative sugar factories produced  fifty lakh tonnes of sugar in nineteen eighty-seven eighty-eight accounting sixty percent national production of sugar  dairy development and processing co-operatives also show  similar progress  the experience of number of successful co-operative organizations like amul in gujarat marksade in punjab  cooptex in tamil nadu apco in andhra sugar in maharashtra  demonstrate that co-operative sector has needful energy to forge ahead  there is thus vast scope for development of organized marketing processing and export activities in the field of vegetables flowers horticultural products forest produce and such other things  consumer store if managed honestly and efficiently can provide services to millions  important achievement during the seventh plan was a process of reorganization of primary society to viable unit  this process was complete in all the states except maharashtra gujarat and jammu kashmir  another milestone was the establishment of nabard in july nineteen eighty-two as an apex institution to handle all matters relating to planning policy and operation in the field of agriculture  the seventh plan also laid down great emphasis on development of professional manpower also  all these efforts brought economic social political  and educational benefits to the members of these societies  the economic benefits include providing of cheap credit  rescuing of rural farmer from the clutches of money-lenders  better use of credit better prices to farmer product and better marketing facilities to industrial worker  on social side idle men became industrial  the spendthrift the thrifty the illiterate learnt reading  and some drunkard person reform their ways  in short co-operatives have become a tool of self  aggrendisement  thus the co-operatives made great strides and influence  all spheres  however there seem to have crept in several distortions  on account of various reasons  actually the movement was introduced to uplift the downtrodden  and the small farmer  but in this respect we find that the movement has certainly failed in achieving these objectives   the rural credit survey committee has rightly observed that the slice of the co-operative finance was eaten by the big cultivator  thirteen percent of the total household got sixty percent share of the loan while fifty-three percent household got eleven percent only  mr c subramaniam governor of maharashtra has rightly said  that the co-operatives have unfortunately not catered to the needs of the weaker classes  on the contrary the leaders and the vested interests  had plagued the co-operative sector thereby the committed honest workers are ousted and driven out  for the poor performance the number of causes are responsible  among them lassez faire policy illiteracy  very small sized societies undue reliance on honorary services  inefficiency in management and partial coverage of the life of the individual  extrinsic factors include widespread indebtedness  lack of business experience uneconomic holding price fluctuation  dearth of regulated market old methods of cultivation  presently the co-operative banking sector faces the problems like overdue shortage of resources indifferent management and the lack of efforts to mobilize deposits untrained staff and weak arrangement for linking credit with marketing  in india twenty-five percent of the societies or say  thirty-four thousand societies are defunct and dormant today  this shows that the co-operative movement in india is not uniformly developed   there's marked regional disparity and unevenness  in the growth  in maharashtra punjab tamil nadu more than seventy percent rural population has come within the fold while in bihar  west bengal assam and orissa the coverage is below twenty percent  in andhra the development is restricted to to telangana  or railseema  one of the most disquietning feature in co-operative sector is  incidence of increasing overdues  in maharashtra alone overdues amount to rupees  two thousand four hundred crore in nineteen eighty-seven  in the past there were selfless and zealous workers who devoted their whole life as a mission  but today there is lack of dedicated leadership and lack of trained personnel also  the development is also hampered due to lack of inconsistant policy and rigid approach of the government  the formation of large sized society was rejected by the government without giving it a trial or a serious consideration  the defective loan policy also stood in a way of severe growth of the movement  in most cases the members of the society do not understand  exact aims and objectives of the co-operatives  the members therefore have become the clients of convenience  this has laid to all kinds of undesirable things in the management of the society  viewed in totality our co-operative sector is not that impressive and overall image is that one of the major reasons for this is that all initiative comes from the government agencies  and not from the people  it thus has lost its basic character  even today the movement is known as sarkari  movement and not the sahakari  there are several apex institutions which have no firm rule  and have a superstructure without infrastructure  there is also lack of inter-co-operative relationship both vertically and horizontally  the sector therefore cannot show its unified strength in the economy  there is absence of sectoral planning in co-operative sector  federal units like n c d c nabard nafed do not pay  sufficient attention to the constituent units   national co-operative policy resolution of nineteen seventy-seven relating to integreted approach has not yet been implemented  absence of such a policy has major limitation which has created  several problems in working of the co-operative sector  there is thus an immediate need for a clear government policy  for the co-operatives  now it is also quite necessary to incorporate role of co-operatives in indian constitution so that a clear prosperous future past could be defined  for the success of co-operatives three elements are necessary  a dedicated leadership professionally competent management  and enlighten membership  after all the co-operatives are owned by members and therefore members should know what they really expect from the co-operatives  awareness among the members is very poor  there is lack of free membership training and education also  leaders also have no clarity about their role  as the members of the co-operatives or resource poor in india government provide finance but with some directives  under such circumstances how to restore member confidence  is the highest challenge facing us  and as a first step in this regards the government will have to loosen its excessive control over the co-operatives  recently the issue of activization of democratic process  coupled with promotion and professionalization of management was discussed in registrar's meeting on twenty-sixth august nineteen eighty-five  and according to recommendations ardhanarishvaran committee was set up in march nineteen eighty-six  the committee in its recent report advised to restrain the tendency to abuse democratic rights in the co-operatives  exclusive of one or two recommendations all other recommendations unless adopted expeditously the movement cannot go further  india is thus facing a number of challenges and in changing situations the role of co-operatives depend on how swiftly co-operatives adopt and reorient to these challenges  fortunately in seventh plan adequate credit was made available to weaker section and less developed areas  in maharashtra from the initial role of disbursement of credit in rural areas the co-operatives have diversified into several subsectors  co-operatives now provide a full range of services to village level farmer in all respect  so all these are good changes yet hereafter the poor sections could be helped in income-generating  activities literacy programme village sanitation drinking water programme vocational training programme and community development activities  hereafter these new co-operatives are to be organized for weaker sections  the members should be provided training in general management along with leadership development programmes  in short co-operatives should do something for the community and then only people will begin to identify as their own co-operatives  
this is all india radio bombay  it is nine thirty  we shall now hear a talk entitled random thoughts  by dr usha thakkar  questions before us are baffling and issues around us are overwhelming  when i start thinking about them i get taken over by their variety and volume  and these different strands are woven together and the emerging picture becomes clear and grim  and i start wondering what is happening to us as individual  as society as a nation  crisis seems to have penetrated everywhere  is it political economic cultural or the crisis of life itself ? we see many young children begging on streets and working in dangerous conditions  we hear many incidents about young women being burnt for dowry  innocent persons getting imprisoned in the trap of bonded labour  and the youth going astray due to lack of direction  we read about many massacres in cities and villages  we know many persons who exchange their ethics and ideals for money  we are aware of many cases of bribery and forgery  our attention is often drawn to scandal in educational institutions the citadels of learning  and nothing happens to us  have we lost our sensitivity the very core of human life ? we preach morality to children and we talk of values to all  but we do not hesitate in compromising when it comes to personal gain  we see nothing wrong in seeking personal favours for gratification  is this in accordance with what we say ? and what impact is it going to have on the young generation who get bewildered and confused by this discrepancy between action and preaching  corruption seems to have penetrated in all spheres of life  and worse then that it seems that we have accepted that it has come to stay  work culture gets adversely affected by this  demands for rights are put forward without due consideration to duties  previleges are sought without fulfilling obligations  consumerism and hedonism dominate our time  pursuit of comfort mixes get oblivious of the means adopted for the same  the importance of money is accepted unchallenged  everything starts getting measured in terms of money and then  values are turned in prices  people get to use henry millers' expression   protected by money learnt by money dulled by money  new inventions advance in technology and wonders of computers have certainly opened new vistas for human beings  but we'll not go in ahead without values and ideals  pushes into an age of despair and destruction  emerson had said that the true test of civilization is  not the census not the size of cities nor the crops  no but the kind of man the country turns out  unfortunately today we see men surrendering their ideals to expediency and yielding their sensitivity to the pressure of power  respect for human value and constraints on human greed  and lust were never more important than they are today  gandhi had pointed out that hankering after riches forces one to exploitation in some form or other  the modern civilization with its emphasis on materialism  and its basis of exploitation of the weak is equivalent to darkness and disease  true civilization consists not in accumulation of commodity  but in a deliberate and voluntary reduction of one  politics bereft of religion is a death trap because it kills the soul  unfortunately today we are at such junction in history where the line between good and evil often gets blurred and consequently the distinction between heroes and villains also often gets blurred  the practice of putting profits before prudence and the instinct of putting i before we  have eroded the foundation of human values  if humanity itself is lost would a human being be a human  or a mere robot ? in that case what about future ? one undoubtedly is in agreement which the russian poet andrei muroyiv when he said that i am not interested in the twenty-first century if it will be only robots  it can happen but it will be death  we will be alive but dead  we start enumerating the advantages and gains profits and pay-offs and neglect human values and human emotions  we ignore the highways and start getting lost in lanes and by-lanes where paths become narrower and narrower  as a nation we are going through rough times  nationalism often becomes synonym with factitious  politics and this gives boost to destabilizing and destructive forces ugly forces of communalism fundamentalism regionalism  and terrorism rock the tranquility of the country  instances of communal riots and political violence provide material for headlines to media  events and happening in the field of politics indicate clearly that politics is the game of power  the game of ruthless strategies the game of selfish interest  where moral norms and high ideals are pushed aside and where credibility and accountability become meaningless words  problem of poverty has assumed grave dimension due to illiteracy basic needs of food shelter and clothing of the people have yet to be fulfilled  rising prices inflation and unemployment bring unprecedented pressures on the common man  today problems are many and solutions are not simple  we have to accept the fact that ours is a plural society  where diversity in religion caste community and language is overwhelming  this plurality cannot be hidden under the clock of concensus  nor can they be blinded branded as confrontation  aspirations and grievances of various ethnic religious  linguistic and minority groups demand special attention to cultural ethos and recognition to diversity  as the noise over masjid-mandir  employment and social justice ethnic diversity and minority rights is getting louder law and order situation is worsening  the weak and the underprevileged sections of the society still suffer from discrimination  here i would like to focus on the status of women  even now after so many years of independence women suffer problems of inequality and discrimination dependant and domination some individual women have achieved stupendous success in some fields such as education and politics  the constitution has granted equality and some progressive laws are enacted  but the majority of women are lost in the darkness of ignorance  the literacy rate among women is only thirty-nine point forty-two percent  the fact to remind that india is a nation where people belonging to different religions live and practice their own way of life  the constitution did not establish a common civil code and the personal laws of different communities remain operative  it is unfortunate that in a democratic and secular state like ours all the women are not on equal footing  women of different religions and communities suffer under oppressive personal laws  traditional norms of behaviour and inequality have taken deep roots in our social system  revival of religious fundamentalism intensifies the threat to  women's equality  it is sad to note that social evils like dedication of girls to temple polygamy and seclusion of women  have thrived in the name of religion  there are some laws which provide protection to women but the cunning and conniving do not take long to find the loop holes  moreover the process is long painful and expensive  the question remains how many women would muster courage and resources to fight discrimination ? bigamy is still not extinct  the provision regarding the age of marriage gets frequently violated   women's access to rights of property  maintenance inheritance divorce alimony and custody of children  get limited  many laws lose their meaning in the absence of proper implementation  though it is one of the duties of an indian citizen to renounce all practices derogatory to the dignity of women women are often subjected to atrocity like grave or physical assault  trade in human flesh is still prevalent  rape victims suffer from tremendous trauma and damage to their personality  crimes against women continue to rise  there were more than six thousand reported victims of rape in nineteen eighty-seven and more than fifteen hundred dowry deaths  including burning  the declining sex ratio is an issue causing grave concern  the nineteen ninetey-one census shows only nine hundred and twenty-nine women against thousand man  this is an issue not just of number but a pointer at our social reality  neglect at every stage is the fate of the women  survival itself becomes difficult as is evident from the misuse of the sex determination test  age specific death rate indicate higher rates for female children and women upto thirty-five years of age  the discrimination against the women in economic arena still exist the provisions of labour laws and equal pay for equal work do not reach all women and provisions are not properly implemented  almost ninety percent of women workers are engaged in unorganized sector  studies clearly show that modernisation and mechanisation tend to marginalise women in many sectors  the fact remains that there cannot be division of women into groups of working women and non-working women  women work but their work goes unnoticed  invisible hands of women are always at work but the data system with respect to women's work is imperfect  estimates of the average hours of unpaid work done by women  outside their homes vary from six to seven hours per day with some women working upto ten hours or more  apart from the domestic duty women are engaged in agricultural operation for an average of twelve hours a day  they have to keep themselves and their families alive  in rural areas thirty to thirty-five percent of household  are headed by women still there access to ownership of land and property is negligible  women find it extremely difficult to enter the male dominated field of politics  the crucial fact is that women find themselves being judged  and often judging themselves by two different standards  one standard is of traditional role of the private world which regards her as homebound nurturing submissive and emotional  the other standard is of her changed role in the public world  which expects her to be ambitious rational progressive and competetive  this private public divide bring severe pressures on her  other deterrants in her way are approach of political parties  prohibitive election expenses demands of home and family and fear of character assassination  still we have a long way to go  democratic notions of equality and liberty have to percolate in her day-to-day life  journey of democracy is never static or uneventful  today realities are hard and challenges are tough but we the people of india have to give a positive response 
professor jahagirdar sound of bell has been extremely kind to me i can thank him without deserving  for my work  my friend ashok has given me the right treatment  uh before you start your day's work in the morning  you have to catch your oxen and then you must put the  ropes through their nose and then get on with the day's  jobs  which he has done for me cough  the other reason why i feel i do not deserve to be standing here and giving a public lecture is quite obvious clearing his throat  as you can see the lecture is not meant for people like me  uhm i can't keep my papers on and then read uh is meant for people who are normal clearing his throat  i am somewhat different from normal but i'll  do what i think needs to be done because the subject on which i wish to speak has become if not here in many other places in the country and awfully important question  as you have come here uh uh forsaking your lunch hour i will not take more time to uh tell you how i do not deserve to be here but get on with it now that i am here  dear panel students  by way of introduction to my talk today i must explain two  ground facts  one which is pervasive throughout non-metropolitant india the other which is threatening to change the foundation of english teaching or rather to do kar seva with it that is to say to destroy it completely in itself may not be a bad thing at all i don't mind if english is destroyed the worst thing that will happen is i'll lose my job  i think i can find another one somewhere  the first uh let me say that my talk does not concerned university level study alone but also the basic levels of english teaching  and learning at the high school junior college and college level  as well  now what are these two threats that i spoke of  the first one comes from the non- teaching of the english school and college teachers generally and even some university teachers actually do not teach english  what is that they do can be given other names  but instead the students don't learn english  i shall mention only one perhaps the central reason that they do not know english  anyhow the result is that they begin to justify and rationalize their failure by arguing that we really do not know english  english that it is a hang over from the colonial british raj that we must really attend to our regional language or mother tongue  now these are destruction tactics because those who wish to honour their mother tongue have always learnt it under any circumstances  more of that a little later  the second threat more recent powerful because its exponents have generally have the advantage of english medium urban education  and also because their arguments come from abroad in very sophisticated and precise words  these people argue as though we have not have any tilak  chiplunkar phule or karmveer that to study english is to continue english or british colonization  that if we study english because of any reason whatever we become post-colonially colonized  and besides they also speak in the same way of the means to engage in culture studies but deny the simple and obvious fact  that the greatest single repository of culture is its literature therefore they argue that we should not study english literature  but only indo- english literature  that we should not study english literature but local and world literature  they attempt to convert english departments into cultural  study's department or departments of world literature  is there anything seriously wrong with these two threats ? can we do both english studies and indian studies if we wish to ? history tells us most emphatically yes  there are persons in my own audience here today who have done this  therefore on the excuse of looking at one such teacher on english ayyappa panikar from kerala who has both studied and taught english well and worked effectively in his own mother tongue  i propose to examine the basic problems involved in being uncertain regarding whether to study and teach english or not  that is why my title to be uh to english or not to english the lesson of ayyappa panikar  english in india it appears is in a crisis  it appears to be insecure to observers of the linguistic  political arena as also to those in the academic arena which  some academia is also another linguistic political arena as though  we did not always know it  at least one state in india uttar pradesh seems openly at war with english  an international congress of marathi recently made a great deal of noise about the continuing hegemony of english in maharashtra without any hesitation however it needs to be said that either there is no real crisis but that one is being conjured up for ideological game by ideologues  or that it is essentially the same old pre-independence crisis  which is hoped to have stoped with independence  more than four whole decades have past since the crucial achievement i mean independance of an essentially older generation  to be found still harping on the same crisis in the belief that it still exists unchanged or in the hope that from keeping it alive will approve linguistic political or academic and political merit seems backward looking if not one word  and at least for that reason unjustified and unjustifiable for a nation that hopes to march through centuries of backlog of development not my word in the space of a very few five years plans mixed up in this crisis scenerio is a conscience crisis or what is at least made to look like it  some in english teaching establishments are saying why should they be teaching english literature why not our own for instance why should be the departments be called departments of english and not departments of literature  there are also those who would like to keep reminding us that english in india today is a matter of post-colonial colonization  regarding the first sort of question we may answer first  that if other literatures need to be stu  taught or study they can be taught without teaching them in the english department  to wish to teach other literatures in english department and i mean other language literatures marathi hindi telugu malyalam imply some great confusion regarding the function of english in india  second there seems to be no reason to deny that india does not need so many departments of english literature  third there is nothing sound of bell  third there is nothing more colonial in teaching english  british american commonwealth included in a department of english than in teaching hindi literature in a department of hindi  or organic chemistry in a department of organic chemistry  as for the more fundamental question why english at all  ? if anyone feels deeply that their career in english language or literature teaching is either empty patriotic or a super- colonial betrayal they can atleast by way of that career to  take up some less renegade or more self-respectful career  this is not to dismiss struggling consciences but to place them on par with other such  to take just one parallel instance  those who feel that western medicine is a betrayal of  ayurveda in the same way such allopath should give up western medicine and trained train in  ayurveda or another career  i would like to leave such cases behind right at the outset by saying that unskilled assessment will help avoid  schizophrenia  further is to english or not to english  that seems to be the question  for anything between means waste through confusion  let us take another look at this crisis or dilemma even though we settle the question once and the reasons for doing so have not changed since then  what is this crisis politically ? how long shall we if we shall let this english language continue as the major link language of the country ? when will hindi take over ? no one seems to be in right mood to ask why should  hindi take over or what if hindi takes over as a link language of our national life ? what shall we do about our international life ? which whether we like it or not does endanger those subtle and growth way on our national life  what is the crisis ideologically are we ?  apparently it's a rhetorical question to being or to  to be or to to continue to be colonized by the language or rather earlier colonial rulers  but that reaction is a feeling known  and indeed to such a question that should be our answer  but ideological arguments in this connection come in english  mostly addressd to english users  and what is complicating if not worst they seem to come in english via europe and america  at least for me after such knowledge what forgiveness in any case this agrument also seems just like the political argument to fail to address the very practical problem before us or before the nation if not english then what ? for the english teaching establishments the apparently active english departments in the university but by implication of the passive departments in colleges and schools what is the crisis ? in simple terms people are asking again and again and again ought we to be teaching studying engish   i've already tried to indicate my answer to that  if our aim is taken for granted when then this amongsts to among other things distraction confusion waste of time and effort and eventually a most horandous shortfall in our achievement of the goals we have set for ourselves in this regard  should we not ask such a fundamental question ? obviously we may and we shall  but whether we ignore its practical implications is the issue for me  and assuming that our nation has affirmatively answer the question already i would like to emphasis that we ought not to allow confusion or distraction to affect adversly our performance of the task now as a democracy let us have admited right away we might well claim the right to reopen the issue  take away the assumption create the condition that our previous decision need not be considered our fate accompli   but as long as we do not do so with full awareness of consequences we have better not do anything that will foster or enhance the downward trend in achievement of the task  not as a negative implication  what must we do if we do decide not to teach or learn english any more ? well we must then decide what we shall do  i see only three alternatives  alternative one shall we teach the rest of the world an indian language  even say if you like hindi  so that we may converse with them or in all ways that international and therefore national life demands  alternative two shall we try to live our national international life without english and without any replacement for it   and three or shall we choose an alternative language  another international language like german russian french or japanese  or another of our very own choice in which to conduct our international business  if we choose the first alternative fine  let us girdle our loins for the task of the next couple of hundred years or so in which we must become internationally so important that outsiders wish to learn hindi  then arrrange a one word like programme all over the world or a hindi council to rival the british council  find in other words the ways and means to install hindi as our international language which we can then continue to use  lessons of the last four decades or so right here in india  ought to teach us what the real response to this questions should be  if we choose the second alternative not to bother with any international language we shall either create an indian culture and nation precisely given the cultural linguistic diversity in india  it may not be quite so bad  we have a very rich culture or we shall be subject to so obviously to all sorts of threats of new colonization from many many sources  have had  that is to say even if we could imagine situation of international linguistic vacuum for india how long we may be able to sustain our integrity and even our sovereignity ? in a fiercly international world this is not in a moot query  the answer is too depressing to contemplate especially i hope it is depressing to those who feel the wealth of previous colonization feeling even today  suppose we take the third alternative to switch to another language than english  a language not tainted by colonial oppressive past for us by the way is there a major language anywhere that is not tainted by a colonial oppressive past ? this question is just as revealing in the past tense and apply to languages like sanskrit or telugu or marathi  what will that decision entail ? dismantling all our international and also related national business and activity that depends on english today  dismantling our machinery for proliferation of english  preparing for and installing in its place the entire machinery required  in the process of teaching and learning that new international language

in bombay  i had my own race horses and pandu khade was my jockey  applause  so kolhapur has this association to hang  now may i extend before i go further my congratulations my hearty congratulations and best wishes to those students who are graduating out today from the halls of these great university  i have no doubt that the training they have received and the traditions they have imbibed in this university will serve them well in facing the challenges of life hereafter  friends i believe that the future belongs to the young the future of india is in the youth of india  i have great faith in the youth of india  youth which has ideals which has vision and which is not being corrupted by the curse of consumerism or the malady of materialism  preservation of democracy and democratic values and protection and promotion of human rights are matters with which everyone of us not merely lawyers and judges and journalists everyone of us is or should be concerned  it is the legitimate pride of every indian and i feel that pride when i go abroad and an uh attend international conferences  and conventions that despite the trials turmoils and tribulations  which our nation has undergone democracy the rule of law  and respect for human rights by and large are preserved and respected in our country  and i think that is something about which every indian should feel proud of  the topic of my address is the role of lawyers and the judiciary in upholding the constitution democracy and human rights  now the problems the perennial problem of orderly government were perceptively discerned about two centuries ago by madison  who was one of the founding fathers of the american constitution  he stated in the federalist and i quote in framing a government which is to be administered by men over men  the great difficulty lies in this you must first enable the government to control the governed and in the next place oblige the government to control itself  over the years experiences demonstrated that governments are not obliging and do not control themselves  the great difficulty mentioned by madison confronts our country in a large measure as we try to ensure fundamental freedoms and elementary decencies to all persons whilst respecting the rule of law and the independence of the judiciary  despite the law's horrendous delays and a multitude of deficiencies which plague the indian legal system it is curious  but also heartening that the public still retains confidence in the judiciary  it is to the judiciary that the citizens turn for protection from legislative excesses and executive abuses and for vindication of his or her rights against the state  an independant judiciary is one of the pillars of our constitutional edifice and is indispensible to a democracy  it is a constitutional and a moral imperative for the protection of human rights of the citizens for maintenance of the rule of law and for preservation of democratic values  and the essence of independence of judges is there is adjudication of disputes between citizens and between citizens and the state and the state is the biggest litigant today judges must act impartially and be free from pressure or influence of any kind  emanating from any source  what kind of persons did our founding fathers visualised for the high judicial office? pandit nehru spoke for all of them when he said and i quote  judges should be not only first rate but should be acknowledged to be first rate in the country and of the highest integrity  and if necessary people who can stand up against the executive government and whoever may come in their way  now in order to ensure the independence of the higher judiciary  our constitution provides for security of tenure namely sixty-two years in the case of high court judge and sixty-five years in the case of a supreme court judge  frankly i have not been able to understand this sixty-two and sixty-five  i don't think there is anything in the high court wherby at sixty-two the judge become one word and at sixty-five the supreme court judges still go on but that's another thing  judges as you know cannot be removed at the pleasure of the executive but only by a procedure provided in the constitution which is popularly known or called the process of impeachment  remuneration of the judges is guaranteed by the constitution cannot be altered by the government of the day except by constitutional amendment  so these are the main bulwarks to insulate judges from executive pressure and to relieve them from being dependent on the government  but executive influences operate in a variety of subtle ways for example the prospect of appointment after retirement to some statutory body or council or commission and sometimes the prospect of the office of the governor  it is my view that the supreme court and high court judges after retirement should not be given any assignment nor appointed to any body or tribunal which is subordinate to the high court or the supreme court  it is an unseemly sight to witness legal challenges to the orders of former supreme court judges in the high court or in the supreme court  the proper course is to give full pension to judges on retirement  and to avail of their services today they don't even get full pension they get only half pension  and to avail of their services in national interest for example heading a commission of enquiry in a matter of vital national importance as and when the occasion arises  it is also my view that the present retirement age of the high court and supreme court judges needs to be increased so that the experience and abilities of the serving judges may be utilised  rather than lose them at the early age of sixty-two and sixty-five  in most countries following the common law tradition the usual retirement age is seventy years  friends i do not desire to list all the qualities a judge should possess  but the foremost quality required in deciding constitutional issues is that the judge must be attuned to the philosophy of our  philosophy of our constitution which is succinctly and admirably encapsulated in the preamble and amplified in the chapter on  fundamental rights and directive principles which taken together constitute the core and conscience of our constitution we may and should should seek lights from judgements of the courts in the united kingdom in the united states canada  australia new zealand south africa another developing country it is important to have exposure to judgements of national courts of other country as also the judgements of regional and international tribunals and understand their approach to the solution of problems specially in the field of human rights  but ultimately we have to work out our own constitutional salvation in the light of our historical background recording broken  independence is that the judge must judge must be independent of himself or herself  in other words in deciding cases the judges should consciously avoid being influenced by the preconceived notions  it is a difficult task  have judges maintained the cold neutrality of an impartial judge as was edmund burke's perception?  let us be realistic judges like you and me are human beings  cannot expect them overnight to completely shed their predilections and preconceptions  the individual tone of the mind the colour of past experience  the character and variety of interests the socio-economic background of the judge inevitably play a role in the decision making process  our great chief justice patanjali shastri frankly acknowledged  that it is inevitable that the so called social philosophy and the scale of values of the judges should play an important part  at the same time he recognised that the constitution is not meant only for the people of their way of thinking but for all   now there have been occasions no doubts when judges have read their preferences into statutory and constitutional provision  for example the judgement of chief justice s. r. das  declaring gambling as an immoral trade beyond the pale of constitutional protection  justice kapur's view that certain advertisements for sexual disorders were not protected by the fundamental rights of free speech and justice hidayatullah's decision i have never understood that that lady chatterley's lover  was obscene  all reflects of social and moral philosophy of these judges  strong views for the rights of labour certainly influenced the decisions of justice gajendragadkar in the field of industrial law  justice d. a. desa's inveterate belief that landlords were a rapacious lots and all tenants deserved the courts utmost solicitude was transparent in his judgements  but it can be safely affirmed that in the overwhelming majority of cases judges in india have not acted as knight-errants  on white chargers in quest of their individual notions of justice  cases are decided as if the parties before them were anonymous  and the issues are legal and constitutional  judges as a rule do not intentionally take a view against their conscience or their oath nor do they take any cue from the sentiments of the ruling party  by and large judges do make a conscientious effort to neutralise their personal beliefs and predilections  if a law prohibiting consumption of alcohol is challenged the court is not concerned with the wisdom of the policy underlying the legislation  and it cannot invalidate the law because in its opinion the evil of drink cannot be effectively tackled by legislation  again when legislation involving nationalisation of road transport  is challenged in fact was challenged the individual notions of the justices over the policy of nationalisation are irrelevant in deciding whether there has been breach of any constitutional provision the decision of the supreme court in the bank nationalisation case  is frequently cited as an instance of the court striking down the legislation because of its disapproval of the policy underlying it  i am afraid what is overlooked is in the criticism of this much maligned judgement is that the supreme court rejected the basic and formidable argument that nationalisation of banks was not in the public interest  they said it is not for the supreme court to go into that they upheld that but court ruled that certain provisions of the act  did not provide compensation as required under the then constitutional provision  consequence was that these provisions were amended and nationalisation of banks was effectuated  the general judicial attitude is aptly and correctly summed up  in the classic statement of justice vivian bose in a case of preventive detention of certain communists  now mind you he gave a dissenting judgement in which he  quashed the orders of detention of the communists  but the statement which i want to read in which i which i would like to read is this and this was justice bose then it is perhaps ironical that i should struggle to oppose this freedoms in favour of a class of person who if rumour is to be accredited and if the list of their activities furnished to us is a true guide would be the first to destroy them if they but had the power  but i cannot allow personal predilections to sway my judgement of the constitution  now let me come to another subject  is there any antithesis between democracy and an independent judiciary?  is judicial review-on undemocratic?  does judicial invalidation of laws thwart the will of the people? although it is necessary to remove certain view you hear this very often  i think it's necessary to remove certain misconception about the role of the judiciary in our constitutional scheme  one of the essential features of our constitution is division of power between different institutions namely the three wings of the state the parliament and the state legislature the executive and the judiciary  a central feature of our constitution flowing from the division of powers is that of a limited government  consequently no authority or branch of the state can have absolute power  moreover the limits of power cannot be determined by the limited power itself  since our constitution divides power between different organs  and prescribes limitations of the powers of parliament the state legislature and the executive it is imperative that there should be an impartial umpire in the shape of an independent judiciary to resolve the inevitable disputes over the boundaries of the constitutional power which arise in the process of government  and please remember that our constitution has guaranteed certain fundamental rights and has expressly provided that any law or executive action which abridges any fundamental right is void  the fundamental rights constitute a limitation on the powers of parliament and the state legislatures and the executive and the question whether any legislation or executive action is violative of any fundamental right has to be decided by some independent body 
kate chopin's the awakening sex-role liberation or sexual liberation  over the centuries women writers have written openly or implicitly about the right of woman to passion  in fact as ellen moers in her literary women  says it was ovid who with his with his heroides  first gave voice to the heroine in love  according to moers ovid started a tradition which extended well into the eighteenth century to become part of the infant novel in britain  and which was born anew in women's literature of the nineteenth century  mary wollstonecraft the strong-minded feminist comes to mind in this respect  for it is in her fiction reviews and letters that  wollstone wollstonecraft is explicit about love  the wrongs of women or maria  by wollstonecraft is a celebration of an unhappy wife's   adulterous love from the point of view of a woman not only with a mind but a body capable of passion  women writers also inherited from rousseau the novel of adultery  as seen from the woman's point of view  as moers put it i quote the adultery novel after rousseau became the woman writer's vehicle of attack on the economic and social class realities that make a mockery of love as well as a vehicle of demonstration that woman has a capacity to think feel and act for herself unquote  a whole host of writers and novelists spoke frankly about the positive consequences of adultery  george elliot the bronte sisters gaskell browning collette and woolf to name only the most well known ones resolved to talk openly about the forbidden subject and the right of a woman to participate actively and consciously in the affairs of love clears her throat  the american literary scene had not witnessed the presence of a traditon of novel writing by women who talk about their heroines from a  woman's perspective  the awakening of female novel writers to a sense of their own identity begins only with the publication of kate chopin's   the awakening at the turn of the last century  one may even say that the american that the tradition begins in the twentieth century  incidentaly the awakening may be read as an  adult adultery novel also   chopin's novel sent waves of shock among the pre-dominantly patriarchal set up of her time  she became almost the first woman writer to create a woman in edna  pontellier who not only awakens to her sexuality but makes bold to confess it  linda huf puts it succinctly i quote the novel  suggested that the renegade heroine had not forgotten herself but had in fact found herself had awakened to her full potential as a human being and all because without consulting any one but her own willful self she had taken un an unlawful  fancy to a younger man unquote  when the novel opens the twenty-eight year old edna pontellier is holidaying at grand isle with her husband leonce pontellier and her  two children raoul and and etienne  i am sorry i don't know how to pronounce the french words so i am  i am just talking in terms of the anglicised pronunciation  pontellier a successful brokerage businessman is one of those husbands who prides himself on his many possessions of which his wife is the most precious and attractive  little wonder that he reacts typically when he reprimands edna for exposing herself at midday in such heat while bathing in the sea  he is anxious that she should protect her complexion as jealously if not more as her honour  he scrutinizes her as he would a piece of personal property which has suffered some damage  during the six years of her married life edna too has lived like any other southern wife in her beautiful house in new orleans  immersed immersed in her home and social circle  she was married she sorry she has married pontellier for the same reason as any woman of her class would  she chooses leonce to become the devoted wife of a man who she felt worshiped her  she feels she would i quote take her place with a certain dignity in the world of reality closing the portals forever behind her upon the realm of romance and dreams unquote  the opening pages of the novel would give one the impression that edna is one of those usual southern women who is contented looking after her husband and children  yet through the flashback technique chopin employs we know that edna had been a different person in her childhood girlhood  and youth  as a lonely and imaginative person she has given herself to secret and intense infatuations  first it is the dignified and sad-eyed cavalry officer at another time it is i quote the young gentleman who visits a lady on a neighbourhood plantation unquote yet a third time it is i quote the figure of a great tragedian that possessed her mind  but marriage with the tragedian which would have been the highest point of her happiness was not for her in this world  however if he does not come in the form of a leonce he comes in the form of robert lebrun who awakens her to a sense of herself as a person rather than as a piece of personal property  but even before robert begins to arouse edna's dormant passionate self it is the sea at grand isle which without her realising it has begun to exert a powerful pull towards her  the seductive voice of the sea never ceasing whispering  clamouring murmuring invites edna's soul to wander the abyss of solitude  the solitude of the sea as judith fryer aptly says propels a real awakening in edna which i quote frees her from her place in society unquote  fryer further maintains that in her illumination edna is most like whitman's awakened self and that once we recognize the extent to which edna's awakening is the whitmanian song of herself the radical nature of chopin's  intentions becomes clear  fryer considers the awakening as a song a celebration of a woman who awakens to her identity as a person quote  defined only in terms of her own experience not in relation to any other person unquote  among the many images that chopin uses to project either edna's  restrictive life or her freedom from this life the sea is the most dominant one  it frames both edna's awakening into life and her final suicide  the first six chapters of the book describe the seductive quality of the sea which stirs edna's awakening  so seductive is the pull of the sea that edna experiences  contradictory emotions of attraction and resistance to robert's  invitation to her to follow him to the shore or into the sea  i quote this is from the text a certain light was beginning to dawn within her the light which's showing the way  forbids it  in short mrs pontellier was beginning to realize her position in the universe as a human being and to recognise her relations as an individual to the world within and about her unquote  that edna's awakening is clearly sexual is indicated by  chopin's description of the sea and its effect on edna  the touch of the sea is sensuous enfolding the body in its soft  close embrace  when edna first arrives at grand isle she cannot swim the sea is dangerous to her  quote a certain ungovernable dread hung about her when in the water unless there was a hand near by that might a hand near that might reach out and reassure her unquote  and of course it is robert whose reassuring hand  encourage encourages her to realize her power to control her body and soul   chopin's aim is in describing edna's trial in learning to swim is clear  it becomes symbolic of edna's moving away from a state of dependence fear and repression to a state of independence  boldness and an awakening of a sensuous self  edna wants to swim far wide where no woman has swum before  as a consequence her will gradually turns resistant and stubborn and eventually refuses to obey her husband's whims  chopin juxtaposes edna's emerging self with her previous dormant self to show how redundant her husband has become for her  her bathing in the sea with robert and her going on a day-long boat trip further shows edna's boldness  yet neither while bathing in the sea nor during their day at  caminada do we see edna and robert in any kind of physical intimacy  in fact the high point of edna's sensual awakening comes when edna is alone at madame uh madame antoine's   co sorry cottage while robert is waiting outside patiently for her to recover from her exhaustion after their boat ride to caminada  more than robert it is adele one of the boarders at grand isle who seems to play a significant role in edna's sensual awakening  it is adele who em emboldens  edna to exalt over her body without any shame  chopin devotes considerable space to describing the intimacy with which the two women sit and talk on the beach at grand isle  yet as long as edna is on grand isle her awakening remains at the level of the sensual only  there is no element of sex involved in her relationship with robert before such a possibility arises robert leaves for mexico  the sexual freedom that edna experiences vis-a-vis  arobin comes much later this is a lover that she consciously takes in the in the novel it is shown that later in the novel  the sexual freedom that edna experiences vis-a-vis  arobin comes much later after she has emancipated herself  from her marital familial and social ties after her return to new orleans  edna has begun to defy her husband's whims even while they are at grand isle that is on the holiday  but in new orleans where they live it's it's their home there she decides to free herself not only from her family duties but also from her social commitments like her weekly reception day  which she has had to observe to further her husband's business  and his status in society  she defiantly moves about alone at odd hours and in odd places  as if this was not enough she turns to her old hobby of painting  which at first she undertakes to kill the boredom of her life but later with a seriousness which eventually helps her helps her to handle her brush with a new sureness and ease helping her to work  to grow in force and individuality these are all textual quotes  the next step in edna's emancipation is her desire to become economically independent which she becomes with the help of her teacher laidpore who sells some of her paintings for her  this in addition to her small inheritance plus the money she has won at the race track makes it possible for her to buy her pigeon house she lives in a separate house from her husband's now thus edna awakens to her full identity as an individual  quietly but firmly freeing herself from the stereotypical roles of a wife and mother which society has imposed on her  an important influence on edna in arousing her later creativity  which ultimately makes her a professional painter is madame reisz a pianist edna has met at grand isle  edna has been attracted by reisz's professional performance that is soiree for the vacationers s o i r e e please how do we pronounce it ?  soiree  soiree okay  but more than this edna has been fascinated by reisz's  independence and her self-assertion and her tendency to trample on the rights of others  in new orleans too edna calls on reisz quite often to hear her play the atmosphere of her room invades edna with repose   reisz's music has the cons  consistent effect of playing upon the responsive chords of her inner being  although reisz's rudeness and offensive manners try  edna's patience her divine art reaches edna's spirit  and sets it free  her observation that reisz's observation in the text i quote to be an artist includes much one must possess many gifts which have not been acquired by one's own effort  to succeed the artist must possess the courageous soul  the soul that dares and defies unquote  challenges edna to further free herself from the shackles of social conventions  probably it is reisz's indifference and unconcern for social norms and conventions that emboldens edna to confess what she has not been able to do to anyone her passion for robert  it is then that reisz says something that is at the centre of  chopin's examination in the novel  i quote the bird that would soar above the level plain of tradition and prejudice must have strong wings  it is a sad spectacle to see the weaklings bruised  exhausted fluttering back to earth unquote  obviousely through the bird imagery which like the imagery of the sea flows throughout the novel  chopin is trying to portray the plight of women who either remain imprisoned in cages of conventions or tear these conventions of  and soar freely doing what they want to do or after having dared to defy and soar find the freedom so daunting that like weaklings  they fall on the land bruised and broken 
respected chairman distinguished guests and fellow  delegates  i would like to say at the outset i'm very much illequipped paper reader  actually i didn't i was not aware of the change in the schedule which was not really supplied to me yesterday i was one of the first paper readers put down  but anyhow i am happy that i am able to read it read it out today  and taking into consideration the limitations of time usually in such seminars i have jotted down some stray thoughts that too on a known author well discussed by you  of course i am not a committed feminist or anything like that but  based on my own reading i would like to share a few thoughts on sylvia plath's poem  of course with a slight difference from the normally vaulted  past adpoted by most of the major voices  uh the actually i struck upon this idea when i was reading yung in some another context  and i had a feeling that uh perhaps uh plath's  insistance struggle or some sort of an obssession with the definition or redefinition of self could be looked at from the complex concept of sex as sorry of the individual in which two polarities the male and female are combined  but anyhow i have not made a very deep analysis of that problem here  but on the other hand i have taken up a few poems and try to suggest why don't we look at this way and try to see a perhaps  another major concern of plath rather than labelling her as an out and out feminist or a committed confessional poet or anything of that sort perhaps i think one of the major problems which could still be studied in relation to her poetry is the integrity of the self  without being st strictly  related to any gender  or the thrust of my paper which i have intend to elaborate later on is to see that the concept of the self which could be perhaps studied in relation to her poems could be quite free from the gender concerns  she takes into consideration the problems created by the male  as well as the female in defining a self intact  so with this introductory remarks i am reading my paper  the self in sylvia plath's plays it is different  in a very general sense sylvia plath's poetry as a whole has been an insistant search to find and define the self  though she is often labelled as a confessional poet in her perception of the self and the poetic process she is quite different from say dorothy robert loyal john berryman and  annie saxon and the like  she links private motives and images into sequences that form the part of a coherent drama a symbolic enactment  the approach adopted by her in the last poem about which i am making some observations  the last poem contained an aerial  adventurous spirit throws in temporarily for highly individualistic and peculiar perception of the self  the victim sends feminist stance concessional strain  and the suicidal mania gain relevance and meaning when one should read to link these factors with her self or in other words herself  with a difference   plath's feminism her confessionalism and suicide are to be seen in relation to her relentless poetic transformation  an inevitable rebirth through death  a hightened awareness of the individuals painful one word   in contemporary society becomes the central focus of their i mean contemporary poet's poems   plath's poetry of imit   of initiation transformation thus appears within its general social framework as a means of escape from the identities and forces that imprisoned the self in america or perhaps elsewhere in the light of the developments in the post- nineteen sixty context there is some scope for looking at plath's work  from a feminist point of view  this view centres upon her supposed victimisation by a male dominated world and her consequence feminist's stance lack of recognition in a male dominated world shocking childhood experiences and the separation from her husband of course these are all autobiographical factors which may or may not be of relevance paranthetically might have contributed to shape her fury  and even to unchange her true self  feminist views her death as a form of martyrdom  her life a case history in the devilish cultural politics  that favours men over women and destroys women's creativity  actual biographical details of plath's may not augment this stance  however because i think she had sufficient acclaim  her poetry was fairly well ratified but in the particular time at which she was writing say i think poetry was at a lower base  i think even now it is applied  when we list this one word i'm sure the response will be much better when we discuss poetry probably the response is limited because it shows on the one hand the readers'  response response and i think poetry is not in great demand  so that may not be something very peculiar to plath  however the distinguishing feature of plath's self in her poems particularly her later ones is that she looks at the world from the point of view of an oppressed one not strictly gender bound  in the last poems there is a rare fury a total release from fear  the recourse to a aggression in the last poem is neither abreast nor aesthetically uncalled for  i think if you make a total study of her poems beginning with her earlier poems and if you come up to her very late poems this trend could be seen  this was some sort of a progressive release from the clutches  of fear and which culminates in a sort of fury which i think render possible the liberation of the self  of course we can cite poems belonging to both groups   i ci i quote a few lines from  a poem which is usually quoted to cite her feminist strength in  pardah for example she makes a declaration of independence i shall unloose from the small jewelled form from the small jewelled doll she got like a heart  the lioness the shriek in the barks the cloak of whole  in another poem which is a longer poem three women   through the voices of a wife a secretary and a girl she brings to life the feminine sensibilities in relation to being an approved mother with a son a woman with a miscarriage and a girl  with an accidental daughter whom she gives away  here one would perceive the subtle variation that plath effect  to bring to the fore herself  perhaps even in this period of emotional fury and psychological collapse she plucks at courage and pronounces rather forcefully  i quote from winter tree i am no shadow though there is a shadow starting from my feet i am a wife  the city waits and aches  the little grasses cracked through stone and they are green  with light  this robust assertion on the elemental beauty of life  green with life brings in the difference in plath's self  even while being one with a one word a feminist or  a confessionist  while looking at plath's poem from a feminist point of view one has to bear in mind two vital points  one sylvia plath may not be a feminist as one is likely to believe  for she does not commit herself to ideological problems in her writings  if that is a major concern  there is limited gender based class hatred in her poems to my mind  time and again she directs her anger against select individuals  her father her husband or their symbolic representatives  even the passages of a hot nature when i quote that we find in a poem like lady lazarus further the applicant and three women may not be sufficient evidence to argue that plath had a committed well defined feminist politics  at best one could say that in such lines i quote from  daddy her boss her lucifer devour devour out of the ash i write with my red hair and i eat men like air   i'm sorry i've quoted these lines from   lady lazarus one word they are  dancing and scanting jumping on you  they always knew it was you  daddy daddy you bastard i am through  plath directed her rage against in the fantacy image of her dead father and against her husband into an attack on marriage and men or in a more inclusive way which i think maybe more  beneficial against violence against total violence perhaps   with your permission to the audiance  the strength of her mature poetry suddenly lies in her ability to coilate polarities particularly the male female polarities  yielding a delicate or even diabolic of course it is questionable balance in the human strain  this aspect is borne out by her poems lasposs  medusa and the other  really she lashes out with equal violence on women  i quote violent attacks on women in this well sort of  not far and few  this only points to herself with a difference  in lassposs she mocks any bounds that exists between one woman and another as a result of their common gender  or shared oppression  i have quoted the poet herself  i quote from one of her poem your voice my earing  flapping and sucking blood loving bath that's that  that's that you peer from the doors sad had every woman is a whore i can't communicate  so i think her problem of defining the self or her problem of establishing a camaraderie is not strictly regimented to or confined to the men  but on the other hand she has been more or less undergoing this dramatic experience in relation to women also which i think critics have not very often taken into serious consideration   that's my feeling  it may be noted that one of her recurrent images of for  women is the medusa image which i think is not a very enduring one  plath unlike the later feminist never struck to any particular ideology in relation to male female conflicts or what we have now begun to term as even the male female crisis  depending on the poetic situations she shifted her views on the male female issues  for her the prime concern is the integrity of herself  perhaps the difference in her perception and hence her self lies in her existencial streak  i think i'll be in agreement with previous paper reader she strikes again the male and female with equal venom and vehemence whenever they irrespective of the gender become a threat to her self  plath discusses a consciousness of political issues but the focus of her politics was neither women nor men's role in  women's oppression  as she explained in a b b c interview  i quote she was imaginatively involved in those historical political events that are closest to the concerned voice in her poems  she herself has listed a number of concerns hiroshima atom bomb one word and nazism which again points to her protest against the general violence total violence rather than the violence impeached on women by men strictly  the sequence of her late poems the bee keeper's  daughter is quite revealing in this sense  in a way it anticipates the lady lazarus mood  the crux of the sequence in a quest is a quest for an independent queenly self  the first poem the the bee meeting just describes the usual practice of replacing old hives  but it soon becomes an awful ritual for the protagonist  for it is directed by i quote dreary depersonlised  a one word like figures of a midwife a rector and a sexton  as they are also agents respectively of birth marriage and death   the poem turns out to be the first step in a cyclic exploration of the self  curiously these agents are protected  but the protagonist is utterly exposed  i quote nude as a chicken neck  unquote  however the mood of aggression asserting the peculiar strength of her self is sustained in the arrival of the bee-box and stings the end of the rabbit catcher another good poem to be looked at from this point of view clearly suggest the constraints set by  the man in personal relationships maybe a male female relationship  maybe a male say a female female relationship  obviously here too she is concerned with the integrity of the self  she abhors i quote and we two had a relationship  tight wire between us  takes too deep to approve and a mind like earring sliding shut on some quick sand  the constrict the constriction killing me also  two words  even in this way the difference in her self is reflected in her persistance on themes relating to children and rebirths in the poems of her last phase  sylvia plath's confessional mood and mood is a designed to bring forth the peculiarities of herself   morning song nick and the candletick death and company cuts the bee-meeting tulips etcetera are some poems which enable us to go far beyond mere autobiographical revealations  these poems record i quote personal experience in the patterns that obtain an objective character of though repetition  illusion and symbolic inactment  unquote plath right from the beginning to the end in her creative essay has been experimenting with the integrity of the self  i underline the integrity of the self through a series of emotionally charged even hyper charged explorations by her feminist concerns confessional overtures suicidal leaps and through her bold linguistic innovations she could present a self with a difference to the reading public  thank you 
hello i'm meenakshi v today i'm going to speak on the topic science and happiness  there have been many wonderful discoveries by scientists to make our lives more comfortable more safe and more interesting  but if we ask the question have these discoveries made men happier ? it is difficult to give a true answer  the chief difficulty in giving a true answer is because   happiness is not a material thing which can be given to us like food or motor or a radio set it is in our mind just think carefully and you will see that this is so  if you get something which pleases you the happiness is not in the thing but in your mind which finds the thing pleasurable  there is another point about happiness  which is also worth thinking about  happiness does not depend upon the amount of things you have  it does not come to you when you try to get it and keep it  on the contrary it depends on the fewer fewness of your wants just think about it this also carefully  a man who has many wants always wants more  he wants one thing and tries to get it  he gets it but he is not satisfied  he wants something else  the more he gets the more he wants  is not that true of most people who want wealth or power or high position ? most people are like that even if their wants are for  smaller things  a boy wants a bicycle  his father gives him one  he sees someone with a be better   bicycle so he wants one like that  when he is a little older he wants a motor cycle  then he wants a motor car  if he has enough money to buy one he wants another and a bigger one and so on  but a man who has few wants whether he is poor or rich has a much better chance of being happy  the wisest men in the world have taught us that the only complete happiness is when one wants nothing  it is difficult for us to be like that  but nevertheless it is true that merely having more does not make us happier  that is why most people are not happier today even with many wonderful and useful new things that science has discovered and given us  some of the things which science has given us have certainly helped  to make our lives happier  science has helped us to get rid of many sickness of the body  that is a great thing  it is difficult to be happy in your body if your body is full of pain  we have learnt of the many discoveries made by scientists to make us painless and to get rid of the cause of pain and sickness  by making it possible to cure terrible diseases such as malaria  small-pox plague pneumonia and tuberculosis science has lenghtened the life of the average man  in nineteen hundred every baby born in the u s a could be expected to live less than fifty years  fifty years later the health conditions have so much improved that the average length of life was nearly seventy years  a few hundred years ago the average length of life was less than thirty years   but it certain but it is certain sorry   but is it certain that people were less happy in those times  ? what is the use what what is the use of living longer unless you are also happy ? science is helping man to produce much more food from the earth by this it is helping to prevent famine and sickness due to undernourishment  it has also made it possible to send quick relief to places where there is shortage of food and medicines with the help of motor uh motor lorries railway trains ships and aeroplanes  this is also very good and many lives are saved in such ways  but in india and some other countries such as indonesia and south america the number of people is increasing faster than than the food supply  science has not yet found out how to solve that problem  it is a very serious because there will be worse and worse famine unless it is solved  and people certainly cannot be happy if they are starving  can they ? there are also many discoveries of science which have definitely brought unhappiness into the world  that is not because the discoveries are bad but because men are using them badly  for example consider the discovery of the gun powder and of other explosives each more powerful than the previous one discovered  in ancient times men could wound and kill each other only if they were near enough to strike each other with stones arrows spears or swords  even in the battles of the olden times which history calls great battles the armies on both the sides usually consisted only of a few thousand men and the number of wounded and killed in the wars  of those times was not very great  in most wars except a few such as the wars which destroyed the roman empire the peasant went on cultivating their fields peacefully  even when the armies were fighting a few miles away  but the invention of fire arms and high explosives caused a great change  a modern machine gun or quick firing gun worked by a single man can wound and kill hundreds of people in a few minutes one modern bomb can kill thousands  it is said that the latest type of atomic bomb could kill  hundreds of thousands of people immediately if it was dropped on a big city  the scientists who invented these terrible weapons are not wicked men who enjoy killing  they are people with kind hearts like yours and mine but they are more clever and they can earn their living by discovering new things  it is the leaders of the various nations who employ them to make discoveries which can be used to kill the people of  o other nations that are to blame  the same country discoveries could be used only for useful purposes if the leaders did not allow them to be used for killing  explosives are not harmful if they are used for such purposes as helping to get coal metals and other minerals out of the earth  the same motors and aeroplanes which are used to carry guns and drop bombs can be very useful for good purposes  so you see that it is not the discoveries and inventions that are bad but the ways in which men use them  now let us try to find out why men use them for harmful purposes  it is not easy to find this out but it is very important  unless you can find it out there will be more and more terrible wars in your your own time and if we go on like that our grand-children will not be able to live in this world at all  the earth will become a desert and mankind will come to an end  with these few words i end my speech  thank you for giving me an oppotunity to speak  thank you once again  hello i'm shantala speaking in uh speaking  for the total literacy in if inevitable  for the political social and economic development of a country on the world scene on one hand india can stand proudly shoulder to shoulder with frontline countries in matters of space research  advanced technology etcetera  but in literacy queue we are far behind other countries   it's well known world over that the areas of poverty and illiteracy more or less overlap each other in a map and continued illiteracy can be a major handicap for the growth and development of democratic institution in a country  in this context functional literacy becomes all the more significant and important  mere advertisement and learning three hours is of no consequence  rather than an end in itself literacy should be regarded as a way of preparing man for social and civil and economic role  literacy teaching is resolutely oriented towards development  and should be an integral part of not only of any national educational plans  but also of plans and projects for development of all sectors of national life  considering the experience of many other countries the targets fixed by india's educational planners are by no means beyond realisation but still are lagging behind   let's analyse the need for our relevance of literacy in a few more specific situations  there are very prejudices facts and taboos which frown upon literacy go indeed to demonstrate its strength let us start with the example of industrial workers  an industrial worker in a an organised sector however intelligent and enterprising is also in need of access to information about the source of raw material and its conversation to  finished goods price standardisation and quality control marketing  rate fixation process provision relating to safety and the work at the work place etcetera  a belief that thus an illiterate worker can also successfully operate machines can repar repair and maintain them is nothing but a an affirmation  of a blind prejudice could be the outcome of vested interests  a worker in the unorganised or the semi- organised sector is in need of sem similar access to information about various process of modernisation improved farming  suitability of a particular soil to a particular crop quality of seeds fertilisers and other modern methods  the malfunctional middlemen who rob the legitimate share of the farm and the forest produce may be tactfully dropped  the plight of the share croppers of the landless agricultural labourers fact factors which lead to their indebtness and bondage will be improved to a very great extent  yet another important segment of the society is the rural artisans they should also wake up from their traditional slumber and look around them and the world  they must look beyond the crude and antiquited ways of making goods example of back blacksmith  should leave his old slumber and switch on to new electric arc furnace etcetera the potter to electric wheels and others  in the social background improving the sta   status of women uh depends mostly on literating the woman  it helps in warding off the superstition and other social evils too woman it helps a woman in tracing her identity and strength and weakness herself  no more she is what we say in sanskrit koop manduke  that's the frog in the well  and even in the political situation the voting right of a person is denied that is because a person is illiterate  and if a person is literate he ca he cannot be deceived by the politi  political parties or the politicians  they can fight for the rights to a greater extent  thus literacy in a sense is not a dose which can produce instant and dramatic results  it can it's an absract weapon through though powerful which gradually trains and equips some human mind and prepares it increasingly for eventual change  these few words of mine add up to the inevitability of total literacy for a countries all round development  thank you 
my dear ladies and gentleman  i would like to speak on the relevance of english education  andbeyond  in fact uh i am not going to deal with the beyond  i am going to speakonly on the relevance of  english education  uh let me start with the background there was a time when the sun did not set from the british empire  that is the empire spread almost all over the world  along with the empire the english language also spread all over the world  now the sun almost does not arise on the british empire  but the english language has now become an international language known all over the world  what is more it is the intelligentia of the world language now less than half of the globe speaks english as its native speaker native language  they are the inhabitants of great britain u.s.a. canada  australia new zealand the caribbean and south africa  and this accounts for three hundred million speakers  in the rest of the world englishis used in various other parts either as foreign language or a second language including in the u.s.s. r. however restricted in its way  roughly there are three major speech communities  spoken all over the world  first the native speakers second   second language speakers and third  foreign languagespeakers  the predominant position of english in the world had something to do with two factors  one is the colonisation of british empire among otherminor european powers towards the end of nineteenth century and stabilized in the year twentieth century until the outbreak of  south wo second world war and secondly the independence from the british colonies from the end of second world war which has been on  the latest as you know is hong kong which will be free in nineteen ninety-seven  after independence the new countries were confronted with theproblem of national language and or official language  a few african and asian countries opted for english the transition was not very easy as many factors were involved particularly the size of the country and the size of the speech communities whether they are mon mono-lingual or multi-lingual communities  the case of india is a very special one  one thing that happened to india after independence was that  the number of princely states thanks to sardar patel were  integrated into the erstwhile british provinces  secondly we have already by this time a de facto lingua franca in fact two  lingua francas if you like english and hindi now the position of english in india is that at the time of independence english was the de facto official language but soon after that we decided to accept hindi as our national language as en enshrined in the indian constitution  along with hindi we decided to continue with english as an associate official language for fifteen years from the  commencement of the indian constitution in nineteen fifty up to nineteen sixty-five  in the meantime wedecided to cultivate and develop hindi to take over from english in the hope that it would be relegated to the position of foreign language that is for restrictive functions  and hindi would take over fully not only as a national language  but also as the official language and as the lingua franca of the pan-indian language  however during the period of fifteenyears something seems to have gone wrong  perhaps because of one of the uh factors that is the  creation of linguistic states the position of hindi seems to have suffered a setback and we had to continue english as an associate official language indefinitely  so at the moment our national language is hindi our+ official language is english and our lingua franca  link language seems to be divided  broadly speaking english and hindi  these link languages cut across the two regions north and south  on the one hand and the two sections of society all over the country english as second language in india  it might be useful to remember at the backof our mind the concept of second language before we go on   second language by definition fulfills  four important functions namely instrumental regulative  interpersonal and imaginative  in india the main instrumental and regulative functions are  fulfilled by education and administration respectively  the interpersonal function is fulfilled by one of the link languages that is english  it is in fact a linklanguage between the regional language  speakers especiallythose who do not understand hindi or even if they  knowhindi will prefer it to english  finally the imaginative function is fulfilled by a large body of  well established literature namely indian writing in english next only to native english literatures such as british american australian canadian and other literatures  the ups and downs in the position of english  we can discern two phase phases in post independent era of english inindia  the first up to nineteen sixty-five and the second after that even before independence the medium of instruction at regional language at the secondary schools and english as second languages  was taught in all such schools  there were of course certain english medium schools also and the medium of instruction was uh english throughout post-school level as early as nineteen forty nine the university education commission recommended a gradual change over of  mediu medium of instruction+ from english to indian languages  at the higher stage at the also  the three languages regional federal presumably hindi  and english are to be studied at seco at higher secondary and university stages  in the year nineteen fifty-one fifty-two the secondary education commission recommended that the study of english should be given importance in secondary schools and facilities shouldbe made available at the middle school stage for its study on an optional basis  thus english was taught as a main second language at the school system in all the stages and in all the states it was taughtfor anything between four to seven years  partly or wholly as a compulsory subject  the report of the official language commission nineteen fifty-six made a clear cut distinction between lan  english language and english literature  hitherto english literature was taught even with  at the school stage but now the regional languages had already become the medium of instruction throughout the secondary schools and gradually it was being used as a medium of  certain faculties even at the university stage  under the circumstances the position of english has undergone a great change  inthe words of the report uh i quote  english has to be taught hereafter as a language of comprehension rather than as a literary language unquote  after the creation of the linguistic states we witnessed one of the most controversial issue issues in indian education that is the place of english in our educational set up  from angrezi hatao  downwith english at one extreme to english as the sole medium of education at the other  were widespread unrest and riots all over the country it is in this context that the three language formula  was proposed  it was subsequently modified in the kothari commission report  nineteen sixty-four sixty-six   the three language formula sought i quote  to establish equally equality  with regard to the study of language between hindi and non-hindi  speaker speaking areas  it recommended that as against the third language hindi  along uh another lan another indian language besides hindi and english should be studied by  pupils in hindi speaking area unquote  this almost amounts to punishment  there was no motivation whatsoever for the hindi speaking pupil  to learn another modern indian language modern  english indian language  thus the three language formula seems to have failed  in the meantime the role of english has undergone change as we have mentioned earlier instead of english literature  we have sought to cultivate english language  pioneering work has been undertaken by the central institute of english c.i.e. hyderabad created in nineteen fifty-eight  english began to be considered as second language and the appropriate methods of teaching english were proposed in course of time several other institutions like the regional institute of english r.i.e. state institute of english s.i.e and so on spread  and on the whole the overall educational facilities had tremendously increased not only in school level but also at the college and university levels  the latest all india education commission kothari commission report has advocated the study of english  on an optional basis at the primary level that is from fifth to seventh and on secondary basis at the secondary level that is  eight to ten and again optional basis higher secondary level that is uhm eleven to twelve in its scheme of seven  uh twelve year school and three year degree course for the entire country that is ten plus two plus three  and the position of english has been prescribed sorry  described as a library language  today english is english in india is an important if not compulsory secondary language at all stages of education  now let me uhm look at the national policy of education and plan action  two decades of intense planning and implementation of mass education that is quantitative improve improve  improvement the government of india hasnow turned to the qualitative improvement of uhimprovement of educational facilities  in the year nineteen eighty-six the national policy of education and plan of action popularly known as npe  and poa modified in nineteen ninety-two were launched  it then reviewed the national policy from nineteen sixty-eight to nineteen eighty-six and noted that there have been slow progress in the implementation of these recommendations and emphasised the need for a dynamic approach  as far as the development of language is concerned the medium of instruction at the university stage has been unsatisfactory on account of two factors ( a) the preparation and production of these text books has not synchronised with the universities decision to switch over to modern english modern indian  languages  and ( b) secondly second uhm uhm university teacher  having received education through english find it difficult to teach through their english language in indian languages  more importantly the universities are reluctant to change their medium ofinstruction in regard to indian languages because the lack of employment opportunities to those who have studied in those languages  there is no special mention of medium of instruction in the chapter on higher education in this document  however the development of english language trained   uh training institution is encouraged  + centres have been set up for imparting training to english language teacher at school stage and have trained one point five lakh of english teachers  now among other things the npe suggests the delinking of degree requirement for employment wherever feasible one of themost important measures taken in respect of  qualitative improvement of the engl education was the creation of  institutes institutions of excellence uh  navodaya vidyalaya  since nineteen eighty-six navodaya  vidya vidyanagar vid vidyalayas were set up in two hundred and eighty districts spread over twenty-nine states and union territories of territories for children who are potentially high achiever   acharya rammurthi commissionreport notes  that in the name of qualitative improvement of education the national policy of educationand programme of action have been criticised for the reclu uh exclusion of the poor  from the educational process and he decries elitism  the relevance of english education  we have now to ask a question how relevant english education is in our country ?   i've been asked to make a statement not only about the relevance of english education butalso beyond it  but first let me make certain statements of the first part how relevant english education is ? you will find from the fifth uh fifth all india education survey of the ncert nineteen ninety-two compiled in nineteen eighty-six that is ten years ago there were two major language medium uh medium schools all over the country  one hindi medium hindi medium schools  and two english medium schools  apart from these there were several indian language medium schools particularly mother tongue languages language schools which were minor ones  all put together there were six point four lakh  of schools in the country at all levels primary upper primary and secondary  out of these the majority of english medium schools account for two point four four lakhs of schools followed by  uhm zero point nine nine lakh that is less than one  lakh of hindi medium schools  that is to say that all the media of instructions in the whole of india there were six point four lakh of schools  outof which english medium schools account for four two point four four lakhs  that is more than one third of all the schools in the entire country  what is more interesting is that the english medium schoolswere much more both in the urban and the ural uh the rural sections  in the rural areas there were seventy-five thousand hindi medium schools as against two lakh of english medium schools that is two and a half time  similarly in the urban sector there were only twenty-four thousand hindi medium schools as against uh forty-nine thousand english medium schools that is as much as double the number  in that there were more number of english medium schools in rural areas than in urban ones  these statistics perve pertaining   to the prevailing year nineteen eighty-six  today in the year nineteen ninety-six what that is  ten year after that what is the real situation ?  we do not know the statistics now but we can project it on an impressional uh impressionistic basis for example  a small town my own place kolhapur 
let me start with some quotations  one as far as laws of mathematics refer to reality  they are not certain  as far as they are certain they do not refer to reality   this is by albert einstein   introduction of exactness in mathematics and logic is artificial and forced  all traditional logic assumes that precise symbols are employed  it is therefore not applicable to this terrestrial life  but only can imaginal imaginary celestial existence  that is burtrend russell   as the complexity of the system increases our ability to make precise and yet significant statements about its behaviour diminishes  until a threshold is reached beyond which precision and significance become mutually exclusive characters  this is lotsizadeh the founder or discoverer of fuzzy sets  the first is a physicist scientist  the second is a philosopher mathematician logician  and the third is a technocrat  so  what was his name ? lotsizadeh l o t s i z a d e h b b writing   the scientist philosophers and technologist are unanimous  on one point mathematics falls far short of their expectations in coping with reality  let us probe a little deeper  consider the following three questions  question one what will be the distance of the planet neptune from earth on march twenty-eight two thousand and one  ? question two who will win maximum world medals in the forth coming olympics ? question three will the world be better to live in by the turn of the century ? the first question the question about distance  is precise and is and it is possible to give a reasonably precise answer  in some cases a precise answer may not be possible at the present level of technological development but there is a general consensus about the theoritical existence of such answers  the questions of this type can be handled with admirably adequate efficiency by present day mathematics  the second question about the medals falls in the different category  though the question is precise the precise answer is not possible till the event actually takes place  these are speculating questions  and there probablistic answers can be given with the help of  statistical theory  however it is the third type of question which is of primary importance to me in my today's talk   will the world be a better place to live in by the turn of the century ? such type of questions cover very vast areas of our cognition most of the real life problems belongs to this category  the formulation of these types of question is in a very vague language  the meaning of the question may change not only from person to person but from time to time for the same person and yet the question is quite meaningful  all of us will agree that this world needs much to be desired  but the prescription of the better  betterment of the world changes from person to person   will everybody be happy if he or she is rich   ? let us not labour on happiness  philosophers have written volumes on the state of happiness  and the ways to achieve it  but nobody seems to have been benefitted from the reading  of those books except their publishers and possibly their authors  but what about the richness ? the word richness has many shades  but i'm using it in a very mundane earthly sense  how much wealth one should amass so that one is called rich rockfeller is rich so is ford an average indian is not rich  so i think there is some standard on which all of us agree  but such agreement does not last long  a person whom i consider very rich may be an average middle class commoner in the sense of rockfeller  thus the concept of richness seems to be highly subjective  relative or self referential  besides who should be call rich ? one whose annual income is say five million  and if the answer is affirmative what about the one  whose income is little less than that ? say forty-five hundred thousand  and this argument will continue till a stage is reached  where one cannot decide whether a person getting the specific amount would be placed in the category of rich persons or not  for one may seek any threshold for deciding the richness  but a person earning little less than the limit need not be considered non-rich  thus the so called threshold is not only highly arbitrary  but extremely foggy and indiscernible  and still the question is meaningful  most of the questions of real world are of this nature  they are fuzzy  so what causes fuzziness ? there are several factors which contribute to fuzziness  let me mention some of them  natural language the first and foremost among the causes of fuzziness is the intrinsic weakness of natural languages  again it is very much debatable whether it is a  the strength or the weakness  but there are no two opinions that there is some one word vagueness in all natural languages  consider for example the following adjectives uh  tall fellow an intelligent lady  a handsome youth or for that matter  the following sentences   if you work a little harder you will get much more  heavier vehicle should be driven more cautiously  the more they change the more they are the same   though all these are very much meaningful sentences their meaning is never precise  the second factor contributing to fuzziness is  subjective preferences  added to intrinsic fuzziness of a language there is some subjective element related to the user  the same word may have different meanings at different places to different persons at different times and in different circumstances  a young man of twenty-five year will consider a fifty year old  man a old man but if you ask the opinion of the fifty year old on the same question he will say that he's  quite young and energetic  uh there is a very beautiful story about uh this in  vedas  well it is not written here uh completely  prajapati the sup the supreme  creator was once approached by humans god and monster  prajapati created them all but they were unhappy in his world  so they asked him to advise them  prajapati said c c c i mean capital  c  the human thought that they were greedy  they wanted everything for themselves that must be the cause of their grief  so prajapati must have told them to show charity  charity starts with c   g god thought that they were pleasure seekers they all the time sitting in the heavens  drinking nector and engaged in sensual pleasure  so god uh the prajapati asked them to control themselves and not to allow their passions to take better of them  monsters thought that they were cruel and unkind  they did not care for miseries of others  that must be the cause of their own misery  so prajapati asked them to show compassion  thus c became charity for men control for god  compassion for monsters  well let us assume that in this type of questions some psychological factors are in involved  so let us consider the problem of controlling warmness of water in shower bath  here the concept of warmness depends on the particular person  particular time particular place particular season and above all the particular mental or physical condition of the user  note that this problem unlike the earlier one is not of academic interest but of economic interest of manufacturers of shower bath equipments  and hence for control engineers  the third factor that contributes to fuzziness is inadequacy of information  many a time there is no sufficient knowledge of the system  for example scientist is always aware that he knows no final truth  he may be sceptic even about well established theory  on the frontiers of knowledge he is always on slippery ground if in addition the data is ana  inadequate everything becomes a matter of guess work then all he has to rely upon is a working hypothesis  based on state of the aa knowledge and unprovable basic assumptions  these assumptions can be a matter of verbal  perceptions as in medical and social problems  sometimes one has to infer not only from insufficient data  but also from information which is not wholly reliable  for example if you are working with strategies in the battlefield  next factor that contributes to fuzziness is interdependence of concepts  a cyclical behaviour of natural phenomena is a very  favourite concept of indian a ancient indian philosophers  and cycle has no cut points  the seeds of decay for an indian philosopher are present  in the growth itself  the transformation of growth into decay is so subtle that you cannot put a demarcation line between them  or let us be more plain  if the demand of certain commodity increases its price  rises  but the rise in price results in decrease in the demand  the end affects the means and the means affect the end  to win elections a political party has to take some populist measures  but such measures result into deficient deficit financing and causes inflation  and prices rise  if the prices rise it is difficult to win in the elections this interdependents of concepts causes fuzziness in decision in complex systems like human body or national ec  economy the effects of this fuzziness can be  very easily observed  complexity of the system is one more cause of fuzziness  in many real life problems specially where human element is involved the system is so complex that it is impossible to control or even to take into account all the affecting factors  then it becomes a matter of personal choice to decide which factors are to be considered and which are to be ignored  and such a choice in general is not easy  then cost effectiveness  many a time it is theoritically possible to quantify  all the parametres of the system  but the cost involved in doing so is so huge that  it is more profitable to ignore certain factors and the choice of relevant factors depends many times on personal preferences  this causes fuzziness  fuzziness of concept is an open invitation to paradoxes here are some of them  suppose we have a small heap of stones  small italics   smallness is a fuzzy concept  if we uh remove stones from heap then of course it will be a smaller heap  but even if we add a stone to a small heap it will remain small  now let us start with the heap of a single stone  which is definitely small  since addition of the stone does not affect the smallness of the heap one can go on adding a stone  one stone at a time  and still continue to get a small heap this leads to the paradoxical situation where every heap is small  another uhm paradox which i am going to state here is  bonkare paradox  we all know that real numbers are totally ordered  in this order they are so densely close to each other that  it is impossible to separate consecutive real numbers  one can easily observe that if a  and b are two real numbers however close to each other there is a number a plus b  by two that lies between them  in fact they're there are uncountably many of them lying between a and b  real numbers can be represented as points on an infinite continual uh a straight line  any two adjacent points on the con on the continuum are so indistinguishable from each other  that they almost overlap  the last universalist henry bonkare described this situation by the following formula   a is equal to b   b is equal to c  but a is not equal to c  uh an analogy of this mathematical contridiction may be  described in the following way  suppose we have a whole spectrum of different shades of colours say red anything arranged in order  of lightness of or the percentage of the redness  the change in two consecutive shades is so minute and gradual that even a trained eye can not distinguish them  if s one s two s three are three neighbouring shades then s one cannot be separated from s two nor can s two from s three   however s one can be separated from  s three  and in this sense s one is equal to  s two s two is equal to s three  but s one is not equal to s three   finally i talked of bonkare paradox  this is an ancient paradox  also know as a paradox of a lier   etimonised etimonised who himself a  cretin says that all cretin are liers  now if etimonised statement is true then being a lier himself his statement is fuzz  on the other hand if his statement is fuzz then he not being a lier may say true statement  thus the statement is true if and only if it is fuzz  these paradoxes are the results of our attempt to put in precisely expressed concepts into the rigour of aristotlian logic  the classic case of fitting a square pet in the round hole naturally there is an unbridgeable gap between the two the deductive method that we employ to derive theorems in mathematics and logic is based on the following three basic aristotlian laws   law of identity   a proposition is what it is or in symbols   s is x  the second law law of excluded middle   a proposition is either true or false x  is either y or not y    the law of contridiction  no proposition can be both true and false x  can not be y and not y   just as in a soap opera a character is all good or all bad we have in our above logic either whole truth or the whole untruth there is no room for partial truth  for this reason aristotlian logic is called two valued logic  
uh now before i go on to the way  indian writing in english got a new lease of life in the  in the in the seventees uh it it got a new lease of life by being a part of whatever you call commonwealth literature   i mean i want to talk about that a little later  but before that i want to say one or two things about  present critical responses to indian writing in english   certain trends and possibilities you see  i read a paper on this some time ago and i thought uh  some of the things that i mentioned in the paper are relevant to our  discussion in indian writing in english  uhm in this paper first i take three poles  i mean i say that we can uh uh arrange a critical responses according to the three poles that are in indian writing in english  one is related to the term indian the other is related to the term english and the third is related to the term writing  so i say let's first concentrate our attention on the pole of english and survey the area of responses centred upon it  the early british responses are to be understood i think in the context of the colonial situation that existed at that time  characterised by the master-slave relationship tempered by the teacher-student relationship of of uh liberal encouragement and patronage  you all know about the concept of the white  man's burden  the question is whether the british attitude was really  what david mccutchion thought it was that of patronising approval  and with david mccutchion who talks about indian writing in english and what the british thought of indian writing in english   he he his uh he saw he thought that uh  there is always a patronising approval there is a patronising attitude  uh we are astonished he says not that it is done well but that it is done at all  uh i'm sure david mccutchion judges his victorian eh uh compatriots like edmund gosse then m a h a l fisher  arthur symons laurence binyon and young w b yeats rather ungenerously attributing to them an attitude of superfluous  superiority  these are these were the people who talked about indian writing in english  uh uh you know edmund gosse wrote about uh uh toru dutt poetry  and he has referenced it to all these people who uh uh liked indian writing in english for one reason or another  i do not think that gosse was patting on toru dutt's  back out of uh adulterated kindness born of parental superiority  if you look at what uh gosse wrote about toru dutt he don't uh find this uh this kind of patting it is genuine criticism  now this is what gosse wrote to toru dutt literature has no honours which need have been beyond the grasp of a girl  who at the age of twenty-one and in language separated from her own  by so deep a chasm had produced so much of lasting worth  when the history of literature of our own country comes to be written there is sure to be a page in it dedicated to this fragile  exotic blossom of songs  of course i mean uh he likes her for what she has written  and also with the word that term exotic is important  that she has a place in the history of english literature  and uh he also likes her because of uh the the the exoticism that she brings in through her poetry  this surely is not a patronising approval  it is uh serious criticism expressed with certain generosity  without falsifying the truth of his judgement  now the second example that i give for such genuine kind of uh response uh without any offence of pat   patronage uh or one word is that of  yeats's appreciation of tagore's gitanjali  if you read uh i refer to this yesterday if you read uh  yeats's uh uh preface to tagore's gitanjali  we find that uh this appreciation uh of tagore his appreciation of tagore throbs with a singular sincerity of response  i quote the work of a supreme culture they yet appear as mu as much the growth of the common soil as the grass and the rushes  a whole people a whole civilization immeasurably strange to us  once again the the note of exoticism immeasurably strange to us   seems to have been taken up into this imagination and yet we were moved because of the strangeness but because we have  met our own image as though we had walked in rossetti's   willow wood or heard perhaps for the first time in literature our voice as in a dream unquote  what we had to accept is the sincerity and genuineness of critical response in tune with the literary tradition to which the critics belonged  i don't see any exaggerated and patronising praise in for example graham green's comparison of uh uh r k narayan  with chekov or herbert read's faith in shankar mokashi  punekar's poetry or milton brown's comparison of the chronicles of kedaram with main street and cranford  the tradition of enthusiastic appreciation of indian works in english by western critics they include the australian critics as well  is a continous phenomenon which has to be accounted for i think  phase-wise taking into consideration the changing context of indian writing in english  the early phase was coloured by a certain self confessed  generosity i mean we should agree  even though it is genuine there is a certain amount of self conscious generosity  and uh there was no question of misreading our indian indo-english literature since it was well within the traditions of english poetry with which they were familiar  the so called exotic element in it might have cast a little spell  but it was never blinding or binding so as to distort their critical sense  after independence indian writing in english  achieved its identity as a viable body of literature  the responses of people like graham greene william walsh e m foster and laurence durrel were seized by us with avidity  since they helped us in building up our confidence in the valley of our literature soon thanks to the rise of uh commonwealth literature  in answer to the new political and cultural needs of the erstwhile colonies of england indian writing in english  claimed a place legitimate and illegitimate at the same time legitimate because of the medium and illegitimate from the point of view of the centrality of indian experience uh obtained the place in it and it was subjected to scholarly study of western and australian commonwealth literature experts like riemenschneider  keith uh uh carelein syd harrex haydn moore williams dorothy spencer kai nicholson etcetera  this post nineteen sixty criticism is characterised by a good deal of misreading although it was based on well meaning laborous close reading  they misreading being the result of a lack of cultural inwardness  these critics trained in uh in the tradition of new criticism discover in our novelist patterns and layers of meaning not easily visible to a norman normal indian reader  now i make this uh uhm po point  with a reference to william walsh what he wrote about r k narayan and also what uh uh some australian critic wrote about  jejuri  so jejuri i mentioned yesterday today i'm going to say something that william walsh's response to r k narayan's  fiction and uh particularly you should r  read in his book commonwealth literature  his uh response to r k narayan's guide  his response is sincere and subtle no doubt but the question is  do the novels of uh r k narayan really stand this over subtle and over enthusiastic scrutiny ? but then what is historically important is the western  critic's joy of discovery which always colours their perceptions in the case of narayan's or anand's fiction the western reader finds an easy entry through ironic or realistic modes  employed in it  but it is when they encounter raja rao that they are baffled  david mccutchion for instance confesses frankly the anglo-saxon mind does not understand india very well he says with aurobindo too they experience an opacity of response walsh for instance finds aurobindo evasive  constantly escaping the grapple of the western mind and dismisses him by saying the importance of aurobindo ghosh belongs rather to the history of ideas and of religion than literature   the western critical sensibility loves irony realism concreteness conflict and rigidity of form and it gets baffled and frustrated when it faces something abstract apparently formless  spiritual and mystical  in the dialectics of critical process or to use leacis's  phrase in the collaborative effort of literary criticism this honest bafflement has a significant role to play  it leads to a healthy discussion of a literary and critical assumptions and to certain important clarifications  the bafflement of the western readers with regard to raja rao's  fiction for instance particularly serpent and the rope  and uh one word and shakespear uh for instance inspired professor narasimaih and dr na m k naik uh narasimiah and dr m k naik's excellent analyses of uh raja rao's works  what is important is the livingness of the critical process  which ultimately cannot be dis dissociated   from the process of culture or life in general  thanks to the fact that indian writing in english  is easily accessible to the western english speaking and english knowing world because of the medium the western response has grown into a tradition to such an extent that the western and australian critics can carry on their dialogue on indian writing in english without reference to indian critics at all  no other indian literature enjoys this exposure to the outside world which therefore tends to equate indian writing in english with indian literature  this has created an anomalous situation  in commonwealth studies literary conferences and festivals  it is this indian writing in english that gets  national representation  what is of relevance to the uh question we are discussing in this seminar is the fact that the western response is a positive factor  in the development of indo-english literature and criticism  with its enthusiasm its over estimation with its quest for indianness for indian philosophical and esoteric speculations for indian sociological pecularities with its bafflements and limitations  with its habits of close reading in search of deeper layers of meaning  the western response adds a new dimension to our own critical awareness which it keeps alive and kicking all the time   let's now move uh uh to the pole represented in term in the term indian  this uh of great signi significance  in the context of the critical climate that we have been talking about because it is the it is the uh centripetal movement towards the roots  as far as indian writing in english is concerned the first  uh big uh movement is to be discovered in sri aurobindo's  criticism of his own poems and his critical remarks on fellow poetic poets like tagore  then i have uh talked about aurobindo and how i mean during the pre-independence period uh he was uh a a a an indian critic very conscious of his indianess and uh he knew his western  poet and western critics uh but still he has uh great faith in the kind of uh new uh poetry that he was writing in epics like uh  savitri  uh yesterday i talked about uh this and so i don't want to repeat this  the attainment of independence was followed by a certain  uneasiness towards english and indo eng  anglian literature as it was then called  uh a certain ambivalence of attitude towards english still continues though indo-english literature gained gradual acceptance during the late fiftees and the sixtees  the rise of the commonwealth the concept of other literatures in english uh the multiplication of uh universities and university departments of english are some of the factor that changed the climate for the development of indian writing in english  yesterday also i i referred to the the uh the multiplication of university departments of english because of which  i mean the indian writing in english uh got a special place uh as far as research is concerned  the growth of the thesis industry demanded complete exploitation of the nearest and the most easily available area of research the increase in the u g c and university supported seminars  this is one of them uh conferences journals created a suitable climate for intense critical activity in the area of indian writing in english  the pioneering work of professor k r narsimh uh k r srinivas iyengar uh in this area opened new vistas of critical studies and research  first the problem of english as a creative medium was thrashed out after tremendous warfare of passions and the value of indo-english literature in the new national context of emergent indian literatures in re regional  languages was questioned and after a good deal of uh discussion it has been accepted to use professor narasimaih's words   not in a not as an exotic plant but as an expression of a distinctive sensibility which is indian 
i am extremely grateful to the executive committee of the indian association for american studies and to my fellow delegates  for electing me to preside over the twenty-seventh annual conference as the president of the i a a s i deem it my previlege to welcome you all distinguished guests from india and abroad delegates members fellow academics from the goa university ladies and gentleman to the twenty-seventh annual conference  american studies in india had a chequered growth during the last forty-five years as indo-u s relations constantly came under the clouds caused by the stresses and strains of international cold war  american studies in a systematic way leaving it mainly to the american funding uh funding agencies or the binational agencies like the  usefi and the a s r c  however indian policy makers have not thought it necessary do their own bit to promote american study  a facile reason sometimes offered for american studies not being considered as an area of study is that it does not require study of a foreign language  thus in india and america uh thus india and america are separated by common language english  hence outside the j n u i doubt whether there is any university in india which has a full fledged centre for study of america  in university of bombay for instance american studies were sought to be introduced in the early ninety-sixties  nineteen-sixties with the help of university of pennsylvania but the conventional departmental boundary was so strong  that readers recruited to study america got scattered amongst the department of history politics and literature rather than remain as one unit  but since then one person specialising on america in each department has not even grown into two contrary to parkinson's  law  this is in contrast to study of the erstwhile soviet union  what the indian americanist have offer often   encountered instead is a charge of being a c i a agent  however whenever any discussion has taken place on the question of increasing contact between the indian scholars and their american counterparts obviously on the american initiative our educational bureaucrats have not hesitated to plead that they too be included in the academic exchange programme  be that as it may i've always tried to find answers to the question why study the u s ? be its politics or history or literature or culture or civilisation  there are many reasons which could be advanced to answer the question  one vital reason is that the u s today has emerged as the only veto weilding major power in the united nation with a will power to commit its superior military strength for the collective good albeit as it sees it  to learn about the u s therefore is to remove our own ignorance  so as to enable us to make our policies more effective in achieving their goals uh their goals  such ignorance galored in our general public and policy makers including law makers  public ignorance deserves to be eliminated but its impact on our bilateral relations is indirect  but ignorance on the part of policy maker can cause avoidable harm to the friendly relations  to give one example very few of our policy makers are aware of the fact that a segmented governmental structure in the u s cannot always act or speak without cacophony  thus in nineteen eighty-three when a few legislators along with a very low level state departmental official met some sikh separatist outside the committees home the indian mp's created an uproar  alleging the u s government interference in our internal affairs  another reason is that as a developed political system  with a continous history of two hundred and sixteen years i feel that the u s can offer us some insight as to how to organise  our ever evolving political system  this is true of our literature to to some extent  most of those who have contributed a great deal to creative work in our regional language uh language literature like marathi or kannada have themselves been teachers of english or more specifically  american literature  if i do not venture to mention some names of such creative writers it is for the simple reason that i do not wish to generate  a controversy from those who are left out as well as those included in the area of comparative political systems where i can claim some expertise i wish to submit that we can search for some answers for our own political problems from the american political system and experience  there is nothing wrong if we look at the american political system for answers to our own problem  as the american political experience has given to mankind  certain unique political concepts to organise sharing of political power like federalism and presidential system  the countries of south asian region for instance look to our democratic political experience to develop their own democratic institutions  today india as an ancient society attempting to build a modern political system is facing three major challenges  first communalisation of politics second political instability  and third as a consequence of the first two challenges a threat to national unity and integrity  as india has faced many challenges in the past and somehow  managed to survive there is a false complacency that we could overcome  present challenges as well  but it is my considered opinion that we are sitting on the tip of a volcano and it might errupt anytime if corrective steps are not taken  hence before these challenges go out of control i strongly feel that we need to switch over to uh a presidential system of government tinkering with the existing parliamentary system won't help us anymore  presidential government need not be a copy of the american system but bio by borrowing essential from american system and applying modifications to suit changed times  our major political problems can be brought under control  india is a multi-regional multi- linguistic and multi-religious society  this diversity and this uh hetrogenity our founding fathers tried to hold together in a parliamentary system within a federal structure  this was imitative of the british parliamentary system as introduced by the government of india act nineteen thirty-five  this is unlike the american experience after their independence from the british colonialism americans though familiar with the british parliamentary system created a unique system of presidential government within a federal structure to hold together their hetrogenous population  the parliamentary system can function well only when there is a two party system  in a more homogenous society as in britain parliamentary system add political instability whenever the labour party face splits as in nineteen twenty-four and nineteen twenty-nine  basic problem with the parliamentary democracy in india is one of our failure to develop two or three national political parties  with the indian national congress inheriting the mantle of glory of freedom struggle the congress party enjoyed one party dominions nationally  but by nineteen sixty-seven there were clear signs that all india national congress was loosing its national character and emerging as only vote catching and power sharing device in the uh  device  in the process the congress developed a pluralistic  political majority in different states by putting together dominant caste and uh minority community based on coalitions like kham kshatriya harijans adivasis and muslims in gujrat  the system of appealing for voters selecting candidates  appointing man to executive positions on caste and communal uh  basis is the congress strategy to begin with  this was only vulgarised by v p singh in his uh effort to develop an alternative to the congress  he started with uh majgar muslims ahirs jath gurjars and uh rajputs coalitions  and later tried to expand it by adding the o b c by announcing the acceptance of uh recommendations of mandal now uh mandal commission  the b j p answered it by taking up mandir masjid issue and trying to bring together highly pluralistic hindus under their political banner  today all political parties from the left to the right are basically communal as once asserted by former justice krishna iyyer  why this communalisation of political process ? it is mainly because in the parliamentary system an m p  who aspires to lead the nation as the prime minister must command a sizable following within the party to be the leader of the legislature party  to do so indian leaders have found it easy to appeal on caste and communal basis and present themselves as protectors of one or the other section of the community instead of developing issues uh issue and programme based party  in this kind of caste and community based politics power sharing blatantly come to uh blatantly has come to be on the  bas same basis as the stunt of the caste or community in the parliament  as a result it is better to be a leader of a small party commanding loyalties on a communal basis than to the to be a part  of issue based political party  when uh too many parties get elected forming a stable government becomes difficult and a coalition or a minority government  becomes inevitable  but from the caste or communal angle a cabinet post in a coalition is assured to a caste oriented party rather than when the particular caste or community follows the national issue based party  this has tended to fragment indian political parties  thus inspite of the congress and janata dal and others wooing scheduled castes they have found it necessary to found their own party  bahujan samaj party in u p as jaths from western u p have come  out from the janata dal after it lost the power in nineteen ninety  today there are thirty-three political parties all fractions in  lo in the lok sabha  while the first lok sabha after fifty-two election  had only five political parties  in the process no political party has been able to get a rolling majority after nineteen eighty-four elections  so long this trend of appealing for votes and post on caste and communal basis continues fragmentation of political parties is bound to continue  the result of communalisation of electoral politics has been political has been uh political instability both at the states and at the centre  instability in state is not a new phenomenon but political instability at the centre is a new phenomenon particularly under the congress party dispensation  what has brought this thing at the centre ? clearly the absence of a ruling family  mrs gandhi and rajiv gandhi cough tried to maintain their individual control over the party and the government through the iron rule of political instability uh political destabilisation of individual chief ministers in the congress party ruled state whenever they showed any one word to independant action  since the end of the nehru-gandhi family rule the centre has seen political instability as well as uh as well on a day to day base  it is politics all the way  hence the government has no time to govern  if in the past non congress efforts to form the government at the centre have invariably ended in the political uh in the vertical splits in the ruling party janata party in nineteen seventy-nine and the janata dal in nineteen ninety whether the congress party can avoid it is not cleared today  in contrast to this american presidential system has been able to provide a reasonable degree of political stability  reasonable because after constitution imposed a two term  on presidential aspirants after franklin d roosevelt was elected for a fourth term  only two eisenhover and reagan where able to complete eight years in the office as against it seven presidents were in the white house for less than two terms  it still appears reasonable stability when we note that carter in his four year term dealt with three indian prime ministers  and bush in four year saw four indian prime ministers  this stability this uh stability in the american system  is based on the principle of the separation of powers between the executive and legislative branches which has made president co-ordinate and independant with congress in respect of term powers functions  and one word  president thus enjoys a fixed tenure and cannot be removed by the congress except through impeachment which is extremely difficult and rare 
 first read the abstract of the paper  titled development of grammar in animal communication systems  and in pidgins  this paper comprises three sections section one and two deal with animal communication systems and  section three with human communication systems  to study animal communication system the washoe project in which a chimpanzee learnt american sign language and the lana project in which a chimpanzee learns rudimentary language-type systems are described  the studies prove conclusively that chimpanzee separated from humans by a mere genetic whisker are unable to grasp syntax  the combination of a finite number of signs in an infinite number of new way  it separates language from other forms of communication  such as vocalisation facial expression gestures which are all paralinguistics features  specifically till date we have no evidence of any animal  spontaneously evolving true language without anybody to teach it  the only animal who does this is man  the focus in section three is on human communication systems  specifically how communication takes place among speakers of pidgin languages  theories which have been propounded to explain the origins of language are explored as the single mutation theory  the innate propensity theory the social pressure or need theory and the contact theory as they have specific relevance to pidgins a dozen examples of vendor's english  domestic's english and shipee english  subsumed under the conventional title of butler english an english pidgin spoken in india for over a century  recorded from nineteen eighty-two to nineteen ninety-two are listed they reveal modest language competence in pidgin speakers  at the levels of morphology syntax and lexico-semantics  extracts from tay boi a french pidgin spoken in vietnam are listed  similarities between it and butler english  and english pidgin can be deduced  this gives credibility to the claim that all pidgins are similar should refer to the innate propensity theory   as they are forged in condition where the premium is on transmitting facts withour frills it should refer to the social pressure or need theory and the contact theory  similarities between the chimpanzee's  rudimentary language type system and the pidgin  speaker's modest language competence have been noted and cross referenced  a common thread runs through the three sections of this paper  that language serves one basic function that of communication  at no point is it suggested that the three sections represent  a gradual progression  no doubt animal communication systems and human communication systems are different for example instinctive and interactive and innate and interactive   but they are also similar for example limited structures and innovative structures  finally the basis for any comparison of cross-species communication  is in the final analysis compassion for all forms of life  deve recording broken the paper comprises three sections section one and two deal with animal communication systems and section three with human communication system  i will concentrate only on the animal communication system  first of all what is communication?   hockett in nineteen sixty defined communication as an act by which one individual triggers the behaviour of another   s. a. altmann in nineteen sixty-seven stated that communication occurs when the behaviour of one individual  affects the behaviour of the other  although this definition is widely accepted by researchers  dealing with animal communication it suffers from generality  communicative features may be linguistic or non-linguistic  verbal or non-verbal vocal or non-vocal  verbal and non-verbal communication do not represent discontiguous processes  both are dependent upon similar complex coding and decoding cognitive processes and to the extent that these processes are comparable between species the abilities of different species to exchange information will also be similar  cognitive styles of perceiving and ordering the world are a combined function of an organism's innate neurological equipment  and his sensory-motor interactions minus emotion which is environmental surroundings  speech is a communication system superimposed on a biological process that of breathing  communication systems superimposed on two other essential biological processes are that of eating and that of sex  now here are some examples of how birds fish and mammals communicate  most of the communicative features are non-linguistic  non-verbal and non-vocal  i am going to specially talk about versatile behaviour  and intentional communication  biologists observing animals have noted that they are capable of versatile behaviour and intentional communication which lead us to the conclusion that animals can think  here are some striking examples of versatile behaviour from  the hindu nineteen ninety-eight  the galapagos finch uses specially shaped twigs to prise out grub from a hole  the green-backed heron breaks twigs into small pieces and floats them on the water  minnows that are attracted to the twigs end up as lunch  when the beaver's dam is damaged and it is forced to make emergency repairs it discards familiar techniques if they prove futile and tries novel strategies   termite's nests despite hot temperatures outside  maintain a certain level of coolness within  when two female gobi fish meet in a corner of a coral reef one of them changes into a male so that the two can mate   what's more the male fish can reverse back to a female  although not so easily  the fish opts for a sex change as a long search for a mate  puts them at the mercy of a predators   they are not good swimmers says phillip munday of the james cook university of north queensland in townsville  japanese researchers support these findings  finally wading birds migrate to new zealand after breeding in alaska a non-stop trip of eleven thousand kilometres  before they migrate they binge till upto fifty-five percent of their weight is fat  to compensate for the added weight they destroy a part of their internal organ like the kidney and the liver by up to twenty-five percent  when they land they rebuild them again  now information technology is perhaps the greatest revolution of this century  there is the internet which links people all over the world but would you believe that insects too have a similar communication system ?  just as we communicate physically and electronically insects communicate through sounds light movement and chemicals  i am going to give you some striking examples of intentional communication from the hindu in nineteen ninety-eight  in the insects communication system the chemical used as a communicators are called pheromones from greek  pherien to carry and hormaein  to excite  the quantity of pheromones used their effective distance and specificity all play an important part  for example a female sex phor   pheromone can attract the male from a distance of two miles or more  male moths fly towards the smell zone which increases as the male approaches the female  ants use these pheromones to communicate their message  as one or two ants identify the source of food they leave an invisible line of pheromones called trail marking  pheromones on the ground as they move which can be sensed by ants following  the ant is so meticulous that it chooses the highly specific  pheromone which does not evoke responses from ants of other species  thus each possesses its own language and higway code  ants produce a pheromone after their death the odour of which immediately provokes worker ant to remove the corpse from the nest some pheromones are used to warn friends of intending danger  if you disturb an insect in an anthill or a beehive the insect disturbed sents off alarm phermones which spread panic through the nest  dolphins sometimes referred to as monkeys of the sea they too communicate  they use unique signature whistles to keep in touch with others  that are out of sight says british zoologists and this is from the hindu nineteen ninety-seven  and do fish talk?  in a way they do  they tell each other how they feel by the way they wiggle and blow bubbles  fish which live at the very bottom of the ocean have a special way of communicating they glow with a bright light  some light up to startle their prey others just to say hello to each other the hindu nineteen ninety-seven  dr cyndy sims parr of michigan states that crows' long distance caws of which there are fifteen or twenty have different meaning determined by their form and rhythm  various vocalizations can mean stay out of my territory  watch out someone's after your lunch or help me get this predator out of here  she says that a string ko-ko-ko-ko-ko-ko  means neighbour you're tresspassing  in addition there are the many soft sounds crows make when talking with family members like gargles coos squawks squeals  and plaintive oo-oo's for example  squeal means teasing one another and oo-oo's   are cries of hunger from the hindu  nineteen ninety-seven  and now i'll conclude with the dance of the honeybee  for it is the dance of the honeybee that constitutes one of the most elaborate systems of communication c russell and w m s russell nineteen seventy-one  the dance was first noticed by pastor ernst spitz ner  spitzner in seventeen eighty-eight but it was left to an austrian zoologist karl von frisch to interpret the language of the honeybees  for this he was awarded the nobel prize in nineteen seventy-three  when a carniolan honeybee discovers a new source of honey  within about ten metres of the hive she returns to the hive and regurgitates drops of honey which are eagerly drunk by other bees  then she begins to dance round in a circle this is called  the round dance  during the round dance the bee runs in small circle  clockwise and anti-clock-wise alternately  the bees who watch her finds the new source of food  the round dance therefore tells other bees to search the near neighbourhood of the hive and the scent on the dancers body tells them what flowers to look for  but honeybees have been known to forage for food at distances of thirteen kilometres equivalent of thousand miles for a human being so when a honeybee finds food say between hundred metres  and hun and hun and ten kilometres she returns to the hive offers the honey she has found and performs a different kind of number called a tail wagging dance  in the case of the waggle dance the bee dances tracing a  figure of eight  like the round dance the waggle dance tells the bee that there is food available and what flowers to look for  but it also tells them exactly how far away the flowers are and in exactly what direction  the tempo of the dance conveys the distance to the food a quick step tempo indicating a relatively nearby food source and a slow foxtrot tempo a more distant one  even all this does not exhaust the language of the honeybee dances they can also vary in liveliness and total duration  they are livelier and longer the sweeter the food the easier it is gathered the better the weather  minute details have been left out such as the waggle dance making the same angle with the sun as the honeybee's flight-path did a complicated piece of geometrical calculation  but even from this brief description it can be inferred that the system of communication evolved by the honeybees is marvellous indeed thank you
