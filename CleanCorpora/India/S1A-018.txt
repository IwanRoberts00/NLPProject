""

it is heard that uh  telephone exchange  at khadaklat
has been commissioned 
""
and  the trunk dial facility  or the s t d facility has been
""
""
extended to all
""
""
extended
""
""
uhm
""
""
that uh exchange 
""
""
in fact
""
""
in how many years  this programme will continue 
""
""
uh actually sir now government is  trying to  trying
very fast  to automize all these exchanges 
""
now there are no manually  operated exchanges  left 
""
only a few exchanges say i can  uh say athani and in chikodi
they are  having manual exchange 
""
rest all exchanges are converted into auto 
""
now this  khadaklat exchange is  recently connected  i
mean  it is  uh it was made auto  before a few years 
""
but now  this is  connected with s t d facility  so that
people of khadaklat  need not depend upon nipani  telephone exchange
""
""
telephone exchange you mean
""
""
and uh nipani telephone operators  for getting their calls
""
""
number of times  uh what they find as nipani do not answer 
operators do not answer  and their calls are heavely delayed and all that
""
""
and since now it is  linked with s t ds   subscriber's
 dialing  facility 
""
uh they are much pleased  that uh they will  themselves dial
 all the numbers of nipani as well as  uh numbers of any state  
 of   of   or of any city they like 
""
""
question is about uh  the system 
""
previously it was the manual  exchange so to say 
""
""
which one
""
khadaklat
""
""
khadaklat nipani  are these  uh the small exchanges 
were uh automatic exchanges
""
""
yes sir
""
""
but the big exchanges just like nipani chikkodi  sankeshwar
 sometimes say even  uh kolhapur was also  once upon a time 
manually  di 
""
""
operated   exchange 
""
""
 operated   exchange 
""
but at this stage means i want to say that automization will not
   uhn  uh uhm what i mean to say is  harm the  society
""
""
but at the same time what about the    staff  staff
and excess staff and  other uh  facilities  that are uh needed
""
""
 uhm  
""
""
 staff  
""
""
especially  there are some  persons who require  s t
d facility    uhm 
""
and there are some who do not want the s t d facility 
""
so even though they are uh automization  still the staff is
needed 
""
""
 uhm  
""
""
yes
""
""
uhn  and here  again  there is possibility of  uh
getting  late connections 
""
sometimes  uh    no answer  no answer like that 
 one word  in what  in this connection what your are saying 
""
""
 no answer  
""
""
no sir  see when these exchanges were manually operated 
for all these years  there the supposing the  exch  there are
about three four hundred numbers in a small exchange 
""
manual operation is just possible  by one or two operators 
""
but when the numbers increased  say to to one thousand two
thousand  so a to b b to c these
""
""
no no i accept i accept your difficulties    no 
or what i mean to say is 
""
""
 no  
""
""
ahn ha ha
""
""
now automization is nice thing i accept    uhm 
but there are certain    loop holes  connect uhm complaints 
  uhm  regarding the telephone bills  for example day before
yesterday i had been  in  kolhapur telephone  bhavan 
   ah 
""
and there one person came and he complained  that his bill has
been uh 
""
""
 uhm  
""
""
 loop holes  
""
""
 uhm  
""
""
 ah  
""
""
over excess bill 
""
""
not excess
""
""
uhm
""
""
it was too much 
""
""
too much
""
""
it was about uh fifty thousand  rupees  
""
and he complained that even though suppose i started  the
subscriber trunk dialing continuously    uhm  the bill will not
   uh uh uh  will not be of uh such  uh great extent
""
""
 uhm  
""
""
 come so much  
""
""
so it is a mechanic fault i mean
""
""
 haan 
""
""
so   this connection 
""
""
 ha yes sir    there is every possibility of 
of having a mechanical fault  with a telephone meter as such
""
""
uhm exactly
""
""
 haan  you see there are clear instructions in
our  directory  uh when the automachine is made  that uh when the
subscriber establishes his call  and speaks for a minute or two minutes
 he has to disconnect and see that he does get a dial tone back 
""
so that he  comes to know that his telephone is disconnected
from s t d
""
""
s t d facility
""
  accepted  sir even though the same thing has been
   followed  properly    uhn  still your bills
are  so high  that we feel that it is better to disconnect the
telephone connection
""
""
 yes  
""
""
 done done by  
""
""
 uhn  
""
""
uh ha no doubt    uhn 
""
this is a very rare case sir
""
in that case subsriber   got   has got   every
right  to approach the    higher authority  higher authority
department  even the court  and he does get uh the  reembursement of
all that
""
""
 uhn  
""
""
 higher authority  
""
""
but on what ground do you  uh settle this case 
""
""
the grounds  you see we will test that  subscribers
meter  and if he will
""
""
at your end 
""
""
at our end
""
""
but at the same time    uhn  what i mean to say
 you may test it but in this  case or say in a particular case  you
must call that particular gentleman  who has complained
""
""
 uhn  
""
""
yes yes yes
""
""
and in    in his presence   you must check it
and you must convince him    uhm  that uh the meter it was faulty
or meter is correct like that
""
do you  have such facility
""
and do you such have these actions or
""
""
 his presence only  
""
""
 uhm  
""
""
no we don't sir 
""
in this case  we don't call the subscriber  but the
department tests the  meter of the subscriber  who has got a complaint
as such 
""
and we will in this case supposing now there are automization 
 is   is   uh recently started 
""
supposing this had started a year before 
""
in that case  we send bills every two  min  uh every two
months 
""
we will see their history of the  uh subscriber
""
""
no he says  na  he says that  we have
brought the bills  for the last two years
""
""
ha two years
""
""
and it was not more  it was not more than for three hundred
 rupees  a month  say uh for two for a period 
""
and it this time it was more than fifty thousand
""
""
ha   if if   if   that is the case
subscriber i told you  subscriber has got every right to  to complain
""
""
no no question of right over here
""
""
and now the now the redressal office complaint is like this
""
""
we will test then  meter  his number meter will be tested
 and uh 
""
""
see question is  sir  whether do you test that meter in
front of the consumer or the customer
""
that is what happens because    we  he must be  you
may say that our uh our read  no you may say that our reading is correct
""
""
 we  
""
""
uhn sir no doubt uhn
""
""
because  you do not want to  take the responsibility of
your fault 
""
""
see   we have  got to take the responsibility of
the fault
""
""
 and that is  
""
""
do you take it
""
""
see when the metre
""
""
does the department take it
""
i don't think that
""
""
see the department has to take sir 
""
  it   it   will take
""
""
just see   has to take it different and takes 
""
""
 see   there is   there is   one rule
  in the department sir
""
""
uhn
""
""
there is one rule 
""
whatever bill is  recei  received by the subscriber he has
to pay first the bill
""
""
exactly what i mean to i want to come to that uh
""
""
since    uh  since   this   this
  is an absurd bill    uhm  say of fifty thousand as
you say    uhm  which he was getting for three hundred four
hundred  rupees   or say a maximum thousand  rupees
    uhm 
""
when he receives the bill of five fifty thousand  definitely
 there is    wrong  something wrong with the meter 
""
he has got to uh he has definitely complained 
""
his complained will be  one word  to
""
""
 uh  
""
""
 uhm  
""
""
 uhm  
""
""
 uhm  
""
""
 wrong  
""
""
uhn without uh asking for the deposition  uh of that uh
amount
""
""
uhm no in this case  here as per the rules he has to 
 pay  fine
""
""
 pay  
""
""
but uh i don't think the   subscriber  
subscriber   will pay fifty thousand
""
  he has no  one or two words  
""
""
 he will not be in a   position to pay
""
""
he will be not in a position to pay 
""
perhaps he has not paid the bill    uhm  and his
complaint will be  dealt with    uhm  in  in due course
""
""
 uhm  
""
""
 uhm  
""
""
now we were talking about auto automization isn't it
""
""
uhm
""
""
 cough 
""
no doubt  this automization  has resulted in reduction of
staff 
""
there is a difficulty with us 
""
we were about  say thirty thirty-five operators in at nipani
""
""
since the automization before a year  the staff is reduced by
ten people 
""
so ten people are reduced  we are now twenty people working 
""
now this    are   is   called  uh 
sma  small    auto key  uh auto key centre
""
""
 auto key  
""
""
where each switch are connected 
""
they are also automized  and linked with s  s t d
""
""
uhm 
""
""
and  now the problem with us is  there will be no
booking of  of calls at all  by akol benkihal and  uh khadaklat 
which are   slowing   slowly   being automized 
""
and they will have to deal i mean oh  depend on the nipani 
  exchange  manual operators
""
""
 exchange  
""
""
and  it's  manual operater like
""
""
ha that difficulty is there for us 
""
no doubt people are people uh
""
""
no  just see what happens no
""
""
yeah
""
""
they say
""
""
people  see people want their facility always 
""
supposing if we get a telephone connection here  i mean the
connection  and if we can dial a numeric  number in america england 
or delhi  japan    some any any  you definitely you want all
these facilities isn't it
""
""
 some any any  
""
""
but uh you don't worry whether there is  there'll  be
 autom  i mean reduction of staff or something of like that
""
you need not bother about it 
""
the department has to bother about it 
""
the department is now thinking  the operators to absorb in some
other departments  and uh  they'll  be posted   to some 
 to some   booths  or  uhm  they'll  be taken as
clerks    in the   in the   various departments 
that is going on 
""
""
no no i am not to concern about  uh your difficult  
 of course not  i am talking of the  difficulties of the consumer
or the customer
""
""
 of course not  
""
""
  no no i  tell you uhm
""
""
 for example  
""
""
now since the  automization is made  people are really
very happy 
""
they need not book the call to nipani exchange
""
""
and wait for the call   and uh depend upon the
operators 
""
""
 wait now supposing now   the difficulty is that
 everybody supposing  subscriber's  at khadaklat  they dial each
other   they'll  be getting engage to each other
""
  they will   they will   keep mum  for a
certain while  so the only facility is  they will dial once again 
""
they will dial try twice thrice four times
""
then they will get each other 
""
they will  you see get the connection  they feel very happy
""
""
they are really very happy no doubt 
""
now  uh definitely as i say  that subscribers are
""
""
what i mean to say
""
""
ha
""
""
so those who have got  there are two  ch  uhm i
have two categories in my mind
""
""
yeah yeah
""
""
one  those who are subscribers of that is one   
uhm  with s t d facility
""
""
 uhm  
""
""
uhm
""
""
those  who have who have got the connections  without
subscribers  uh uh    s t d  s t d
""
""
 s t d  
""
""
without  s t d's   there're  some pople are 
  uh  see s t d  is a subscriber dialing  uh facility
""
""
 uh  
""
""
ha
""
""
you have got a telephone at home
""
""
uhm
""
""
when you are out somebody your children or wife or somebody
   yeah yeah   they'll  dial the number
""
they go on speaking
""
ladies if this start speaking no
""
""
 yeah yeah  
""
""
yeah they don't know  uhm the technique of  using the s
t d
""
""
i see i see  because it is to be used by second to second
 cough 
""
s t d is a facility  generally useful for the subscribers 
who can  uh minimise their conversation for a minute or so say  thirty
seconds even forty seconds  or a minute also  and stop it
""
so that  previously they were taking the paying say twenty-five
 rupees  for a bombay call 
""
if they finish up you say when  twenty-five thirty seconds 
it is just possible even to speak during thirty seconds forty seconds 
""
they get it    within two thousand 
""
""
 no i i know this   i know this    ha ha
 uh procedure
""
""
 ha ha  
""
""
question is  those who do not want that s t d facility
""
""
uh they have to come and book the call
""
""
  isn't that isn't that  and here again the manual
labour    uhn  comes into  uhm    focus 
picture  in the picture uhm
""
""
 ha uh uh  
""
""
 uhn  
""
""
 focus  
""
""
and uh same difficulty will be faced by that subscriber
