and another thing i would like to know the wealth which have been not properly or defeated whether they are able to plan any  new systems that will enable to increase the fertility in order to increase the requirements of the crude in this country  the honourable minister has made a statement saying within three years they have increased to upto sixty percent of the last   pre previous production  and i would like to know how you will able to achieve that results  and if you can be able to give some information i would be happy  the security clearance is required for opening up uh  the areas before that uh we have to get the security uh clearance required and normally after we get the security clearance those areas are opened up for either explanation or production  specially where they are outside investors foreign companies involved  uh the second part of the question uh uh on what steps are being taken to enhance the production  sir there are various steps which are being undertaken right from bombay high which is the largest field there is a what you call the e o r uh enhance oil recovery uh proposal which is being evaluated there are five companies who have uh bid for this proposal  which will improve our production from the bombay high that is being considered because there will be substantial improvement from the existing  besides that also of other fields we are looking at uh geo-techniques and other technology to come in  like the horizontal drilling in all other method to see how we can augment the all production  and as far as the third third part of the question is concerned the sixty percent production rise  yes sir they are very much in place  this year the production is going up by five million tonnes  that means from the lower of twenty-seven millions last year  this year the production goes upto thirty-two next year thirty-eight and in the year ninety-seven i am glad to inform the house the oil production in the country will go upto forty-four point five sir   that's what the situation is  speaker sir as per the eighth plan what the honourable minister says it should go upto forty-four point four five million  and if we achieve those it will be happy  but whether they are going to do all the things within our own country or in the boundaries of surrounding countries also where it is possible ? whether the o n g c's make any new survey in andra pradesh tamil nadu kerala and gujarat for new areas for new development ? whether they are able to make in order to as   requirements are going up by two thousand years what is the total demand ? how much we have to import ? how much you can produce within the country ? and other important item is the driving technicians which is required in this country are terribly shortage and we are depending more from outside  whether we will have a training school that we can develop them within the country i would like to know from the honourable minister ? sir the strategy for oil explosion explosion in production is to get india its share in the global oil that means india must have its equity in the global oil  hence we are looking for oil within the country and outside the country  we are going to be exploring and getting trying to explore opportunities for producing oil outside  vietnam is the classical example where o n g c videsh  started looking for oil in the vietnam borders  and i am glad to inform the honourable members that in vietnam we have found gas natural gas the commercial study is right now under way  similarly we have taken a block in egypt  we are negotiating with yemen  and there are various other places we are seeing besides looking for oil and gas within the country  so that we don't miss the bus  all this company this is a global phenomenon  you look at all the majors whether it is british petroleum  british gas all the major one word in the world  they are not only looking in their territory they are also looking globally  so the idea is india should be self-sufficient in oil and gas in the quickest quickest possible time frame and that is the strategy we are following  regarding the survey in andra pradesh other areas has not made any reply sir thank you very much  v k bhat  a new o n g c has found a struck a new biggest field in terambulam village in the ramnagaram district of south southern tamil nadu  if so will the ministry beg the o n g c to drill more wells so that the gas field could be consolidated sir sir i would like to convey to the honourable members in the house that wherever and whenever we find presence of hydrocarbon  whether it is in the form of gas or crude the logical next step is  more wells are drilled to de-alianate the fields to find out what is the quantity of the gas and oil which is there so that process definitely wherever it happens it is  automatically that project is taken up more wells are drilled only then we come to a conclusion as to what is the size of the reservoir what is the size of the one word reserves we have so that will be worked again a few words  sir is this a fact that terambulam has been has been cut short mr rao please  mr speaker sir though taking the involving the foreign companies in the oil exploratiion is unavoidable to some extent i would like to know from the honourable minister in view of the fact that o n g c have invested and spend thousands of crores  of rupees and after great great deal of efforts  after very long years some oil fields and gas fields have been identified my question to the honourable minister is why not the government of india his ministry to allocate new fields which are not yet explored to the foreign companies and take up oil exploration and drilling operations by o n g c and our indian oil companies ? various companies are there and by giving issuing shares to the public and raising one word into the ratio in the ratio of one is to four definitely the o n g c and other oil companies  will be in a position to explore the oil which has been formed with our efforts and kindly one word why not the government reconsider its special policy offer giving on platter to this m l c's the precious oil resources and confine only to the new fields which are yet unexplored i would like to have a categorical answer from the honourable minister  sir i think the honourable member is referring to the discovered oil fields which were found out to the indian and international companies in the past  sir i would like to convey to the honourable member  that when this decision was taken which was in ninety-two our foreign exchange reserves our foreign exchange the resource crunch was so severe  that we had some of these fields which we had found which we had discovered ten to twelve years ago so for years they were lying dormant oil was in place but they were not being exploited because of the resource crunch on one hand and the other that o n g c was fully committed with whatever funds and  one word it had for other which they considered more important projects  so to bring the oil on stream in the earliest possible time frame because of the severe oil crunch with which   the country was facing to save the foreign exchange on the import bill we decided to give some of these fields after ensuring that ( a) o n g c is  one word to the partner to the extent of forty percent ( b) that we get the right technology that the production costs are lower than even what o n g c uh would have spent so after taking all these factors into consideration we negotiated in the best interest of o n g c and country sir  but we have to purchase at international market prices  it still comes to uh commercially speaking uh to give an idea a uh that for a given field where the o n g c is a partner like the panno mukhta tapti rava the kind of investments which were required then or even now when they start operating the fields is over a billion dollars and what are we giving them  we are giving them in a range of only ten percent to eighteen percent that they return the rest ninety percent in some cases a little less than  the other cases is all coming back to the company in the country so it is in the best interest sir india is not the only country which is doing it this is being done as a regular programme in argentina in russia in china all over   it's a part of the thing to attract these companies who will get into this crude oil fields and then going to as you are saying the future exploration project and it has already happened  some of these companies like enron and kaman petroleum and indian companies like videocon or uh uh the reliance they have moved now from the discovered all these programmes and they are investing into exploration which is the key area reserve exploration is the biggest challenge from within the country we have to have domestic company we have to have international companies  this the discovered oil fields is very limited its only five percent of the total reserve  what is more important is to get this investment into extension area so that we can find new oil for the country another bombay high reserve efficience goes up that's  the biggest challenge for the country and this will bring bring about this mr shahabuddin  mr speaker sir in his reply the honourable minister  has referred to fourteen fields  now if i recall sir in the seven international rounds of bids that we had offered i believe that around fifty or sixty  different blocks or fields are involved  now i would like to know from the honourable minister the reason for the delay in response in respect of the large number of blocks that we had offered ? and for this the minister has not told anything  and secondly i would like to know he has said that the first five fields are going under a production sharing uh contract  but about the other eight more small fields he has not mentioned the type of contract  so i would like to know whether that is also in the nature of production sharing agreement or not merely a service contract  so first is the un the fields that we have offered to which we have received no response and the reason therefore  and then these fields that have been now put under contract are going to come on a stream  sir the honourable member referred to the fifth fifth round and the sixth round that was the continuous continuous round of bidding for explanation  the subject matter which is being discussed right now does not relate to explanation is mainly focused on discovered oil fields  as far as the other the second part of the question which refers to the small fields and the type of contract we have got into  for the small fields unlike the discovered oil fields where i said that the discovered oil oil fields five fields the investment is over a billion dollars  here the small fields are so small that they are actually not economically viable for a company like o n g c and one word to handle that's why they were bound out and we have gujarat uh uh  government company public sector company and some other companies which have got to gather on their own  in these small fields unlike the medium size fields  here there is no joint sharing these are very small uh the risk will be taken uh by those companies who will be producing the small amounts of gas and uh uh crude wherever it is in the small small one word  see it's not a joint venture unlike the medium  size fields which are mention which are joint ventures where o n g c and the other companies are partners
