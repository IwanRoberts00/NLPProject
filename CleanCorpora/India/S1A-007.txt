""
could you tell us some recipes that we can learn it ?
""
""
aha 
""
""
recipe is simple thing is i  mostly i stress upon  uh
boiled vegetables
""
i think you won't like   to take it 
""
""
 no  i'm  not    boiled vegetables
""
when  i'm  all by myself i had to do that cooking so 
that's  the best thing i suppose 
""
""
so uh  we prefer more on  makke ki roti  and
 sarson ka sag   laughter 
""
""
 sarson ka sag 
""
yeah it should be very much  sarson ka sag  
""
""
 i'm  very fond of it 
""
just  uh this what you call that  leaves and you know all 
  mustard leaves  that mustard leaves
""
""
 mustard leaves  
""
""
we  first of all we wash it  then we cut and uh 
""
""
into small
""
""
into small pieces very small pieces 
""
and then at least in my house like we have got a  choola
 
""
 we've  got a  uhm  angeethi  what you
call
""
""
yes
""
""
so in that there is uh  earthen pot  and in that we put
""
in the morning we  ca  we  i mean we put some water in it
and in the afternoon it becomes very much well mashed up  well prepared
""
then we put all those  coriander and something  uh  
 tomato  tomato and everything all the  masalas  we put
""
""
it becomes very tasty
""
""
 tomato  
""
""
but the main thing is we stress upon butter and  desi
ghee  
""
""
 desi ghee 
""
do you add a bit of flour later ?
""
""
yeah 
""
""
you keep some  basen  of
""
""
no  haan  we put some  basen 
""
""
 basen  and that makes it much tasty
""
""
tasty 
""
""
tasty to have to eat
""
tasty that in many punjabi family staying near we get it
""
but then somehow i can't prepare it
""
 it's  the burning as per the initials
""
""
even you can't do it in a pressure cooker ?
""
""
no we can do it in a pressure cooker
""
""
but it won't be that tasty 
""
""
actually that family  it's  my family is traditional
""
""
so  i've  got my old grandmother and making for us you know
""
""
so like if we have to make  we'll  naturally prefer a 
 pressure cooker 
""
""
 pressure cooker   you boil the  saag
 ?
""
""
yeah we boil the  saag  
""
""
then you fry it 
""
""
uh not nothing to fry  just to put  desi ghee
 and all those
""
""
after that cook it for some time
""
""
 haan  onion  we  pre  make it red
""
""
then put some  haldi  powder and some little bit of
chilli  as per the taste 
""
then we put that masala into the mustard 
""
""
you put tomatoes also in it ?
""
""
 haan  tomatoes also 
""
it gives taste  even tomatoes
""
""
but what you like eating ?
""
""
 it's  uh i mean fish  laughter 
""
 we'll  have it in uh i mean  it's  a kind of
essential for   both the lunch and uh 
""
""
 yes  that's  it is you feel like uh  
""
""
lunch and dinner   you take 
""
""
 yeah   both even the  chapatis 
when  we've  got
""
""
 accha 
""
""
fried fish 
""
""
fried fish 
""
so we have fish we have to have it
""
""
uhm
""
""
plenty of fish
""
""
plenty of fish
""
if we don't eat fish we feel very   we haven't eaten any
thing 
""
""
 we haven't eaten any thing   
""
""
and you know it  price is not the thing  you know it
can go upto seventy eighty a kg and even then  you've  it 
""
on every occasion you have to have fish 
""
how do you  you have  kaliya 
""
""
 kaliya  i mean   it's  a very tasty
fish
""
""
you put some curd also making a fish ?
""
""
yes
""
""
curd and cream also
""
""
yes sometimes 
""
that depends upon the  dish  you're  preparing
""
""
yeah 
""
if you want to make a fried fish  what you do
""
""
you just   fry it  
""
""
 fry it   in mustard oil
""
""
mustard oil
""
we use mustard oil for  fish preparation i mean even the newer
generation which is using uh refined oil  uhm it uses mustard oil for the
 fish preparation
""
""
you can use refined oil for whatever 
""
""
yes you know refined you know  postman  or
 saffola  whatever you use its of no use 
""
no
""
""
  it won't allow the taste to come through 
""
""
 it won't allow the taste to come through  
""
""
the taste it is very flavour but they say  you've  lot
of cholestrol there 
""
""
  mustard oil 
""
""
 mustard oil  
""
""
but fish in itself doesn't contain as much as cholestrol as a
egg or meat 
""
""
and i think you must be frying in  uh this iron 
kadai 
""
""
yeah  kadai  yes
""
""
iron one or
""
""
iron one  hi 
""
""
or the brass ?
""
""
better  iron one is better because it doesn't stick to the
""
""
stick to it
""
""
and those  uh non stick things if you don't have because
""
""
they don't have a rounded base
""
""
 na     they're   shal 
shallow base  
""
so there should be plenty of
""
""
 so that uh  
""
""
then uh then you just fry it and then what you do ?
""
""
first we  i mean wash cut and wash the fishes and then we
put some uh salt and  haldi     uhm  in it 
and leave it to marinate say for about  five or ten minutes   
uhm  and then we fry it  deep fry it more or less in oil
""
""
 uhm  
""
""
 uhm  
""
""
and i mean the most common preparation is with  uh
grounded mustard 
""
we fry the fish  and then we grind the mustard  put 
haldi   water and green chillies  and put into the 
kadai    along with the fish   and salt to taste  and
 that's  all
""
""
  one word   
""
""
i mean that is the easiest way
""
and you can even steam it
""
""
steam it with the ingredients
""
""
 hilsa 
""
""
 hilsa  you do it
""
 it's  like you put in if you don't  you know you can
put in the pressure if you want it separated and get 
""
""
 it's  all means you don't cook the heat or just
""
because the  hilsa  itself is a very i mean easily
cooked fish 
""
and i mean we prefer sweet water fish to  sea fish
""
""
sea fish
""
""
yes we don't eat the sea fish 
""
 it's  only occasionally   when it comes  in the
market
""
""
 occasionally  
""
""
especially in winter 
""
that too we go for prawns
""
""
prawns
""
""
 haan  you get the prawns
""
""
don't like prawns 
""
""
no  laughs 
""
 i've  never  seen anybody taking that in my family 
""
""
yes of course  you know people they when they talk of
prawns you know when
""
""
see you know we people are so considerate that we take
 alu ke parathe  and  gobi ke parathe  and
 sarso ka saag makke ki roti   we're  much more
concentrated on these type of foods you know 
""
regarding non-veg we take that meat and    chicken 
and all that 
""
but atleast i don't take
""
""
  biryani   
""
""
have you tried uh  taking fish in uh
""
""
in the oven ?
""
""
yeah
""
""
no i haven't
""
have you ?
""
""
yes  uh i prefer it more you know that means you have to
have less  of oil
""
""
any fish ?
""
""
any fish
""
no we get this you know
""
i don't know what you call it this side 
""
 we've  the names of uh supposed to call  what do you
call it
""
""
uh no
""
we have we call it semi  putthi  and we have
different     putthi   semi  putthi
 and  it's  very sweet
""
""
  putthi   
""
""
  semi  means sugar  and then  we just
marinate it with lemon or something and all
""
keep it for sometime then i usually make a sauce 
""
""
 yeah  
""
""
sauce ?
""
""
maybe a cheese sauce  and get into a egg  white sauce
with egg 
""
and you don't need to do it
""
sometimes i just  just  fry a bit slightly and then  put
you know  i just put into a tomato sauce and onion then   ginger and
garlic  and big chillies or capsicum whatever  you've  
""
then you just give a topping  you give uh cheese 
""
""
 ginger and garlic  
""
""
so that cheese melts and    one word  
""
""
  i've  uh   actually  i've  got
this  griller also in my gas  stove 
""
so  the easiest way you put it inside and then you are studying
you don't have to fry it it takes time then i make the  fish uh  one or
two words 
""
press inside the fish cut it from  one word
