uh yeah talk about this uh marriage and uh celibacy that means uh celibacy  he's not exactly laughter  you might not be you might not be married and you may not to be a celibacy  yeah yeah forget that thing what i mean is uh there is no pleasure without married life is it ? very good you are the one exception you are the only one oh sir i didn't one word  there are difficulties and uh problems start only when you   uh get married  problems  no i think uh we have some one else to take care of  when we have children one word children to take care of there are lots of problems but yet  uhm wonderful married life you've got uh precious but i feel but uh yes yes i think people after getting married giving birth to children i'm going to school this thing that thing so many problems  because  so many problems and then so many expenses the problems are there but also there are pleasures in the married life in the family life whereas in celibacy you don't get pleasures  that you can remain  i feel free now   without problems uh i i feel free now you may have got uh problems i am not tied i am free yes no problems   i think there is uh this there is the pleasure in sharing in life sharing it with some one else companion i am sharing my thoughts ideas with you yeah and when you get married  you come into a close relations and uh connections with so many uh relations of uh on your side on your wife's  side   from wife's side  so many people coming to contact with you  and you face a  lot of problems in the list of problems you get joy  but i don't know but i think sir it all depends on how your wife is  suppose you get a okay understanding wife is okay but suppose you get a different kind of wife a nagging wife from the some one who just can't adjust with you yeah then marriage is not the then even you will be segregated from the society you relatives as well as uh friends  always you must be  you might be lucky sir you must be optimistic oh yes yes yes you should not think that you will get a nagging and uh obsessive uh such kind of wife you get you should not think next thing  people say that must you get me educated ladies atleast a graduate or post graduate what is there in it all are woman  no graduation post graduation or it's all goes to help someone who can understand us who can vibe with us  for example okay we have done our ma and all that suppose we do get married with someone who is not having any education  there is a total difference between us so you may not exactly have a better a good understanding my my father is an ma my mother did not see she couldn't write at all  they adjusted they had a very good life that is the matter that's what even my wife  uh she is not a graduate   uh you what what your she is not a graduate  see the harmony of uh marriage uh or married life uh is not in education or not in other things  or one word money or uh it uh depends on the understanding between that is likes and dislikes  both of them are seperate one or two words  i think we stop talking about marriage  there are two unmarried people laughter  you are the one married a few words  you may not uh think that uh only the educated and uh  people who are working or earning are highly educated  they alone can uh live happily otherwise all others  but on the other hand my both brother and my sister-in-law are both are educated  they have problem even now everyday quarrel fight what to do  it's all wife thinks a few words educated as so why should i  yeah how many in your uh how many members in your family are uh post graduate ?
