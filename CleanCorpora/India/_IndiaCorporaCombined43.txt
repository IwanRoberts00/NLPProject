laughter and how is your aunty who got married uh in the summer uh okay where is she staying  mangalore  mangalore only yeah  is she doing something there  no just a house-wife   house-wife so that's it  aunty you do craft  no not craft as such i do stitching work all these you did it no these things have been done my father-in-law oh  he is a great artist  you don't know anything about craft aunty  craft i don't know much  because i wanted to learn something uh which you know  i know stitching i do uhm stitching of clothes  so if you are interested in that i can teach you basic what's the basic in stitching aunty first what should we learn like anything  you should start from the smaller clothes  uhm that's the easiest way  and the clothes in which uh there is not much of cutting  because cutting the things is uh very important  if you cut them nicely naturally the stitching will be nice the dress will come out nicely  so you should choose the clothes which are uh easy to cut so first you should choose the smaller one like dress of a baby which is easier  and then only you can graduate to uh complicated dresses  and i think that uh saree blouse is  most complicated thing  oh laughter  and uh how do you pass time like only stitching aunty you don't have any other uh no passtime like  no  household work is there stitching is there   hobby what's your hobby  stitching and teaching laughter  i have heard that you have that stitching with the like  like electric current you use current for stitching yeah  how how is it   yeah   there's a small motor  uh it is attatched to the machine itself  and with the help of a belt that uh wheel of the machine the balance wheel of the machine that rotates with the help of that motor so whenever the current is there we can use this  but in bangalore it's just   you can take it out when there is no current and you can use it like that yeah yeah yeah   it's easy to take out  just that belt has to be removed  and when that belt is removed you can just put on that uh other belt which is used for the paddle style running  like for ordinary machine only you have attatched the mo  motor  yes oh it's ordinary machine earlier it i was using it on pedestal only  but uh after three four years i attached the motor to it so i can use it both way  there is no difficulty in using it  and whenever current is there it becomes very easy  oh  yeah because  using it on the pedestal puts a lot of pressure on uh feet  do you want to learn stitching  yes but i am very interested but uh how yeah at present you won't be able at present i won't be able but next year after my exams i think i want to learn stitching laughter so i was  and then craft uh  yeah craft i was taught many things in school  but now we don't have yeah sapna my younger sister she is interested and she does all things  but uh in t v i can't adjust with them and i can learn things from because i wanted uhm  no i want to do it with them like they are too fast   oh i can't keep it everything in my   oh   yeah they keep everything half ready  yeah and then only they start showing it  yeah   and then  i want it uh actions like yeah face to face  yeah  but then if atleast you can take down the things on paper and uhm then try doing them yeah i can but i am used to teach like like i was taught in the school  yeah doing the things of handcraft is really a nice thing you know you can pass time time  you're doing something creative  creativity is also important  then what other things you want to do   that's all not not much  but craft was my main and i liked it so much because in the school one word  are you intersted in drawing also no laughter  then who has put on this mehndi  this my younger sister yesterday oh for the festival no simply we had  i was uh arranging my cupboard things and all and i found a packet of mehndi over there and so   uhm uhm  its nice  did she learn it somewhere or no just  on her own she's doing yeah on her on own  yesterday only the first time she  yeah its a nice i was very scared to give it like to tell her to do because if it won't look nice if it if she does wrong  and then uh did you put it on in the evening  yeah about at i seven-thirty eight  uhm  and i removed it in the morning   haan that's why the colour has come out so nicely yeah or else that was an old stock one can it was usually the old stock doesn't give the proper colour yeah  if you are interested in mehndi my   yeah one of my friends mehndi class  yeah one of my friends is expert in putting on mehndi   yeah   mehndi class  yeah i want to learn to put it to others  yeah she is expert and she stays nearby only  so you can go and learn it from her yeah i am interested to put but i don't like it putting myself sister wanted to try
