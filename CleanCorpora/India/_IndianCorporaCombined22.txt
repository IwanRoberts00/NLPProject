oh uh i am very happy to have met you rather  yeah  uh uh i uh can't spell it a kind of pleasant occasion yeah surely it's a equally a pleasure for me  that i met you oh thank you very much sir  uh so it's uh i can say a few words about an institute where i have been  yeah please let me know something about the institute  where you worked   uh yeah yeah uh that's what i understand that people i was under the impression that uh almost for the educated people are aware of birla institute of technology  i'm one word as it's quite reputed one  yeah  you are right  but i understand some of our participants who have been here are not uh as much aware of the institution as i expected  rather well for myself atleast i i'm  ah accha thank you yeah uh it's in fact a kind of unique institute  in the sense i say that uh it in fact uh motivates the students  in such a way that they become quite uh uh what what  should i say is acquiring a sort of managerial quality  with which they are able to sell themselves that are in the market   field uh uh  yeah  now-a-days the sad story about other universities and uh higher education institutes is that the products uh do not come out very well equipped  and they flood the market there are no job opportunities for them yeah yeah but uh products who come out of your institute  yeah are really absorbed  yeah  yeah sure  and uh for yeah quality goods there is always a demand yeah one should say   yeah   yeah  yeah sure  and more over they take a kind of uh national cream i must say  and uh half of the credit goes to rather saying that the institute is able to provide something to such an extent that each brings that there i must say uh they've become quite fit to the society but basically they are brilliant students when they come to the institute because uh they input i would say that are really brilliant uh they score above ninety-three percent  based on their merit they get into the institute yeah  uh  yeah  uh it's not only that uh the best students come to this institute yeah they are also given the best kind of training yeah that's there  yeah uh but the best kind of uh  i wish i wish there were more institutions of this type yeah  uh in the country yeah unfortunately there are only just one or two here   yeah to be counted on finger's end like an island  yeah  yeah laughter  you know sea of mediocrity  you know it's good that though the institute has been in rajasthan uh i would say that it it's in fact a kind of oasis  yeah oasis  uh i was quite surprised to see how in that uh desert atmosphere uh uh g d birla was able to establish such a great institute  uh which in fact has become popular at the international level rather yeah  and moreover i understand when our students uh come to the third level which we say third year rather when they come to the third year their attention is mainly towards preparing for gre  and get out of this country  uhm that's rather unfortunate yeah because we spend so much on them and the best mind  the best talent the best energies of the country flow out of it   yeah   it's a pity that india doesn't get the benefit out of these uh the best minds the  yeah  one way we have to accept this also this india is not able to provide better opportunity uh to their expectations rather  so and i am very happy still the students uh foreign united states of america uh they are quite uh grateful to the institute  uh the what to say is to their almamater  and they come forward voluntarily to see that the institute  still further developes  and uh i understand a few students have given a sort of a statement to the authorities that uh they are collecting some amount  which would in fact uh update the computer centre  uh its quite uh remarkable approach on their part i feel  uhm i wish not only would such an institute be updated  but more such institutes were uh started in other parts of the country  so that uh all the regions stand to benefit  yeah and the country as a whole yeah uh progresses  yeah  yeah  but in that sense i say that i see in pilani  i must say all the states a country a country in pilani i could see uh uh national integration rather yeah yeah uh i could experience yeah  and moreover the students are highly disciplined i must say  i was told by then i wasn't there  but even at the time of the mandal commissions i i could understand that all over the country the students were on strike  but uh that was the only institute which was functioning where there was no disturbances no not at all very kind ah not at all  very kind  and uh the students you know because they are much  uh motivated uh towards getting trained with which they will be able to get into better industries  and one more good thing i would like to say about our institute is  we have a practice school system uhm uh with which in fact they're able to give the better training to the students and they are able to expose their better products to the country rather i would say i see  uh  haan  see we have a practice school system in such a sense  uh a practice school training running of about four months at the end of the second year uhn  and uh they got to go to they have to go to different industries where the students are expected to go and do some industrial training but this does not mean that they can go alone and do away with some work and get and report that they have done the report that they have done some industrial training or something it's  not  when they send the students they are sending the faculty members also to look after   uhn  uhm  uh this programme is going on for about in eighty centres all over the country  eighty centres eighty centres are there  eighty centres  and we have practice school too running of about six months  and i understand there are for about thirty faculty members  are staying outside to look after the students i see  all the care for the students in a way and looked to their  academic upbringing in all possible ways so that uh they turn up to their best uh lot the best products of the educational system that uh exist in the country  no i would say that uh in fact the system of education uh that's there in this pilani i would say that it is quite application oriented oh i see uh how it would be quiet useful to give a kind of life skill for a student but elsewhere we don't have this application approach at all yeah  it's only a theoritical approach and most of the students who come out of these institutes have only a theoritical background and in the practical world yeah they are not much of a success  yeah   yeah  yeah you take for example uh i belong to the department of english we have ma honours in english  but when i say that we have ma honours in english it doesn't mean that the subjects taught are purely confined to only the literature field  oh see for about first two years the respective of any disciplines they are exposed to common these common subjects  uh a student who is admitted in ma honours in english he will be exposed to thermodynamics i see will be exposed to computer science   he'll be exposed to physics uh and chemistry  i see   uh  uh so irrespective of any discipline a student who is admitted in uh computer science will be doing the same course of the student who has who has who has been admitted into  ma honours in english oh i see  so they are exposed to compulsory disciplinary course we call it cdc only when they come to the third year  ah right again it is a sort of interdiscipline  again  interdisciplinary that's why they call it first integrated degree ah  one cannot uh i should say one should be  should be happy to see such an institution having been developed in some part of the country if not in our own part near our home  and uh i should compliment you on oh being on the staff of such an institute  laughter  thank you sir uh it is not everybody's lot to be  yeah in that sense a part of such an institution yeah i'm really happy though i'm quite away from my home town  i am very happy that i am working in an institute which is known for an academic excellence yeah and the students are very bright so we have got a kind of job satisfaction that's there,, uh uh though there are a kind of advantages and disadvantages  as far as my personal point of view is concerned  but as an academician i am really happy yeah we have such an ethos yeah uh ethos and academic excellence exist one really feels one is previleged to get in there apart from uh job satisfaction  there  yeah  though i was not uh as happy as i am now now i consider it as a kind of blessings in disguise yeah really yeah one should  yeah  yeah when i left madurai where i had been working uh i in fact was not at all uh willing to go to such a place which is quite a far off from my place yeah but now i don't have that uh feeling what should i call sense a hallucination uh i'm not i'm  not at all suffering from that   uh  uhm you are all saint of the country so to say laughter and uh one more thing i would say that uh students have been in bits pilani are uh quite more in number from south rather i see oh that's uh yeah rather strange  yeah  yeah that i would say is truely beecause uh the admission takes place is done merit  i am very happy to say that there is not even a single seat  for the chairman of the institute oh  it's really remarkable  yeah  uh uh they don't interfere in the admission process  and even if the vice-chancellor's son gets  point point point one percent less than the percentage that is fixed that is the set marks for the admission as for as that particular year is concenred he also has to be out  oh that's really remarkable  we don't see this kind of a thing elsewhere  see everywhere else in the country people in position's  of power and authority try to manoeuvre yeah the the admissions uh even the academic grades that are given  sometimes the professor's son or daughter himself or herself get the gold medal though they might have not even  ordinarily got a second class let alone a first class  so we have heard many such stories from elsewhere  but in at pilani such a thing a really exists one should be happy as well as proud uhm also of such an ideally ideal institution  uhm also  also it's quite a known for cultural festivals they celebrate a festival called oasis  which is once in a year  and the students are given enormous freedom and they collect the funds from different sources i mean many firms are sponsoring  and they are able to uh going out the function called  oasis in such a manner that it is uh uh what to say uh known and famous at the national level  what one or two words uh i mean the management of the institute is allowed to keep for the best available in the country to their students to their alumni  they do not spare any kind of effort  of course the these cultural festivals are organised by students themselves by students themselves  yes it's they who collect the fund  it's they who collect fund organise  it's they who collect fund  no doubt about that all should give a kind of better training for the students this is what i should say and uh moreover sir uh though the students are prepare to soil their hands anywhere it's not the case with supposing somebody gives the training in the name of mba graduates or whatever we also have got a degree programme called mms  and the students who come out with a degree mms i understand that there is a report that has been received uh from different firms  that the students of bits pilani specially mms candidates they are prepared to soil their hands  they are prepared to do any kind of work it is not that they demand ac room they will be sitting only in the ac room they will be able to only manage the sub-staff it is not the quality  if the situation warrants they are prepared to do any sort of work or they are prepared to go the field  yes it is that kind of uh service motivation yeah and uh committment to work that we should instill in our students  instead what we are producing these days is uh  brown sahibs  those who want to be uh in offices which are air conditioned those who do not want to soil their hands  those who want to think themselves the upper crust of society  born they heavenly born one word so to say yeah to rule the country  to rule over others  and this is unfortunate
