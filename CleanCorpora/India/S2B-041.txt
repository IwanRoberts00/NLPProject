professor jahagirdar   sound of bell  has been
extremely kind  to me  i can thank him  without  deserving
 for my work 
""
my friend ashok  has given me the right treatment 
""
uh before you  start your  day's  work in the morning
 you have to catch your  oxen  and then you must  put the
 ropes  through their nose  and then  get on with the  day's
 jobs 
""
which he has done for me   cough 
""
the other  reason why i feel i do not deserve  to be standing
here and giving a public lecture  is  quite obvious   clearing
his throat 
""
as you can see  the lecture is not meant for people like me 
uhm  i can't keep my papers on and then read  uh is meant for people
who are  normal   clearing his throat 
""
i am somewhat  different  from normal  but  i'll 
do  what i think  needs to be done  because the subject on which i
wish to speak  has become  if not here  in many other places in the
country  and  awfully important question 
""
as you have come here  uh uh  forsaking your lunch hour  i
will not take more time  to  uh  tell you how i do not deserve to
be here but get on with it now that i am  here 
""
dear  panel  students 
""
by way of introduction to my talk today  i must explain two 
ground  facts 
""
one which is pervasive  throughout non-metropolitant  india
""
""
the other which is threatening to change  the foundation  of
english teaching  or rather  to do  kar seva   with
it  that is to say to destroy it  completely  in itself may not be
a bad thing at all
""
i don't mind if english is destroyed  the worst thing that will
happen is  i'll  lose my job 
""
i think i can find another one  somewhere 
""
the first uh let me say that my talk does not concerned university
level study  alone  but also the basic levels  of english teaching
 and learning at the high school  junior college  and college level
 as well 
""
now what are these two threats  that i spoke of 
""
the first one comes  from the non-  teaching of the english
""
""
school and college teachers  generally  and even some
university teachers  actually  do not  teach english 
""
what is that they do can be given  other names 
""
but instead  the students don't learn english 
""
i shall mention only one  perhaps the central reason  that
they do not  know  english 
""
anyhow the result is  that they begin to justify  and
rationalize  their failure  by arguing that we really do not know
english 
""
english  that it is a hang over from the colonial  british
raj  that we must  really  attend to our regional language  or
mother tongue 
""
now these are destruction tactics  because those who wish to
honour their  mother tongue  have always learnt it  under any
circumstances 
""
more of that  a little later 
""
the second threat  more recent  powerful because its
exponents  have generally have the advantage of english medium  urban
education 
""
and also  because their arguments come  from abroad  in
very sophisticated  and precise words 
""
these people argue  as though we have not have any tilak 
chiplunkar  phule  or karmveer  that to study english is to
continue  english or british colonization 
""
that if we study english  because of any reason whatever  we
become post-colonially colonized 
""
and besides  they also speak in the same way  of the means to
engage in culture studies  but deny the simple and obvious  fact 
that the greatest  single  repository of culture  is its literature
""
""
therefore they argue that we should not study english literature
 but only  indo- english literature 
""
that we should not study english literature  but local  and
world  literature 
""
they attempt to convert english departments  into cultural 
study's  department  or departments of world literature 
""
is there anything  seriously wrong with these two threats  ?
""
can we do both english studies  and indian studies  if  we
wish to  ?
""
history tells us most emphatically  yes 
""
there are persons in my own audience here today  who have done
this 
""
therefore  on the excuse of looking at one such teacher  on
english  ayyappa panikar from kerala  who has both studied and taught
english well  and worked  effectively in his own mother tongue 
""
i propose to examine the basic problems  involved  in being
uncertain  regarding whether to study and teach english  or not 
""
that is why my title  to be uh to english  or not to
english   the lesson of  ayyappa panikar 
""
english in india it appears  is in a crisis 
""
it appears to be insecure  to observers of the linguistic 
political arena  as also to those  in the academic arena  which 
some academia is also  another linguistic political arena  as though
 we did not always know it 
""
at least one state in india  uttar pradesh  seems openly at
war with english 
""
an international congress of marathi  recently  made a great
deal of noise about the continuing  hegemony  of english in maharashtra
""
""
without any hesitation however  it needs to be said that either
there is no real crisis  but that one is being conjured up  for
ideological  game  by ideologues 
""
or that it is essentially the same old  pre-independence crisis
 which is hoped to have stoped  with independence 
""
more than four whole decades  have past since the crucial
achievement  i mean  independance  of an essentially older
generation 
""
to be found still harping on the same crisis  in the belief that
it still  exists unchanged  or in the hope  that from keeping it
alive will approve  linguistic  political  or academic  and
political merit  seems  backward looking  if not  one word 
""
""
and at least for that reason  unjustified  and unjustifiable
for a nation  that hopes to march through centuries of backlog of
development  not my word  in the space of a very few five years plans
""
""
mixed up in this crisis scenerio  is a conscience crisis  or
what is at least made to look like it 
""
some in english teaching establishments are saying   why
should they be teaching english  literature why not  our own  for
instance  why should be the departments be called  departments of
english  and not departments of literature  
""
there are also those who would like to keep reminding us  that
english in india today  is a matter of post-colonial colonization 
""
regarding the first sort of question  we may answer  first
 that if other literatures need to be     stu   
taught or study   they can be taught without teaching them in the
english department 
""
to wish to teach other literatures in english department  and i
mean other language literatures marathi hindi telugu  malyalam  imply
some great confusion  regarding the function of english in india 
""
second  there seems to be no reason to deny  that india does
not need  so many departments of english literature 
""
third  there is nothing   sound of bell 
""
third there is nothing more colonial  in teaching english 
british american  commonwealth  included  in a department of
english  than in teaching hindi literature  in a department of hindi
 or organic chemistry in a department of organic chemistry 
""
as for the more fundamental  question  why english at all
  ?
""
if anyone feels deeply that their career in english  language
or literature  teaching is either empty  patriotic  or a super-
colonial betrayal  they can atleast by way of that career   to 
take up some less renegade  or more self-respectful career 
""
this is not to dismiss  struggling consciences  but to place
them on par with other such 
""
to take just one parallel instance 
""
those who feel that western medicine is a betrayal of 
ayurveda   in the same way  such allopath  should give up
western medicine  and   trained   train   in 
ayurveda   or another career 
""
i would like to leave such cases behind right at the outset by
saying  that  unskilled  assessment will help avoid 
schizophrenia  
""
further is   to english  or not to english
  that seems to be the question 
""
for anything between  means waste through confusion 
""
let us take another look at this crisis  or dilemma even though
we settle the question once  and the reasons for doing so  have not
changed  since then 
""
what is this crisis politically  ?
""
how long shall we  if we shall  let this english language
continue as the major link language of the country  ?
""
when will hindi  take over  ?
""
no one seems to be in right mood to ask   why should 
hindi  take over  or what if  hindi  takes over as a link
language of our national  life  ?
""
what shall we do  about our international life  ?
""
which  whether we like it or not  does endanger those subtle
and growth way  on our national life 
""
what is the crisis ideologically  are we  ? 
""
apparently  it's  a rhetorical question  to being or to
 to be  or to to continue to be colonized by the language  or rather
earlier  colonial rulers 
""
but that reaction is a feeling known 
""
and indeed to such a question that should be our answer 
""
but ideological arguments in this connection  come in english
 mostly addressd to english users 
""
and what is complicating if not worst they seem to come  in
english via europe and america 
""
at least for me  after such knowledge what forgiveness  in
any case this agrument also seems  just like the political argument to
fail to address the very practical problem before us  or before the nation
""
""
if not english  then what  ?
""
for the english teaching establishments the apparently active
english departments in the university  but by implication of the passive
departments in colleges and schools
""
what is the crisis  ?
""
in simple terms  people are asking again  and again and
again   ought we to be teaching  studying engish  
""
 i've  already tried to indicate my answer to that 
""
if our aim is taken for granted  when  then this amongsts to
among other things  distraction confusion waste of time and effort  and
eventually a most horandous shortfall  in our achievement of the goals we
have set for ourselves in this regard 
""
should we not ask such a fundamental question  ?
""
obviously we may  and we shall 
""
but whether we ignore its practical implications  is the issue
for me 
""
and assuming that our nation has  affirmatively answer the
question already  i would like to emphasis that we ought not to allow
confusion or distraction to affect adversly  our performance of the task
""
""
now as a democracy  let us have admited right away  we might
well claim the right to reopen  the issue 
""
take away  the assumption  create the condition that our
previous decision need not be considered  our  fate accompli
 
""
but as long as we do not do so  with full awareness of
consequences  we have better not do anything that will foster  or
enhance  the downward trend  in achievement of the task 
""
not as a negative  implication 
""
what must we do if we do decide  not to teach or learn english
any more  ?
""
well we must then decide  what we shall  do 
""
i see only three alternatives 
""
alternative one   shall we teach the rest of the world
an indian language 
""
even say if you like  hindi 
""
so that we may converse with them or in all ways  that
international and therefore national life demands  
""
alternative two   shall we try to live our national
international life without english  and without any replacement  for it
 
""
and three   or shall we choose an alternative language
 another international language like german  russian french or japanese
 or another of our very own choice  in which to conduct our
international business  
""
if we choose the first alternative  fine 
""
let us girdle our loins for the task of the next couple of hundred
years or so  in which we must become internationally so important  that
outsiders wish to learn hindi 
""
then  arrrange a  one word  like programme  all over
the world  or a hindi council to rival the british council 
""
find in other words the ways and means  to install hindi as our
international language which we can then continue  to use 
""
lessons of the last four decades or so right here in india 
ought to teach us what the real response to this questions should be 
""
if we choose the second alternative  not to bother with any
international language  we shall either create an indian culture  and
nation  precisely  given the cultural linguistic diversity in india
 it may not be quite so bad 
""
we have a very rich culture  or we shall be subject to  so
obviously to all sorts of threats of new colonization from many many sources
 have had 
""
that is to say even if we could imagine situation of international
linguistic vacuum for india  how long we may be able to sustain  our
integrity and even our sovereignity ?
""
in a fiercly international world  this  is not in a moot
query 
""
the answer is too depressing to contemplate  especially i hope
it is depressing to those  who feel the wealth of previous colonization
feeling even today 
""
suppose we take the third alternative  to switch to another
language than english 
""
a language not tainted by colonial  oppressive past  for us
""
""
by the way  is there a major language anywhere  that is not
tainted by  a colonial oppressive past  ?
""
this question is just as revealing in the past tense  and apply
to languages like sanskrit  or telugu  or marathi 
""
what will that decision entail  ?
""
dismantling all our international and also related  national
business and activity  that depends on english today 
""
dismantling our machinery for proliferation of english 
preparing for and installing in its place  the entire machinery required
 in the process of teaching and learning  that new international
language
