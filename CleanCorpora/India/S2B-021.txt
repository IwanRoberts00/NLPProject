kerala  is the southern most  part of india 
""
we are having  many  theatrical art forms  and
performances  as a part  of our culture 
""
among  our  classical  theatrical arts  
kathakali   is the foremost one 
""
perhaps  we may be able to point out   chakyarkuta
  and  kudiyatam   are the  more
ancient forms of classical art forms   kathakali  is
more popular 
""
we have got  krishnanatam   which might have
 originated  before   kathakali  
""
actually  the first term used for  kathakali 
 was  aatam  
""
and the first performance was based on  the ramayana theme 
 ramanatam   composed  in  seventeenth century
or later sixteenth century  by kottarakartampuran 
""
at that time  this  ramanatam  was not so
sophisticated  and it was not perfect  in any sense 
""
 ramanatam   is a story  on drama 
based on valmiki ramayana  divided into eight parts  just as 
 krishanatam  is  framed  in eight  days play
form 
""
 krishanatam  was popular in the south 
northern part of kerala  while  ramanatam  was popular
 in the southern  areas  of the  play uh  land 
""
 ramanatam   though  was  spreading
slowly  in   throughout kerala  gradually  another composer
 kotesampuran  who lived in  seventeenth century  composed
 four stories  based on  mahabharata 
nivathakavachakalakeyavatham  bhagavadham  karmiri  karmirivatham
 and kalyanasaugandhikam 
""
among these four plays  kalakeyavadham  became very popular
 on the kathakali stage 
""
   kot    kotechidambaran   
composed these  aatakathas   and uh they are  very
popular  of course  but the major contribution to kathakali stage 
by kotechidambaran  is that  he has stabilized  the  wa 
method of presentation of this  atam   making much
improvements  on  ramanatam technique 
""
so  the system evolved by kotechidambaran  was popularly
known as  vettadda sampradayam 
""
and  from kotechidambran   kathakali 
 became  a sophisticated classical theatrical art of kerala  and
uh  as far as the visual aspect of kathakali  no major attempt was
made  to make  a stabilisation  in this art form 
""
but  in the later years  there were  many other styles
just like  kannadikot sampradayam  kapling art sampradayam 
etcetera 
""
this kapling art sampradayam  is the eighteenth century 
modification  made by  one kapliknot nambudri  which the then
maharaja of travancore  shri  kartigeternol dyamavarma 
""
kartigeternol dyamavarma  composed  not only 
atakathas   but he  made a  uh technical book  a
theatrical book  a theoritical book  balaramabharatam  that is also
 a very concrete evidence for the stabilisation of this art form 
""
as far as the technique of kathakali is concerned  it is a
combination  of  the three forms of  abhinaya  nrita 
nritya  and  natya  
""
and in  kathakali   we find  
padarthabhinaya   in  dense quality 
""
as   padarthabhinaya  is there  we find
 bhavatmaka  character  also 
""
every word is being depicted on the stage by the actor 
according to the word  and according to the  bhava  
for the relevant  context 
""
and  we find  natya  aspects we find  
nritya  aspect  we find  nrita  aspect also 
""
there are four types of  abhinayam  aangika  aahariya
 wachica   and  satvica  
""
this  aahariya abhinaya  abhinaya   or action
based on the costumes  is very relevent  to  kathakali
 
""
the  costumes are uh  planned  on the basis of 
satvaguna  rajoguna   and  tamoguna  
""
there are  different terms used for costumes   pachha
 minikka  katti  tadi  kari  etcetera 
""
these are  for various characters  according to the story
""
""
and uh  in the uh   aangika abhinaya  context
 we have to point out one  very important aspect  that is the
gestural language 
""
the  hastamudras   are employed in  in a very
 profused manner  based on  either  natyashastra 
 or  hastalakshnadeepika   or  balarambharatam
 
""
perhaps all these steps might have used by  the  uhm foremost
compositors and  actors 
""
 hastalakshnadeepika  contain  of course it is a
kerala text on  gestural language  uh this  hastilakshnadeepika
  gives a  very good evidence  for the  aangika
abhinaya  technique  employed in  kathakali 
""
""
and all the actors see that they are basing on  uh 
hastalakshanadeepika   where  the twenty-four 
hastamudras   the  samyuta mudra   the 
asammita mudra  etcetera are  uh used  and utilised for each
purpose 
""
for example  pataka tripatakam  mudra kadagamugham  uh
shukatundam   all these  mudras  are  uh
employed  in this gestural language 
""
likewise  the  rasabhinaya   the 
satyakabhinaya   for that the  navarasabhinaya  is
very important  for each and every character 
""
we  take valour   singara  karuna  uh shoka
  or uhm   hasya   all these  rasas
 are being depicted  in   kathakali  
but the presentation is  on basis of  bhavas  
""
 padarthabhinayatpada   and  bhavatmaga
 is  kathakali  
""
so   bhava  is being conveyed through each and
every word of the composition 
""
the actor is presenting  his action on the basis of this 
 pada  
""
 pada  is  sung by  or the    wak
    wachikyabhinaya    is performed by the
musicians 
""
the compositions are written in various  ragas  and
 talas   restricted to  the kathakali style 
""
the  that  style of singing is   often called as 
 often called  or  referred as   sopan sangeeta 
""
""
 sopana  is a word used for  a particular method
of singing  songs especially the geetagovinda songs  on the steps of
the shrine  in every temple  in kerala 
""
so that is called  sopana  style 
""
this  sopana  style is being adopted in kathakali
singing  uh eventhough there are  ragas  common to carnatic
music and  sopana  style of singing  the method of singing
the rendering of singing  is very different in  sopana 
style 
""
uh  kathakali  composers  uh adopting the
 sopana  style and there is an evidence in the 
kathakali   that  uhn they incorporated item  
manjutala  
""
it is also called as  melappada  
""
this  manjutala  is a first portion of a 
pada  in  uh geetagovinda   manjutala kunjatala
kelisadane   that portion is being  sung at the beginning of
every performance of  kathakali 
""
and that denotes the adoption  of kathakali style  from the
singing method of a  ashtapadi   or geetagovinda in the
kerala tradition 
""
so   in  the actor is performing his action on the basis
of  the  wachikabhinaya  performed by the composer the
musician
""
the main musician is called ponani the second musician is called
sengadi 
""
ponani and sengadi with uh  instrumental  music  cymbals
  chengala   or  eluttalam   are being
used by the singers 
""
and on the basis of the  wachikabhinaya   the
actor  acts  on the principle of  padarthabhinaya  and
 bhavatmaga  
""
he has the freedom to  uh present his uh  quality and
efficiency in  manodharmatam  or  ilagiyatam 
""
while  in  chuliyatam  he actually imitates the
words through expression and uh  conveying the meaning through the
gestural language  just like  pataka  mudra  kadagamughum 
shukatundam  sarpashirsham uh  mrigashirsham   etcetera 
""
so  the gestural language is very important in 
kathakali   as it is  important in kudiattam also 
""
but in krishnanatam we don't find  so much employment of
gestural language
""
there the dance technique is more important  the  nritya
 and  nrita  are important  while in 
kathakali    natya nrita nritya  are also  uhm
equally important 
""
the another aspect of  kathakali   we have to
point out that we are seeing imitative action  we are seeing 
descriptive action  we are finding symbolic action  in 
kathakali 
""
all these techniques are employed together in  kathakali
 
""
kathakali  actor  will have to  undergo  a training
 a rigorous training for six or more years  under an able  guru
  to become a good actor 
""
uh  and for that  in kerala  the  gurukula
 system of coaching was    pre    prevalent 
 
""
now it is almost faded  and we are having certain institutions
like kerala kalamandalam  instituted by  poet laureate  wallatol 
narayan menon 
""
he is the  chief personality  who  worked behind  the
popularisation  the modern popularisation of  kathakali
  in modern times 
""
the kalamandalam  margi in trivandrum  and some other
institutions are also giving  training in this particular art form as well
as it provides  training in  kodiattam  mohiniyattam 
 uhn and other similar art forms of kerala 
""
with regard to the literature of kathakali  we are having about
five hundred stories based on  the puranas 
""
   ka    ramanatam   of course  is
based on  valmiki ramayana  and uh  kotechidambaran stories  
unnai's  nalacharitam  iraimentam stories  are based on mahabharata
""
""
and similarly we are having  many stories  based on ramayana
 mahabharata and  other puranas 
""
yet dakshayagam is a very  popular story  connected with
 shiva 
""
lord shiva  is punishing  his father-in-law  daksha 
""
and a quarrel between  father-in-law and son-in-law  takes
place  in a very dramatic manner 
""
this  theme is adopted by  a poet composer of eighteenth
century  iraimantambi 
""
iraimantambi was  a musician  a musicologist  a 
kathakali composer  and uh  a very good art connoisseur  who lived
in the period of  shri  sadatinha maharaja  who was the 
doyen of karnataka music as far as kerala is concerned 
""
and uh  iraimantambi was a court musician  court poet  and
uh  very popular figure in the cultural arena of kerala of the ninteenth
century 
""
before that we have got  unnai wadiyar who composed
naliyadadamaatakatha which is a four  uhn days play  uh based on
mahabharata 
""
the nala damayanti katha  is beautifully presented in the
nalacharitam  uh with musical skill  with literary skill  as well as
sufficient scope to  action also 
""
after that we can point out only this personality iraimantambi 
uh for his three plays keechakavadham  uttaraswayavaram and dakshayagam
 uh very popular stories on the kathakali stage 
""
beyond that  we are having ravana vijayam by tilimanur
vidwangoitambran  and uh  duryodhanavadham  by waikkarmusud  uh
tadagavadham by weekasindambi who is the originator of the kathakali club
system in kerala  uh who has uh written some kathakali plays also  uh
modified some techniques  evolved some uh  evolutions in the 
methods on the kathakali stage 
""
uh similarly  we are having some later period composers also
""
""
for example one  man who lives till now  mali madhavanna has
composed a story on karnashapatham  that is also based on  mahabharata
""
""
modern writers  uh try to adopt foreign stories  in kathakali
stage 
""
for example kerala kalamandalam  presented this year  a story
on the basis of  shakespeare's   king lear  
""
uhn it was appreciated by  foreign audience but i don't know 
whether  this will suit kathakali  stage fully well as the mythological
 themes of our  traditional  style  and we can not  think of
a  a shakespearean character  with this  pachha  or 
other costumes  on the kathakali stage 
""
another  aspect  we have to account  with regard to
 kathakali  is the musical  aspect of uh  this
theatrical art 
""
we have got  in kerala  three major instruments of music 
 idakya  chanda   and  muyav  
""
 idakya  is used for   sopan 
music  or  ashtapadi  singing  and uh   muyav
 is for  chakyarkut  and   kudiattam
 alone 
""
while  chanda   and  maddalam  
are used in kathalali 
""
 idakya  has got some relevance in 
kathakali  very rarely also 
""
and this    chan     chanda 
  and uh   maddalam  iluttalam   and 
kaimani   this combination of  kathakali  in
 musical aspect is very important  and just like  aharyabhinava
 this musical instrument also gives  a very good impression on the
whole art 
""
 kathakali  is a total theatre 
""
it is dramatic 
""
it is musical 
""
it is rhythmic 
""
there is dance  technique there are  there is natya technique
 there is nrita technique  everthing is combined in there 
""
and the total story is being present 
""
another  aspect of the story is  in  kudiattam
 and  kuttu  we find  vidushaka 
character 
""
but there is no  vidushaka   or comic character
in  kathakali  
""
we are having  dhirodatta  dhirodhadata  dhiralalita
 and  dhirashanta   characters 
""
these characters are  ba  coming from  our puranas and
 uh epics 
""
so  uh this type of  nayaka  characters  uh
 heroines like  damayanti  or  uttara  or draupadi  uh
women characters they also  uh participate in the action
""
but the women characters  uh are represented by men only 
""
major actors are men 
""
they take the role of uh  female characters 
""
that is a peculiar  uh aspect of  kathakali
""
""
there are very few  ladies  who  participate in
 kathakali  
""
and there is a troupe also  ladies troupe also 
""
but that is not so popular 
""
mainly  the  main  men take female role also 
because uh   kathakali  requires  very rigorous
training in  uh  aangikabhinaya  aspect 
""
uh female  dancers or actors do not  undergo such severe
training 
""
men only can face that uh  annual  training  physical
training 
""
so   kathakali   is  a performance
 mainly acted by  men  and this is very popular 
""
this is  almost a temple art  but it has come out of the
temple walls  and  it is presented for social functions  cultural
functions  and other  uhn celebrations also 
""
every temple festival  will have a kathakali performance 
one or two or three or  any number 
""
similarly  uh this  costume makers  the 
productions  everything  of  katha  every aspect of 
kathakali  has become  a predominant  uh factor of our 
  k    kerala   culture 
""
just like  we had krishnatam troupes in ancient times  we
are having  kathakali troupes  in modern times also 
""
uh it is  almost  a non-secular performance now 
""
and we are having  kathakali  pada kacharis 
now 
""
we are having individual presentations like  putanamorcha
 or  some other story 
""
individual characters are being presented
""
now we have got a  youth festival stage in kerala  school
youth festival and college youth festival 
""
there also   uh there is  much competition is going on
between youngsters to present   kathakali  in a
beautiful way 
""
so   kathakali  is getting  its
popularity  day by day  and wallatol has contributed much for our 
uh present popularity of  kathakali  
""
this classical theatre  is  uh progressing  even though
we have lost so many  uh distinguished actors 
""
the style of acting and the presentation of the art  the
standard of art is maintained almost  in a very  uh attractive 
method 
""
thank you
