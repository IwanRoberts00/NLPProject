 in hindi  bidhan nagar in attack  to sanjoy mitra sanjoy das the captain is looking at the box but referee waves play on  bidhan nagar playing the three mid field players three forwards  and five defenders  sports college lucknow attacking to veer bahadur thapa  now it's rajan kumar kuldeep left footer  comfortably collected by vimal das the bidhan nagar goal keeper  sports college lucknow trailing zero one in this subrato mukherjee cup final  and the substitution being made by bidhan nagar vimal  no it is raja chatterjee who's coming on  raja chatterjee the number thirteen who'll come on and coming out is the number twelve that is santosh gupta  so raja chatterjee will come in in the next back position  bidhan nagar in attack  once again to sanjoy das the skipper  this is in the second half bidhan nagar leading their opponent sports college lucknow one nil in the nineteen nineteen   ninety- one final  bidhan nagar has lost three nil to sports college lucknow  so if bidhan nagar win today it will be their first ever win in the subrato cup  and as their coach surjit kumar ghosh said it will be sweet revenge for the defeat in nineteen ninety-one when they lost zero three to sports college lucknow  referee joji awards foul  bidhan nagar player pulled up for stamping and a free kick to sports college lucknow which they will take just near the centre line  long high free kick but not much danger comfortably collected by vimal das the goalkeeper as he collect it  bidhan nagar in attack through sanjoy das their skipper a good through pass but it's clear for a corner  corner kick will be taken from the far right  some clearance and the ball goes into touch  now sports college lucknow hemchandra joshi throwing the ball but losing out again  bidhan nagar skipper sanjoy das trying to build up an attack  for the off side  so bidhan nagar still clinging on to that one nil lead and if they maintained this lead they will have achieved their ambition of bringing the subrato cup they have been pass getting the subrato cup since nineteen ninety semi-finalist in nineteen ninety semi-finalist again in ninety-nine in ninteen ninety-two and runners up in nineteen ninety-one  but they have yet to win the tournament  aimless football even this early part of the second half  bidhan nagar have the distinction of having reach the final without having conceded a goal  in their league matches they won ten nil thirteen nil and then were held cold by one word shillong in the quarter final they won one nil and in the semi- final they beat the school from ranchi three nil  sports college lucknow from the near right but well cleared by bidhan nagar raja chatterjee  long clearance this could be dangerous a chance by sports college lucknow mid fielder lalit singh takes a very weak try  mid field action not much constructed football and referee joji giving awarding a foul to bidhan nagar because  one of sports college lucknow player obstructed bidhan nagar defender  so it's a long clearance bidhan nagar in attack  from the near left through raja chatterjee the overlapping left back  a long left footer but the ball goes obviously wide  manoj singh long high goal kick but the ball goes into touch on the near right  still bidhan nagar one sports college lucknow nil and kamal ghosh the prolofic scorer for bidhan nagar scored this goal  now raja chatterjee with the ball dribbles well attempted to pass but mis direction  suddenly bidhan nagar seem to have become a bit hasty as time is running out they are getting anxious to hold on to this lead which could be long tactics because the break away move sports college lucknow could equalise  the ball is not of a very high quality  both teams tense and anxious  now this arbind mhatra who's cleared the ball out of danger for bidhan nagar  see bidhan nagar players lying on the ground as a results of these  tussles of the ball  and referee joji calls up for medical assistance and there will be a slight hold up  bidhan nagar high school from fourth lane in calcutta adopted by the sports authorities of india our leading sports college lucknow by one nil both these teams met in the finals in nineteen ninety-one  the sports college lucknow won rather emphatic win three nil  but this time bidhan nagar has have the initiative  they have been the more dominating team but they are not really being able to translate their dominance into goal  approach plays good but near the goal hasty passes  leads to impossession in attack and break up of the attack  so it is bidhan nagar shonkar das receiving assistance  medical attendant near the goal line near the goal and play will resume referee joji insist goal keeper goes to see him and there will be long goal keep goal kick  by parmanand karmakar  shankor das also leaps back onto the field  now bidhan nagar in attack this could be dangerous but komal ghosh looked as he trys to touch the ball  and on the break for sports college lucknow is there  number twelve salim javed salim javed to veer bahudar thapa  and a long aimless kick which sails over the bar  lalit rathod and veer bahadur thapa were the main striker for sports college lucknow on their way to the final  but they have made very little impact against the tight marking bidhan nagar defence  now imad hussein the left winger attacking for sports college lucknow takes a good returned pass attempts across but  is unsuccessful  sports college lucknow trying to build up attack through from the left to imad hussein  and lalit rathod with the ball solo pass but it's  the referee pulls up this tackle by sanjoy das he accidently handle the ball while tackling and throw a free kick  from a reasonably dangerous position if they have a hard hitting striker sports college lucknow could utilise this free kick quite well  standing there is vishal prasad and lalit singh and let us see who takes it  lalit singh serving the free kick just goes over the bar  of course goal keeper vimal das has seen it well and so there was no danger  and referee waves ask for play to resume  bidhan nagar leading sports college lucknow by one goal to nil  sports college lucknow salim javed losing out to komal ghosh komal ghosh pulled up forward for the obstruction and so salim javed will take this free kick for sports college lucknow  a wasted free kick mis directed bidhan nagar also now playing study football just long clearances in inter space  just trying to wind time away  bidhan nagar leading sports college lucknow by one goal to nil komal ghosh being the scorer  raja chatterjee taking this throwing trying to get komal ghosh in action but it is the right back amit singh rawat who intercepts and place the ball into touch  yet another throwing for bidhan nagar  referee joji looking at his watch  bidhan nagar coming close to fulfilling their ambition good build up this but well foiled by surendar kumar  from the far side it is imad hussein building up an attack for sports college lucknow  the typical long pass but very well headed away by bidhan nagar parmanand karmakar  the long ball tactics of sports college lucknow not really  penetrating enough to upset the tight marking and bidhan nagar defence which intercepts very well both in the air and on the ground  habib and mondal now it could give neg  niyogi in the striker position  he steals a diagonal but displayed by shailendra kumar the poor shailendra kumar  and it is lalit rathod give the ball to veer bahadur thapa  dangerous striker  good ball controlled by veer bahadur thapa one word   takes the return pass   it's the rajan kumar moving up but again misdirected by one word bidhan nagar defender shankar das to make a long aimless clearance  this tactics could misfire because on a break away sports college lucknow could equalise  it would be very demoralising for bidhan nagar  in the beginning they stop playing constructive football the type of football they are capable of playing  and that is formed by sujeet niyogi strike and you will see yet another substitution  it's number seventeen sudeep majumdar who is coming on for bidhan nagar so they have used first one word on team substitution they can of course still change their goal keeper if they want according to latest sefa rule  and coming out is the number eight for bidhan nagar is  that is  and a down step sports college lucknow but number twelve salim javed shoot wide  so sudeep majumdar on the field the substitute to komal das komal ghosh from the left side  komal ghosh dribbles well and good ball control komal ghosh gives the fine smooth pass but it deflects for sports college lucknow defender and good recovery tackle  by their one word back surendra kumar which prevents danger bidhan nagar in attack but it's infringement and so sports college lucknow will get this free kick if they take from the near right long clearance from amit singh rawat  the ball with salim javed now with shailendra kumar with manoj singh long clearance to imdad hussein attempted long pass but which is misdirected  so bidhan nagar playing with four defenders three mid field players and three forwards  and leading sports college lucknow by one goal to nil sports college lucknow playing in the traditional four to four formation four defenders two mid field players and four forward  though one of their wingers just frequently fall back to help the forward line  bidhan nagar so far quite untroubled by sports college lucknow  it's long passing game and they can hold out unnecessary defence in one word  long pass trying to get veer bahadur thapa in action but the ball is too long to wangled for veer bahadur to even get near to it  veer bahadur thapa of course is the prolofic dangerous striker for sports college lucknow but he has not received the service to which he can do justice  shankar das getting ready with a long free kick goal kick but doesn't find an opponent komal ghosh going up for the ball losing out to stretched out komal ghosh sports college lucknow taller fitter but making a tight control with the bidhan nagar players there  now it's a good throw pass to komal ghosh  but it accidently handles the ball and there's a free kick to sports college lucknow  misdirected free kick raja chatterjee edge but it heller  goes straight to lalit rathod lalit rathod to veer bahadur thapa  who attempts the cross from the right but he doesn't reach  so one of the rare break away move sports college lucknow couldn't really spell any danger couldn't create any major danger  one more wrong high goal kick to the left side to find komal ghosh  but he is unable to attack  so one more aimless crappy football into aimless crappy football  and there will be a throwing being taken by amit singh rawat the right back  amit singh rawat right back trying to find lalit singh  who turns and shoot but promptly cleared by parmanand karmakar  amit singh rawat  now it is raja chatterjee pulled up for pushing salim javed from behind and so it's a foul  free kick which is being taken by lalit singh of sports college lucknow  free kick from the near right if taken accurately could create danger three sports college lucknow player up in the box but well cleared by shankar das  a chance here for sports college lucknow veer bahadur thapa has the ball  and now good shot by imdad a good shot by imad imdad hussein but which went wide gives the side one word  so this was the danger because what could happen bidhan nagar by being such a defensive and trying to lose out the ball and  on a break away move sports college lucknow nearly collide  now it is manoj singh on the far side  but an aimless clearance by manoj  arbind mhatra sending it to skipper sanjoy das who kicks it on to deepak mandol  deepak mandol controls it's a long clearance a chance now by sujeet niyogi top of the box but the ball goes to the goal keeper  bidhan nagar players resorting to long drives in this closing minutes  probably content on their one goal lead and trying to waste a little time by taking these long rangers they also hope to unsettle goal keeper abdus salam and try for a rebound komal ghosh is a very nippy forward as he is darting through here  on the left but it is amit singh rawat who gets there first and clear the ball into touch for a throwing to bidhan nagar  so these seems to be the tactic for bidhan nagar long passes  and now it is again komal ghosh but uh obstruction by the two bidhan nagar players amit singh rawat and throw foul which will be taken by amit singh rawat at right flank for sports college lucknow  goaler goaler in yellow shirts sports college lucknow  not being able to create any cohesive attack  now bidhan nagar developing an attack to sujeet niyogi sujeet niyogi a fine through pass from far right and on the far right it is deepak mandol getting control yes he dribbles but he is very crudely tackled and rightly gets a foul though one sense may be umpire joji could have given advantage because he had managed deepak mandol had managed to dribble  again chander joshi and the free kick now to bidhan nagar from the far right  a free kick uh sports college lucknow building up an attack from the near side it is to rajan kumar rajan kumar loses out the ball to lalit rathod lalit rathod in centre of the field  building up an attack with lalit singh back to lalit rathod a diagonal pass to the near right to veer bahadur thapa  this could be dangerous veer bahadur thapa moving up picking up pace dribble pass one against the form but he gets a free kick just outside the box if there had been a yard inside it could have been a penalty and could have spell danger  again the break away move causing danger to bidhan nagar  veer bahadur thapa certainly shows good subtle pulse and quick control  the most dangerous movement for sports college lucknow veer bahadur thapa picked himself up his credit being thinking of himself uh a wall being formed ten yards away this is an area with certainly a well directed free kick could lead to a goal  it's a direct free kick veer bahadur thapa is there  rajan kumar is there   let's see how sports college lucknow take this free kick veer bahadur thapa props up and this could be a goal  rajan kumar kicks in the rebound as goal keeper vimal das didn't collected very properly  a crowning free kick put vimal das in trouble he couldn't control it and off the rebound it was the nippy rajan kumar who darted in that goal with the low left footer  bidhan nagar defenders should be blamed with this because they didn't rush back sensing their goal keeper was in danger they should have rushed back to help him one hour now and the game could go to extra time  bidhan nagar school calcutta one sports college lucknow one now there will be greater sense of urgency in bidhan nagar's play now
