photogrammetry means making measurements on photographs  when direct measurements are not possible as in the case of  very intricate objects or moving objects we make  photograph and from that photograph we make measurements  usually we take photograph from the air to make map of the topography  in this case the branch is known as aerial photogrammetry if the photographs are taken from the ground then the objects are surfaces are at a distance less than three hundred metres we call the branch as close range photogrammetry where do we make use of close range photogrammetry in ? there are a number of applications  we can broadly divide these applications into two parts  the first part the objects will be static  for example historic monuments temple one word   a train accident  in all these cases the objects on the surfaces are not moving they are all static  in the other case the object will be moving or the surface will be dynamic  to cite some specific example we can take the case of a wave form  when the waves are moving if you want to make measurement about the characterstics of the wave it is not possible to record the measurement directly  we take the photograph of this wave which are dynamic and later on we analyse the photograph to derive that information we desire to cite another example we can consider a running athlete  if you want to analyse the movement of the athlete it is difficult to make the measurement directly  we make use of close range photograph to record the movement of the athlete at various instance of time and later on from the photograph  we can analyse the movement of the particular sportsmen to find out their deficiencies  there are a number of applications of close range photogrammetry in the medical field  one such application is plastic surgery  for example if we want to make some alteration in any part of the human body we should know the present position of the particular part  we take photograph of that particular part by making use of  a special camera  the doctor can then simulate by making use of computer  how the particular part would look like after the surgery is made  the surgeon may decide how much of tissue should be taken  from another part of the body where the tissue should be placed and how it should be placed all these required measurement can be analysed by means of the photographs taken of the particular patient  another interesting application is in recording crime scene and traffic accidents  imagine the nature of the traffic in a very busy highway  when a traffic accident takes place  immediately the vehicles pile up one after another for kilometres together if it is a very busy highway  we will normally wait till the police people come to make the necessary measurement and the signal from the police people  to clear the traffic it takes about half an hour or so to record all the measurements the police people need to present the case before the magistrate  consider the delay in the movement of the traffic in this case to all the people who are waiting in their vehicles to clear the traffic  if you have here close range photogrammetry camera we can rush the camera to the traffic accident site record the scene by means of a few photographs taken from two or three vantage position  what all measurements we need about the traffic accident we can later on derive the same by analysing the photograph taken from the close range photogrammetry camera  another area where close range photogrammetry would be more useful is in the recording of structural movement of massive structures  to cite a specific example we can consider a massive dam if we would like to know how much the dam is one word   over a period of time or how much the dam is getting deflected over a period of time we can make use of this technique  we will make special target on the surface of the dam  at various points  we can record the dam site alongwith the target mark making use of the photogrammetry camera over a period of time  normally we may take pictures at intervals of about a month if we analyse the photograph of the dam taken periodically  making use of special plotting machines we will come to know  how much that targets are getting moved either in the vertical direction  or in the lateral direction or in any direction of deformation  because we will be taking measurement to a very high order of accuracy to about one by thousand of a milimetre we will be knowing how much the structure is getting deflected over a period of time  very very accurately  same is the case when we want to record structural failure  for example if a beam is loaded by external load  gradually the beam will be deforming until the beam fails  if a structural engineer would like to record the behaviour of the structure due to various types of loading he can make use of the close range photogrammetry camera to record how the structure is getting deformed instant after instant  after the recording is done he can analyse the photograph  in the special photogrammetry plotting machine to find out their nature of deformation and the extent of deformation very very accurately another field of application is the field of anthropology  the anthropologists are interested in classifying the skull  to find out to which race a particular skull belongs  the anthropologist will be recording the important dimensions of various skulls belonging to different races  there will be some characteristic measurements for a particular skull  if a skull is to be analysed we can take photograph of the skull  find out the characteristic of the important measurements and from the measurements we can find out whether the skull belongs to a chinese or a nepali or an asian race  we need a number of equipment to produce map making use of the close range photogrammetry technique  the first equipment needed is an electronic distance measuring equipment  an electronic distance measuring equipment is known as e d m this is a sophisticated equipment to measure the distances  and angles  an infra range beam is generated in the e d m and it travels to the point to which you want to make measurement and it gets reflected back to the equipment  by analysing the face shift we can find out the distance between any two points to a high order of accuracy usually fractions of a milimetre  in the case of close range photogrammetry we establish a few control points as target in the field of view of the photograph  the e d m is made use of in the field to record the rectangular coordinate of the various control points  by analysing their distances and angles we will come to know  that x y and either coordinate of the control point situated in the field of view  when we analyse this photograph in the plotting machine the control points are very essential  the coordinate of the control points which were obtained from the e d m are fit into the plotting machine  the second equipment needed for the close range photogrammetry  is a special stereometric camera  this camera essentially consists of two independent  highly accurate camera separated by a known distance of hundred and twenty centimetres  the lenses are having a focal length of sixty milimetres  a speciality of these two cameras is that the lenses have been so refined that practically no lense distortion occurs in the pictures taken from this camera  since we will be making measurement on the photograph to a very high order of accuracy we have to have the images of the objects  positioned in the geometrically correct location  if there is need of specially refined lenses required for this stereometric camera we we should have two cameras instead of one in the case of close range photogrammetry  if we take twin pictures simultaneously we will be able to see their actual field in three dimensions in the plotting machine which we will be using later  because the two photographs are taken simultaneously we are freezing the movement of the objects as well as we are able to get a three dimensional true to scale model in the photogrammetric plotting machine  this machine is so constructed to have simultaneous pictures if we operate a single button both the pictures are taken simultaneously  because we will be taking measurement very very accurately this camera takes only glass plates  the glass plates are sensitized with the photogrammetric emulsion the emulsion are sensitive to the light and the processing which takes place after the exposure is made  during the development stage during the drive stage no distortion of the pictures occurs  thats why we are making use of glass plates to arrest all distortions of the negative  another special feature of this camera is the various possibility of orientation of the camera  if we need the shaft of the camera containing both the cameras can be rotated in the longitudinal axis or the camera can be brought one over the other  the camera can also be swivelled about the vertical axis  why should we need all these types of movement ? we may need to take photograph from the high point such as the top of a mountain but the object may be far below  once the photographic processing is over the original glass plates containing the emulsion are converted into the dipositives  in the plotting machine we keep the dipositives  one on the left side and one on the right side  we measure the coordinate of a particular point in the machine  through the binocular kept in front of the observer  the observer finds a fourteen mark in the field of view  he keeps the fourteen mark over a point of interest as he measures the coordinate of the point making use of the photogrammetric machine the computer controlled part takes the x and y coordinate from the left image and the right image and they are processed through the computer to give the x y and either coordinates  with respect to a given origin  the ground control points which are measured earlier they are also made use of to calculate the actual position of the point measured  the computer after recording all the photographic coordinates  converts them into graphic details  the graphic details are then passed on to a special plotting table  in the plotting table the plotting pencil according to the command of the observer converts the details of the scene into a picture  that picture may contain all the details appearing in the field of view in the form of live feature  the operator may choose special symbols and special colours  to codify the different types of features appearing in the field of view  a user by studying the map coming out from the plotting table  will be able to get all the measurements he needs without any difficulty  if the observer needs only the coordinate and not the map he can take all the required coordinate from the screen of the computer itself or if the operator would like to keep all the measurements in a magnetic tape or a floppy he can store all the information of the field and keep them in a special plate  if you would like to record the changes in a particular field over a period of time the same type of measurement can be repeated and from the repeated measurement it is possible to find out the changes which have occured in a particular field or a particular object  concluding i would like to remark that whenever you have a situation where the direct measurements are not at all possible  the stereophotogrammetric technique will be coming handy to you
