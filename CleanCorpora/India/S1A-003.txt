""
""
uh you just call 
""
""
 theek hai na  
""
""
otherwise it will be too expensive for you 
""
""
then  it's  two or three couples 
""
yes  doctor in the colony
""
""
is there a baby-sitter who 
""
do you agree with  one word  
""
""
well
""
""
 i'm  going to get later on  laughs 
""
""
i  won't  serve scotch
""
""
 laughs  
""
""
then i only serve the scotch for a big toast at twelve 
o'clock  
""
""
to bring in the real effect  na 
""
""
a toast for the birthday boy
""
""
wow 
""
like that 
""
""
but  it's  a waste  yaar 
""
 it's  a waste  yaar  serving good scotch
""
""
""
and what  you're  going to have to eat
""
""
now what do you want  it's  upto you
""
that you can decide
""
you want mutton you want fish you want chicken 
""
""
look uh 
""
""
or you want pork
""
""
 laughs 
""
why did you  one word   i'm   one word  
laughs  
""
""
now seriously decide 
""
see if it is good fish 
""
""
no fish is out of question
""
""
why
""
""
you  don't  get fish
""
  and fish  is too expensive 
""
""
 we'll ask  
""
""
 we'll  ask that person no that sagar you can tell
""
""
he  won't  give 
""
""
he  won't  sell it 
""
""
he gets it for his own purpose
""
""
warna is also  getting fishes  warna we may  a few
words  
""
""
he  won't  give you like that
""
""
but why 
""
""
they get it for their own purpose 
""
 it's  their business  yaar 
""
""
fish is not available 
""
""
 it's  not the question of   it's  available
""
""
 it's  in very small quantities 
""
and there is  no regularity 
""
""
 can't  be sure
""
""
as more expensive than uh  wadangi  or mutton
roast
""
""
so the special dish is chicken or mutton  we always have
mutton 
""
""
 we'll  have chicken 
""
""
so what  we'll  do is make a  a gravy of 
chicken    ah  thickish    ah  or as we usually
do the kolhapuri style    uhm  and uh  we'll  make that
mutton  ekdam  dry    uh  like a roast
""
""

holiday it being a sunday 
""
""
yeah
""
so   we can have 
""

""
so it is on the sixth 
""
""
 you'll  get a holiday or
""
""
on sixth  we're  going to have problem for mutton also
""
""
""
why
""
""
that all uh everybody buying out the
""
""
what when  everybody getting  a few words  
""
""
so  we'll  do that you want a  biryani 
""
""
but this  biryani  is out because then we won't get
this  biryani  made
""
""
we won't 
""
but don't get  a few words  
""
""
shall i make that  keema pulav  along with it
""
""
""
instead of it make plain  keema  
""
""
so you want the chicken and  keema  
""
""

 we'll  have uh proper  chapati  
""
""
 uhm  
""
""
you can make  bhakri na  
""
""
ah  bhakris   we'll  make  no
problem
""
""
everyone eats this  bhakri 
""
""
yeah okay  we'll  have  bhakri  or 
we'll  have  uh  chapati   whatever 
""
and  i've  asked uh hemant to get this  bot  one
bottle of scotch 
""
but now it depends on how many people  you'll  call 
""
if  you've  got friends like raj and all   then my
one bottle is not  going to  suffice
""
""
  laughs   
""
""
then decide  one bottle of  one or two words  
""
""
no  we'll  buy a good whisky  that's  no
problem  but uh when  we'll  serve ordinary whisky
""
""
okay 
""
""
 accha   what was that  uh uh what was
that mr mane telling you  that this time when  they've  sports what
do they want your help for 
""
""
as a common referee 
""
""
as a    to 
""
ah what do  you've  to do 
""
""
 to  
""
""
look over the things 
""
""
what things    uh 
""
what things
""
""
 uh  
""
""
to know that everything is going properly or not 
""
""
no but for what programme
""
or 
""
""
for sports
""
""
their inter-school or  intership  or what 
""
 you're  talking  a few words  
""
""
national style you see 
""
""
ah okay 
""
so inter-school sports when are they normally
""
""
i  don't  know 
""
""
so he wanted your help 
""
so funny you know
""
he  he's  so much faith in your expertise   
and he he was saying i  don't  bother you 
""
you were saying that you need that qualification was   n i
l  and he was saying we  don't  bother about all such things 
""
""
  laughs   
""
""
 n i l  
""
""
so anyway  but yesterday  we had our inspection my god
so tiring 
""
we really had a tough time 
""
""
uhm you  don't  have real qualified teachers 
""
""
but you you
""
""
that is the biggest problem in your school 
""
""
you  don't  get   good 
""
""
  don't  talk   your teachers are all
bastard teachers 
""
there is no hope 
""
you want to have a real good school here 
""
""
you  don't  get good teachers   over here 
""
""
 there is   no professional approach towards
teaching 
""
""
but that really we learnt in bombay 
""
how to be a professional in your jobs 
""
""
 that's  it
""
""
shireen  she was excellent at that 
""
she was very good 
""
she would just you know even even when there was bickering between
teachers and all that 
""
if ever we went to her with our problems   ke 
so and so is you know she used to say just rise above all that 
""
because if you just rise above all that just forget about it 
""
you  don't  be affected by it and  don't  even try
to solve it just rise above it
""
""
that means you  can't  have an understand  but 
you should keep that others you have to solve that  problem of with
management 
""
you should not neglect your teaching  uh you know
""
""
no but i believe that we people are   not 
""
""
 you should   be honest with what  you're 
teaching 
""
not just because  i'm  i a s  i'm  appointed as a
teacher i have to go there  teach there  and teach them for thirty
thirty-five minutes whatever is in the book you know 
""
most of your teachers are not well prepared 
""
""
 that's  true
""
""
they should do the preparation at home
""
""
i feel its for school teaching you know all the people who
come there half of them are the one who  you know  haven't  been
able to get in anywhere else so  they've  come into this profession
""
""
look    being a  once   you  enter the
class  na  the teacher  doesn't  have to  open a
book
""
if she is well prepared she  doesn't  have to open a book
""
""
""
 being a  
""
""
 no  
""
""
she can carry on for one hour also without opening a book
 if  she's  so thorough 
""
""
  they 
""
""
 and   it is not a question of  you being
properly educated and you qualify
""
if  you're  honest with it  then you can do it
""
""
and teaching is a knack
""
you can be very qualified but you  can't  communicate 
""
you  can't  have a rapport with the children
""
you just  can't  communicate what  you're   
trying to say 
""
""
  that's  true  
""
what is b ed 
""
those teachers are trained to teach 
""
 they're  trained 
""
""
that gives you very basic outline you know on how to go about
things 
""
that basic   line you have the 
""
""
 but that is also   but that is also important
 na  how to go about things
""
if you  don't  know how to go about things then what you
are going to do 
""
""
uhm  that's  true
""
""
that's the stupid little boon which government has 
imposed on everybody 
""
""
and  we've  a
""
""
so all the management should follow the this guidelines 
""
your problem is known you can get qualified english teachers 
""
""
our   management  
""
""
 trained   english teachers
""
""
english    but  not english teacher english
speaking
""
""
 but  
""
""
english speaking
""
""
they all educated through    look  marathi medium
  so we can't we don't have to  one-word  
""
""
 look  
""
""
 you you can get it  
""
but then 
""
look if you want the best then  you've  to give out the
best also 
""
""
they can
""
""
you know how to 
""
put your hands into your pocket and shell out the money
""
we just want teachers teachers teachers   don't  run
like that 
""
come on give them proper salaries no 
""
""
no what happens you know  they know how to speak english
but they  don't  have the colloquial expressions 
""
they just you know  corrupt they are they talk in very quaint
uh in a very quaint fashion 
""
they were  it's  not a  sort of and they don't have
vocabulary is so limited that they can't  express one thing into two
other ways also 
""
""
but then you have to use your expressions facial expressions
to  explain things 
""
""
 you've  to have a good command over the language
""
if you in in an english medium school 
""
""
no that way in a  in any language then you should have a
command
""
""
yes
""
""
if you want to teach just look 
""
besides doing school work if  you're   fall  falling
short on that particular language  then  you've  to work on that
 lang  language
""
""
yeah  you've  to work   at it  
""
but then what happens once you get a get set job  they're 
okay
""
then they become a bit uh 
""
""
uh  you've  to do your self-improvement 
""
""
how many people really believe in that
""
and how many are really ready to do that 
""
how is ajinkya today
""
i wonder he got temperature 
""
""
