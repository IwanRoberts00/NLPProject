 one word    sushila 
""
""
 so shushilaji   when are we leaving to your place
""
""
""
 i'm  leaving on the twenty ninth of     one
word  
""
""
 what is   your impression of mysore last year 
and   whether you like 
""
""
 mysore is   a beautiful city 
""
i liked it very much 
""
""
i never imagined that  it's  a beautiful city 
""
perhaps  because i stayed in lucknow hostel and even 
""
""
yeah lucknow used to be very very hot 
""
and  when i came to mysore  i came here  with the
intention of visiting a new city 
""
i didn't have any idea about the weather  in mysore 
""
when i  reached bangalore  uh i asked my sister how mysore
would be like  and she said that  uh well it would be as good as
bengal 
""
now i  come to know that my sister was uh  right in a way
""
""
but you know 
""
now
""
""
i don't know about sushila  she is she  one or two words
 all that and asok is also 
""
""
now  i see you  can we  one word   uh it
proved to be a bit  cough  troublesome  for me sushila  of
course  you are there  and  i'm  surrounded by  friends like
you and patil and asok and all that 
""
i don't miss my home as much 
""
""
but even then     one word   made
quite long    one or two words  
""
""
 now  
""
""
 one month is a long  time   to be away from
home 
""
""
and especially  food  and when you come back  to my
to your room  uh you don't exactly like a warm     that's 
""
""
""
 yeah   especially in the evening  when you
returned  from from the institute you feel rather home sick   
yeah yeah 
""
to enter the empty room  when nobody is there to 
""
""
 yeah yeah  
""
""
of course with sushila with with   neighbour  you
 there is a kind of compensation  kind of uh sisterly  daughterly
   yeah  persons  that the cheerful charming sweet and all
that 
""
but then we know  that this is a kind of a medicine  
 yeah  the family insists on but  it is illusion
""
""
 i know  
""
""
 yeah  
""
""
 yeah  
""
""
suddenly you begin to feel early in evening  she is always
there 
""
but you know  up to the twenty first of june  i think you got
 whole  long sushila
""
""
yeah
""
""
and now  when  i'm   as if  i'm  out of
job  because   the part of job it is yeah 
""
""
 part of job it is yeah  
""
""
before she    a few words  
""
""
  a few words   
""
""
there is no worry  formerly i used to think about my lesson
moreover what shall i talk
""
""
exactly exactly to keep you busy
""
""
yeah it kept me mentally busy  and now  i'm  
attending this classes 
""
""
unless i  must  say
""
""
i have got nothing else nothing to do 
""
so  in first the first thing that seem  one word 
""
""
i would i will say participate like that
""
""
  it clearly give it a hope 
""
""
 hope hope   you know
""
""
i just i just  missed it  all hope  now this is no
 eat  for  getting to missed it  so the only thing is that 
""
""
i don't know but i think uh
""
""
it was a very good experience uh 
""
""
yeah 
""
""
 a few words 
""
""
we had a nice time together  all of us 
""
""
and this evening we spent about half an hour  uh uh with
sushila  uh talking about the  sarees  that she  one
word 
""
""
the blanket on a blanket 
""
""
blanket with the shawl that she has done 
""
and my  one word   we started talking about  uh
colours  patterns and  one or two words 
""
""
 we're    just allowed because  one or two
words  
""
""
 which colour will go   with that person 
""
and uh by the by the way it is interesting that  that's  
we've  got  this thing about the indian beauty 
""
especial reference to  women  and uh  sushila was one of
the main person  but she didn't feel embarrassed  laughter  
""
a statement about  her and uh
""
""
short nose  tall  uh reminding of uh  classical
 upbringing and all that   she's  from madras
""
""
that was a very compliment   comp  comprehending
with uh historical persons 
""
""
complimenting  compliment uh compliment they are true 
""
otherwise she would feel uh  furious 
""
there is no embarrassing thinking but uhm  these are the
features and especially the sharp long nose  and i think of that
""
""
who is this lady  ?
""
""
uh  i don't have uh rajasthani painting  uh kishangarh
school and all that 
""
you will find that uh most  uh women  who are usually
dressed  as they were queens  uh people of royal family  they acted
like  a you know each and  one or two words   cough  
""
unless you think of it  you you relaxed  when it loses us
 it occurred to me there is something there 
""
and i wouldn't fall on it 
""
but today we started talking about it  and then you know uh 
you get uh uh uh  a few words  
""
""
so uh  now that  i'm  leaving on the twenty seventh
 a few words 
""
""
and you are all alone 
""
""
how long uh  will be your journey  uh perhaps
""
""
actually if i  leave this place and go straight to burdwan
then it won't take uh  uh very long time compare to other such thing like
""
""
""

""
""

""
""

""
""

""
""

""
""
then it was a
""
""
cannot move that on the way
