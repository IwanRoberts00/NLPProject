indian food is often spoken of as rich which is to say fatty
 and spicy  meaning chilli hot 
""
nothing should be farther from the truth 
""
it is unfortunate that the excessive use of   desi ghee
 which is clarified butter  or vegetable shortening and spices 
by a handful of half baked cook  made as a misunderstood food 
""
our food is rich  but not fatty 
""
it is true that we sometimes cook in a little more fat than
necessary 
""
but the amazing thing about indian cuisine is that the cooking is
deemed complete  when the fat leaves the sides or comes on the surface 
""
in other words  the ingredients  expose all fat  when fully
cooked 
""
the excess fat merely uses the cooking process 
""
in any event  it is supposed to be drained off before the dish is
served 
""
in fact the drained fat  which we call  rogan 
 can be reused and makes a better fat medium because the flavour and aroma
of spices  acquired during the cooking of the dish 
""
of course  the  rogan  cannot be used again and
again  but just once again  which is not to say that this series  is
even for one solitary moment  recommending that to use a gram or a
mililitre of extra fat 
""
the same applies for that nasty word  spicy 
""
""
the fact is  our food is spicy  not chilli hot 
""
we make use of our exotic spices for their special flavour and
aroma 
""
the use of red chilli  on the other hand  is at  one's
 own discreation  like to burn yourself  do so  don't want to
 don't burn others as well 
""
there are however  some regions which  are using more red
chillies than the others 
""
they are the exceptions rather than the rule 
""
having said that  this episode is guarantee to give lovers of
hot food  a vicarious thrill 
""
those with feeble guts  i advice to stay away from  today's
 fiery delight   cough 
""

""

""
and  believe it or not  we are going to use  sixty-four
red chillies  with two and a quarter pound of meat 
""

  translated  that means red meat 
""
one of the kinds you and i know about 
""
the red here refers to this  red chillies 
""
and he is going to use sixty of them  mind boggling figure 
""

""
""

""
""
you if you have  steel- line stomach this is just a delicacy
for you 
""
whatever my fears about red chillies   i've  got a health
mandate and get into my dig 
""
""
welcome to this dawat  the first dish in  today's 
menu is  lal maas  or red meat 
""
pieces of succulant lamb in a volcanic gravy 
""
a dish guaranteed to wake up your insights 
""
 we'll  begin with a list of ingredients 
""
two and a quarter pounds or one kilo of lamb  deboned and cut it
into one and a half inch cubes 
""
sixty red chillies 
""
one and a quarter cups  finely sliced onions 
""
one third cup  peeled and sliced garlic 
""
one cup  yoghurt 
""
one teaspoon  roasted cumin 
""
four teaspoons  corriander powder 
""
half a teaspoon turmeric powder 
""
five tablespoons refined oil 
""
the preparation time for this dish is one hour  and the cooking
time is fifty minutes 
""
with accompaniments  this dish serves approximately four people
""
""
the method 
""
remove stems from the red chillies  slit them  beseed and
soak sixty whole red chillies in a bowl of water  for fifteen minutes 
""
before you get alarmed at the quantity of red chillies used 
here is a reassuring word about red chillies 
""
""
while manjeet prepares the other ingredients  let me clear
some cobwebs about red chillies 
""
for a long time  especially outside this country  the word
spicy has been synonymous with chillies 
""
to us indians  the word spicy means a combination of exotic
spices  of which chilli is just one measly part 
""
eaten in the right quantity  and the prescribed limit is one
teaspoon  or two or three whole red chillies per person per day 
""
chillies are said to prevent cold  cold sweats induced by
tension  and cholera 
""
now in the last thing  it is important  to consume a little
bit of chilli during the monsoon 
""
""
proceeding with the preparation  whisk one cup of yoghurt
in a bowl 
""
add the red chillies  shake a dry girdle and add one
teaspoonful of cumin seeds 
""
roast lightly   noise of roasting  until the cumin pops
and emits a unique aroma 
""
now add this to the yoghurt chilli mixture   noise of
stirring 
""
add four teaspoons of corriander powder  half teaspoon turmeric
powder  and stir in salt to taste 
""
whisk  and set 
""
some of the effects of the red chillies are also neutralised by the
garlic and yoghurt in this recipe 
""
without yoghurt it would probably be impossible to digest all those
red hot chillies 
""
and now for the cooking 
""
heat five tablespoons of refined oil  add the sliced garlic and
set over a medium heat until golden   noise of stirring 
""
add the onions and stir again until golden brown   nise of
stirring 
""
finally  add the meat and stir fry until the fat begins to leave
the sides of the pan 
""
this process is also called pruno  and takes approximately five
to six minutes 
""
now add the chilli yoghurt mixture  and stir fry until the
moisture evaporates   noise of stirring 
""
to complete the cooking  add three and one third cups of water
""
""
bring to a boil  cover and simmer  stir occasionally until
the meat is cooked 
""
to check if the meat is done  take out a piece  and break it
apart 
""
the gravy should boil till it has the consistency of a thick sauce
""
""
check the salt  and the fiery red meat is done 
""
but this is best eaten with the steamed rice or  chapati
 
""
arrange chopped tomatoes and onions in a platter  and spoon on
the sizzling  lal maas  
""

""
let us proceed to the dining table  while our guest try out
this  coveted  dishes 
""
""
you know what we are eating is   murgakoli 
chikenna  when translated what that means is pepper chicken 
""
i thought they ate really spicy food 
""
""
uh it is spicy but it is slightly  fried  means a
little oil to go head off
""
you know he makes the second dish for that  laughs 
""
""
fifteen chicken pieces for this chicken and what pieces are
these ?
""
""
yeah this chicken we have used the uh  thigh of the
chicken 
""
so that you have the consistency  uh is there in the base 
""
i thought it is the same and  that every  every person gets
the same part that is important
""
""
uhm
""
""
actually we have gone a step beyond uh uhm and what we are
talking about now  is  dinapsychology 
""
uh  and the objective here is to make sure that  everybody
is  cut off meat or  the the shape of the vegetable is identical so
that  when you peep into somebody  else's  plate you don't have
this terrible sense of envy as if you know  uh  say arti has the better
piece and romi hasn't got the one that she like 
""
so we just make sure that everyboby is dining pleasurely equal by
providing an identical cut  all are being identical size of vegetables
""
""
""
but this what about  one word  may be a particular
guest would prefer to have another piece
""
""
romi  it's  not as if we sort of you know done this at
random
""
but we have consulted our butchers any how our butchery  uh
 in indian cooking is a very very strong point without that you really
can't  uh provide any good uh delicacies
""
so we consulted our butcher and  as per his advice decided for
example the case of the  murgakoli  chickenna but the ideal
stuff would be  the thigh 
""
may be manjeet can tell us a little bit more about it
""
""
yes its your own choice also  and uh  whether it may be
that must need one  dine   whether you use  dine  from the
thigh or the  one word 
""
""
i see that means originally  from the chickenna if they
have a specific piece or this you feel is inferior in now
""
""
well this uh  they feel that one  one word  of the
meat should to be used in a particular curry 
""
originally   i've  got some chicken of it used  
that's  to as a matter of fact if i may say i am looking a bit
""
you know in the south  in considering the  one word  as
a major brahminical influence
""
""
and consequently you will uh  notice that when you go down
south that  uh the pieces of meat are usually cut into very small 
sizes 
""
and they are really nugget size pieces 
""
""
but they originally do it for snacks you they will know only
use of this size
""
""
normally it can be looked this size
