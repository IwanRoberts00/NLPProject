""
""
now in this  what happens we have to take  ammonium
chloride and  clay lime  in the ratio of  three  is  to 
two 
""
what is the ratio ?
""
""
three   into   to   two
""
""
now this  i will arrange as  in  shown in the
""
""
figure
""
""
see in your figure 
""
now we heat the test tube  and we pass it the gas is allowed to
pass over  this line tower
""
why  ?
""
because when it pass through line tower the  ammonia becomes dry
""
it helps in drying    ammonia  
""
""
 ammonia  
""
""
now as this gas is lighter than air  it is collected by 
the gas jar is kept inverted over the    line tower   and
the gas is collected
""
""
 line tower  
""
""
have you understood ?
""
""
yes
""
""
now we take  this is  by  we collect by the downward
displacement of
""
""
air
""
""
now we check some of the  physical and chemical properties
of the  gas 
""
now first physical property
""
we see that  it   is    has   no colour
""
""
inside is colourless   gas 
""
""
 gas  
""
""
then the smell is strong 
""
it has a   high strong smell 
""
""
 high strong smell  
""
""
teacher  noise 
""
""
then 
""
so we can say 
""
what can we say about the smell that it is the pungent  
smell 
""
""
 smell  
""
""
  what   how   it  is  smell ?
""
""
pungent smell 
""
""
then the next property is  it is lighter than air
""
we have seen in collection of  when we are collecting the gas
 we are collecting by the downward displacement of    air 
""
""
 air  
""
""
so it is naturally   lighter than air 
""
""
 lighter than air    noise 
""
""
now this gas  is also soluble in water
""
how  can  we check  ?
""
take  water  and drift the gas  which is coming out 
""
we see that  the gas easily dissolves in water and  hence we
say that  the gas is   soluble in water  
""
""
 soluble in water    noise 
""
""
now this gas  will neither support   
cumbustion  nor  it will   burn  itself
""
""
 combustion  
""
""
 burn  
""
""
so it is not a combustible substance  nor it is supporting
   combustion 
""
""
 combustion  
""
""
means the candle will go    off  
""
""
 off  
""
""
now this gas can be easily liquidified
""
on cooling you can liquidify 
""
this make into or turn into  liquid  and it can be compressed
""
""
now have you understood the physical properties ?
""
""
yes
""
""
or no ?
""
""
yes 
""
""
now this  we see the chemical properties of the  gas
""
""
ammonia when combined  with water  you get ammonium hydroxide
""
""
what  do  you get ?
""
  ammonium hydroxide 
""
""
 ammonium hydroxide   
""
""
the formula for ammoniun hydroxide is na  four 
  o h  
""
""
 o h  
""
""
n h  four   o h  
""
""
 o h  
""
""
what is the formula for ammonium hydroxide ?
""
""
n h  four o h 
""
""
now this  when a  one or two words   takes in 
hydrochloric acid  is taken here  the jar we see that  white fumes
 of ammonium chloride  are  seen 
""
means what ?
""
ammonia react with   hydrochloric gas   to form 
  ammonium chloride  
""
""
 hydrochloric gas  
""
""
 ammonium chloride  
""
""
now once again we repeat the  physical   
properties 
""
""
 properties  
""
""
can anyone tell all the physical properties  ?
""
""
ammonia is a  uh colourless gas 
""
it is lighter than air
""
it is  it is highly soluble in water   noise 
""
""
come on next property bhushan ?
""
""
ammonia is colourless gas
""
uh  it has  uh sharp pungent uh  irritating odour 
""
it is lighter than air
""
it is soluble in water 
""
uh it can be liquidified by cooling in low pressure 
""
it is combustible in air and uh it is not 
""
""
it is combustible in air  ?
""
it is
""
""
it is not combustible in air
""
""
neither it supports 
""
""
combustion
""
""
sit down 
""
now the chemical first chemical property 
""
yes priyadarshan  ?
""
""
ammonia gas is basic 
""
""
okay and how will you can you say that ammonia gas is basic
 ?
""
it turns    red litmus to blue 
""
""
 red litmus to blue  
""
""
okay next property  ?
""
asha  ?
""
""
it reacts with water and forms ammonium hydroxide
""
""
it reacts with water and forms   ammonium hydroxide
""
""
""
 ammonium hydroxide  
""
""
what is the formula for ammonium hydroxide ?
""
you  kapil  ?
""
""
n h  three plus uh 
""
""
no teacher 
""
""
no ?
""
""
n h  four
""
""
four a 
""
""
what is the formula for uh ammonium hydroxide ?
""
""
n h  four o h 
""
""
now the gas when kept with turmeric paper  the turmeric
paper turns
""
""
yellow
""
""
brown
""
""
brown 
""
""
the yellow colour    change to brown  
""
""
 change to brown    noise 
""
""
now we see the next property 
""
you take the mixture of ammonium chloride  and make lines 
and put it in a dry  test tube 
""
now just insert a hot platinium    wire   into it
""
""
now the hot wire will supply  heat to the  mixture 
""
yes 
""
and it reacts
""
platinium is acting as a catalyst
""
now what do you mean by the word catalyst ?
""
""
 wire  
""
""
a substance which helps in chemical reaction 
""
""
one at a time 
""
the substance which helps in   increasing the rate of
reaction but does not take part in the chemical reaction  
""
""
 increasing the rate of reaction but does not take part
in the chemical reaction  
""
""
so what happens  this gas oxidised to  colourless
nitric oxide  gas 
""
ammonia gas oxidised  to colourless nitric oxide gas 
""
the nitric oxide further combines with    oxygen 
oxygen and from air and it becomes  firm  reddish   brown 
coloured  nitrogen dioxide  
""
""
 oxygen  
""
""
 brown coloured nitrogen dioxide  
""
""
this nitrogen dioxide fumes  are seen in the   test
tube  
""
""
 test tube  
""
""
so yes what happens when clay lime and ammonium chloride 
 mixed in a    taken in a   dry test tube  ?
""
when a hard platinium  wire is  inserted  when a hard
platinum wire is inserted ammonia gets oxidised  to form nitric oxide 
""
this nitric oxide  further takes oxygen from air  and you
get brown fumes of nitrogen   dioxide 
""
""
 dioxide  
""
""
here platinium wire is acting as a    catalyst 
""
""
""
 catalyst  
""
""
so can anyone repeat the point 
""
yes uma  ?
""
""
hot platinium wire is inserted in the mixture  of 
ammonium chloride and clay lime
""
then hot uh  then ammonia gas is oxidised  into nitric 
ox   nitric oxide
""
nitric oxide takes oxygen from the air  and  that  and
red brown fumes of nitrogen oxide we get 
""
""
okay 
""
now you please sit down 
""
now we see the third property  that  bb-work  cold
concentrated hydrochloric acid  is taken  in a test tube and the
ammonia gas  is passed over it 
""
it combines uh  reacts with the acid  and forms crystals of
 ammonium   chloride  
""
""
 chloride  
""
""
it  forms crystals of   ammonium chloride 
""
""
 ammonium chloride  
""
""
so n h  three  plus h cl gives you    n
h  four cl  
""
""
 n h  four cl  
""
""
have you understood ?
""
""
yes 
""
""
means it readily combines with h cl  forming crystals of
   ammonium chloride  
""
""
 ammonium chloride  
""
""
can anyone repeat the properties  ?
""
""
ammonium uh uh  reacts with
""
""
ammonia reacts with  ?
""
""
ammonium uh uh 
""
""
ammonium reacts with the oxygen two times only this much
""
""
ammonium reacts with the h cl forming crystals of ammonium
chloride 
""
""
and tell the equation   n h  three 
""
""
 n h  three   plus h cl  gives you n h
 four cl
""
""
sit down   noise 
""
now we see that  this ammonia reacts with  cold
concentrated sulphuric acid  and  nitric acid 
""
so take  sulphuric acid in one test tube and nitric acid in
   another test tube  
""
""
 another test tube  
""
""
pass ammonia gas through  this test tube 
""
we see that it reacts with sulphuric acid giving you ammonium
sulphate  crystals of ammonium sulphate  and it reacts with  nitric
acid giving you ammonium    nitrate  nitrate 
""
""
 nitrate  
""
""
so which should which  can you   tell me the 
 summarize    of  the property  that it gives salt it
forms salt with when it reacts with its  acid the  respective salts
are formed
""
have you understood ?
""
""
yes 
""
""
now see this  chlo  hydrochloric acid it is forming
 chloride  ammonium chloride
""
with sulphuric acid it is forming sulphate ammonium  
sulphate  
""
""
 sulphate  
""
""
with    nitric  acid it is forming  
ammonium nitrate  
""
""
 nitric  
""
""
 ammonium nitrate  
""
""
can anyone repeat these three properties   noise 
""
yes samir  ?
""
""
the  the ammonium reacts with  hydrochloric acid to
form  and  to form ammonium chloride  and it reacts with 
sulphuric acid to form ammonium sulphate and it  re  reacts with 
uh  nit  nitric acid to form ammonium nitrate 
""
""
so any difficulty to you  ?
""
""
no 
""
""
or you have not understood ?
""
""
yes we have understood 
""
""
so then  we see the next property 
""
when ammonia gas  is slowly passed  through copper sulphate
solution  what happens ?
""
a bluish white precipitate  is formed 
""
a bluish white precipitate of  copper hydroxide  is formed
""
""
and when more  ammonia gas is passed  this precipitate
dissolves in  the excess of ammonia and a solution  of deep colour 
blue colour is formed 
""
precipitate means 
""
what do you mean by precipitate ?
""
the residue which is remaining at the  bottom 
""
the residue or the  substance which remains at the  
bottom  
""
""
 bottom  
""
""
now see here  when  ammonia is passed through copper
sulphate  you get a bluish white precipitate 
""
but when more ammonia is added  this precipitate dissolves with
 and you get uh  da  deep blue colour solution 
""
have you understood ?
""
""
yes 
""
""
so when you pass more  ammonia the precipitate  divo
 dissolves and you get deep blue colour  solution 
""
can anyone  summarize  the properties  ?
""
summarize means tell in short 
""
all the properties  or one property uh one student 
""
""
the  che   the chemical properties of ammonia are
 ammonia gas is basic  which reacts with water and form  ammonium
hydroxide 
""
it burns in atmosphere oxygen with  yellow flame 
""
it combines with hydrogen chloride to form ammonium chloride 
""
it combines with oxygen in the presence of a catalyst to form
nitric oxide 
""
it gives phosphate acid 
""
ammonia reacts with the solution of salts of nitric to form
precipitate of that oxide 
""
""
so have you understood the chemical properties  of ammonia ?
""
""
uh yes 
""
""
now we see  the uses of  ammonia 
""
now first it is used in manufacturing
""
manufaturing means  making of washing soda  and  
sodium bi-carbonate 
""
""
 sodium bi-carbonate  
""
""
and also in nitric    acid 
""
""
 acid  
""
""
now last year we had seen how ammonia is used in preparing
nitric acid when we were studying  acid 
""
now washing soda and sodium bicarbonate are different 
""
the formula for washing soda is sodium carbonate na  two
c o    three  
""
""
 three  
""
""
and for sodium bicarbonate it is   na h c o 
three  
""
""
 na h c o  three  
""
""
now this sodium bicarbonate is used in  preparing food or
 making the substance porous 
""
while washing soda is used in   ma  washing clothes 
""
big clothes  or blankets
""
this washing soda is    used  
""
""
 used  
""
""
now it is used in  uh manufacturing of fertilisers like
ammonium phosphate  ammonium sulphate  and urea 
""
now these fertilisers  help  in increasing the food crop of
 uh by adding fertiliser what happens the quality and the quantity of the
food crop or the grains  increases 
""
so these are used ammonium is used in  as a fertiliser  so
that we can get more yield of  crop   noise 
""
now ammonia is also used in  medicine 
""
now solution of ammonia  is used in laboratory as a reagent
""
""
now what do you mean by the word reagent  ?
""
what do you mean by the word reagent ?
""
""
fooding agent  which 
""
""
a substance which helps in chemical reaction 
""
""
a substance which is helping in   chemical reaction
 is called as a   reagent  
""
""
 chemical reaction 
""
""
 reagent  
""
""
now this  liquid ammonia is also used as solvent
""
we have seen what do you mean by solvent is  in which the
substance gets   dissolved  
""
""
 dissolved  
""
""
so that  solution in which the substance is getting
dissolved is called as a    solvent  
""
""
 solvent  
""
""
now ammonia is also used as a  solvent 
""
some substance get dissolved in  ammonia 
""
now any difficulty in chemical properties  and uses of ammonia ?
""
""
no   noise 
""
""
now just  answer the questions orally   noise 
""
describe the laboratory of  ?
""
what are the chemicals  used in  preparing ammonia  by
laboratory method  ?
""
yes  ?
""
""
uh  in laboratry methods  uh ammonia ammonium chloride
and clay lime is used 
""
""
ammonium chloride and   clay lime is used 
""
""
 clay lime is used  
""
""
what is the ratio of  the  mixture  ?
""
""
the ratio of uh the mixture is three is to two 
""
""
three is to two 
""
""
what is done to the mixture  ?
""
""
the mixture is heated 
""
""
the mixture is   heated 
""
""
 heated  
""
""
what comes  out  of the tube  ?
""
""
the ammonia gas comes out 
""
""
through which it is passed  ?
""
yes  ?
""
""
it is passed through delivery tube 
""
""
to the line tower through the line tower
""
it is passed through the    line tower 
""
""
 line tower  
""
""
why is it passed through the line tower  ?
""
yes ranjeet  ?
""
""
to dry 
""
""
to    dry the gas  
""
""
 dry the gas  
""
""
how is the gas collected  ?
""
yes ?
""
""
by the downward  uh downward displacement of jar 
""
""
so any difficulty in this
""
""
no
