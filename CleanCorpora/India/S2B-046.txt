my dear ladies and gentleman 
""
i would like to speak on the relevance of  english education 
andbeyond 
""
in fact uh  i am not going to deal with   the
beyond  
""
i am going to speakonly on   the relevance of 
english education  
""
uh let me start with the  background
""
there was a time  when   the sun did not set from
the british empire  
""
that is  the empire spread almost all over the world 
""
along with the empire the english language also spread all over the
world 
""
now the sun almost  does not arise on the british empire 
""
but  the english language has now  become  an
international language  known all over the world 
""
what is more  it is the  intelligentia of the world language
""
""
now  less than half of the globe  speaks english  as its
native speaker  native language 
""
they are the inhabitants of  great britain  u.s.a.  canada
 australia  new zealand  the caribbean  and south africa 
""
and this accounts for  three hundred million speakers 
""
in the rest of the world  englishis used  in various other
parts  either as foreign language  or a second language  including
in the u.s.s.  r.
""
however restricted in its  way 
""
roughly  there are three  major speech communities 
spoken  all over the world 
""
first   the native speakers   second 
 second language speakers   and third  
foreign languagespeakers  
""
the predominant position of english in the world  had something
to do with two  factors 
""
one  is the colonisation of british empire  among otherminor
european powers  towards the end of nineteenth century  and stabilized
in the  year twentieth century  until the  outbreak of  
south  wo   second world war
""
and secondly  the independence from the british colonies from
the  end of second world  war  which has been  on 
""
the latest as you know is hong kong  which will be free in
nineteen ninety-seven 
""
after independence  the new countries  were  confronted
with theproblem of national language  and or  official language 
""
a few african  and asian countries opted for  english
""
the transition  was not very easy  as many factors were
involved  particularly the size of the country  and the  size of the
speech communities  whether they are  mon  mono-lingual  or
multi-lingual  communities 
""
the case of india is a very special one 
""
one thing that happened to india after independence was that 
the number of  princely states  thanks to  sardar patel were 
integrated into the erstwhile british provinces 
""
secondly  we have already  by this time  a  de
facto    lingua franca   in fact  two
 lingua francas   if you like  english  and hindi
""
""
now the position of english in india  is that  at the
time of independence  english was the  de facto
official language  but soon  after that we decided to accept hindi as
our national language  as  en  enshrined in the  indian
constitution 
""
along with hindi  we decided to continue with english as an
associate official language for  fifteen years  from the 
commencement of the indian constitution  in nineteen fifty  up to
nineteen sixty-five 
""
in the meantime  wedecided to cultivate and develop hindi  to
take over from english in the hope that  it would be  relegated to
the position of foreign language  that is  for restrictive
functions 
""
and hindi would take over fully  not only as a national language
 but also as the official language  and as the   lingua
franca   of the pan-indian language 
""
however  during the period of fifteenyears  something seems
to have gone wrong 
""
perhaps  because of one of the  uh factors  that is the
 creation of linguistic states  the position of hindi seems to have
suffered a setback  and we had to continue english as an associate
official language  indefinitely 
""
so  at the moment  our national language is hindi  our+
official  language is english  and our lingua franca
   link language  seems to be divided
 broadly speaking english and hindi 
""
these link languages cut across the two regions  north and south
 on the one hand  and the two sections of society all over the country
""
""
english as second language in india 
""
it might be useful to remember at the backof our mind  the
concept of  second language before we go on 
""
 second language  by definition fulfills 
four important functions  namely  instrumental  regulative
 interpersonal  and imaginative  
""
in india  the main instrumental and regulative functions are
 fulfilled by  education and administration  respectively 
""
the interpersonal function is fulfilled by  one of the link
languages that is english 
""
it is in fact a linklanguage between the regional language 
speakers  especiallythose who do not understand hindi  or even if they
 knowhindi  will prefer it to  english 
""
finally the imaginative function is fulfilled by a large body of
 well established literature namely   indian writing in
english   next only to native english literatures  such as
british  american  australian  canadian and other literatures
""
""
 the ups and downs in the position of english 
""
""
we can discern  two phase  phases  in post independent
era of english inindia 
""
the first up to nineteen sixty-five  and the second after that
""
""
even before independence the medium of instruction at  regional
language at the secondary schools and  english as second  languages
 was taught in  all such schools 
""
there were of course  certain  english medium schools also
""
""
and the medium of instruction was uh  english throughout
post-school level
""
as early as nineteen forty  nine   the university
education commission  recommended a gradual  change over of 
mediu   medium of instruction+ from english to  indian languages
 at the higher stage   at the  also 
""
the three languages  regional federal  presumably hindi
 and english  are to be studied at   seco   at higher
secondary and  university stages 
""
in the year nineteen fifty-one fifty-two   the
secondary education commission recommended that the study of
english  should be given importance in secondary schools  and
facilities  shouldbe made available at the middle school stage  for
its study on an optional basis 
""
thus  english was taught  as a main second language  at
the  school system  in all the stages  and in all the  states
""
""
it was taughtfor  anything between four to seven years 
partly or wholly as a compulsory subject 
""
the report of the  official language commission nineteen
fifty-six   made a clear cut distinction between   lan
  english language  and english literature 
""
hitherto english literature was taught  even   with
  at   the  school stage  but now  the regional
languages had  already become the medium of instruction throughout the
secondary schools  and gradually it was  being  used as a medium of
 certain  faculties  even at the university stage 
""
under the circumstances  the position of english has undergone a
great change 
""
inthe words of the report  uh  i quote  
english has to be taught  hereafter  as a language of comprehension
rather than  as a  literary language   unquote 
""
after the creation of the linguistic states  we witnessed one of
the most controversial   issue   issues    in indian
education  that is the place of english  in our educational set up 
""
from  angrezi hatao    
downwith english   at one extreme  to  english as the
sole medium of education   at the other 
""
were widespread  unrest  and riots all over the country
""
""
it is in this context that  the three language formula
 was  proposed 
""
it was subsequently modified in the  kothari commission report
 nineteen sixty-four sixty-six 
""
 the three language formula  sought  i quote
  to establish   equally   equality  
with regard to the study of language between hindi and non-hindi  
speaker    speaking    areas 
""
it recommended that  as against the third language  hindi
 along  uh   another   lan    another indian
language    besides hindi and english  should be studied by
 pupils in hindi speaking area  unquote 
""
this almost amounts to  punishment 
""
there was no motivation whatsoever for the hindi speaking  pupil
 to learn another modern  indian language  modern  
english   indian   language 
""
thus   the three language formula  seems to
have failed 
""
in the meantime  the role of english  has undergone change
""
""
as we have mentioned earlier  instead of english literature 
we have sought to cultivate  english language 
""
pioneering work has been undertaken by the central institute of
english c.i.e. hyderabad  created in nineteen fifty-eight 
""
english began to be  considered as second language  and the
appropriate methods of teaching english were  proposed
""
in course of time  several other institutions like the regional
institute of english  r.i.e.  state institute of english s.i.e  and
so on  spread 
""
and on the whole the overall educational facilities had tremendously
increased
""
not only in school level  but also at the college and university
levels 
""
the latest  all india education commission kothari
commission report   has advocated the study of  english 
on an optional basis at the primary level  that is  from  fifth
to seventh  and on  secondary basis at the secondary level  that is
 eight to ten  and again  optional  basis higher secondary
level  that is  uhm eleven to twelve in its scheme of  seven
 uh twelve year school  and three year degree course  for the
entire country  that is  ten plus two plus three 
""
and the position of english has been  prescribed sorry 
described  as a  library language 
""
today   english is   english in india  is an
important  if not compulsory  secondary language  at all stages of
education 
""
now let me  uhm  look at   the national
policy of education  and   plan action  
""
two decades of intense planning and  implementation of mass
education  that is  quantitative  improve improve  
improvement  the government of india hasnow turned to the  qualitative
improvement of  uhimprovement of educational facilities 
""
in the year nineteen eighty-six  the national policy of education
and plan of action  popularly  known as   npe 
and  poa   modified in nineteen ninety-two were
launched 
""
it then reviewed the national policy from nineteen sixty-eight to
nineteen eighty-six  and noted that  there have been  slow progress
in the implementation of these recommendations  and emphasised the need
for a  dynamic approach 
""
as far as the development of language is concerned  the medium of
instruction at the  university stage  has been  unsatisfactory on
account of two factors  ( a) the preparation and production of these text
books has not  synchronised with the universities decision to switch
over  to    modern english   modern indian  
languages 
""
and ( b)  secondly  second uhm uhm university teacher 
having received education through english  find it difficult to teach
through their  english language in indian languages 
""
more importantly  the universities are reluctant to change their
medium ofinstruction in regard to  indian languages because  the lack
of employment opportunities to those who have studied in those languages 
""
there is no special mention of medium of instruction in the chapter
on higher education in this document 
""
however  the development of english language  trained 
 uh training institution is encouraged 
""
+ centres  have been set up for  imparting training to
english language teacher  at  school stage and  have trained
one point five  lakh  of english teachers 
""
now  among other things  the  npe suggests  the
delinking of degree requirement for employment  wherever  feasible
""
""
one of themost important measures taken in respect of 
qualitative improvement of the  engl  education  was the creation of
 institutes   institutions of  excellence uh 
navodaya  vidyalaya 
""
since nineteen eighty-six   navodaya  
vidya vidyanagar vid   vidyalayas  were set up in two
hundred and eighty districts  spread over  twenty-nine states  and
union  territories of   territories for  children  who are
potentially high  achiever 
""
 acharya rammurthi commissionreport  notes 
that  in the name of qualitative improvement of education  the
national policy of educationand programme of  action  have been
criticised for the   reclu   uh exclusion of the poor 
from the educational process  and he  decries  elitism 
""
the relevance of english education 
""
we have now to ask a question  how relevant  english
education is  in our country ? 
""
 i've  been asked to make a statement not only about the
relevance of  english education butalso beyond it 
""
but  first   let me  make certain statements of the
first part   how relevant  english education is  ?
""
""
you will find from the  fifth uh fifth   all india
education survey  of the ncert nineteen ninety-two  compiled
in nineteen eighty-six that is  ten years ago  there were two major
language   medium   uh medium schools all over the country 
""
one   hindi medium    hindi medium schools
 and two   english medium schools  
""
apart from these there were several indian language medium
schools  particularly mother tongue  languages   language
schools  which were  minor ones 
""
all put together  there were six point four  lakh
 of schools in the country  at all levels  primary  upper
primary and secondary 
""
out of these  the majority of english medium schools account for
two point four four  lakhs  of  schools  followed by
 uhm zero point nine nine  lakh  that is  less than one
 lakh  of hindi medium schools 
""
that is to say  that all the media of instructions in the whole
of india  there were six point four  lakh  of schools 
outof which  english medium schools account for  four  two point
four four  lakhs  
""
that is more than one third of all the schools in the entire
country 
""
what is more interesting is that  the english medium
schoolswere much more  both in the urban  and the  ural  uh the
rural  sections 
""
in the rural areas  there were seventy-five thousand hindi
medium schools  as against two  lakh  of english medium
schools that is  two and a half time 
""
similarly in the urban sector  there were only  twenty-four
thousand hindi medium schools as against uh  forty-nine thousand english
medium schools  that is  as much as double the number 
""
in that  there were more number of english medium schools in
rural areas  than in urban  ones 
""
these statistics    perve    pertaining 
 to the  prevailing year nineteen eighty-six 
""
today in the year nineteen ninety-six  what  that is 
ten year after that  what is the real situation ? 
""
we do not know the  statistics now  but  we can project
it  on an  impressional  uh impressionistic basis for example
 a small town my own place  kolhapur
