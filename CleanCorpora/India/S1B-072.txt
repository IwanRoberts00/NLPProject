in the absence of  dr shastri  for some time  who
had been the guiding spirit  for  the preparation  of text books
 from nineth to  twelfth 
""
during his absence  we have  done our best  to select
some passages 
""
i now welcomes him   i we   we welcome him  to 
to take the reins in his hand 
""
so  just to take a review  of what  we've  done  i
would  like to  request  professor  patil-kulkarni  and
 principal  krishnamurthy  to  make us  rather  available
 the list of the articles  or the passages  that have been 
selected 
""
i  request  patil-kulkarni  to  give the  brief 
""
""
according to the plan  evolved by  the board of studies
in english  of said board of  secondary and higher secondary 
english  pune 
""
uh we have  in all seven units  of which  the first unit
is called informative writing 
""
the second one is note-making 
""
third unit is distance communication 
""
but the final decision is not yet taken regarding this one 
""
the fourth unit is  reading and responding to advertisements
""
""
workshop is to be done  in this  next week 
""
and the fifth one is reading newspaper 
""
almost  complete selection has been made  as far as this
particular  unit is concerned 
""
and  i may speak  a few words  regarding the selection
that has been made  and the contents of various  items that have
appeared  under this unit  reading the newspaper 
""
as we all know  newspaper forms  an essential part of 
civilized society 
""
without newspaper  people will be  in dark  of what has
happened  been happening  all over the world  and around  their
own village or town 
""
and so we thought it  essential  to    intr 
introduced   introduce   this one unit  for the benefit of
 the students  studying in  twelfth standard 
""
we have selected   a  various  articles 
according to their sections 
""
the sections may be  alright  interruption 
""
one short news  another  letters to the  editor 
""
other forms  a report 
""
and  one form  uh the editorial  section of  the
newspaper 
""
and then another  spot news  all these are relevant  to
the understanding of what has been happening around us 
""
the first one of these  is about an accident which took place
in bengal  and about forty-one people were killed  in the coal mine
""
""
it might have been due to the fire that broke out  and also 
due to  carbon monoxide  which they breathe  and then they died 
 cough 
""
several bodies have been recovered  where the final report is
not yet available 
""
but then every one has said that about forty-one  miners were
killed 
""
second one is from   one word  to  the letters to the
editor 
""
one writes it about highway development 
""
taking into consideration all development that have been made 
recent years 
""
the  writer opines  that  we are lagging far behind 
perhaps generations behind  the other countries  our asian countries
particularly  singapore  indonesia  malaysia etcetera 
""
they have forged far ahead of us  in the maintenance of  the
highways 
""
so here   presented  a few  developments that have
been taken by  the government of india  in maintaining  the highways
""
""
the last two of it  is  consist spot news  giving
information regarding  what's  happening at the centre  for the
budget session was opened on the last day of the session 
""
the information is given earlier  and what items could be
included  into the session into the small views  mentioned 
""
we shall come back to it
""
 that's  about unit five 
""
unit six deals with persuading  for which  others will speak
""
""
and seventh unit narrating  would be   at   spoken
about by  some other person 
""
and then we come to imaginative writing  section two 
""
and which contains  poems and  other imaginative things 
""
and the last section is  rapid reading  which particularly
full of short  short stories 
""
and in the earlier section  imaginative writing  we have
selected  a number of poems 
""
out of ten i will present  only three poems only  two or
three poems 
""
and in this  another one   pulley   by
george herbert  which  many of the people already know about it 
""
it tells about  the human being  generation and regeneration
 and the humanisation or  whatever it is  in this world 
""
 they're  known to each and everyone i don't think  
i'll  spent   much time on this 
""
""
 you can pass   pass over
""
""
pass over 
""
""
and the next one is  uh by a black poet  oleghe 
""
i feel   a sudden storm   the
environmental  situation  presented in this poem  is almost
similar to  indian  environment 
""
before storm comes  rain comes  there is a lull  lull
before the storm 
""
and children gather  in that lull  and the coming sign of
storm  people are worried  they go in search of their children 
""
they are calling them  of   but the children don't listen
to them
""
for children love the storm  and it is about to rain 
""
and suddenly  when all the winds are cleared  people are
there in their houses 
""
storm raises  thunder takes over  lightning is there and
suddenly it starts pouring down 
""
and  children  enjoy themselves  playing out in the rain
""
that is a poem  by  a black poet  which is also very
relevant  of indian   one word  
""
after this we go to  the rapid reading section uh 
""
 i'll  speak on only  two or three
""
""
fine 
""
""
uh  haan  
""
""
yeah 
""
""
uh selected  stories 
""
one is  the well known story   the cop and the
anthem   by o henry 
""
this is typical henrian  uh short story  having a twist in
the tale 
""
you know how that is 
""
here  a  one word  convict  soapy  he is now
facing  an ordeal 
""
as the winter was approaching  he wanted to find a shelter 
warm shelter from that  interruption  
""
the best idea was to go back to prison  so that  he would get
some warm corner there 
""
but unfortunately all his efforts  in trying to go back to the
prison  failed 
""
sincere efforts at that  but then  when all these things
failed  he comes near  a church  where prayer was going on 
""
and he felt certain trasformation 
""
so he decided  to live  a honest life  put an end to 
his  stop  this stealing business 
""
but the moment this transformation came  next came the hand of a
cop  on his shoulder    one word  what are you doing here 
he says  nothing 
""
""
  one word   
""
""
and the last one that  i'm  discussing on  is
 the nightingale  
""
 nightingale  again brings to  to our
memories  various feelings  that we pines for nightingale  and 
story viewers also have written on nightingale 
""
this one is  by  hans anderson 
""
this a lengthy story  telling about  a bird  nightingale
bird  who sings sweetly  in some remote corner  on the  shores
""
""
there was an emperor  chinese emperor  who has  all the
greatest things in the world  in his empire  in his court 
""
and then somehow he comes to know  casually  there is a
wonderful bird  singing a  very melodious song  day and night 
""
he likes to hear that 
""
ultimately the girl who had heard it first  persuade this bird
 to   comes   come   to   king's  court
""
""
and then  the bird sings  to the satisfaction of the great
emperor 
""
and  this emperor  makes  a golden cage for it  with
all the amenities  and a place  a designation in the court honour 
as a court singer 
""
the bird everyday goes on singing 
""
but this she cannot continue for a long time  the bird is also
mortal being 
""
and so  to immortalise the song of a bird  a genius was there
 scientist  who made a machine  which would reproduce the song 
exactly as nightingale 
""
when the button was on  it will go on singing like nightingale
""
""
and the people appreciated him 
""
and then everyone neglected this bird  original bird 
""
and the bird felt very sad 
""
and it flew away  from 
""
and then once this machine is  uh that  gets out of order
 though it was repaired it could not produce the  melodious song as
before 
""
then the emperor  felt that he was missing this music 
""
and on account of this he fell ill 
""
people went in search of the bird they could not find 
""
ultimately  the emperor thinks of  nightingale bird 
prays the bird  to come back to  emperor  the emperor was on his
death bed  so he  is  only saved  by the song of the bird 
""
the bird comes   two words  from  one word  of
the window  and then  sings 
""
the emperor very much  one word  he started recovering 
""
he only said that  we can talk again the whole  one word
  but  it'll  come  sometimes  say once in a day 
once in a week  to sing  to the emperor  one word  
""
so this is the story of nightingale 
""
with these few  one word  i think  i've  spoken 
uh within the specified time that was given to me  to review  the
items that have been selected  for this particular book  for standard
english text book  which commence from ninety-five  june  thank
you 
""
""
thank you  sir 
""
infact   i'm  divided between  recording broken 
these are  i should compliment you  or offer my thanks 
""
i  began  that uh  you are going to give a kind of
report  and  it was rather a kind of prosiac begining i think 
""
and now i think  when i heard  your review  of the 
units that  you have selected  i rather feel  that  i've 
 travelled through the  realms of gold  
""
thank you  thank you  now
""
""
thank you mr kaned  for this opportunity given to me 
to review  a few of the lessons  selected by us  for uh  the
twelfth class  english text 
""
i begin with uh  rapid reading section 
""
we have  selected  about uh  ten stories 
""
and i feel  the main considerations  behind the selection
of these stories  are  number one  the sustained interest 
""
two  suitability for the age group 
""
three  the moral orientation  the story may have 
""
and  lastly  the variety 
""
of these stories i take first   fate  a woman 
and a ruby  
""
it is a detective story  from the files of  cecil bishop
 c i d  scotland yard 
""
the story  narrates  in a very gripping  manner 
how  bishop  was able  to find out  the lost  ruby 
""
in this  he makes several efforts 
""
and a woman came to his uh    age   aid  
""
""
but even  after uh very long  search  almost  he
gave up hope  at that moment  fate came to his  uh aid 
""
and with the help of the fate  he was able  in the end 
to detect  this uh  lost ruby 
""
 it's  a very  fine  absorbing  detective story
""
""
but second story  that  i've  selected is  the
accursed house   by emile  gaboriau 
""
it is a story on human psychology 
""
vicomte  reduces the rents of  the buildings  with very
good intention  of helping the tenants 
""
but unfortunately  this  intention was misunderstood 
and the people began to smell  something foul 
""
and they thought  that there must be some other motive 
behind it 
""
and then  one after the other  all the tenants  desert
the  uh house 
""
and thus the house becomes an accursed  house 
""
the third story   the fortune tellers  
which is a folk tale  it tells about  story of uh  scholars 
who  out of their greediness  ruined themselves 
""
the fourth story  is uh  foolish friends 
 by premchand  one of the famous  indian short short story writer
""
""
he describes  how sometimes  even  good friends 
with good intention  may become embarrassing  to the extent of even
ruining  the people  whom they want to  help 
""
here it is about  few boys i mean  two boys  i mean one
boy and the girl  who out of their curiosity  and also out of their
intention to help them 
""
uh eggs in the nest  ultimately  ruin it 
""
and the  the next story  once upon a christmas
  by pearl buck 
""
he is very absorbing absorbingly narrated story  of a boy 
who comes to the writer  on the eve of uh  christmas 
""
and she  adopts him  she becomes grownup 
""
and he becomes a doctor 
""
and afterwards there were troubles in china  china splits 
""
and uh  pearl buck  wanted to return  home 
""
she wanted  the boy also  to accompany her 
""
but he refused 
""
and  he wants to stay back in china  doing self-less
service  to the people 
""
she tells him  that the communist may not allow him  to do
the type of uh service 
""
but he says  he is determined to stay  whatever may happen
to  him 
""
ultimately he is uh  shot dead 
""
and uh  after these few stories  i want to take up  one
or two poems  that  i've  uh  the opportunity of selecting 
""
one is  the poem  what kind of a  place
 
""
 what kind of place   this is by  uma
parmeshwaran 
""
this is a satire  on uh modern life 
""
now  we find  all the windows and the doors of the house
 shut 
""
and the curtains withdrawn
""
the curtains  and no breeze comes in 
""
we don't have the opportunity of seeing uh  the  natural uh
beauty 
""
and uh even  our way of life is so changed  that there is
no distinction between man and uh  woman as far as social life is
concerned
""
they move  they move together they mix with each other 
which  for an  old  father  looks very odd 
""
and even  cooking  is done once for uh  in a month 
""
and  he expresses  his displeasure  for this life 
and uh  he wants his son to open  the windows and the door  so that
he can have the opportunity  to  breathe fresh air  and see 
nature in all its splendour 
""
and the  next poem is  the  whiner's  plaint
 in search of identity  
""
this poem is about  an indian  who is not known as indian
in his uh country  but known as  a  madrasi  or a
brahmin or a hindu or a muslim 
""
and uh he doesn't feel happy  with these labels  that are
attached  to that  persons 
""
and he wants  to be known  only as  an indian 
""
and these are the  two poems  on which  i wanted to 
say a few words 
""
and thank you very much for this opportunity given   two
words 
""
""
in fact  story has been the  first love  of every
generation 
""
and uh  with so much visualisation  and uh  rather so
much pain staking labour  we have selected  the stories  with
variety of subjects 
""
and  we feel no doubt  that these would be  very
interesting 
""
in fact  the stories are interesting  but the story
telling was also interesting 
""
and therefore for a moment  we thought  that the time 
had stopped 
""
when  you  switched to  poetry  and as i know 
that it is your first love  and  the way you  said something
about the poem that you have selected  has aroused curiosity  in our
mind 
""
and it would be  appreciated by the students  at large 
""
i am reminded again  of the   one word  seed 
that may sprout  and flower  when the text books  comes into light
""
""
thank you very much  thank you
