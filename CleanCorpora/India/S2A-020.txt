""
 it's  a great privilege for me to be  commentating
on the  women tennis  because uh  of the past experience for
nineteen eighty nineteen years lawn tennis 
""
i was just before the match  speaking with uh  nirupama that
on the screen you see janaki 
""
and uh  janaki is from bombay  and she is uh  janaki is
from bombay and she is uh  looking fit at the moment 
""
she has lost uh  this is a wrong caption i think we are showing
""
""
that about i was pointing out 
""
""
uh this is
""
""
this is nirupama   that's  nirupama and she is 
seventeen years now 
""
so i was just telling you telling the viewers that just before i
entered the uh  commentators box i was talking to nirupama  and i was
talking to her father 
""
in fact we have her father here with us in the commentary box 
""
and they both were telling me that uh  nirupama was  when
she was about fourteen  this girl was already  uh uh number one in
india
""
she had won the national uh  championship hard court and she has
shown great promise 
""
but again from the age of fourteen one never found her being picked
up  and groomed much earlier  and she also suffers from the same
problem
""
she says  now  i'm  already seventeen  and 
it's  so late  
""
and uh  why didn't she go into  big game and big tennis at
the age of  thirteen or fourteen  ?
""
the same answer that lack of finances lack of support  and uh
 for women tennis i don't think india is a right place at all 
""
 we've   it's it's  continuing for years on end 
""
i remember the same thing used to happen  uptil nineteen
eighty-one  until nineteen eighty-two till i played tennis  and the
same thing is continuing in ninety-four
""
where have we come ten years from now 
""
 i'd  like to uh uh  interview her father in fact 
""
why don't you come and share your views with us  ?
""
 we'll  do that a bit later because we have the  first
game  in progress 
""
and  that's  nirupama serving the first serve  
applause 
""
beautiful crosscourt returned by janaki 
""
love fifteen 
""
you see janaki nirupama serving now to  janaki 
""
 that's  a beautiful forehand  down the line returned
  applaud 
""
and  that's  love thirty  to nirupama on her service 
""
keeping the ball in play  nirupama claiming fifteen thirty 
for the first set 
""
next shot there  a beautiful return  by janaki cross again
""
""
put away forehand crosscourt volley 
""
 that's  the recaption again 
""
a very good  pick up there by nirupama  makes it 
fifteen forty 
""
 that's  a drop shot there by janaki 
""
nirupama did not even try for this ball i think it is far too long
for her to run 
""
in uh  leading tennis unfortunately service has never played
such a major  role 
""
and there we have first break 
""
whereas in  men's  tennis it  acquires much greater
significance  probably because the boys follow up their service to the
net  and the women even after serving tend to stick it on in the base line
""
""
and that makes the service as good as any other ball 
""
it looses  it's   significance altogether 
""
when we have big service in the world like martina navratilova and
 beligin king   and they used to follow up their balls to the net
""
""
and once they did that  it made their service and it made their
ball and made the volley much more effective 
""
for it one has to stay around at the base line then service really
 does not have that much of significance 
""
we have the first break of nirupama  and janaki up one love in
the first set 
""
we hope that the   women's  tennis is not such a wash out
as it was in the  men's    cough 
""
love fifteen 
""
nirupama has beaten janaki earlier when they met this year  
that's  what she told me 
""
the ball seems to be much faster on grass for janaki   cough
""
""
janaki serving love thirty 
""
oh  janaki is uh  relying on this rough shot 
""
but i don't find nirupama making any effort to come forward 
""
this tactics of janaki is going to pay off untill  unless
nirupama tries to come up to the net 
""
beautiful shot there by janaki a beautiful forehand crosscourt
taking a round of the court 
""
equalising the score  at thirty all 
""
first of service 
""
forty thirty   cough 
""
beautiful shot there by nirupama  taking on the offensive for
the first time  and hitting that ball  crosscourt forehand 
""
there is that replay  a slight backhand return by janaki and
that the put away  crosscourt 
""
deuce  first first service   interruption 
""
uh  nirupama trying to  make a winner out of it second
return  second service  however she missed the points  she  went
in the prickly part where the ball didn't got 
""
 that's  deuce once again  first first service 
""
return of service  good return of service by nirupama  
cough 
""
i think that  nirupama really threw away that point  she
had a break point  from  janaki's  service 
""
 it's  not going to be a very easy  match for her if she
throws away such easy points 
""
good backhand 
""
oh  janaki just  could not keep up the consistency  and
hit the ball  double fisted backhand out 
""
advantage once again to nirupama  to take a break back  into
the first set 
""
second service janaki serving  advantage to nirupama  safe
backhand return 
""
beautiful shot there by nirupama  who's  taken on the
offensive  hitting on both the flags very beautifully  and has broken
that  service of janaki  making it  one game all 
""
and  there's  the replay of that shot  that wonderful
forehand crosscourt winners  and no way could janaki ever reach that ball
""
""
one game all  first set 
""
very good return of service there by janaki  meeting the ball
early  and using the  timing of the service 
""
 there's  that 
""
quick return of service there by janaki  and  that's 
the return of nirupama through down   cough 
""
yes  janaki slices the ball  far too often 
""
 that's  a nice shot there by janaki  making it 
thirty all 
""
he took she took the ball on the line   that's  the
replay  and you see her totally bent in total position  going in for
that  tidal line forehand winner 
""
oh  that was just  total bad luck she tried to hit forehand
crosscourt 
""
i think she needed to bend a little more 
""
nirupama serving  forty thirty 
""
foul  out 
""
 that's  deuce once again 
""
nirupama needs to get back into the game with more consistency now
""
""
beautiful shot there by janaki  brought the low ball  low
ball  returned beautifully by janaki there 
""
see how low the ball is keeping  see  and she is able to 
hit that winner 
""
uhm  good service there by nirupama  stretching around the
backhand corner 
""
and justifies only low return 
""
deuce once again 
""
foul first service  advantage janaki 
""
third person 
""
wonderful top spin  backhand return by janaki  forcing 
nirupama to deuce once again 
""
now a drop shot there by nirupama 
""
i don't think she  really wanted to hit that shot it was 
stroke of luck that  fell so short 
""
in grasscourt say if it is a drop shot it gets uh  difficult to
handle it   cough 
""
that game to nirupama  leading two one in the first set 
""
to carry on the commentary mahin kapoor 
""
to carry on the commentary mahin kapoor 
""
""
she is  coming out with the shots  which in the
beginning she wasn't 
""
she is getting to the winner  she's  getting the rhythm now
 and is able to  reach the ball faster  and even the timing of
the ball is much more accurate with her now 
""
""
and uh 
""
""
beautiful 
""
that was a beautiful shot there by janaki krishnamurthy
""
what all can see here is the  low rally which they had 
this kind of of  best long rally uh in the match here  there you can
see the  crosscourt backhand return  and once again a crosscourt
return by  nirupama and down the line winner 
""
""
all are just 
""
""
beautiful shot there by nirupama 
""
beautiful shot  out of the blue 
""
you could see nirupama doing a little variation in that game 
""
she started tossing the ball a little higher 
""
you could see that toss now 
""
 that's  the winner across  she sprung out of the blue
""
""
fifteen all 
""
oh   that's   nirupama's  mistake there 
""
she needs to steady down a little more 
""
fifteen thirty  uh thirty fifteen 
""
 that's  janaki  a few words  which is  not
called for at the moment at all 
""
 that's  the beautiful  slice uh combat between the two
 girls  a shot slight backhand combat with  two words  it went
on and on until the  janaki gave up 
""
 that's  a break point for nirupama  and a set point
also  of the first set 
""
 that's  it the set goes to nirupama  at six two 
""
""
 in hindi 
""
""
 in hindi  she played very well 
""
see what nirupama was  rightly telling me is that uh  she
has showed potential much earlier 
""
but she says that uh   nobody did anything for me 
and i had no financer 
""
in fact i told her  you're  from  tamil nadu and tamil
nadu does a lot
""
but she said  no  i have not got anything from any
support from any quarter  
""
the  women's  tennis also needs to be picked up you see
""
""
beautiful but missed shot there by janaki  first 
""
thirty love to nirupama 
""
lovely shot again 
""
nirupama is really showing a lot of confidence in her strokes 
""
just shaping up well playing well  and she still has uh 
good future ahead of her 
""
""
 in hindi 
""
""
 in hindi  and then uh nirupama also needs to  go
up on the net much more than she has taken her position 
""
oh  that ball was called out so  forty fifteen to nirupama
""
""
janaki is not showing any  signs of coming back 
""
in the  beginning game of the second set 
""
oh ho beautiful shot there by janaki
""
i think that   she's  really gone out of the way with
the slight backhand and forehand crosscourt return there 
""
 that's   the replay and  that's  the crosscourt
shot that janaki gave up 
""
 it's  beautiful  crosscourt  winner 
""
forty thirty to nirupama 
""
easy return  beautiful shot there  easy sitter there
sitting there for nirupama to put on net 
""
you know there is one thing i wanted to share with you mahin 
   haan   and also for the benefit of our viewers
 that  ours uh  that see uh replay which  we've  been
watching then  i'll  share it with you  there is that put away shot
which gives her a game 
""
you know in our country   it's  very difficult for women
to come forward at this level 
""
see for men  it's  much easier 
""
our country it is very traditional  and a women has to perform
many roles 
""
she has to also be a housewife 
""
she also has to be a daughter at home  she also has to do her
studies 
""
and if they come forward and perform like this in matches 
then they should be encouraged  because they have a triple role if they
become a sportswomen 
""
they have  because in india sports alone is not enough they ask
you what else are you  ?
""
what are you in your studies ?
""
and are you an m b a ?
""
or are you a ph d  ?
""
 it's  very important in our country to be a ph  d's
 also 
""
and plus a woman  is never only a ph d and a sportswoman 
she also has to look after her home  she has to have babies 
""
so therefore you know  for a woman life is much more tougher
 and if she comes out of her shell and becomes a sportswoman  i think
she needs all the applause and the encouragement which she deserves 
""
""
  haan   
""
""
 in hindi 
""
""
but this nirupama is showing promise but   in hindi
 then the age is over   applaud 
""
fifteen all  nirupama was saying  she's  uh 
attending an academy  abroad  she's   training there 
""
just imagine the the expense and who is paying for it 
""
now  if the family is  uske peeche   
it's  okay otherwise  there's  nobody 
""
""
her mother is uh  with her in the academy 
""
""
uh nirupama
""
""
nirupama 
""
i remember for  seventeen eighteen years my mother travelled
with me  otherwise who is there to be with us 
""
she travelled all over the country with me 
""
beautiful shot there by janaki 
""
janaki can sometimes pull up some beautiful  ground strokes
""
""
""
 in hindi 
""
""
she just needs a little more experience 
""
""
over first service 
""
uh  but she is able to do that  well did service and that
one game all in the second set 
""
but she returns the service is not very effective
