coming

thirty-six  thirty-seven  anybody  wants any clarification please
come 
""
""
yeah  interruption 
""
""
let me tell you  
""
 one word  donation of  one word  
""
""
anybody giving donation we are giving receipt   that's
 the one thing  
""
 a few words  
""
""
no  let me make it very clear 
""
we are not taking any donation  from the parents  for
admission of the children  to the school 
""
we are taking the donation  from anybody  parents 
students  well wishers  uh connected unconnected anybody 
""
whenever we take any donation  we issue the receipt 
""
 one or two words 
""
""
every donor is given a receipt 
""
""
see we continously collect  uh donations  irrespective
of their status 
""
and then we issue the receipts 
""
now  uh we have uh always tried to maintain  cordial
relations with the parents  and uh often  uh our english medium
parents  they are more alert and active than  uh the parents of the
kannada  school  because they come from the economically higher
strata in the society 
""
and uh  they  are  also often give us suggestions and
ideas  to improve the working of the school 
""
and we always accept their suggestions if they are  uh uh
academically sound  and financially feasible to implement uh  these
ideas and suggestions 
""
now sometime of course the  uh the parents may say that we need
 uh more time for childrens to play and  uh badminton court  and
such suggestions are also made 
""
but they are not within uh uh you see our  abilities for the
time being  but the point is that we too  uh meet  and we had
recently  about uh  three    we    weeks 
 back  in the month of november we had a meeting uh  of the junior
uh k g k g section and primary  and subsequently after a week  on the
twenty  uh seventh of november  we had a meeting with the  uh
parents of english secondary school 
""
uh we have tried in the past six years  though not this year
 to have a meeting of the parents of kannada  uh teach kannada school
""
but  uh response has been very  limited and therefore we
didn't try
""
but next year  we will also have the meeting  uh of the
kannada parents 
""
now  mr chairman i had received  a letter  addressed by
keshavrao  of fourteen points 
""
this is within his right because
""
""
he is a member
""
""
he is a member and we had printed if you have any question on
report  you should raise it in writing three days before  he has sent
the  letter  and i had prepared the answers  but he is not uh
present 
""
""
 i'll  ask the secretary to hurriedly  uh uh mean
inform the members  what were the questions  and we may give the reply
that is understood 
""
""
now he had pointed out  uh two mistakes in the report and
uh  these mistakes are uh accepted that uh 
""
""
printed mistake
""
""
printers mistake 
""
the notice says nineteen ninety   two  ninety-four
 it should be read as   uh ninety-three  ninety-four 
""
""
 two  
""
""
 ninety-three  
""
""
budget
""
""
and uh  wherever  we are told  appears in the 
 i'm  sorry wherever english school appears  it should be read as
 b r  one word  english high school  we've  not mentioned
some places  b r  one word  he wanted us to be specific 
""
and uh he wanted to know  why there are only three  uh
school committee meetings uh from uh  in the english medium  while
there are six school committee meetings in kannada medium 
""
my reply to  that is  uh initiative to call the meetings
entirely lies with the    headmistress  head mistresses of the
respective school  and uh possibly the h m of english school has uh  uh
felt that uh  many meetings were not required
""
however  we've  already  told the h m of english medium
school  to call the meetings more often 
""
""
 headmistress  
""
""
then uh there were suggestions to hold the continous  uh
meetings of the school committee on the same day  so that there will be
equal uh number of uh meetings 
""
uh my reply to that is that it is not possible because  
the  most of the members of the committee from the management side are
honorary  and they can't spend uh  three four hours at a stretch in the
school 
""
so meetings have to be on different uh  days 
""
then there was a question why there is a separate  uh uh 
 head  ma    head mistress   for english primary
 and why there is no separate head mistress for uh kannada  primary
""
""
my reply to that  uh uh as you know  kannada primary has a
very small strength  and english primary has more than four hundred 
under the rules  we cannot have uh  separate head mistress for uh 
kannada primary and therefore kannada primary is looked after by the 
secondary   head  mas    head mistress   without
any extra remuneration 
""
he has also asked why  uh junior college uh is also looked
after by  the head mistress of kannada high school 
""
answer to that is very simple  that uh  the junior college
is the extension of the kannada high school  and under the rules we cannot
appoint a separate person to  the junior college  the head mistresses
had to look after that also  and under the rule she is  uh given by the
government not by the management  uh an additional honorarium of hundred
 rupees   which she has been getting 
""
now  he wanted to know how often the various  sub-
committees are met  uh my answer to that is maintenance committee has 
meant   uh met number of times  to maintain the building 
""
health committee    ha    has  
attended to all the health problems arising  in the schools 
""
they  uh fund raising committee has raised the funds  uh in
the last six years  at different times 
""
and  therefore the sub-committees are doing uh  their
functions properly 
""
uh  how many life members were enrolled that is uh  the
question 
""
the report is very clear that we have not mentioned any life
member because we  have uh stopped enrolling life members since nineteen
seventy-four 
""
and that is uh reason why  we've  brought the amendments in
the  extra ordinary general uh meeting 
""
now he wanted to know  uh the forty-seven children studying in
kannada  uh studying kannada in english medium school whether they are
outsiders or  uh insiders
""
they are our own children  studying in kannada  in english
medium  but because their parents are from karnatak  they want kannada
to be  taught and  we've  made  voluntary provision for teaching
of  uh kannada in the english medium school
""
there is no compulsion 
""
similarly  we've  also  uh introduced uh on a voluntary
basis computer education  for which  uh separate fees are charged 
and uh  this is  provided by on a voluntary basis uh they pay  and
 one word  automation company is providing the education  and
therefore the  mandal   is not directly involved in the
 uh uh computer education  except providing room for computers to be
placed
