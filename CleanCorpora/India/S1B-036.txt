""
with the end of the cold war  and the dismemberament of the
soviet union  there have been many dramatic changes  in the
international scenario 
""
one of the healthy developments has been the change  in the
relations between india  and britain 
""
as they were our colonial past  and after independence  a
number of issues had forward our relations 
""
foremost amongst those  was the question of kashmir 
""
just next month  two very significant results are going to take
place 
""
the british home secretary  their home minister that is mr
kenneth clerk  will be coming in the first week of january 
""
and this visit will be followed  by that of  the  their
prime minister  mr john major 
""
we have here with us  dr l m singhavi  our high commissioner
to britain 
""
he is here for  pre-visit consultations 
""
and  we're  going to take this opportunity  of exchanging
some views  about the significance of the visit 
""
dr singhavi how do you  view this visit  of what  one word
 ?
""
""
these visits represents  a  remarkable new phase 
of indo-british togetherness 
""
as  the british foreign secretary once said   we no
longer wrangle  about problems 
""
we sit together and resolved them  
""
and i think these uh  uh  that the year and a half 
that is there  had experienced a progressive phase for a qualitative
change  in  that relationship 
""
we have been trying to resolve problems 
""
we are trying to evolve that equation  which is durable 
and meaningful 
""
and where we both  share  or uh view points  and we care
for each others concerns
""
""
so what is the attitude  now  as  one word  in
regard to the kashmir problem  ?
""
""
when i went there i found that  the situation  was
considerably confused  partly because i think  in the labour party
there was an inadequate appreciation  of the historical background  of
the legal implications  and  of  the ground situation 
""
today we have a situation when  the shadow  foreign secretary
 mr jack cunningham  called on me some time ago at the high commission
 held the press conference  and made very positive  clear-cut 
unambiguous statements  with regards to kashmir 
""
there is no doubt that they are very much concerned  about
allegation of human rights  violations 
""
but there is also no doubt  that they regard  kashmir as an
integral part of india 
""
""
but this is very different to  what the former shadow 
foreign minister of the labour party said after his visit to india 
""
he was rather critical about it
""
""
uh  well  mr  jerim cockson  was very critical
about us before he came here 
""
but after he came he had made  a considerable change  in
the position that he has taken earlier 
""
but i must say in fairness  that mr jerim cockson eventually
came to a position 
""
which is  very much more favourable to india  than  it
ever was 
""
in fact when i went there  he used the word occupying part for
india 
""
when i took exception to it    yeah  he was good enough
 to say i am extremely sorry that i used that expression 
""
on the whole during this period  not only  the labour party
 not only the ruling part  not only the liberal party  but  the
people as a whole has come to understand our position better 
""
they sympathise with our opposition  much more  and they
share a lot of our perspective  in these matters 
""
""
 yeah  
""
""
to what extent uh  would you attribute this  uh to
england itself now  emerging  more and more as a   multi 
  multi   ethnic community 
""
because this was a common base to me  that the british uh 
government and people are also very concern  of containing religious 
racial and ethnics rights in england 
""
and therefore they  better understand  uh the problems
countries like india face 
""
uh when uh  forces  for their own aim  try to use religion
 or  language  or race  to try and divide and create conflict 
""
""
but  that's  only one of the many dimensions 
""
it is an input no doubt
""
but i think  the more direct input in  this whole situation
is  their coming closer  towards understanding of our position 
""
therefore  it's  the question of terrorist 
""
i decide in to put my case directly  as a case has to be put
""
""
we decided  that they must  have  a  full encounter
with the evidence that we have  of the involvement  of our neighbouring
country  in the export of terrorrism  in the funding and training of
terrorist 
""
and we share that openly  with the british government
""
""
yes this was an issue which was always rankling  uh
between us  and the the signing of the expression treaty  is  an
extremely significant and important one 
""
and i am glad that they do  realize the  importance that we
 attach to the type of systems  perhaps perceived by us  and not
actually happening there 
""
there assistants that  was being given or at least the  
nelson's  eye being turned  to the activities of terrorist in  uh
in britain 
""
uh how do you  uh evaluate this yourself  ?
""
""
no  i  put before the british government  the
perceptions that both india and britain  are victim states of terrorist
""
""
that both of us  have to face the situation  in a similar
manner  and that both of us  us must collaborate  in meeting
terrorist 
""
now britain  came out clearly  large and clear  on the
question of terrorism 
""
the question was  what do we do about it 
""
when i reopened  what was regarded as a close chapter  on the
extradition treaty 
""
and what is more important the  agreement on the confiscation
of terrorist related  and drug related ethics 
""
i found  for the first time  when we had prepared the ground
 and openess  and there is  activity   in britain 
""
and we have established a bi-lateral arrangement  which may
well pave the way for india  to contribute to a global  regime 
against terrorism 
""
""
this is very healthy  very good 
""
there are sir now also to the economic side
""
i think that is    yeah  uh foremost in or mind 
""
 we'll  have such  old ancient  economic links with
 britain  special ones 
""
uh could you give us  your own thoughts on this  ?
""
how do you see  increase possibilities of increased 
investments  from uh  british industries ?
""
now i want to put them a little seperate to the nri 
""
because the  nri's  have now become  extremely important
in england 
""
and our nationals have  really contributed very  uh
creditably  to the development of  britain's  economy 
""
and  they're  also greatly interested in india 
""
perhaps  uh some comments from you on both the sides
""
""
 yeah  
""
""
yes  uh first let me speak about the nri and then the main
stream  investment  potential from britain 
""
uh to this acronym  nri   i've  given   i've
 spelt it out as the national result of india 
""
uh they are a tremendous resource for indian diplomacy 
""
long ago when i was in parliament  in nineteen sixty-two  i
took up this issue with the government 
""
well the government did not regard it  any part of their
obligation  to cultivate them  or to regard them  as  indians
""
""
now i  felt that these children of mother india must be
acknowledged  because i found  that  in their heart there was very
deep love and attachment to india 
""
now  nri's   have done well 
""
they would be a useful catalyst  in our country 
""
they would like to have a relationship  which enables them to
stay where they are  and to do something for  our country  which
they regard  also as their mother country 
""
now  from that point of view  they won't  one word  a
nationality
""
i have placed  several proposals  with regard to  this
whole concept to  one word  nationality  and how it can be made
operational
""
i do hope  that some   decisions  should be taken
before long 
""
but the  nri's   has a tremendous contribution to make
both in terms of technology transfer  in terms of investments  in terms
of contributing to  the  general climate for investments  in our
country
""
""
 yeah  
""
""
i would also say  i would also say they have a  very
major role  to play in  improving indo-british relations in general 
 very much  because  they've  become   they've 
become fairly active also on the
""
""
 very much  
""
""
yes yes 
""
""
on the political side
""
  and  i think  they're   they are a group of
people  whether you call them  nri's  or people of indian origin i
mean  this  what you call is debatable 
""
but this group  are ones which we should pay very much more
attention to and i  i'm  glad that we are doing so
""
""
 yes  
""
""
 that's  true  i made this my business to cultivate
them 
""
uh  a very large significance  uh eternal constituency  of
support 
""
even if i take my job to be a credit to the people of great britain
 they are a segment  of that population 
""
and in the modern world diplomacy has to relate to people  and
not only to the government 
""
and  they're  a very important positive group for india 
""
but that apart  the nri have also  one very important
contribution to make  and that is  the constant positive projection of
india  among the people they live 
""
and that is  something which we cannot do on the same scale as
they can 
""
about the other hand  the main stream investments here 
about which  i have great enthusiasm  and great expectations  or
held that today because  of a strong recessionary phase  in the
europian and the british economy 
""
but had to understand that in this recessionary phase  you
cannot have received  buoyancy  
""
on the other hand  for instance  when it comes to nri 
during the time when our foreign exchange reserves were at the rock bottom
 ah britain the sterling area  contributed  in such an enoromous
measure  and such an unexpectedly large way
""
that  today  from a reserve of one million  or less
which was very small  we have a reserve of eight point eight million 
""
this is the situation to which nri have made a very useful
contribution 
""
now the main stream investors  the money managers  the
bankers  or  one word 
""
but  it takes a lot of time 
""
britain is not only  britain's  financial market  is a
world financial market 
""
and we have  been able to make  considerable impact  on
the city of london  on the  money managers  on the  potential
investors  to all thing  that they cannot afford to miss the
opportunity of investments  in india 
""
last year  mr bhandari  i've  brought a very large group
 of british investors    uhm  the top of the shares company
 with their chairman  their managing directors their financial advisors
then attorney to all see india 
""
and they went back  with  nothing but  the most positive
and optimistic  reform 
""
it had to take time 
""
when this recessional  the period of  one word  is much
longer    yeah  but  it's  happening
""
""
 uhm  
""
""
 yeah  
""
""
well i would have thought may be because there is a recession
 uh british industries  and financial insitutions would be looking our
for other markets  and india
""
""
yeah they are 
""
""
india is the natural  massive market
""
and we have  very weak advantage  as far as britain is
concerned  that there is the  uh the language is not a barrier  we
know each other 
""
in fact we still adopt their own standard  uh we have a  one
word  their judiciary the  one word  administration  therefore
everything is there very conducive for  uh increasing this
""
""
yes we  we and  two countries relate very closely to
each other  and that is very important 
""
this is tremendous awareness of the thing  that the india is a
natural ally  india ia a natural  country where to go for investments
""
""
and this is a tremendous help 
""
i think during the recessionary phase also  the number of
approvals  applied for and granted  or industries  one word  is
very large 
""
but  so far as the economic  one word  is concerned 
it would have to take a little more time
""
and we will have to  one word  here  a little more
""
i have also hopes for  relocations of industries from europe
 into india 
""
i am certain that joint ventures between britain and india would
be  a  interesting reality in the world market 
""
we will do very well if we established these joint ventures for
the reasons you  just now mentioned 
""
but i think  you cannot  merely add up  during a short
period time play 
""
the  results of what  we've  already achieved 
""
there is tremendous positiveness in the climate 
""
it will take some time before we can uh  harvest the crops 
""
which will come out of this uh     ma   
massive   efforts that we have made  particularly in this 
""
""
well the most important  fact that is the question of the
climate 
""
if it is a climate of understanding and of co-operation  of
good-will  of wanting to co-operate with each other 
""
 there'll  be other  exchanges  follow automatically
""
""
and i think it is in the interest of both  britain and india
 that we  have a much closer understanding with each other 
""
uh europe is going in  uh for  unification
""
""
here  there'll  be problems 
""
""
but the unification of europe  uh with britain being  a
part of it will create  uh both problems 
""
and i think also opportunities 
""
and  uh relations with britain would play  very major role
not only on the bi-lateral side  but also in regard to  india's 
co-operation and exchanges  with europe 
""
at the same time i think that greater understanding  greater
objectivity  in the  a few words  these are the india and pakistan
 is welcome and we see  much greater objectivity now 
""
this is welcome  as such the visits of the home secretary and
the prime minister are going to be  extremely significant 
""
uh it is also worth noting  that even  three years ago one
would not have imagined  that the british prime minister  would be the
guest of honour at the republic day 
""
but he is going to be there  in nineteen ninety-three 
""
i have no doubt that he will receive a very  warm welcome 
""
and i also sincerely hope  that uh these two uh  very
important visits  would also pave the way for much greater and more
intensive  economic and other exchanges  as also much better
understanding  between india and britain
