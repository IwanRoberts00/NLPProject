i am mr b n patil  teaching at the balasaheb desai college
 patan 
""
""
i am mr a y shinde  uh  i'm  lecturer in english
department of college patan  satara district 
""
""
well mr shinde  uh nowadays  we give importance to 
marriage 
""
what are your feelings about  wedding 
""
what do you say about 
""
""
about marriages  marriages can be of two types 
""
one is uh  arranged marriage  and another is  uh uh love
marriage you can say 
""
so modern  one  modern version 
""
and the previous  uh uh in uh bygone days  it was the
arranged marriage 
""
""
okay you 
""
""
uh these days people prefer the  love marriage or the 
uhm uh other types of marriage  where the expenses will be minimum 
""
""
but  middle class  that the people  particularly in
satara sangli or kolhapur district  mostly they demand dowry 
""
is this so  uh is it uh  a fact or   it's  only
""
""
yes it is a fact 
""
but uh it depends upon the girl 
""
if uh the girl is not very beautiful  uh then they expect more
money
""
they ask for the dowry 
""
and so  if the  boy and girl  are of uh equal status 
if uh both of them are uh  uhm uh they like each other  then 
there is no question of dowry as such 
""
""
but if there is no question of dowry  then why is that the
people go on demanding more and more from  all the people  all of us
""
""
will you uh in particularly    ah  if you are from a
marathi   community   okay 
""
will you tell me something about  the  community  that too
 on the dowry 
""
""
 ah  
""
""
 community  
""
""
i know  i am from maratha community 
""
i am from uh  sangli district 
""
uh this here the people have got into the vicious circle  
 uhm  in the sense that uh  this uh  they give them dowry  to
their  daughters  uh while marrying them 
""
and later on when their boy becomes of a marriagable age  that
time they want the return 
""
and so they demand uh  the dowry 
""
so that is the problem
""
""
 uhm  
""
""
is it because of the social conditions 
""
""
no
""
""
yes  something else 
""
""
yes 
""
""
what is it then 
""
""
uh 
""
""
well why is that the dowry system has become  important
nowadays 
""
""
uh one thing is that  suppose that girl  uh  girl's
 father  or the parents are rich    uhm  uh  and they
want their daughter to be  uh settled in    uhm  uh or sent
to another  uh rich family    uhm 
""
then they don't bother about the money
""
  they  are ready to  they are ready to give the dowry
""
""
""
 uhm  
""
""
 uhm  
""
""
 uhm  
""
""
 but  
""
""
nowadays  it has a become a problem
""
the dowry has become a problem  one word 
""
""
yeah 
""
""
why why because  even the educated people    uhm
 go on demanding  they need fridge    they  need scooter
""
""
sometimes they demand    uhm  car  or what they
call the television set and all these things
""
""
 uhm  
""
""
 yeah  
""
""
 uhm  
""
""
yes
""
""
okay what is the use of the education then 
""
""
no  that way the  uh uh there is no self examination or
introspection as such 
""
uh most of the people are tradition bound  uh and  because of
that they go on  uh uh accepting the dowry 
""
""
well is it the dowry are we going to be  are we going to
 get everything what you want 
""
""
yes  uhm they ask for money and   they ask for the
""
""
""
 no it is   well it is said    uhm 
uhm that   nature has everything for  man's  need  
 uhm 
""
but there is nothing for  man's  greed  
""
what do you say about   it 
""
""
 uhm  
""
""
 uhm  
""
""
 yes   there is  i agree with you 
""
because there is no limit to the  greed of the man 
""
and uh  if another party  can afford to give  then the
another party goes on asking  for for more and more money and  uh the
and something in the form of articles and things
""
""
well there are some people  who act as mediator
""
""
yeah  they are called match-makers
""
""
they are called the match-makers
""
""
match-makers
""
""
well what are  what are your impressions about these
match-maker
""
how they work    uhn  what they   do exactly 
""
""
 uhn  
""
""
 it is very   uh interesting role they they
function 
""
uh  uh they   knows   know   both the
parties
""
""
uhm
""
""
and  uhm most of the time this match-makers they are
relatives of the  uh one of the parties
""
""
uhm 
""
""
or sometimes they know the  both the families
""
""
uhm
""
""
and  they take it to be a  uh good work
""
""
uhm
""
""
it uh  you can say it a social work    uhm 
or community work    uhm 
""
they want to help  in one form or another form    uhm
 and uh  this marriage    uhm  uh uhm uh   it's
 a tie  the holy tie    uhm  and they want  uh that
both the parties should come together
""
""
 uhn  
""
""
 uhm  
""
""
 uhm  
""
""
 uhm  
""
""
 uhm  
""
""
uhm
""
""
and if uh  it becomes fruitful    uhm  they uhm
 uh they   themself   themselves   become very happy
""
and that is why  uh   sometime   sometimes 
 they spent the money on their own
""
""
 uhm  
""
""
ah
""
""
and see to it that both the parties come together   
uhm  and uh  they get married
""
the boy and the girl uh get married 
""
""
 uhm  
""
""
so  in ancient times  we have heard of some  people
or  wo  women chosing their husbands
""
""
yes
""
""
what is they call  the  swayamwara 
""
""
uhm
""
""
okay it differs from    yeah  this marriage
that is a marriage system    uhm  means she  had the right
 to chose her husband
""
""
 yeah  
""
""
 uhm  
""
""
 haan 
""
""
that is according to her wish
""
what do you say about it 
""
as if   swayamvaras  nowadays or  the people
are simply making their daughters obey the orders 
""
""
 haan  these days uh  uhm the daughters
don't depend mostly upon the uhm  parents 
""
they have also some  some say in the matter 
""
that if  uh if the daughter doesn't like the boy  uh her
would- be husband  then she  uhm tells the parents  that uh she
doesn't approve of  that boy 
""
hence uh  she  tells or she is free enough to  tell 
the   her parents 
""
""
well is it going to be the marriage of  uh two minds 
or is it going to be the marriage of the economic status of the two families
""
""
""
well  in arranged marriages it is not the marriage of two
minds    yeah 
""
wherever there is uh  love marriage    it  is a
marriage of two minds 
""
""
 yeah  
""
""
 uh  
""
""
well  it's  plenty out there    that 
love doesn't cause the way  or they can  one word 
""
""
 yeah  
""
""
yeah 
""
""
well but now at least  we find people changing their minds
""
""
yeah
""
""
taking divorces  and uh marrying remarrying   again
 taking divorces
""
""
 uhm  
""
""
yeah 
""
""
why is it so 
""
what has happened 
""
what has changed the whole society  or  a few words  
""
""
uh previously  uh they thought that  the marriages are
made in heaven
""
""
uhm
""
""
and uh uh  they have to continue this sacred tie 
""
they have to remain husband and  uh wife till the end 
""
but uh so far god has been  uh uh driven away from this world
 nobody uh uhm  nobody is afraid of god or  nobody believes in
religion as such 
""
and so they think that  uh if that marriage  uh doesn't make
them happy  then they  uhm they take divorce or they behave 
according to their own will 
""
""
well  is their life going to be happy in the end or 
""
""
  afterwards 
""
""
 what   what what are your observations  one
word 
""
""
the people those who have taken divorce you see them  one
word  living uh  isolated life   or 
""
""
  nai    see if  a few words
 unsuccessful marriage
""
""
unsuccess marriage  yes 
""
uh in  if the husband and wife  they are not happy  then
 it's  better to quit  and look uh for another partner   
uhm  if they think that  uh they will become happy 
""
otherwise uh it will affect their children 
""
""
 uhm  
""
""
so perhaps  if they go away from each other   
yeah  and live  uhm uhm independent lives  so  what's  going
to happen to their children 
""
""
 yeah  
""
""
now that is the question 
""
sometimes uh uhm  the court  if the if the matter goes to
the court  the court can uh  uh come to the help  of the children
""
""
when the  uhm children are  below seven years  then they
are uh kept with the mother 
""
and after that   it's  the duty of the  uhm father
""
""
he is free to  uh take the  responsibility of the  
child 
""
""
 so   what the tie means is the love   
not  the property
""
""
 yes  
""
""
up to
""
""
what we  have  call the materialistic
""
""
yeah
""
""
 it's  not the material    uhm  topic 
""
""
 uhm  
""
""
what is to be done about that one 
""
""
you see that is why the court insisted that  uh upto the
age of seven    uhm  the child is  allowed to be kept with the
mother
""
and after that  uh uhm the father can claim the  the
children 
""
because it is  uh his responsibility
""
""
 uhm  
""
""
yeah
""
""
and he is also able to  uh bring them up properly or help
them in a materialistic uh    one word  
""
""
 well    it's  so  i i  if they have
the law of the land is that we can   take  divorce
""
so we can live uh independently   also   that's
 true 
""
but is it not the duty of the husband  to take proper care of
the  girl
""
""
 yeah  
""
""
 uhm  
""
""
yeah
""
""
uhm  because it is  the faith  of the father 
that his daughter will be safe    yeah  in the hands of this
particular person 
""
but it is not observed nowadays 
""
why so 
""
""
 yeah  
""
""
sir the reason is that  uh the father sometimes he is
unemployed
""
""
uh
""
""
and uhm  he has no  time  and uh  he cannot take
uh the proper care of the  girl 
""
and so he has to keep her in the hostel or some  uh some other
place or with some relatives 
""
and the  the daughter cannot become happy
""
""
no no  that's  not my question you see    
one word   if   one word  his daughter marries a particular
person
""
""
  one word   
""
""
ah ha i see
""
""
he thinks that he is a right person    uhm  who
will take care of my daughter
""
""
 uhm  
""
""
yeah 
""
""
but  his  dreams are shattered
""
""
yes shattered by
""
""
what does he dream   whether  daughters or father
dream
""
""
 uh  
""
""
 haan  
""
""
the father  of the
""
""
sir father think that uh  he has made a wrong choice or
his daughter has made a wrong choice 
""
and sometimes say it  it happens that the  uh two family
 uh backgrounds  they don't match 
""
or the  the culture  of uh both the  families doesn't
match 
""
and because of that the clash  uh takes place and  uh both
the parties  get separated 
""
""
for the
""
""
they live uh unhappy  sort of life 
""
""
well  what can be done about it 
""
 what's  the solution 
""
what do you think about it 
""
""
well the only thing is that  uh if uh  the husband and
wife wants to be in  uhm happy  then they should  uh cooperate each
other 
""
they should not  uh uhm be selfish  and uh  they should
think that it is the duty  to see to that  the marriage becomes
successful 
""
and they can make conducive or happy atmosphere in the family
""
so that the  the children  they will benefit by that
atmosphere
""
""
how can that be achieved  first they must understand each
other
""
""
yeah 
""
""
well  that's  what we  we say  but the
religious man those who are there    yeah  that their lives are
 uh bound by  sanctity  or by each to each uh by bounds   of
 nature or by    yeah  uh uhm religious views
""
""
 yeah  
""
""
 yeah  
""
""
 yeah  
""
""
uhm 
""
""
but nowadays it seems that  the people do not trust 
""
""
uhm god
""
""
god
""
""
god
""
""
god as well 
""
or even they do not uh  believe in themselves what they are
doing exactly 
""
means the life of the  people  has uh  become uh sort of
disorderly life  in the sense   now  they themselves do not know
what they are going to do    uhm  or  what's  going to
   no but  happen
""
""
 yeah  
""
""
 uhm  
""
""
 no but  
""
""
 one word  depend  that  her father mother 
or the husband and wife  uh need not depend upon god or religion all the
time  or tradition all the time 
""
that uh they should  uh uh continue their their affection 
uh for each other 
""
and so that  if they love each other  then there will be uh
no trouble as such
""
""
so it is a love  that is a binding   spirit 
""
""
 yeah   binding force 
""
""
binding   force 
""
""
 or   it is a tie 
""
""
it is a
""
""
ah ha both the parties can be united  uh till the end 
of their life 
""
""
okay  so now  it's  about the maratha families or
what we say  one word   now they are married in uh in some gujrati
family or the marwari   family  or some jain family  or some 
one word  family    yeah  what do you say about it 
""
hey what what are your observations 
""
""
 yeah  
""
""
 yeah  
""
""
now as far as marriage from maratha community are concerned
 most of the marriages are arranged marriages 
""
""
arranged
""
""
and uh  they  i  it is uhm  long process or long
business you can say
""
""
uhm 
""
""
because uh  first of all  the match-maker  
plays  a very vital role  very important role
""
""
 uhm  
""
""
well 
""
""
and he sees to it  that both the parties come together
""
""
uhm 
""
""
and uh  there the  the  girl's  father  
 uhm  pays a visit  to that uh  boy's  house 
""
and uh he talks  about the marriage 
""
he gives the invitation you can say
""
""
 uhn  
""
""
okay 
""
""
uh to come to his house uh and see the girl    
one word   and that ceremony of showing the girl    uhm 
takes place 
""
and uhm  that boy also comes  uh and before that  uhm
everything is discussed 
""
and if the boy and uh  parents of the boy  likes the girl
 then they uh show the green signal 
""
and uh  later on  then uh a  a formal ceremony takes
place
""
it is called  engagement   uh that ceremony
is called  engagement  
""
""
  one word   
""
""
 uhm  
""
""
well now you talked about this match-maker  it's  true
then  whether th match-maker particularly intents to    uhm 
uh contact two families   which are 
""
""
 uhm  
""
""
 yeah he   knows the  fam  uh both the
parties
""
""
okay
