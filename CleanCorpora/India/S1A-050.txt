""
""
so  what do you think about the disaster happened 
 dakshin  maharashtra about earthquake 
""
""
actually umesh  as we have seen  there are a lot of
people  died 
""
""
ahn 
""
""
so  uh according to scientists they are expecting one more
""
""
but this is very very  serious disaster happened  last month
""
""
""
uhm  but do you think that  what has happened is for
good or bad 
""
""
no no it is extremely bad 
""
in the last  around ten fifteen years this is the worst  uh
disaster happened 
""
""
in india or on earth 
""
""
uhm
""
""
in india or in the world 
""
""
uh  i can't tell in the world because i don't know more
about  other  sides happened  but in india this is the very very
serious  hit to  the people and also to the country 
""
""
uhm 
""
""
as  as this is a very  serious happened  mr p v
narasimha rao should have   take   taken   a very 
serious step on this
""
""
oh yeah 
""
""
and that affected a lot of people  and also many houses
every thing has been  crushed 
""
""
do you think  anything that will be going to happen in 
india 
""
""
yeah umesh  just for the day
""
""
have changed in india    earthquake  my friend
""
""
 yeah  
""
""
yes umesh 
""
actually what happened is  scientists have predicted that 
there will be a  serious  earthquake in one  uh again 
""
in uh most probably in december  as they have predicted 
""
because uh  before that time they have to take  more
precautions  as there is a lot of  life lost  in the 
earthquake till now  a serious  step has to be taken 
""
so we have to think about it  a lot 
""
""
what do you  think about those people  whose lives have
gone  whose lives have gone in earthquake 
""
""
yeah  there are uhm  there are lot of  relief funds
coming from outside the country and  people are also donating  on this
 break in recording 
""
there are a lot of uh relief funds coming from other countries 
like uh  donations of  amount and aid  and also the  food 
one word  like uh food  uh from other countries and also  from
 the people are also donating   break in recording 
""
but don't you think that it will be better that if uh  the
people  take up  general opinion of  say uhm helping us 
""
""
yeah we like to have it so  taking to uh  what is
called  uh box or something  and uh going on  just asking for
relief  this one uh for earthquake relief fund for earthquake do you think
it is better  mr mahesh 
""
""
yeah 
""
uhm  yeah i think  people are donating and also  the 
a lot of participants are coming  to take part in the relief  fund
""
""
so  as far as my thinking  people are donating as much as
possible for the relief fund as  they think that  their own pople are
dying from  whole everything 
""
so  we also should have to take part in that 
""
as far as my
""
""
but mr mahesh  see what i think is  uh that people being
suffered  by this  uh being wounded  in all this cases  
it'll  be better if those people uh    would   would
  have lost their lives  because see all the things what has
happened  it all most more  uh  it's  been happened  slum
areas you can say always  you get
""
""
yeah 
""
""
so  and  you can have  and one more thing is  uh
not only in india but also as  uh and most of the countries are concerned
 all this uh  what is called uh  the unwanted scenes happen only in
slums  like uh you know this uh  raped and uh  they all this multi-
millionaires trying to become  more and more  millionaire   
yeah  by destroying all the slums
""
""
 yeah  
""
""
yeah 
""
""
so what i think is   it'll  be better if all those
people  would have lost their lives in  uh the earthquake
""
""
yeah  so what do you think  which is more beneficial
 to participate in the earthquake 
""
""
because as far as participation is concerned uh  it would
be better  first uh those people who are  uh half the way
""
""
uhm
""
""
in their life that is uh  half the thing they are 
living and the other half side they are  dying in that case  it'll 
be better  people  gener  donate generously
""
""
uhm 
""
""
 that's  what i think 
""
and  more  one more thing is  if people would have lost
their lives the population also would have gone down
""
""
uhm 
""
""
so  from that point of view  the other people also 
would have been uh benefitted  because the earthquake doesn't bring 
the problem of uh
""
""
uhm 
""
""
eatables
""
""
uhm 
""
""
then uh any other  miscellening uh purpose
""
""
uhm 
""
""
that wouldn't be much of problems 
""
""
and what do you think of the  pm's   participation
in this  relief fund uh relief  umesh 
""
""
as far as  pm's  is concerned the prime minister uhm
  he's  working quite hard 
""
of course  uh i think even he is generating i mean he is
donating generously 
""
but to some extent 
""
we can't say that he isn't uh  uh helping them 
""
 it's  his duty to  those because  he is the prime
minister of the country no 
""
""
so now what do you think about the  earthquake in
maharashtra 
""
there a around thirty thousand  people have died and what do you
 feel which is  better
""
""
no as i told you before that  uh  it'll   be 
 the thing was better if all the people  would have lost their lives in
that  as i told you before
""
""
uhm uhm
""
""
because  one more thing is  now this medical expenses
 and going for that thing as far as  living uh even  the medical
expenses have been given free the all items
""
""
uhm 
""
""
but as far as uh other thing is concerned
""
""
uhm
""
""
they  being lost their property and other thing   
uhm  they naturally feel  uh bad about  they feel that  the life
is miserable
""
""
 uhm  
""
""
uhm
""
""
 it's  better  if they would have lost their lives
""
""
""
now what do you think about  the people  maximum many of
the people have died in maharashtra
""
""
oh yeah
""
""
so what do think about them 
""
""
about them   sa  sad 
""
""
what would be better if  what would be the better steps to
be taken 
""
""
i think it was good what have what happened was good 
""
""
and what about  what do you think about the  uh
earthquake happened  in gulbarga that is in karnataka 
""
""
yeah in karnataka that same opinion
""
""
no many people they  uh very few died and also
""
""
no the same thing  that has been applicable to maharashtra
""
""
""
uhm 
""
so okay  uh now   we'll  shift on to some other this
one  uh  recording broken 
""
okay umesh  what do you think about the  dussera 
festival that is  uh from next week they  uh the college  has
declared holiday 
""
so what do you think about it 
""
""
enjoyable   one word 
""
""
okay umesh uh  actually what i am thinking is i am thinking
to  of going to mysore  and uh  spending there a week  seeing
the  dussera  festival that is  uh in front of mysore
palace 
""
there will be a  big crowd and also  the mysore 
maharaja   the  uh  maharaja  will be  seated
on an elephant  and  uh all uh
""
""
i  a few words   some maharaja at present 
""
""
no actually his grandsons are there
""
so  they are going to  uh get him seated uh on an elephant
in the place of their fore-fathers 
""
so there will be all ministers  and also the prime minister will
be attending the  uh function 
""
so i think there is a grand festival and  people from all over
the country will be  coming 
""
okay umesh what do you think about the  compt  competitive
exams conducted by  the all india level 
""
""
 it's  good for students  to come up in life
""
""
uhm 
""
""
so  they got plenty of  comp  competitive exams
""
""
uhm 
""
""
so it helps uh  students come up in life
""
""
uhm 
""
""
in  just not in monopolying    uhm  they have
got plenty of  other way
""
""
 uhm  
""
""
uhm 
""
""
so it really helps 
""
 it's  something like an entrance  something you say
""
""
yeah like  uh many  most of the  intelligent persons
will be filterd  and will be  placed in a top most position 
""
and uh  so it helps a lot of students who  want to be in a
good position 
""
and so what do you think about their  this one future or  uh
like will it be good or  uh will there be any  politics or what do
you think about it 
""
""
no as far as  their will  power and their mind is
concerned  if they are well strong enough 
""
""
uhm 
""
""
 they'll  be well placed 
""
""
no  what i am   thinking if there is some 
political  background like uh  from some minister  any influence
comes and  uh will they change their mind or will  the correct person
will be placed on position
""
""
  they'll  have good or uh  
""
""
hey  that's  what  i'm  telling no 
""
as far as the will power and the mind is strong    uhm
 they need not have to  uh keep uh  say  they need not have to
keep themselves down 
""
""
 uhm  
""
""
yeah okay 
""
now what do you think about the state competitive exams 
""
""
state competitive exams  right  people are uh 
taking much of interest in union state competitive exams
""
""
uhm 
""
know what i think is  in the national level  many of them
who have done well will not be qualified
""
""
fine 
""
""
sometimes in the state level they may be qualified 
""
their intelligence may be understood  or their  intelligence
can be  seen by the examiners or some  higher persons who are going
to conduct the exams 
""
so i think uh  this this is more  uh  it's  good
competitive exams all india and state level it is quite good 
""
it helps people in many ways and also  influences many of the
 people to come up  and also be placed in a good position 
""
well  what do you think about the  university exams
conducted 
""
""
so university exams are conducted uh  see at present
india is considerable you know plenty of universities  union level
""
""
uhm uhm 
""
""
and some of the  some of the universities
""
""
uhm 
""
""
their  great  wisdom
""
""
uhm 
""
""
so what i think is doing in that particular university
""
""
uhm 
""
""
the persons career  to some extent might be spoilt
""
""
uhm 
""
""
because  moreover  now-a-days  when we go away 
for job opportunities
""
""
uhm 
""
""
what they ask is 
""
""
uhm
""
""
preferably from a good  recognised university
""
""
uhm 
""
""
and if the university has got a black spot
""
""
uhm 
""
""
naturally all the persons who has  studied in that 
particular university
""
""
uhm 
""
""
also  the same thing
""
""
will be a waste
""
""
yeah 
""
""
to the student who has studied over there
""
""
exactly 
""
""
and what do you think about the  college itself 
""
if the college is not good how can a university be  uh means
 uh be pointed out 
""
""
the college is not good in the sense what do you mean 
""
""
like uh  lecturers are not good or  students may not
be good  or sometimes  the placement may not be good 
""
""
as far as lecturers are concerned
""
""
uhm 
""
""
the teaching  you know might be  quite low   
uhm  quite high the level  standard
""
""
 uhm  
""
""
uhm,
""
""
as far as students are concerned 
""
""
uhm 
""
""
the main thing all depends on students
""
""
uhm 
""
""
they  they have got a good friendship
""
""
uhm
""
""
alright 
""
""
uhm 
""
""
they can uh  deal with any other thing also  that's
  with studies
""
""
uhm 
""
""
with lecturers  they can have good relation   also
 
""
but suppose if the students    uhm  don't have  to
build up their  good friendship
""
""
 uhm  
""
""
 uhm  
""
""
uhm
""
""
good friend circle 
""
""
uhm 
""
""
naturally the  college also gets a bad name
""
""
uhm 
""
""
so in which  the achievers also  will also be included
""
""
uhm 
""
okay then 
""
okay  mah  okay umesh  uh we have talked  a good 
""
""
we had a good conversation
""
""
yeah  and uh  i think  the flood relief  might
take a good turn  and in the earthquake  may take a good turn and 
it may  be of some help to the people 
""
and  so  i'm  thinking of  finishing this
discussion by  this topic itself
""
so  okay umesh  say you   good bye 
""
""
 good bye   mahesh 
""
""
good bye
