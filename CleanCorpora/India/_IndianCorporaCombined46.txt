 i'm mrs chapala nayak from orissa and  what's your name please  i am mr mishra from arunachal pradesh  i have come here for a refresher course uh means in kolhapur how do you enjoy it ? i enjoy it very well but uh i thought there could be more uh uhm programmes like guest lecturers many more guest lecturers coming from outside  that could have been a better programme  look suppose uh we are forgetting about this refresher course how do you enjoy this place ? this place is also is very nice very nice so i think that's uh here the weather conditions are fine and yeah  very pleasant   yeah  in arunachal pradesh the conditions are totally different  i work in bondila  and yesterday there was in the means t v means that uh  there is heavy snowfall  the temperature is always uh minus uh seven uh seven to  seven degrees  i take also this place for enjoyable but uh i get a little bit of cold because i have some sort of problem here that typical cold here uh over above all its  okay  that is why climate is so nice i think and the beautiful sceneries are here  you're right  and when will we go back ? actually on fourth uh this refresher course is coming to  an end  and after that i plan to go back via orissa to  arunachal pradesh tickets it's uh have you reserved ? i have got my reservations   no not got  then we may go both of us now that is how your husband also by that time we meet he has requested me  i have uh told him that i will acompany have you visited any other place ? in ? in kolhapur ? yeah i went to mahalaxmi temple  i went to also rankala lake i also shalini palace    that kolhapur city  why not we are making a programme that uh for panhala i think it's a nice place   panhala we'll go uh we've  planned it uh on next sunday  if you like you can join us  i think it's a historical place  yes since i heard that there are forts and uh some other things let us see yeah   shivaji  it it is mostly in the pattern of our barwati study one word barwati durg  yeah  and that day in panhala we will be able to find our own uh past culture  culture of orissa tradition of orissa  how do you find is it better than orissa ? actually means uh every place is a good place  we cannot say which place is better but uh to each one like his own name sounds the sweetest the place uh where he is born that must be the best  then how is it that  how is it that that from ap the natural scenery ? natural scenery also see in ap that is quite good  because that uh the government is taking much interest in developing that into a tourist  is it hilly hilly area ? yes hilly resort  they are going to develop it in the sima simla and kashmir type of then how do you feel that uh remaining far away from you home ? obviously if you remain far away from your home uh you will feel nostalgic for your home  next time you'll   then also family  and very often even if i like this place but uh i feel very homesick here   one or two words was got to feel that but anyway  the the call of the business is there and you have to there be there for  you are remembering your children family  certainly laughter  and i also feel very often when i feel that to go and that to visit some places here i always remember my children  that it means they will be with us how nice it could it be  that could be better  i also feel and here actually i feel that uh they are not giving us any holidays  and just like makarsankranti which was uh shiv ceremony idea like in   one word we are going to forget it  in orissa  yeah  because there is no holiday  i also thought that day we'll be getting some  makar chawal and some other things means this all cultural and traditional things   but they're observing here in a different way   yeah means uh uh also i am looking food in a mess  that some sweet they're giving  yeah  and saying that   in the class also they gave certain sweets that gudgudate like this ha right  that is quite good also   this is almost seem the simla pattern of orissan  this that's why i seem  only the variation of culture actually   that's what different culture  ha it is there the way we observe it's different here  and again that uh saraswati pooja we observe there with uh so much pomp and ceremony   haan  but here they are one word they don't know what which sarswati pooja  but ganesh pooja is different here and in maharashtra ganesha is a very uhm a good uh big god  a uhm you may be finding on the street you may be watching on the t v   it may be but they're not observing that saraswati pooja and i feel that's  it   ha but uh every region has got it's own gods and goddesses yeah and that is   yeah  no not that uh it's your own god or goddesses  laughter gods and goddesses are there everywhere   natural  but uh they by culture generally you have got your own specific ident tified god  they  yeah  that happens and uh vinayak is a very important god here in maharashtra uh you come orissa when in your vacations every year  ? almost every year because uh every year we are having two vacations  two one actually vacation of two months summer vacation summer  and in winter we get about twenty-two days break we call it the winter break do you come in both the vacations ? almost  you enjoy that  certainly summer summer  summer actually in orissa these days it is becoming very hot for us after staying there in arunachal for about  uh say seven eighty uh seven years uh years i am finding it uh very hot to manage in orissa particularly during summer   summer   what's your idea about that konark temple ? konark temple do you find any other substitute or something equal  in any other state ? i think so far as konark temple is concerned konark is konark  uh it has got a world status uh you know it is there in  uh the great surprises of the world  it has been enlist enlisted that way and so in some of the states you may be finding very good temples like here in maharashtra jejuri is there on our way  from poona to kolhapur from the train i had a glimpse of jejuri is it so artistic ? jejuri ? it may be i have not uh seen it i have seen it only from the train i think it could be because uh like jayanta mahapatra has written on konark uh here arun kolatkar has written on  that temple jejuri  but the difference between jayant mahapatra and arun uhm you can find as the people say the critics say that jejuri is uh on the pattern of t s eliot's waste land  it might have been but might have been actually we've we've not read it so you cannot say but konark after all it is on a different pattern yeah i think so that uh it's completely different   haan  mainly because of uh not of that uh background on the one side that the background or the story behind it  we take it as that of the patriotism that about the  it is the case of patriotism it is a case of sacrifice it is a case of uh a fa father's love for his child a son's dedication for his father all that   no not only  also you say if you go back to that  dharamputli jheel   and it's artistic  ha that artistic talk i think  artistic talk is there certainly and uh if we go back to that dharamputli jheel yeah you find  it's all a count in search of his father  and the father and the son then they don't get an opportunity mean to exchange the mutual courtesies   yeah  the very eve evening the boy reaches  the same night he constructs that uh dome completes that dome yeah yeah completes and again for the sake of his own uh uh community he sacrificies jumps from the river but it shows as jumps from the top of the temple and uh gets uh buried in the  it shows his patriotism put itself i think   put itself  its patriotism but the boy is that what to be expected more than a boy like uh dharma of twelve years or ten to twelve years old  right of course it's a it it can be different uh a differently interpreted it can be also a sign of patriotism i think  it  have you seen that chandipur ? yes chandipur i have gone chandipur where we have got this uh ordnance factory   chandipur  yeah and that gopalpur ? gopalpur in barampur ? uhm  that sea beach nice sea beach in the a few words   haan one word central uh of course the light house is a is a bit away from that  gopalpuri is also no not i connected to our orissa's rich past  from there only we sailed in the long past to japan borneo  some other places we hear then what's your idea about chandvali ?  one word the government is taking a lot of interest and uh it has developed into uhm missile and  missile the present site uh yeah  but let's see it also there was a huge approach previously  that there was a port  there was a port but uh again they are trying that uh that to have built   but if it will be possible   but  it may not be possible now it may not be in in this present condition of the  they are trying that yes they may be able to do may not be able to do  but in the left of one word and this uh ordnance factory there  do you enjoy your service there ? in arunachal pradesh yeah  enjoying it how how many are there from orissa ? means actually in our college there are three  from orissa ? yeah   i'm one then another is mr nayak he's  a lecturer in history and there is another dr mahonty  he's from one word but he is from orissa  orissa  he is in political science   orissa  why they are so much interested and also you ? no it's not a case of interest then ?  it's uh you got the chance how ? you get a chance and you go because in these days of uh  unemployment and all that you cannot just stay back at home  and take risk   that's what  no to me i i always think that uh the first chance is the best chance  whenever we get no no first the chance  no no  and also   we've to abide after that we may consider that is the prescription  because if you leave a chance those same chance may not come to you again and so far as coming to orissa is concerned   and which is your in one word  we've to do grasp it  once the matter if coming with orissa is concerned you can come back yeah anytime you like because the ugc has uh as per the ugc scheme uh you can come to the university in a way that way i'm looking up for a better future   yeah  that you are thinking that to come back orissa ? yeah in if anytime it is possible i'll come back  and here in orissa the correspondence are quiet good also as far east organisation has come under uh actually after ugc  recommendations have been implemented with new year we are finding the pay scales are almost the same  i was previously working in kandapur college  i started my career as a lecturer in kandapur college itself  in orissa  but in uh new the conditions in those uh days but in the private colleges  that's obvious problem is everywhere  actually i joined that uh in nineteen eighty when the college started  and now still now i'm there  uh i heard that day also actually i i matriculated in seventy-nine  seventy-nine seventy-nine and you joined in eighty eighty  that is quite nice and interesting also  and we have four there no  we have lot respect uh better command  and others  in other departments  yeah no they have  off day that is a uh two to three members are there  one wo working that the result  means the government has got yeah different categories   yeah  not that according to plus two and plus three system  in class two they have minimised just like the clerk and something like  actually in other states the pattern is different they are not having the junior colleges  they are having the plus two plus plus system of indian school  we call it as one word   in orissa they have not done till date but in orissa even the a few words  but they have done the bifur bifurcation in one college plus two plus three all these systems are different but the pay structure is quite good for them for junior college lecturers because you find they hire secondary teacher a senior teacher who gets uh sixteen uh sixteen forty to twenty-nine  scale  whereas in orissa you get uh means a junior college lecturer gets uh two thousand to three thousand five hundred  i think uh that is the second pay  no that is not the second that is higher than the second stage  no now in orissa  so they are getting two thousand uh they are getting it at par with the o s officers  that means class two  yeah class two  whereas we are also class one officers  not actually class one yes class one  there  no we are  no no  there a p  uhn
