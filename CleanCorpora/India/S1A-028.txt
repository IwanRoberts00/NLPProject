""
""
anything which is spoken in india will be indian english or
 a particular type of english  will be called indian english 
""
""
no i think english spoken here in the indian context  
 in   on   the indian soil   that's  what we 
  saying   say    india english 
""
""
and there will be  different types of indian english 
indian english one two three and so on
""
""
there must be different types of indian englishes because we
have different varieties of  languages spoken here in india  varieties
means different families of languages spoken here in india
""
""
or how many of this is the most indian  of all these indian
englishes  again becomes a question 
""
""
yeah  that's  true 
""
i think  that is  one of his task to find out 
""
  we can  ask him also
""
""
 so when was  
""
""
when was this  when was this started  this subject of
indian english 
""
""
i think it started around sixtees  so i feel
""
""
i remember  in  the college uh  mr uh  i forgot
the name of this english teacher  but it is on my tongue
""
""
yes 
""
""
he brought the book  uh  common errors in in
indian literature   he mentioned certain things  like
 a big size    a big big size  
""
""
what is that   that's  like
""
""
 nahi  big size 
""
""
 achha    what's  that one
""
""
an arab stays in the big size what you say
""
""
i see 
""
""
but he said  it's   a  wrong english  
it's   a  wrong english and it should be  like   he he
  he   recommended some other books for the use
""
""
so what are  what is the what books did you have
""
""
i forgot  i was giving an example
""
""
okay 
""
""
so that kind of thing with indian english or  what is
indian english  that wrong  wrong one  so called wrong one in
indian english  or right one in indian english 
""
""
no no you cannot say wrong one or right one not  i think
there are some influences and interferences from the mother tongues 
""
""
oh
""
""
the  newspeak  english   it's  a   
one word  
""
""
 so the   concept is changing  those days 
certain things  spoken in indian english  were considered wrong
""
""
wrong  that's  it
""
""
and now even a wrong ones are indian english  i think
""
""
so whatever english  which is spoken here in india i think
these are all rule governed  because there is no language which is not
rule governed 
""
so in that way you cannot say that indian english is spoken here in
india is wrong
""
""
but uh  many people in india speak  english  with
the 
""
""
yeah even we will make one of
""
""
no no i  what i mean to say is  uh many people in india
speak english  in the wrong tense  uh wrong  wrong construction 
  yeah  that kind of thing
""
""
 yeah  
""
""
so how do you 
""
""
and the  one word  is where  past participle to be
used    yeah  present is used that kind of a    yeah
 that kind of thing
""
""
 yeah  
""
""
 yeah  
""
""
that kind of thing 
""
so  how many speak english 
""
""
so that is  that is
""
""
is it  is it to be categorised as wrong english or indian
english 
""
""
it can't be categorised as wrong english  it is to be
categorised as indian english
""
""
but you must remember is 
""
""
yes 
""
""
you remember your collegues 
""
""
yes 
""
""
and uh his english  laughter 
""
so  uh  i want to say  i want to tell something  i
want to say something or the other to you  means
""
""
no i can teach english  uh i don't know what kind of
english is this  but  that's    sometimes   there are
englishes which are spoken by local people which are quite intolerable like
""
""
 that means  
""
""
 haan  if you can consider it as a very very
extreme form of indian english or 
""
""
i think
""
""
no  you have to you will define a range
""
""
yeah  that's   yes  that's  what
""
""
 you've  to define your range or to which you can
consider  something as indian english    yes  so i think that
""
""
 yes  
""
""
so even even indian english    no  there must be
established indian english  i think that    uh  should be
brought out
""
""
 no  
""
""
 uh  
""
""
something as indian english
""
""
so that will be taken as a variety of indian english 
""
""
so you say  like an example  i remember uh  a song
 which was uh  uh written in kannada  when i was in bangalore 
several years back  this song was very popular  uh  this this 
english song  uh this song is sung by  a gardener  or a helper 
to a rich maiden  uh rich lady 
""
so the song goes  in kannada mixed with english 
""
kannada kannada interspersed with english  english uh english
words broken english words  so the language goes madam giving  giving
money
""
""
without any word without any  one word 
""
""
 haan  madam madam give me money  i bring in
clouds 
""
so suppose  and this is not a  concocted  example 
many people 
""
""
yeah
""
""
specially  helpers  who know something  this is they
are going to speak
""
""
yes
""
""
so this is cooked up  in your mind some   certains
  certain   words  it is simple
""
""
i think that  that why
""
""
so   we   we   consider  indian
kannada english  or will we consider is  something  which can be
considered english 
""
so that we have to decide   up  upto  what level you
can considered it an english proper  i mean uh proper english or even
proper language 
""
""
yes 
""
""
because  unless you define a range  anything which is
cooked up  even a a monkey  or a  even a computer which stores
certain things  jumbled up
""
""
yeah 
""
""
you mix  words jumble it up  and what whatever comes
out  you'll  say is  indian english  or african english 
depending on where it is spoken 
""
""
yeah  the interference is from mother tongue that they
have  all this interference is like people used to consider is  uh as
a mistake  but those mistakes  uh they they used to sort of reject the
mistakes 
""
now these mistakes are normal considered as unwanted element 
they  in fact on the basis of error which are made by the  speakers 
of different communities are  tak   taken as a strategy 
""
so that  uh after  chronicling  this strategy they can
 uh what to say they can make  uh plan
""
""
yeah i remember uh another  form of very interesting indian
english which was spoken in j n u where i studied 
""
uh j n u in the evening  uh you have to see the j n u  uh
you can visit until seven  people thronging the bus  and they talk
marxism  art  cultural dance debating  so all those uh  smart
 girls and boys in j n u  used to sit together and they used to talk
as  not all  not all of them 
""
but certain classes among them
""
""
yeah 
""
""
who had rich fathers or you know with  uh uhn  higher
incomes  or you know where a certain kind of life style 
""
""
yes  yeah 
""
yes this   this one includes there 
""
""
 yeah this one like  
""
""
pardon uh 
""
""
you cannot have to bring the tea here no 
""
""
yes 
""
""
no you tell him to bring it  you bring it here
""
""
ah here here one  ah here it is there
""
""
what form of  two words 
""
""
oh sorry
""
""
 that's  too much  one word  know you should
 one or two words  
""
""
when i think of two  this  thank you  haan
 
""
""
so i think  it's  already  two  min  
it's  already ten minutes more than ten minutes no
""
""
 let's  hope  another another few lines and this
""
""
okay
""
""
it will be over  so i remember 
""
""
uh
""
""
i was just pacing out wherin
""
""
yeah 
""
""
so there names speak some changes like  uh you know 
uh uh  one word  yesterday you know  uh  in hindi 
""
you know  he's  wear the jean he brought was impressing you
know
""
""
 that's  i think  that's  uh
""
""
that kind of thing  you see 
""
then uh  i saw with my friend  uh you know what what michael
says  in hindi  but but you know i can write it  one word  that
kind of  so mixed english
""
""
yeah got one
""
""
you know we you know what happened when you say something 
  uhn  in hindi  then you continue with english
""
""
 uhn  
""
""
 that's  what you call  code mixing 
""
""
so what is it  is it indian hindi english or indian hindi
english ?
""
""
so  that's  what makes a construction
""
""
and there is something called
""
""
 one or two words 
""
""
i wanted to ask professor shastri here something is called
hinglish 
""
""
hinglish
""
""
uhn
""
""
i know  hinjali 
""
""
not  hinjali   hinglish hinglish
""
""
hinglish means 
""
""
h i n
""
""
yeah i know hinglish 
""
""
yeah
""
""
hindi english
""
""
yeah 
""
""
combined 
""
""
english spoken by you know 
""
""
hindi speakers 
""
""
hindi speaking  but of course they won't be speaking these
people 
""
""
 accha  
""
""
where you know hinglish  is modified according to their
convenience 
""
""
 haan   uh so where did you come across
this english 
""
""
this comes  in newspapers  in printed news 
""
""
hinglish  once i came across like  hinjali  
isn't it
""
""
 hinjali  i don't know 
""
""
hindi you remember  i think uh 
""
""
so in english i have come across but  hinjali  i don't
know
""
""
 hinjali   it's  uh  i think their argument
influences in punjabi from  i think nil the other way round there are
some influences of  punjabi songs  in hindi 
""
""
uhm  that way it could be 
""
but  it's  
""
""
that 
""
""
but there is something  different  na 
""
""
yeah that is also   something different  
""
""
 that  
""
""
their way
""
""
i just remember that uh that one
""
""
and we
""
""
i remember the words 
""
""
yeah another form of  variants of english
""
""
yeah  but what is   it 
""
""
 indian   english  will be considered as a
variant of english or variety of english 
""
""
it is a variety spoken here in india
""
""
and variant and  va  variety say  i think they are
 quite different
""
""
yeah    they are  just
""
""
 variant  
""
""
variant
""
""
uh so that  it's  uh 
""
""
variant variant  is uh
""
""
variant is 
""
""
is a little different from i think  variant 
""
""
uhn 
""
""
varieties of these  very necessarily main influences 
""
""
i think it differs on which perspective you are trying to say
that no 
""
""
no that 
""
""
variant means uh  hinglish 
""
""
no i  variant  in fact it contains
""
""
i can yes some sudden
""
""
it can
""
""
uhn
""
""
it can have some  substance  of you know that makes
""
""
yeah  yeah  that's  true
""
""
 substance  or you know away from the north
""
""
 haan   yeah  that's  one 
""
""
but i think it is a very vast topic  so unless you define
some range 
""
""
yeah 
""
""
unless you bring certain 
""
""
but you
""
""
uh  certain certain acceptable you know criteria
""
""
a rough 
""
""
uh this indian english will be too hard  and uh you note a
 useless for an indian english
""
""
i think regarding this we have to take other exam with
faculty   no  you know sushil kumar  one word  will it go
straight uh
""
""
 no  
""
""
so we pick up a case  indian english in manipur  or
what is called indian english in manipur or manipuri indian english 
""
you take up that case 
""
even though manipur is a small state  uh most indians don't
know about manipur  very less  it speaks more 
""
but even though it is a small state tiny state  so called tiny
state  you have to take up a project like indian english  spoken in
manipur  you will see how many varieties  how many different forms 
i do remember  hindi spoken by these  people like kukis once 
already there are friends and colleagues  and the  primoga  
even that  those two americans 
""
""
i know   as far as  that    two words
  error is displayed
""
""
 that then uh  
""
""
 then uh  
""
""
see in the in the case of uh  doctor uh  you know that
uh  or economics professor muslim professor  they will speak in a
different  there use and way you know   it's  been the way they
speak english is different 
""
so  it's  a english academy which is
""
""
no the way they speak is manipur is a   in uttar
pradesh  they speak manipur uh english is not so different as   no
 this
""
""
 there is a  
""
""
 no   
""
""
i think i think there is some differnce 
""
then uh
""
""
i don't see there is much 
""
""
dr n  loken   the elder brother of dr. loken 
uh  he'll  speak in a  typical so called intellectual student like
intellectual way 
""
""
all this is higher 
""
""
what is it?
""
what is your opinion
""
""
ah they are smaller in one  na  it will uh 
""
""
they are  tribals  for example uh  uh
""
""
yeah  that's  true
""
""
or professor
""
""
ha literateurs  are there 
""
""
henry
""
""
ah 
""
""
they speak in english in a different way  and again 
even now this kukis speak english in a different way from  tamkuls  or
other nagas 
""
i think   yeah  you may think that i am a kuki upper
""
""
 yeah  
""
""
ahn
""
""
i was just  i was just
""
""
 that's  not a  one word  difference are 
 so  bound to come 
""
""
 so  
""
""
then 
""
""
 that's  what there is the  the debate of indian
english 
""
""
uh you take up  even in a tiny state there are so many
varieties
""
""
yeah 
""
""
so how many we work at it 
""
you have to  you have to define a range 
""
""
yeah here 
""
""
upto which you can consider certain things 
""
there is english for part of what i can which is considered as
certain range 
""
upto which you can consider certain things
""
""
i mean  it's  sort of fresh   or 
""
""
 something   a language  something a language
 for a suitable language 
""
then after area you have to decide define certain things 
acceptable  english see
""
""
acceptable norms 
""
""
ahn  whether it is indian english call english hindi 
just forget that but what you have to define
""
""
uhn 
""
""
then only you can take up
""
""
as as you have american started earlier english  na
 i think we should although we  i think we already have a 
indian style  we have it you know 
""
""
we have to have considered a limit na extreme   limit
""
""
""
 yeah  
""
""
yes 
""
""
and then whatever falls
""
""
arrange 
""
""
whatever falls 
""
""
within that range
""
""
within within range in that range then  on  then only
you speak up in indian english 
""
otherwise you continue with that english
""
""
i think if we get an influence 
""
""
 haan  
""
""
rush 
""
""
with english spoken like
""
""
 one word 
""
""
manipuri special dialect  all that you have to include
""
""
""
yeah 
""
if you want to represent a model of india
""
""
ah  that's 
""
""
 that's  true 
""
""
it will become an impossible to   yeah  do that kind
of
""
""
 yeah  
""
""
english that  that's  spoken here in indian no 
""
""
so it is a it is a vast topic 
""
i think we can somehow please stop here
""
""
ahn
