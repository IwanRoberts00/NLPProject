resolution adopted in the last general body meeting that is special general body meeting  i hope the members approve  now about the secretaries report  after this report uh relates to the period after the previous general body meeting  uh about teachers problems which are pending so far we'll  come to that issue at a later stage  but what has been done during this intervening period i think can be stated in a very brief manner in the following words  the president the secretary and the member of the executive council of supta attended national executive council meeting of a i one word on eighth march nineteen ninety-four in delhi  at the same time they participated in a morcha  and dharna organised by the one word  where the major demands were number one pay revision that is appointment of a panel for pay revision  number two uh earlier demands which have been pending for a long time with the u g c and the government of india regarding inclusion of uh teaching experience as demonstrators and tutors in the total length of service for placement purposes  number three promotion of readers to professors in the universities and uh some minor things  but these were the three important major demands uh which were presented by the one word morcha on the parliament  and i am very happy to uh report that uh subsequently  immediately at the same time uh the minister for human resources development was very generous enough to invite a select uh you know group of people representing one word  they had a discussion  subsequently the u g c chairman also invited a larger contingent  uh for discussion where again most of the pending problems of the teachers were discussed  and uh as you might all be knowing recently uh the most important demand that is appointment of a pay panel uh has been considered by the u g c and uh a committee for pay revision of college and university teachers has been appointed uh under the chairmanship of professor rastogi  uh as a result of which incidently the thirty-first uh july  uh sorry august demonstrations were cancelled by one word   subsequent to that uh of course in a very casual manner i would say i will have to uh recall to you the two days  where perhaps for the first time supta organised some cultural activities after a long gap  uh one was that uh article show by uh laxman deshpande  from marathwada and another by vishubai bapat uh kutumba  rangale kavyat  then uh comes the mention regarding the efforts made by  supta with the authorities of the university for installing or instituting rather a prize for a good teacher every year to be awarded on the day of the university foundation  incidently the whole affair began with the announcement by the authorities that a prize of this nature will be instituted for only non-teaching employees of the university  not only that uh the sons and daughters and ward of non-teaching employees of the university they were to be given some prizes for their excellent performances in the various examination  when that circular uh was raised by some of the office bearers of supta we immediately rushed to the university authorities discussed the matter with them and then subsequently a written demand was placed that the teachers are also employees of the university and they also must be considered for this kind of treatment and fortunately in the subsequent executive council meetings of the university the demand of the teachers was considered and i hope on the first uh that is coming eighteenth november nineteen ninety-four first of such awards will be issued uh awarded  and uh let us hope uh some of you is going to bag that award then this womens' well  women's cell committee conducted two meeting  a report has been prepared by that committee  the report will be presented to the body subsequently  then as you all remember we organised a discussion on the  maharashtra universities act nineteen ninety-four  we have also submitted a demand to the university authorities regarding uh issue of laminated i-cards  uh they have been issued to the non-teaching employees and again we were perhaps forgotten  and only after we approached the authorities and uh brought it to their notice that they have agreed in principle that similar laminated i-cards will be issued to the teachers also  then we have submitted another representation to the university authorities regarding uh some particular problems of the  adult and continuing education department number one and one word  their problems relate mainly to some cofusion regarding new facilities whether these people that is academic non-vacational employees of the university  they are entitled to some kind of earned leave in lieu  of the period for which they work during vacation  that kind of a demand has been placed and uh enquiries are being made with the u g c as well as the state government  recently just three days back uh according to the suggestion made in the meeting of the supta members  very recently held to discuss maharashtra universities act nineteen ninety-four   the some very important deficiencies in the act were discussed at that time and it was suggested that a committee be constituted uh tandurkar myself uh mr kalme  uh we were supposed to prepare a draft  i had been keeping in touch with these people  making request again and again  uh may be because of their other preoccupations they were not in a position to submit their uh notes or comments to me  ultimately i had to prepare my own uh note and i have sent a note to the government of maharashtra uh more particularly to the secretary uh department of law  uh of course if you want the contents of the letter i can read them out  of course this is a very important uh aspects of that act  so everybody should be aware of that uh reads the letter  to honourable pratima one word secretary law and judiciary department government of maharashtra mantralaya bombay  maharashtra universities act nineteen ninety-four that is the subject  madam uh at the unanimous suggestion of the members of  supta i in the capacity of secretary seek your permission to submit following modifications for your kind consideration and necessary action under section one one six of the act maharashtra act number thirty-five of nineteen ninety-four  number one uh section twelve one a i should be deleted  as it will lead to awkward situations in the actual working of the university  because secretary higher education and technical education  becomes ex-officio member of management council of the university  it would be more appropriate to allow the senate of the university to nominate this person  i hope you remember that in the selection committee for the  vice-chancellor's posting the new act provides for a committee of five persons one nominee of the academic council the other nominee of the management council the third would be the nominee of the univesity grants commission the fourth is the secretary in-charge of higher and technical education and the fifth is the nominee of the govern uh governor  uh very interestingly the position of the secretary for higher and technical education is secondary to the position of a vice-chancellor and in the actual conduct or operation of this particular act the secretary will be a member of the selection committee and subsequently he will come to the executive council of this university and be a member of the management council under the chairmanship of the the same vice-chancellor whom he appoints  so both for him and for the vice-chancellor perhaps the things would be very awkward and everybody has agreed to this even uh in a recently conducted meeting of supta uh sorry  suta this point was raised and they have also  agreed that something will have to be done regarding this particular point  uh let me clarify u g c has to nominate one member  the academic council of the state university will have to nominate another member  the management council of the same university nominated one more member the governor also has nominated the third fourth member that is one uh mr b g deshmukh the chairman of the rest of maharashtra  what you call vaidhanik vikas mandal or something like that  and uh the secretary in-charge of higher and technical education is not to be nominated  he is automatically by his position a member of the selection committee ex- official
