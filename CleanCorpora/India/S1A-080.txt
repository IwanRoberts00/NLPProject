""
""
uh i wonder this has been actually defined you know what what
gossip consist of  because one of the things that it consists of is  uh
uhm attitudes and emotions i mean  it's  a very emotive kind of use of
languages this    precisely  gossip
""
""
 precisely  
""
""
  precisely   precisely     this is
  this is   very
""
""
highly coloured
""
""
highly coloured
""
now gossip i believe is like humour  which is peculiar to every
language
""
""
uhm 
""
""
and every culture  and every  you see and there is
something which is  which you can't pass on
""
""
uhm 
""
""
i mean just as you cannot  see poetry is something basic
   uhm  the people and culture  so has humour
""
""
 uhm  
""
""
uhm 
""
""
and i think more than poetry and humour is gossip
""
""
uhm 
""
""
because it is there letting yourself go    and 
letting yourself go is letting your  say orientation of thinking and
feeling    yeah  really have a free place
""
""
 yeah  
""
""
 yeah  
""
""
yeah
""
""
and that kind of thing you see i   wonder  if 
they see that is some of us  you've  to do it in the language  in
which you see  this is not that it will be that oriented
""
""
 yeah  
""
""
yeah 
""
""
some of us would be playing to the oriented and  say other
languages  that means other than our   own  and  isn't it
 might be   possible  but i do not know how far is  
this possible 
""
""
 uhm  
""
""
 yeah  
""
""
 because there   are certain words you know 
which have that value 
""
uh for instance words like   faltu  and uh 
you know 
""
""
you see this is i think
""
""
 patao  or some such things
""
""
pushpinder this is letting yourself go
""
""
yeah 
""
""
now whether you can let yourself go    yeah  in a
language which is not the language of your
""
""
 yeah  
""
""
yeah 
""
""
i mean  basic upbringing or basic  say orientation of
your    yeah  thinking and feeling structures
""
""
 yeah  
""
""
yeah 
""
""
you see this is    yeah  that is this  an 
and mostly gossip is just than talking about nothing
""
""
 yeah  
""
""
yeah 
""
""
and yet you see you find people  extremely at home which is
there
""
""
yeah 
""
""
and extremely interesting
""
""
yeah 
""
""
i mean if you if   you  would reduce it to a 
some kind of a dramatic content 
""
""
 yeah  
""
""
uhm 
""
""
anyway it accounts to nothing
""
""
uhm 
""
""
and yet you see    when   when   you
  you   see  see people gossiping    yeah  i
think they  they're  completely  i mean there is sort of  two
words  sense of feeling at home    yeah  you see
""
""
 yeah  
""
""
 yeah  
""
""
perhaps it has a psychological uh  dimension as well as a
social one
""
and we are talking about  you know  one word  social
cultural  uh pattern there which are evident or    it's  a
   it's  a   form of  social behaviour  which is
 specific to  any culture to  uh but i think there is a
psychological dimension as well
""
just as in humour  there is a psychological dimension  that
you know  it's  a play of the  uh uhm subconscious or   in
  in    in grotesque in fantasy i mean    it's
    it's    subconscious coming out 
""
so even in gossip there are these  these psychological factors
isn't it ?
""
some kind of hatred or  uh maybe some feelings of angrer or
jealousy or whatever
""
you know     one word   instead of uh you
because you don't have a way of expressing them openly  or just saying how
i hate so and so  or uh i i detest that person and uh  i wish i could
kill him or some such thing 
""
you don't uh   pu  put it in that way  but you 
gossip about that person or you talk about that   person about 
 little things that the person does  or doesn't do and so on  going
out with so and so or   having a 
""
""
  one word   
""
""
 but  that's   one word   
""
""
 no i wanted   to say they are psychological
""
""
yeah
""
""
probably trying to make some kind of distinction between this
social and psychological
""
""
yeah 
""
""
and   i i   i     don't think i
don't think 
""
""
 not yeah not the total distinction   but   i
mean  these are two aspects
""
""
 no i  
""
""
no no i don't think    they  i don't think
""
""
 they  
""
""
yeah
""
""
i don't think they are two aspects 
""
i think they  two words  relatonship is rather organic
""
""
uhm uhm
""
""
it is psychological in fact if you try to understand it and
see it in terms of the genisis
""
""
uhm 
""
""
you will find rooted in your collective unconscious
""
""
uhm
""
""
you will find it rooted in your   then  
obviously your habits are really  coming to terms with it
""
""
 right  
""
""
right
""
""
coming to  and and expressing it
""
""
yeah yeah
""
""
so so we  two words  that distinction does not stand
""
""
yeah 
""
""
you see   the the   the   in between the
collective social and    yeah  then psychological
""
""
 yeah  
""
""
yeah
""
""
you see what in fact  you see one  i mean one could say
 is that this is the  say   the the   the  
pshychological factor that you are talking about  would be  i mean how
an individual absorbs    uhm  you see or response to whatever one
has inherited
""
""
 uhm  
""
""
uhm
""
""
this is not that collective   uh   you see level
   uhm  that of ones    uhm  i mean social
existence
""
""
 uhm  
""
""
 uhm  
""
""
 uhm  
""
""
uhm
""
""
so it is   they   they   there would be
of course i am not trying to rule out the personal inclusion  personal
action    uhm  personal action will be there
""
""
 uhm  
""
""
uhm
""
""
but the personal action would be see you will have to see in
terms of uh  i mean the style of  one's  feeling  i mean talking
about  one word  things or  you see stressing certain things 
  yeah  or
""
""
 yeah  
""
""
now suppose you were to take   a   the  
 con  concrete instance you know 
""
say a concrete instance of how we  gossip in the staff room for
example 
""
so i am going to take a  another instance like 
stardust film gossip   or some such things
""
""
true true i mean staff room    yeah  gossip is
more different from  stardust gossip 
""
""
 yeah  
""
""
yeah yeah
""
""
see i i
""
""
so we can take any context  and that is the written uh 
kind of thing and this is uh  uh spoken  but now if we were trying to
 if we were to try and analyse  uh what we do  when we gossip say in
the staff room or in in a party or something
""
""
yeah  that's  true
""
""
uh what  what  what   social and psychological
dimensions   you   you   think   are are  
are   they 
""
""
  i  i'll  tell  i will tell i will tell i
will tell i will tell    i'll  tell   you  
social and psychological dimesions are undermined    uhm  in even
whatever  we really  say pass and start from gossips
""
""
 uhm  
""
""
  uhm 
""
""
 but   we are trying to  one word   what
we are trying to do is
""
""
yeah
""
""
to either run away from certain things    uhm 
from certain tensions    uhm  from certain contridictions
""
""
 uhm  
""
""
 uhm  
""
""
yeah
""
""
from certain say  certain form  their phase or certain
""
""
sure  yeah
""
""
or  you see we are trying to have adjustments
""
""
yeah 
""
""
or  we are trying to  really transform them   
yeah  into some kind of  socially respectable kind of  
communicate   communication   i mean   comminicability
""
""
""
 yeah  
""
""
 yeah   uh i
""
""
so   the the   the   i   i 
 mean   if we   if we      yeah  had i
mean this you you they are not talking in the air  one word  not just
floating there
""
""
 yeah  
""
""
uhm 
""
""
i mean  it's  not just that i enter the staff room
when i am off my  say  phase and i am off my  say grounding
""
""
uhm 
""
""
i i am there and then  ob  obviously that kind of a
gossip has acquired a kind of a grammar of its own
""
""
uhm 
""
""
it has acquired a    gradient    grade
  of its own
""
""
uhm 
""
""
and i only fear   that  whatever we talk about in
the staffroom    uhm  it gets talked about more   
uhm  under the  one word  of that grammar
""
""
 uhm  
""
""
 uhm  
""
""
 uhm  
""
""
yeah
""
""
i mean  one word  abiding by a certain idiom  or a
certain you see habit of saying things 
""
there are certain  you see way of verbalising things
""
""
uhm 
""
""
rather than you see what may have been gossiped about  if
we were not  i mean under this kind of  one word  of  one word
""
""
""
yeah 
""
""
say of another language  and striving for    ah
ha  specific kinds of effects
""
""
 ah ha  
""
""
oh so you think that you know that  english comes in 
  english comes  uh in a way over it
""
""
 english comes  
""
""
we we being  one word  comes in  one word 
right   this is this is   this is   an english coffee
""
""
 laughs 
""
yeah 
""
""
and when i gossip  gossip in english staffroom
""
""
ha
""
""
and the particular kind of  say first  one word  of
effects which we    uhm  think you see are respectable enough
""
""
 uhm  
""
""
ah 
""
""
or which are interesting enough   uh  which you see
 which  one word  have some air of  say some air of
respectability
""
""
 uh  
""
""
uhm
""
""
i mean i do not know i mean this is it is directly you you
wouldn't like to  just wait  say  i mean just like i mean just would
like to something that is  uh vulgar   or  that is not 
respectable
""
""
 yeah  
""
""
yeah 
""
""
you see  the  now this scene of respectability  is
i fear
""
""
yeah
""
""
not merely  a  say  a bottleneck
""
""
uhm
""
""
only in respect of samething  expressing or communicating
""
""
uhm 
""
""
probably this also influences  in a very  constitutive
    uhm  and familiar way what really is said
""
""
 uhm  
""
""
uhm
""
""
or what really is talked about
""
""
uhm uhm 
""
""
so therefore  i mean with the the i think the gossip takes
uh 
""
""
yeah
""
""
overtakes us 
""
""
yeah
""
""
and  it's  really is is played out    yeah
 through us
""
""
 yeah  
""
""
yeah
""
""
i mean some kind of  isn't it ?
""
""
yeah 
""
but you know  it's  part of that running away that you said
in the beginning you know
""
that  uh  it's  part of our uh  desire to run away
""
""
uh now english serves a very useful purpose   over there
 because  uh  running away from our actual circumstances also
means running away from our language or from our real being and so on 
""
and so in the context of the staffroom  uh what happens is that
we run away from those  uh real  things   and uh 
""
""
 no you can't say that  
""
""
 and   and what do we run away too   you
see we are not sure 
""
""
 and what we run away too is a   constructed 
 laughter  you know discourse 
""
 it's   it's  a   it's  a constructed
world  cough  and uh  in that world as you say of course we are
very careful  that we don't violate  some of the    some of
the  circulated norms you know
""
""
 we we we  
""
""
we we are playing the game
""
""
yeah 
""
""
and the games for i mean for which in fact we device the
rules
""
""
uhm
""
""
but now the rules really get better of us
""
""
yeah
""
""
so that we game is being played by the rules in fact
""
""
yeah 
""
""
and we are probably   mean  we we probably become
instruments
""
""
 yeah  
""
""
yeah 
""
""
so
""
""
i find that happens quite a lot to me because  what
happens is uh sometimes i violate those rules   laughter  sometimes
i  what happens is that i  am  know  in the context of staffroom
one is not supposed to be  talk  talking seriously about it
""
""
that is right   that is what  that is that they
they that is the violation
""
""
 or not yeah  
""
""
yeah   that's  the violation 
""
""
that is
""
""
now sometimes i put my foot in then i start talking seriously
  about something   which is considered to be you know uh 
not done there and
""
""
 uhm see see that  
""
""
 that's  not done and
""
""
yeah
""
""
  that is   that is   playing fouls 
""
""
and  that's  the  one word    yeah 
that's  not something that yeah 
""
""
 you see it  one word  i i think   if if
there were a referee 
""
""
yeah
""
""
to see this match of uh    yeah  i mean  to
monitoring this match    yeah  i think he he would probably 
  yeah  i mean uh  declare it as foul
""
""
 yeah  
""
""
 yeah  
""
""
 yeah  
""
""
yeah   that's  right
""
""
uh uh  if you are being honest    yeah  or
you are being serious you see    yeah  this is this a foul play
""
""
 yeah  
""
""
 yeah  
""
""
yeah
""
""
this is not admissable
""
""
 that's  right 
""
""
that is exactly as my difficulty here is
""
""
uhm 
""
""
that the  say  the gossip itself here
""
""
uhm 
""
""
say   we we we   we   just say  
is is   is   a kind of a  construct 
""
""
yeah 
""
""
and  it's  a kind of a some kind of a  game  
you see 
""
""
 yeah   yeah
""
""
now which we  are not very  one word  very acutely
aware of
""
""
yeah 
""
""
you see   once we   once we   start
playing the game
""
""
yeah
""
""
the games get better off
""
""
yeah
""
""
then so do the rules
""
""
yeah 
""
""
and so we merely are then the puppets
""
""
yeah 
""
""
so we are just just his  master's  voice
""
""
yeah
