no sir i am not yet started page i'll i'll  give you the pages whenever it is necessary  my my line of argument will be sir that i'll be  dealing with a case against me  i have divided that according to my learned friend the case in two parts  one is scene two and one scene seven  same uh witnesses  i have uh i have divided  now sir according to i need not tell your honour your honour is well aware your honour is uh has read the evidence and well aware of the the prosecution interruption  yes sir i will be i will be giving a written statement argument also  interruption  yes sir i'll be putting interruption  yes sir interruption  no no sir e e interruption no no it is ready sir it is in my interruption  size sir it wil be sir i interruption  no no sir your  my handwriting uh my my my handwriting is very clear sir  alright sir i'll i'll get it typed   i'll get it typed i'll get it typed sir  doesn't matter sir i'll get it interruption   i'll argue orally orally also  on the same point interruption  your honour may at present your honour may not take  interruption  yes yes sir at present your honour may not take when i  when i am commenting on his argument from the note then your honour will take  because at present i am arguing from my own note which  i'm going to present to your honour yes interruption  now sir as as my learned friend has put it for three hundred and two four wi eye witnesses are there sir  the first eye witness is santosh iyengar pandu  who is the son of deceased  and the the rest three are there sir  the second is arif jauhar  third is kadu timothy and fourth is nasreem  shafi  these are the four persons now i'll i will take one by one   i'll take uh uh p w seven santosh  son of the deceased iyengar sir  my submission is sir that this witness is out to help the prosecution being the blood relation of uh iyengar  as well as kadu achari  so as his sister's son interruption  these are interested witness sir interruption  but sir unfortunately unfortunately yes sir  i i i'm not i am interruption yes sir  interruption  yes sir  i i'm not saying i i i am i am alluding sir few things i will have to admit sir  one one of these is the one the the uh iyengar  has been assaulted and his death has been caused  we don't dispute that  there is also no dispute interruption  who assaulted who assaulted yes interruption   haan accused number six one part accused number  interruption  yes sir so wha interruption  yes sir what and we have taken and whether whether these witnesses who have who have come here and deposed are  trustworthy witnesses in favour of accused number against  accused number two and three  this is way i'm i'm going to start  now the first thing is sir why he insisted witness  because sir they all are uh being close rela uh it is on their evidence that this uh santosh and his mother  after iyengar was removed to the hospital they also followed and went to the hospital  so in that case santosh was in the hospital on three four eighty-eight sir  as my learned friend has pointed out that officer were very alert enough they have examined the eye witnesses on that same day  but your honour will see sir that the evidence of this p w seven has not been re recorded   on on three four though he was available and present in hospital sir interruption   santosh though he was present and available to them in hospital and they were very alert enough to examine all the eye witnesses on the same day if not if uh in the hospital sir   in in in in the in the police station but same day  i am talking of the same day  but though your honour will assign that the statement of  santosh has been recorded on four four eighty-eight next day sir  why why this this uh has been postponed sir  my submission is sir interruption  time is not given  on on i have seen that the original time is not not mentioned sir  but date is date is four four interruption   santosh sir in marathi  the date is four four eighty-eight  time not mentioned sir  i sent to the return services there sir but i have seen it and uh i didn't find it  yes sir  anyway sir  now why this why this delay of one day sir interruption  my submission is sir that the officers when they recorded the statement of eye witnesses specially this arif  kadu and such interruption when they recorded the statement of these p w arif jauhar kadu timothy and  nasreen  in their statements they were not they had not emphatically  said about the assault on seven two and three on  iyengar  their names were not given  therefore they wanted somebody to give the names of these two assailants  further these these two assai  assailants there according to the prosecution  they were known to kadu uh achari and p w three kadamma  because they have seen them in that labour camp locality  and they were knowing the names and therefore they want to put  put these names of names of number two and three in the in the mouth  of p w seven and therefore this delay of one day sir  and therefore my submission is sir that he he is a witness  who being a blood relation is one thing he is out to uh uh say that this uh both these persons and another thing is is that he is under the thumb of the these these two police to say what they want to say  i specially name number two and three  and therefore this delay as i i have already told  yes beg your pardon sir interruption  so he has he has named it three persons only sir  because sir they wanted to in involve  these persons and therefore uh his uh statement has been delayed interruption  yes sir recorder is underneath  now sir let us see the e ev evidence  on record sir  what type of evidence on record has been recorded sir  now he has he has stated sir that the big umesh  assaulted my father by knife i do not recollect on which uh sir it is uh page page seventy-five line eighteen to twenty your honour  interruption  seventy-five sir  ha big umesh assaulted my father with knife  i do not recollect on which portion of the body of my father  was assaulted by big umesh  so i  now sir if if he if he has seen the assault then he should tell sir on which part  as sir your honour will will see sir here he has given  that accused number one assaulted iy   iyengar on chest stomach chest hands and legs  so he'd he'd given given definite part  in his case if he had really seen it sir my submission is sir that he he he should have given the part but he does not give sir he said i don't recollect  but recollection i mean uh that that can't be any reason  for whether whether he has seen it or not seen it that is these are the only two que questions we can we have to answer sir  now this this also sir uh uh is an imp   improvement and uh omission has been proved uh in the  in in the statement uh your honour i will tell one minute  it is one ninety-seven sir  one ninety-seven  page one ninety-seven your honour  no i'm sorry sorry is this this uh contradiction is not proved  this contradiction was not proved   i'm sorry  then sir further up uh at page seventy-five only sir line twenty twenty to twenty-two sir  he says sir   even my father was crying for help nobody from  from the neighbour aaa neighbouring area came forward to help  as n h uh n h s and his associates were threatening  the uh members of the public by saying that that they will kill them  they will kill them  this implement is is proved but yet i'm sorry sir  at page one ninety-seven line three sir from below one ninety-seven line three from below sir  uh uh p w seven did not disclose be be  before me that when when his statement was recorded that accused num uh that and that uh that the two absconding accused threaten the members of the pu   public while interruption  public that's all interruption   haan by that time sir  because it is not mentioned there interruption  yes sir  sir this this contradiction has been has been proved  that he has not said stated so  sir this this is this is definitely a improvement a before this honourable court sir interruption  yes sir  then further sir  i i narrated the the incident to them  this is this is at uh page seventy-six your honour  i narrated the incident to the to them that my father was assaulted  however i did not utter the names of the assailants  now sir if he has not given the names of the assailants  then immediately after the assault he goes to the mother and and tells this i mean part uh uh tells this information  so he has seen the incident if he had seen the incident he could have given the names  my submission is sir that time if he has not given the names that means either he has not seen them sir or he has seen some persons whose names he did not know  this this this can be only two possibilities  then sir page seventy-eight line eighteen to nineteen eighteen and nineteen your honour interruption  yes your hon uh lines were drawn on the ground by chalk  yes yes sir interruption  yes  so and now your honour will see will see sir that all other witnesses specially ka kadu   p w nine sir because he is the person who has who has produced that challa game board  it was cardboard  everybody says that it was a cardboard and uh specially this  kadu he has produced that cardboard  and therefore sir this man when this man says sir that knife is gone on the on on the ground and then in the square  that means this also shows sir that he has not sir he was not present at the at the scene of offence  because what is the fact he does not know sir  now about kadu timothy sir he has he has stated before  the this honourable court sir  for playing the game the the that is at ninety-seven line seven eleven seven to eleven sir in the in the statement of kadu  sir   for playing the game of challa eight  kaudis small stones and cardboard are are required the above mat uh above mentioned material which are required for playing the game were produced by me  he has stated  so actually it was a cardboard when this request states that lines were drawn on the ground that means he has not seen the  he was not at the scene of offence sir  then further up sir  then i come to the the the uh another eye witness p w eight sir  ar arif jauhar  he is a ra ra ra radiator  mechanic ra ready to repairer sir  he admits that he does not have any re  regular training in radiator repairing  he only learnt from his brother who is a who is a radiator mechanic  he is carrying on his business on pavement at karnaik bandar sir that is there in the evidence sir  he he does not he he does not possess any licence for his  business that is at page eigh eighty-nine   your honour  now sir if a person is carrying a business that too on on the path pavement then he must he must have at least a some some place to carry on business because it it can't be carried out on on just on the road sir  this is the in make making uh radiator radiator repairy if he if he has got a shop or a place then he must have a licence for that he doesn't possess anything any document  he has stated sir i will just point out interruption  he said i was he was carrying on the business on on he was carrying on the business on pavement interruption pavement  sir pavement also doesn't doesn't mean that he shouldn't have any licence sir interruption  he says carrying on the business sir carrying on the bus  any business sir anywhere that is licence is required  licence is required b m c licence is required interruption offence  oh yes sir  po po po policeman charged him  for not not not carrying the interruption  without licence interruption  on didn't say sir  so therefo therefore sir this man doesn't produce any evidence to show that he has he is carrying  interruption  he is carrying on the business  yes  he doesn't possess any document  therefore whether really he is carrying on such a business is not proved sir  now sir another thing about this witness i i wa  i want to say sir that he hasn't got any any uh uh regard for the truth sir because he changes the mat  version in just in a second or or sentence for  for that i'll i'll point i'll take your honour  he yes uh at page eighty-three your honour uh at uh line nineteen and twenty-two sir   iyengar was was also assaulted by three more  per associates of n h s  he said this  then sir interruption  of n h uh n h s interruption  now i said that then in the next he said now i say that two other re remaining associates of  n h s a a a also assaulted iyengar  so he make changes in this sir interruption  yes sir then then oh if he has he has seen a certain incident  then there is no necessity to change sir  i understand sir why it is changed i'll i'll   i'll tell your honour  because sir he must have got some some help or some uh audience and note carefully sir who just that you have you have  doing something wrong  so they must have put extra fingers instead of three  so he said two persons  why why he why he doesn't say in the same second line only  interruption  that is my argument he is you take it or or leave it interruption  then sir a question was put to him sir that the version na narrated by me in in yesterday day it doesn't effect that after after gateman refused to open the gate gate this is at page uh ninety-three your honour  the version narrated by me in yesterday's evidence  to the effect that after gateman refused to open the gate i'd  got down from the motor taxi and went to the shop of  yogendra  he is haan yogendra  he is incorrect  he is not correct  so he admits sir what he has stated yesterday was was not correct  therefore i want i am just pointing out sir uh what regard he has for the truth truth sir he himself admits that yesterday the uh whatever i stated was not correct  so my submission is sir that evidence of such a man sir who hasn't got any any regard for the truth should be taken with uh with pinch of  yes sir  then sir the about the inj about injuries to   kadu achari sir p w one  point is sir about the injuries he has mentioned  interruption  you are saying sir  i i i am reading when when i was standing there i i saw  ka interruption  line is like like this sir when i was standing there i saw  kadu kadappa achari kadu kadappa was being brought there on stretcher  so uh i just wanted to uh show these two lines only that he was brought on stretcher by by by members of the public then two lines below thereafter sir i had a talk with kadu achari
