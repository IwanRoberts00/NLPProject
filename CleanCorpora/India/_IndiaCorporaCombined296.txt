let me start with some quotations  one as far as laws of mathematics refer to reality  they are not certain  as far as they are certain they do not refer to reality   this is by albert einstein   introduction of exactness in mathematics and logic is artificial and forced  all traditional logic assumes that precise symbols are employed  it is therefore not applicable to this terrestrial life  but only can imaginal imaginary celestial existence  that is burtrend russell   as the complexity of the system increases our ability to make precise and yet significant statements about its behaviour diminishes  until a threshold is reached beyond which precision and significance become mutually exclusive characters  this is lotsizadeh the founder or discoverer of fuzzy sets  the first is a physicist scientist  the second is a philosopher mathematician logician  and the third is a technocrat  so  what was his name ? lotsizadeh l o t s i z a d e h b b writing   the scientist philosophers and technologist are unanimous  on one point mathematics falls far short of their expectations in coping with reality  let us probe a little deeper  consider the following three questions  question one what will be the distance of the planet neptune from earth on march twenty-eight two thousand and one  ? question two who will win maximum world medals in the forth coming olympics ? question three will the world be better to live in by the turn of the century ? the first question the question about distance  is precise and is and it is possible to give a reasonably precise answer  in some cases a precise answer may not be possible at the present level of technological development but there is a general consensus about the theoritical existence of such answers  the questions of this type can be handled with admirably adequate efficiency by present day mathematics  the second question about the medals falls in the different category  though the question is precise the precise answer is not possible till the event actually takes place  these are speculating questions  and there probablistic answers can be given with the help of  statistical theory  however it is the third type of question which is of primary importance to me in my today's talk   will the world be a better place to live in by the turn of the century ? such type of questions cover very vast areas of our cognition most of the real life problems belongs to this category  the formulation of these types of question is in a very vague language  the meaning of the question may change not only from person to person but from time to time for the same person and yet the question is quite meaningful  all of us will agree that this world needs much to be desired  but the prescription of the better  betterment of the world changes from person to person   will everybody be happy if he or she is rich   ? let us not labour on happiness  philosophers have written volumes on the state of happiness  and the ways to achieve it  but nobody seems to have been benefitted from the reading  of those books except their publishers and possibly their authors  but what about the richness ? the word richness has many shades  but i'm using it in a very mundane earthly sense  how much wealth one should amass so that one is called rich rockfeller is rich so is ford an average indian is not rich  so i think there is some standard on which all of us agree  but such agreement does not last long  a person whom i consider very rich may be an average middle class commoner in the sense of rockfeller  thus the concept of richness seems to be highly subjective  relative or self referential  besides who should be call rich ? one whose annual income is say five million  and if the answer is affirmative what about the one  whose income is little less than that ? say forty-five hundred thousand  and this argument will continue till a stage is reached  where one cannot decide whether a person getting the specific amount would be placed in the category of rich persons or not  for one may seek any threshold for deciding the richness  but a person earning little less than the limit need not be considered non-rich  thus the so called threshold is not only highly arbitrary  but extremely foggy and indiscernible  and still the question is meaningful  most of the questions of real world are of this nature  they are fuzzy  so what causes fuzziness ? there are several factors which contribute to fuzziness  let me mention some of them  natural language the first and foremost among the causes of fuzziness is the intrinsic weakness of natural languages  again it is very much debatable whether it is a  the strength or the weakness  but there are no two opinions that there is some one word vagueness in all natural languages  consider for example the following adjectives uh  tall fellow an intelligent lady  a handsome youth or for that matter  the following sentences   if you work a little harder you will get much more  heavier vehicle should be driven more cautiously  the more they change the more they are the same   though all these are very much meaningful sentences their meaning is never precise  the second factor contributing to fuzziness is  subjective preferences  added to intrinsic fuzziness of a language there is some subjective element related to the user  the same word may have different meanings at different places to different persons at different times and in different circumstances  a young man of twenty-five year will consider a fifty year old  man a old man but if you ask the opinion of the fifty year old on the same question he will say that he's  quite young and energetic  uh there is a very beautiful story about uh this in  vedas  well it is not written here uh completely  prajapati the sup the supreme  creator was once approached by humans god and monster  prajapati created them all but they were unhappy in his world  so they asked him to advise them  prajapati said c c c i mean capital  c  the human thought that they were greedy  they wanted everything for themselves that must be the cause of their grief  so prajapati must have told them to show charity  charity starts with c   g god thought that they were pleasure seekers they all the time sitting in the heavens  drinking nector and engaged in sensual pleasure  so god uh the prajapati asked them to control themselves and not to allow their passions to take better of them  monsters thought that they were cruel and unkind  they did not care for miseries of others  that must be the cause of their own misery  so prajapati asked them to show compassion  thus c became charity for men control for god  compassion for monsters  well let us assume that in this type of questions some psychological factors are in involved  so let us consider the problem of controlling warmness of water in shower bath  here the concept of warmness depends on the particular person  particular time particular place particular season and above all the particular mental or physical condition of the user  note that this problem unlike the earlier one is not of academic interest but of economic interest of manufacturers of shower bath equipments  and hence for control engineers  the third factor that contributes to fuzziness is inadequacy of information  many a time there is no sufficient knowledge of the system  for example scientist is always aware that he knows no final truth  he may be sceptic even about well established theory  on the frontiers of knowledge he is always on slippery ground if in addition the data is ana  inadequate everything becomes a matter of guess work then all he has to rely upon is a working hypothesis  based on state of the aa knowledge and unprovable basic assumptions  these assumptions can be a matter of verbal  perceptions as in medical and social problems  sometimes one has to infer not only from insufficient data  but also from information which is not wholly reliable  for example if you are working with strategies in the battlefield  next factor that contributes to fuzziness is interdependence of concepts  a cyclical behaviour of natural phenomena is a very  favourite concept of indian a ancient indian philosophers  and cycle has no cut points  the seeds of decay for an indian philosopher are present  in the growth itself  the transformation of growth into decay is so subtle that you cannot put a demarcation line between them  or let us be more plain  if the demand of certain commodity increases its price  rises  but the rise in price results in decrease in the demand  the end affects the means and the means affect the end  to win elections a political party has to take some populist measures  but such measures result into deficient deficit financing and causes inflation  and prices rise  if the prices rise it is difficult to win in the elections this interdependents of concepts causes fuzziness in decision in complex systems like human body or national ec  economy the effects of this fuzziness can be  very easily observed  complexity of the system is one more cause of fuzziness  in many real life problems specially where human element is involved the system is so complex that it is impossible to control or even to take into account all the affecting factors  then it becomes a matter of personal choice to decide which factors are to be considered and which are to be ignored  and such a choice in general is not easy  then cost effectiveness  many a time it is theoritically possible to quantify  all the parametres of the system  but the cost involved in doing so is so huge that  it is more profitable to ignore certain factors and the choice of relevant factors depends many times on personal preferences  this causes fuzziness  fuzziness of concept is an open invitation to paradoxes here are some of them  suppose we have a small heap of stones  small italics   smallness is a fuzzy concept  if we uh remove stones from heap then of course it will be a smaller heap  but even if we add a stone to a small heap it will remain small  now let us start with the heap of a single stone  which is definitely small  since addition of the stone does not affect the smallness of the heap one can go on adding a stone  one stone at a time  and still continue to get a small heap this leads to the paradoxical situation where every heap is small  another uhm paradox which i am going to state here is  bonkare paradox  we all know that real numbers are totally ordered  in this order they are so densely close to each other that  it is impossible to separate consecutive real numbers  one can easily observe that if a  and b are two real numbers however close to each other there is a number a plus b  by two that lies between them  in fact they're there are uncountably many of them lying between a and b  real numbers can be represented as points on an infinite continual uh a straight line  any two adjacent points on the con on the continuum are so indistinguishable from each other  that they almost overlap  the last universalist henry bonkare described this situation by the following formula   a is equal to b   b is equal to c  but a is not equal to c  uh an analogy of this mathematical contridiction may be  described in the following way  suppose we have a whole spectrum of different shades of colours say red anything arranged in order  of lightness of or the percentage of the redness  the change in two consecutive shades is so minute and gradual that even a trained eye can not distinguish them  if s one s two s three are three neighbouring shades then s one cannot be separated from s two nor can s two from s three   however s one can be separated from  s three  and in this sense s one is equal to  s two s two is equal to s three  but s one is not equal to s three   finally i talked of bonkare paradox  this is an ancient paradox  also know as a paradox of a lier   etimonised etimonised who himself a  cretin says that all cretin are liers  now if etimonised statement is true then being a lier himself his statement is fuzz  on the other hand if his statement is fuzz then he not being a lier may say true statement  thus the statement is true if and only if it is fuzz  these paradoxes are the results of our attempt to put in precisely expressed concepts into the rigour of aristotlian logic  the classic case of fitting a square pet in the round hole naturally there is an unbridgeable gap between the two the deductive method that we employ to derive theorems in mathematics and logic is based on the following three basic aristotlian laws   law of identity   a proposition is what it is or in symbols   s is x  the second law law of excluded middle   a proposition is either true or false x  is either y or not y    the law of contridiction  no proposition can be both true and false x  can not be y and not y   just as in a soap opera a character is all good or all bad we have in our above logic either whole truth or the whole untruth there is no room for partial truth  for this reason aristotlian logic is called two valued logic
