 i'm sumati narvekar and i've taken my b sc  which uh faculty  hello a few words  science is not a faculty it's a vast area   it's one of the major  uhn   it's one of the major  that's true and a few words as minor  haan that's right how about  you i have done my arts  what arts  arts arts is b a you know like  yeah b a  yeah  which area  we don't have majors actually like uh  which subjects have you you know in all we have five optionals english basic is always common yeah  and uh psychology history and sociology  ah do you know something about uh use of statistics in psychology  no way  what are these no in p g they use this  no i haven't done my p g i have done my graduation  i'll introduce myself two words  my name is girish hullur and i have done my b sc forestry  so how many two words your studies  families  uhm you should have learnt about uh forty fifty families   one word exclusively uh  one word  forty fifty  yeah  in one year means no it usually our one word tries to see you study entirely botony  yeah entire botony even this ecology and all  ecology then uh physiology entomology all  entomology so two words  hey come on yar i am getting you are getting out of the track okay i'm  okay okay okay  okay so which topic so why why not talk something about the social and all   problems or something like that   you should have listed some something socially relevant and most in thing  eh do you think uh the funds that they are collecting for the earthquake is real worth of  when we have a feeling that nobody is using i mean like  the population is not as much you know it's one word  only there and we are colleting more than uh double funds only no they are creating a sort of reserve fund  it's not fund and in one month two words   one word  it is said that the politicians are only eating it up  no it directly goes to charity associations you nee nee need not be afraid of uh the funds being used appropriatly   not afraid i mean as a citzen i think i should know about it  uhn you've to di directly send it to government okay government will supply the funds to non-government organisation when the people are not existing only what you are doing with the money what kind of people are not existing there are people there are a few words   there are so many people uh the poor people  but the funds that we are collecting not for the there are many villages but the funds that we are collecting i don't think so not for the people that they are existing now uhm  but it's for people who have been crippled and who have been disabled and who are suffering   uhm  uhm uhm   it's not for those who are uh fit and they are uh then  then what  then what  so how do you feel of this programme  what programme  m b a  programme m b a i think uh m b a should be strictly made for uh commerce students and engineering students  no way no way you cannot offer management in every field so  why  there are  no management only i don't think so it's easy for the arts students  atleast they should have some programmes for the   nei you have some programmes arts  nei you have some programmes  arts  of course one word problems nothing like that  it's not problems i mean like we are not used to  we are not taught about uh accountancy statistics  many higher students have this problem i mean you people are hard working and usually we have seen that arts students are very lazy i mean like merry go round type  and the one word students yeah   uhn very lazy  lazy sort of people they are not used to obstacles  that's one word   they are lazy people and in the school time  one word know that sort of  i think they should have some training for the m b a beginners  especially to the arts students oh you mean to have foundation course for   they should conduct separate classes  atleast somehing no the basic foundation should be little bit strong  they'll find that they need a foundation course   to arts and the science students   what do you need it  i think you'll have one word  no means regularly i mean you know even my doctor says  i'm regularly irregular  you better enroll for m b a this thing evening programmes that would be better for you  now i am not this problem are like one word   one word actually i'm  definitely not interested in business i have something more interested in psychology  psychology doing b a psychiatrist and work for the people especially the mentally retarded the abnormal   psychology  and why did you opt for m b a  means it was just for the heck of it i appeared for it  and i got caught  yeah just for one word you need to mould your  career and you know why   i don't think so  i think it is pure luck obviously you don't want to enter into any kind of programme that you no it was actually after my graduation it was of course m b a was the first entrance exam that was out so you know   a few words  so because of success just squeeze in it  i don't know i think just tried your luck  pure luck   it's two words  i know that it's pure luck laughs  so  and i regret entering it maybe i'll be very happy doing it later on  i mean you are planning to do  many people give an excuse of a sort   continue   it's not excuse it's a reason but  i'm not giving it up you know i'm standing by  just offering it  no i'm going to do it you know the first time was we are one word   one word sort of i didn't know how to prepare first semester and all now i know how to yeah now you know you have missed so many one word  in past  i know that's one thing i'll never be  able to compensate  so how do you feel uh aids is research going on now how do you   i'm out of it i've no idea about it  come on you should be aware of it  i mean everybody should be aware of it  of course aware of it but i'm i mean i don't know much about it  hey what would you be after te ten years from now  ten years from now i visualise myself as a more of a practical man rather than in terms of success and failure which is part of one word   hey in which field you are going to be in see any sort of thing i'll have no  boundaries to having suitable say any kind of   suitable  what a plan  what do you mean plan you don't have to plan you know  everybody dreams yar  i don't dream  if you don't dream you can never   hey it'll be lot of question   it's not that only when you dream you think of doing something  you can use  but that is impractical  not practical you every man has to dream it it's  practically proved  dream is something different than  dream in the sense not sit and day dream just you have a feeling in you  someone one word  so how do you visualise yourself  myself somewhere in the public field  maybe helping out with my dad   then you're political figure yes somewhere with my dad   like your dad  particularly politics or writing novels and uh full fledged poet  painter that's it  you are interested in politics  yeah i have two words my dad he is sitting  sticking to this post  so how do feel the corruption towards what kind of a  i think you can do no mean yeah politician you can be a perfect politician only if you are crooked  no way no there're so many people who are not crooked and all  you just can't know you have to be crooked   your dad know much you have  because politics is itself is a crooked field you know  you have to be very crooked in it but you have certain  you you know if you are straight you are pulled down man  you are just pulled down  but you've have some leaders where whereas  you'll have a certain affiliation towards sometime you feel that uh you do it you know means always they are not corrupted  some people will be i don't uh mean like i don't like politicians i like politics   that's running in your blood you know  after sometime you will become one politician  i don't mind i mean only i'll be an actress in one word i'm not a good a politician  i can't be because i'm not crooked yet maybe one fine day when i'm put in the post   one usual kind of  maybe you'll  i will as well solve lots of things have makes a good politician  it's not like accept things which is uh which you have one word  look that is what i dream and i don't that is what  i'm telling it out  so you need a challenge always not guarding your   perspective   something i mean like i have my own set of principle my own way of thinking oh  everyone is now  because i don't compromise with it yes i listen to you yes yes but i do whatever i want to do  compromise means we should compromise at times  look if it is affecting somebody else fine i'll  compromise  no you should compromise with yourself no that's my life yeah one word  it's my life why one word force in my business live and let live that's my policy   no way  so others may be a few words then what  you'll do  well they are elders yeah i i i can't do anything if it's my mother or my father  so you but i'll try to convince them no i do it  behind them no problem   so you  so how do you react to your friends  friends when they suggest something to your own way it might means compromise  look yeah  when it's my friends we share a very different kind of relationship like  we are very frank everybody knows who how and what she is going to do  like they can literally predict your every move  frankness doesn't always mean   i'm telling you listen i'm   telling you know i'm not telling you frankness means frankness means although they're telling what sort of friendship  i'll share with my friends  and everybody knows and most of my friends are my childhood friends they know what i am  i mean they know i won't listen to anybody  but still as a good friend they always give me the advice and if i find it worth and if i can feel that i can take it i do it  accept whatever  you always tend to make certain adjustments in friendship  always like if it if if never imposed no okay if it is together you are doing something yes i'll co-operate whereas i alone have to do it no i don't take anybody's  advice  of course i ask people but the more you ask people the more advice that people giving it's more complicating for you to decide it   if it is  so let's switch on to new topics it's  already boring deciding a single particularly one word  i think sumati should be speaking yeah   she should speak on educational standards now  what yeah  what man  sumati is more like a one word  very good listener and usually you know good listeners they won't like they don't know anything of themselves   two words   keep quiet   laughs   it's true  that's specially true about capricorns so you  one word   oh so you are capricorn he must one word  definitely definitely i'm a capricorn  oh come on don't play tricks on  but you know what they say on leos because of that  leos two words the world the world is stable because of the leo  one word  no why  i'm not bosting okay because i'm a leo  i'm not bosting
