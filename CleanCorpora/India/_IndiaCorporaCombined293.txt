respected chairman distinguished guests and fellow  delegates  i would like to say at the outset i'm very much illequipped paper reader  actually i didn't i was not aware of the change in the schedule which was not really supplied to me yesterday i was one of the first paper readers put down  but anyhow i am happy that i am able to read it read it out today  and taking into consideration the limitations of time usually in such seminars i have jotted down some stray thoughts that too on a known author well discussed by you  of course i am not a committed feminist or anything like that but  based on my own reading i would like to share a few thoughts on sylvia plath's poem  of course with a slight difference from the normally vaulted  past adpoted by most of the major voices  uh the actually i struck upon this idea when i was reading yung in some another context  and i had a feeling that uh perhaps uh plath's  insistance struggle or some sort of an obssession with the definition or redefinition of self could be looked at from the complex concept of sex as sorry of the individual in which two polarities the male and female are combined  but anyhow i have not made a very deep analysis of that problem here  but on the other hand i have taken up a few poems and try to suggest why don't we look at this way and try to see a perhaps  another major concern of plath rather than labelling her as an out and out feminist or a committed confessional poet or anything of that sort perhaps i think one of the major problems which could still be studied in relation to her poetry is the integrity of the self  without being st strictly  related to any gender  or the thrust of my paper which i have intend to elaborate later on is to see that the concept of the self which could be perhaps studied in relation to her poems could be quite free from the gender concerns  she takes into consideration the problems created by the male  as well as the female in defining a self intact  so with this introductory remarks i am reading my paper  the self in sylvia plath's plays it is different  in a very general sense sylvia plath's poetry as a whole has been an insistant search to find and define the self  though she is often labelled as a confessional poet in her perception of the self and the poetic process she is quite different from say dorothy robert loyal john berryman and  annie saxon and the like  she links private motives and images into sequences that form the part of a coherent drama a symbolic enactment  the approach adopted by her in the last poem about which i am making some observations  the last poem contained an aerial  adventurous spirit throws in temporarily for highly individualistic and peculiar perception of the self  the victim sends feminist stance concessional strain  and the suicidal mania gain relevance and meaning when one should read to link these factors with her self or in other words herself  with a difference   plath's feminism her confessionalism and suicide are to be seen in relation to her relentless poetic transformation  an inevitable rebirth through death  a hightened awareness of the individuals painful one word   in contemporary society becomes the central focus of their i mean contemporary poet's poems   plath's poetry of imit   of initiation transformation thus appears within its general social framework as a means of escape from the identities and forces that imprisoned the self in america or perhaps elsewhere in the light of the developments in the post- nineteen sixty context there is some scope for looking at plath's work  from a feminist point of view  this view centres upon her supposed victimisation by a male dominated world and her consequence feminist's stance lack of recognition in a male dominated world shocking childhood experiences and the separation from her husband of course these are all autobiographical factors which may or may not be of relevance paranthetically might have contributed to shape her fury  and even to unchange her true self  feminist views her death as a form of martyrdom  her life a case history in the devilish cultural politics  that favours men over women and destroys women's creativity  actual biographical details of plath's may not augment this stance  however because i think she had sufficient acclaim  her poetry was fairly well ratified but in the particular time at which she was writing say i think poetry was at a lower base  i think even now it is applied  when we list this one word i'm sure the response will be much better when we discuss poetry probably the response is limited because it shows on the one hand the readers'  response response and i think poetry is not in great demand  so that may not be something very peculiar to plath  however the distinguishing feature of plath's self in her poems particularly her later ones is that she looks at the world from the point of view of an oppressed one not strictly gender bound  in the last poems there is a rare fury a total release from fear  the recourse to a aggression in the last poem is neither abreast nor aesthetically uncalled for  i think if you make a total study of her poems beginning with her earlier poems and if you come up to her very late poems this trend could be seen  this was some sort of a progressive release from the clutches  of fear and which culminates in a sort of fury which i think render possible the liberation of the self  of course we can cite poems belonging to both groups   i ci i quote a few lines from  a poem which is usually quoted to cite her feminist strength in  pardah for example she makes a declaration of independence i shall unloose from the small jewelled form from the small jewelled doll she got like a heart  the lioness the shriek in the barks the cloak of whole  in another poem which is a longer poem three women   through the voices of a wife a secretary and a girl she brings to life the feminine sensibilities in relation to being an approved mother with a son a woman with a miscarriage and a girl  with an accidental daughter whom she gives away  here one would perceive the subtle variation that plath effect  to bring to the fore herself  perhaps even in this period of emotional fury and psychological collapse she plucks at courage and pronounces rather forcefully  i quote from winter tree i am no shadow though there is a shadow starting from my feet i am a wife  the city waits and aches  the little grasses cracked through stone and they are green  with light  this robust assertion on the elemental beauty of life  green with life brings in the difference in plath's self  even while being one with a one word a feminist or  a confessionist  while looking at plath's poem from a feminist point of view one has to bear in mind two vital points  one sylvia plath may not be a feminist as one is likely to believe  for she does not commit herself to ideological problems in her writings  if that is a major concern  there is limited gender based class hatred in her poems to my mind  time and again she directs her anger against select individuals  her father her husband or their symbolic representatives  even the passages of a hot nature when i quote that we find in a poem like lady lazarus further the applicant and three women may not be sufficient evidence to argue that plath had a committed well defined feminist politics  at best one could say that in such lines i quote from  daddy her boss her lucifer devour devour out of the ash i write with my red hair and i eat men like air   i'm sorry i've quoted these lines from   lady lazarus one word they are  dancing and scanting jumping on you  they always knew it was you  daddy daddy you bastard i am through  plath directed her rage against in the fantacy image of her dead father and against her husband into an attack on marriage and men or in a more inclusive way which i think maybe more  beneficial against violence against total violence perhaps   with your permission to the audiance  the strength of her mature poetry suddenly lies in her ability to coilate polarities particularly the male female polarities  yielding a delicate or even diabolic of course it is questionable balance in the human strain  this aspect is borne out by her poems lasposs  medusa and the other  really she lashes out with equal violence on women  i quote violent attacks on women in this well sort of  not far and few  this only points to herself with a difference  in lassposs she mocks any bounds that exists between one woman and another as a result of their common gender  or shared oppression  i have quoted the poet herself  i quote from one of her poem your voice my earing  flapping and sucking blood loving bath that's that  that's that you peer from the doors sad had every woman is a whore i can't communicate  so i think her problem of defining the self or her problem of establishing a camaraderie is not strictly regimented to or confined to the men  but on the other hand she has been more or less undergoing this dramatic experience in relation to women also which i think critics have not very often taken into serious consideration   that's my feeling  it may be noted that one of her recurrent images of for  women is the medusa image which i think is not a very enduring one  plath unlike the later feminist never struck to any particular ideology in relation to male female conflicts or what we have now begun to term as even the male female crisis  depending on the poetic situations she shifted her views on the male female issues  for her the prime concern is the integrity of herself  perhaps the difference in her perception and hence her self lies in her existencial streak  i think i'll be in agreement with previous paper reader she strikes again the male and female with equal venom and vehemence whenever they irrespective of the gender become a threat to her self  plath discusses a consciousness of political issues but the focus of her politics was neither women nor men's role in  women's oppression  as she explained in a b b c interview  i quote she was imaginatively involved in those historical political events that are closest to the concerned voice in her poems  she herself has listed a number of concerns hiroshima atom bomb one word and nazism which again points to her protest against the general violence total violence rather than the violence impeached on women by men strictly  the sequence of her late poems the bee keeper's  daughter is quite revealing in this sense  in a way it anticipates the lady lazarus mood  the crux of the sequence in a quest is a quest for an independent queenly self  the first poem the the bee meeting just describes the usual practice of replacing old hives  but it soon becomes an awful ritual for the protagonist  for it is directed by i quote dreary depersonlised  a one word like figures of a midwife a rector and a sexton  as they are also agents respectively of birth marriage and death   the poem turns out to be the first step in a cyclic exploration of the self  curiously these agents are protected  but the protagonist is utterly exposed  i quote nude as a chicken neck  unquote  however the mood of aggression asserting the peculiar strength of her self is sustained in the arrival of the bee-box and stings the end of the rabbit catcher another good poem to be looked at from this point of view clearly suggest the constraints set by  the man in personal relationships maybe a male female relationship  maybe a male say a female female relationship  obviously here too she is concerned with the integrity of the self  she abhors i quote and we two had a relationship  tight wire between us  takes too deep to approve and a mind like earring sliding shut on some quick sand  the constrict the constriction killing me also  two words  even in this way the difference in her self is reflected in her persistance on themes relating to children and rebirths in the poems of her last phase  sylvia plath's confessional mood and mood is a designed to bring forth the peculiarities of herself   morning song nick and the candletick death and company cuts the bee-meeting tulips etcetera are some poems which enable us to go far beyond mere autobiographical revealations  these poems record i quote personal experience in the patterns that obtain an objective character of though repetition  illusion and symbolic inactment  unquote plath right from the beginning to the end in her creative essay has been experimenting with the integrity of the self  i underline the integrity of the self through a series of emotionally charged even hyper charged explorations by her feminist concerns confessional overtures suicidal leaps and through her bold linguistic innovations she could present a self with a difference to the reading public  thank you
