i am uh professor prem singh of the department of the
linguistics university of delhi 
""

i am ravindra gargesh  also of the department of linguistics
university of delhi 
""
""
uh well  since  uh we were talking about  the
problems  uh that we face  in analysis of literary text 
""
uh you see besides  you know  the text in stylistic analysis
 uh what other things you are paying attention to ?
""
you see i am also engaged along with that the whole problem of 
uh uh translation and  uh and in that you see i have told you that 
i've   been dealing with this problem that  all translations are at
the  le   level of parole  not at the level of langue 
""
now how does this fitting include  your theory of stylistics and
understanding of a text  ?
""
""
ah  that's  very interesting  you see  uh first
of all what comprises  textual analysis  because coming from the 
dis  discipline of linguistics  we have to be micro approach to begin
with the micro approach 
""
now in the micro approach  we have to see what the text is
constituted of
""
""
uhm uhm 
""
""
that is the text is a larger    uhm uhm  symbol
""
""
""
 uhm uhm  
""
""
but what is that symbol made of
""
""
uhm uhm 
""
""
and when we break it into its uh  constituent parts  
 uhm uhm  then we have to look at it  in terms of its language
structures
""
""
 uhm uhm  
""
""
uhm uhm 
""
""
language structures in the sense of  in linguistic terms
 as well as in let us say metalinguistic terms 
""
""
uhm uhm 
""
""
in the linguistics terms what are the patterns what are the
 uh how the  uh particular sensitivities are issues are coded  or
certain concepts are coded 
""
and then how that codification  does not remain only the prime
way does not contain only primary limits  but it is to have secondary
limits  within a larger context 
""
""
uhm uhm
""
""
so we have to look at  uh the language at two levels 
""
first level is the level of linguistic structures 
""
""
uhm uhm 
""
""
and in second level will be level of lexical significations
""
""
significations within  textual context 
""
""
so what your significance is not really significant in the
sense of  uh the contemporary or french school  in the sense that  a
particularly there is   an   a   company where they are
trying to  deconstruct  the text 
""
you don't seem to be deconstructing the text in any  significant
way where either the  the entire  structuation  of signification uh
 falls apart in a way  but at the same time it gives you the peep 
a peep into human minds
""
it also believes  a kind of psychological and philosophical and
historical forces involved  in understanding of a text 
""
""
very right  very right 
""
uh we are  i mean the kind of analysis that i am doing  these
are variants between french school different way 
""
but that was primarily  because i think the text as way odd
identity 
""
and uh  perhaps i would not like to begin analysis wherever i
want 
""
so that is one defect  because for the  in the deconstruction
 one can bring in anything 
""
you can bring in your subjectivity to interpret the text 
""
whereas  if text is structured  if human mind is structured
 or if language is structured  then definitely the text must also uh
 get restructured 
""
and if the text has a structure  we have to go from some recent
structure towards the end  or towards significations 
""
""
basically what you are trying to establish is a kind of a 
grammar of  of stylistics and grammar of analysis 
""
and you know if i quote uh that these  all grammars leak
""
""
so what are the leakages in your  laughter 
""
""
yes the grammar is weak and there are  major weaks in this
grammar   so that 
""
""
 even   even you see  though in all linguistic
analysis we know  that  in panini grammar which is called the perfect
grammar  is is  really an imperfect grammar otherwise    yeah
 katyayana would not need to write  uh would not have needed to write
separately  and then openly didn't need to get up and defend panini
against katyayana
""
and sometimes uh you know  one word  makes a  uh fun of
himself
""
""
 yeah  
""
""
oh alright 
""
""
 two words  fool of himself when defending  panini
""
""
""
ahn
""
""
uh  so  one word  worried about is  what are the
leaks  in your grammar of style and your grammar of literary analysis  ?
""
""
well there are many leaks
""
""
ahn 
""
""
 it's  leaving of  it's  leaving everywhere
""
because firstly there is no comprehensive that the grammar of uh
 literary analysis that  one word  you can put it like that 
""
there is no comprehensive 
""
for example  for poetry  for poetic analysis we require  a
separate set of parametres  for analysis 
""
for drama  which may be a non-poetic text particularly  
we'll  require separate uh  uhm parametre for analysis 
""
and for stories  or narratives we would require still separate
parametres of analysis 
""
so you see there are multiple levels of analysis
""
""
i i    and  could say  to catch that i say one
is the phonological one is the morphological level  third is  a
syntactic level in that way  you can't you want to  say that at this
parametre of poetry in these parts fiction then these for drama 
""
i say alright  poetry is a kind of  one word  level 
phonology and  uh a drama at the level of uh  morphology and  and
text  analysis of a  a fiction is at the level of syntax
""
how would you defend  uh your position against mine this this
  your view 
""
""
 and  
""
""
 yes that   would be uh my position will be at
variance  somewhat 
""
uh for poetic analysis i would agree with you that uh 
phonological patterns are significant  morphological pattern are
significant  syntactic patterns are significant  semantic
configurations will be in the sense of figurative language  are
significant 
""
and how these interact and lead down to larger meaning larger
meaning constructs 
""
but in drama  things are going to be different  because by
and large we may have sentences which are incomplete 
""
so there the unit of analysis cannot be a line because poetry would
be line laced or stanzas 
""
but in drama  we'll  have to be very different 
""
 we'll  have to bring in discourse 
""
 we'll  have to talk about speech events  and we will
have to analyse language  as constituting speech event 
""
and the drama would have to be seen as a series of speech events
put together 
""
and we will have significations speech  that's  all about it
""
""
well i think there are  but i still think uh  that 
one word  more and more about it  that most of this analysis  is
at the  le  at the level of parole  not at the level of langue
because it doesn't go  into the soul of literature 
""
uh so then i think there needs to be some compromise between old
 what you call philosophical or historical analysis of the text
""
there must be now  two words  now just say   it's 
a  phenolo   it's   phonologian  don't want to touch it
""
""
uhm
""
""
uh if we do that  then your analysis is primarily based on
the theories of roman jacobs 
""
""
uhm
""
""
and over  jacob's  and  bob's   to a most of
the time  what you will  what modern people will dismiss as
phonological analysis  so that roman  jacob's  and  one word
 pushed in  it's  nothing 
""
""
yeah 
""
""
but  uh but phonological analysis  so we have one needs
to kind of going to uh  certain other aspects and we need to broaden 
uh uhm from or your uh uh  your theory of style  uh then say  
you're  basically  what's   you're  doing is  as a
modifying  partial  position 
""
""
ah yes  in a way you can say that for  ra  roman
jacobsan i would say that his theory was a brilliance with  it's 
practice 
""
in practice he was a grammarian   cough  in theory he was
a phonetician 
""
and the two well there was a significant between the two 
""
uh whereas uh uhm for bob   bob's  known known uh
linguistic facts as well
""
he would account for known linguistic facts like uh uh 
""
""
  for the present  one word   yes bob was
not interested in language for say  roman jacobson was interested
primarily and  in a very fundamental way   uh uh the uh the 
language    yes  or the  one word  work uh verbal
shiftance    yes  in russian
""
uh russian phonology    yes  or french phonology
""
""
 phonographs like uh like  
""
""
 yeah uh in a way yes  
""
""
 yes  
""
""
 yes  
""
""
 yes  
""
""
history of   french phonology  and uh you know and
uh his you know work on lithuvanian and latin accent
""
""
 yes yes  
""
""
yes
""
""
they all  you know basically he was  concerned with
language
""
even his work on  one word  is basically how  we as a
linguist can handle and help  those unfortunate people  for this  uh
uh speech disorders
""
""
yes we generalise the metaphoric mood and the  one word
 mood
""
""
but uh but i think  bob's  was not concerned about any
of these things
""
and needed  needed and  a few words  any of them is
concerned with these issues 
""
so  they're   actually they should be separated in a way
totally  as to separate  theorotically approaches to our understanding
of literary texts
""
am i right  ?
""
""
well as far as uh the scholars themselves are concerned
surely they are talking different things 
""
but when we approach uh  a problem theoritically  surely we
have a right to sympathise 
""
and uh i for one would like to sympathise  simpson's  side
 rather extend the jacobsonian model 
""
because if you see the different analysis that jacobson has made
 of the different texts in french and english and so on 
""
always what he has done is  he has broken down a text books
grammatical structures and simply partition the grammatical practice 
""
and that was the  one word  against him 
""
that the elements that roman jacobson formed in a  two words
 could be found in a pattern of a newspaper as well 
""
so he has dramatical patterning  or he does not   wants
  want  to do the text
""
""
i don't think that  that the correct position as for as
 roman jacobson is concerned because  roman jacobson is very much
concerned about metres 
""
you can't have him  that cut a newspaper text and say there is
a  one word  constructed  every year
""
say for example his analysis of uh  great french poet  one
word   alright   where  he talks about metres
""
pushkins he talks about metres 
""
you know while  no where bob doesn't mentioned metres 
""
""
 yeah  
""
""
so while he had  laughs 
""
""
that you also have been uh they have been doing it  but
trying to escape  metres 
""
""
no i have not never try to escape metre 
""
in fact i begin with metrical analysis  i begin in phonological
analysis 
""
that the first level of  one word 
""
""
the look what i mean is this is  that you have not started
   yes  building a theory   new theory  of metres
""
specifically using the same old metrical  hollan  and
metrical structures and trying to apply them  in new thing
""
this kind of thing was done by  kaiser and holla in here 
 very interesting  book on  you know that they have book on
english metres
""
""
 yes  
""
""
 yes yes  
""
""
 yes kaiser and holla  
""
""
yes
""
""
alright  so what do we do  probably how do we my my
concern is  how to integrate all these things  into main theory of
linguistic analysis 
""
""
yes 
""
""
and we must sit down  must  you know put our minds 
into understanding  these problems 
""
""
i agree with you basically  uh but with one difference
""
""
role of ours is  uh analyse is given the  uh theoritical
perspective of the analysis of narratives
""
""
uhm uhm 
""
""
take for example chaucer to come back 
""
so we can't say that he was not language  one word   or
he was not  uh doing literary kind of analysis  he was not taking
literature as  part of his  one word 
""
he was taking literature as well
""
but of course his preoccupations much large 
""
""
uhm 
""
""
and uh  what i mean to say is that of course there is need
to integrate everything
""
integrate  more into this stylistic theory 
""
what we have done so far is not that sufficient 
""
metre must be seen afresh from new perspective i do agree with you
""
""
and uh  laughs 
""
""
 let's  move back to again
""
""
yes
""
""
 let's  try to understand  uh the relationship of
saussure with all these people  particularly saussurian type  one word
""
""
""
yes
""
""
and how people have been using them  and now and then 
sometime literary people without even understanding  uh what is meant by
it  you know contrast and opposition it 
""
what is meant by the saussure thing that  uh all linguistic
analysis  is basically an algebra of oppositions and contrasts
""
""
yes
""
""
alright  uh even if we leave out all other
""
""
but this is exactly
""
""
and if really think of that    uhm  two things
come out of saussurian  analysis  very clearly
""
""
 uhm  
""
""
yeah
""
""
one is  that  people don't understand
""
that this whole theory is based upon   two words  theory
of  one word  
""
""
ah ha 
""
""
and other thing that come up  very clearly  uh all sort
of sassurian these people are not kind to uh  one word  i don't
understand  that the concept of opposition  is basically again red
indian and foreigners 
""
 it's  not saussure
""
""
would you like to elaborate on that ?
""
""
ah yes i can
""
see  uh when you  when saussure talks about that x and y 
and g    uhm  are in opposition
""
and they are in a net  net  one word  of contrast is
there
""
""
 uhm  
""
""
uhm 
""
""
alright
""
then the same kind of thing was being said by  pre-paninian 
uh  two words  authentic
""
""
uhm
""
""
that sounds are primarily  in a system of contrast and
opposition they do not exist by themselves
""
""
ah  that's  wonderful
