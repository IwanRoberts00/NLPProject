""
yeah november
""
""
november
""
""
last week

""
yeah
""
""
last week
""
""
uhm
""
""
because his cousin marriage is there   that's  why
he wants to go and be present
""
""
so friend is close  very close 
""
""
friend means cousin not friend
""
""
oh  relative marriage   laughs  oh
""
""
 that's  why he wants to go 
""
maybe he will go after one week 
""
""
then he will be away for another week or uh  he will
return within  short period 
""
""
no no it will take so nearly one week to
""
""
ah marriage is to attend one day 
""
""
one day marriage but uh  he has some work there 
""
so he  he will he will distribute some  wedding cards and
""
""
""
so he has to look after    yeah  and arrange uh
 of course 
""
for  diwali  you won't go there no 
""
""
 yeah  
""
""

""
""

""
""

place
""
""

""
""

""
""

""
""

""
""

""
""

""
""
uhm  actually  dassera  is 
navratri utsava  no 
""
""
uhm 
""
""
nine days  celebration 
""
first day is just  two words 
""
""
yeah
""
""
that all ladies are  gathered one  street and 
they play with some songs 
""
after seven eight days    uhm  another festival 
that is uh   one word     uhm  that day also they
play
""
""
 uhm  
""
""
 uhm  
""
""
uhm 
""
""
uh next day  dassera  
""
we celebrate  daseera  we put one  uh  a
few words  
""
""
you know it is being on this uh  by depression  in the
bay of bengal loss is  some town in your  state 
""
you know how much  uh that property and the livelihood lost
 because of this time    uhm  that flood situation
""
""
 uhm  
""
""
yeah flood
""
""
cyclone affected
""
""
cyclone effects 
""
""
uh yeah 
""
""
uh  i think 
""
""
but  that  death toll is going up  for sometime 
""
""
do you have any  this statistical uh  data 
approximately
""
""
see i have no idea about that  but i saw in paper 
""
""
yeah yeah 
""
""
uh nearly four hundred or five hundred members are dead 
""
""
five hundred members 
""
""
four five hundred members  in flood situation
""
""
uh
""
""
because they  don't  know they  don't  know how
to escape from  uh flood  because this is first time flood came in
raelsima district 
""
""
is it is it the first time 
""
""
in raelsima district
""
""
oh
""
""
near the coastal area every    yeah  time it will
come
""
""
 yeah  
""
""
so what is the useful  uh ways to 
""
""
that flood
""
""
every year they will uh 
""
""
in coastal area in manglore and uh 
""
""
cyclone blast
""
""
srikakulam  coastal area will come  cyclone  but uh
first time raelsima district 
""
""
so raelsima is also in coastal area  but uh in karnataka
""
""
not always this is first time 
""
so  that's  why  they   don't know how to escape
""
""
""
  a few words    any crop was in the 
""
""
yeah total  so many villages are 
""
""
drowned in the flood
""
""
uh drowned in the flood 
 uh that how many days it was uh  lasting this cyclone  uh effects
""
""
""
no nearly one week 
""
""
one week uh
""
""
nearly one week uhm one week 
""
so many  bunds  and uh 
""
""
did you  get to the state  get any relief from other
states ?
""
""
no
""
""
uh
""
""
tamil nadu government they gave some    relief 
fund
""
""
 what  
""
""
one one  a few words 
""
""
prime minister uh sorry     karna   chief
minister relief fund
""
""
  karna   
""
""
uh like uh
""
""
uh as well as hear in the news that uh  uh deve gawda
also
""
""
 haan  central government
""
""
 two words  some
""
""
fifty  crores rupees 
""
""
fifty  crore rupees  
""
""
we got the 
""
""
as you said uh  that  death toll and everything  did
it  a few words  sufficient to meet that 
""
""
uh 
""
""
the destruction caused  uh that cyclones 
""
""
uhm
""
""
 a few words  might be large  area  that the
population in the 
""
""
deve gowda  saw the situation  by helicopter
""
""
ah ha ha  he  ca  came
""
""
he came to  one word   one village
""
""
when did he come 
""
""
ah he came  in third week 
""
""
third week
""
""
third week of this month  and we saw him  in
helicopter 
""
in the  one word   ordered fifty  crore rupees
  as a relief    relief fund 
""
""
 it is   released or uh 
""
""
released
""
""
just only in uh    one word  
""
""

rupees  
""
so some industrialists and uh some business magnates in andhra
pradesh 
""
""
ah ha  they are also providing
""
""
ah providing some aid  to this flood victims 
""
""
oh 
""
""
so anyhow it is very horrible situation in andhra pradesh 
""
""
so  one word   it happens almost every year
""
""
every year but this is first time in raelsima district 
""
""
ahm 
""
""
this is very horrible
""
""
this time it is     haan  
raelsima 
""
""
  haan   
""
""
any   cine  actors uh  contributed anything for
the heavy toll 
""
""
 but  
""
""
uhm  well they are
""
""
 two words 
""
""
they are the  hard workers uh   two words 
""
""
big money they are enjoying all the facilities
""
""
yes it is 
""
but uh i think saw the paper  they will  gave  one word
 or not
""
""
yes cheeranjivi is one of the  popular
""
""
cheeranjivi is one of the  popular actor he is super
""
""
well he is the
""
""
super star in 
""
""

""
""
in telugu films  telegu cine films 
""
""
ah nagarjuna is uh 
""
""
leading actor
""
""
leading actor
""
""
uhm 
""
but uh  uh since two three years two years  his films are
good 
""
""
uhm uhm 
""
""
 that's  why
""
""
so  that uh  type of uh  blind uh  support you
give him for his 
""
""
uhm
""
""
the  a few words 
""
""
yeah 
""
""
yeah  you see his last films also last years
""
""
uhm
""
""
yesteryears also  you may find something  that 
films are  and i think so good
""
""
uhm 
""
""
because we are supporting him blindly  we may  see his
uh  even uh this uh   one word  films
""
""
uhm
""
""
or uh   a few words 
""
""
uhm
""
""
so this uh  this type of craziness is now  wrong 
coming down
""
""
uhm 
""
""
so i think uh  people are realising or uh  something
bored with this uh  peoples act
""
""
all 
""
""
so that they are getting  new faces
""
""
ah new faces and
""
""
so new faces they are  they have to know this whole
business and uh 
""
""
yes  actually cine fightings also  fightings and
stories  all are old movie types
""
""

""
""
old movie stories   that's  why 
""
""
south indians  one word

""
""

""
""
very little
""
""
very little
""
""
and they have to get uh more money
""
""
more money 
""
 that's  why  one word 
""
""
low budget  films
""
""
ah low budget films 
""
 that's  why the films are not
""
""
but  cheeranjivi is having superstar he  one word
