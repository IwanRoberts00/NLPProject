doctor agarwal and my and professor pandya and my friends  it is my previlege to be with you and uh whatever doctor agarwal has said it is exaggerating it uh form or thing  i do not have those qualifications which he has narrated just now only thing is that uh i have been throughout a teacher  and a very long career of a teacher  earlier i was in uh rajghat baseti school a foundation for new education society run by doctor j krishnamurthy  foundation  and uh then i heard him in fact i had no intention to become a teacher but after hearing several lectures of doctor krishnamurthy  which was which had changed brought a change in my attitudes in life  i have not become disciple of anybody so far but most of these philosophers had been uh having some or the other impact on me  and i remember krishnamurthy as saying that when you want to create something new you have to start afresh you can't uh begin with the middle  and if you do it you will simply improve upon it you cannot  create something new  well i do not know how to start afresh because wherever i have gone i had got an established institution of course my studies i have started afresh and of course there i have been able to create a new discipline in the botany department of banaras hindu university  discipline of micro- ecology in which some twenty-five research scholars have got doctorate and a couple of them are registered  straight away i joined this college uh uh soon after passing my university and uh i am not that smart to run here and there  for a better job  whatever i got i wanted to make it better most suitable for me and here the people are so wise and intelligent that they moulded me into a science educationist and being a botanist and then a science educationist and then environmentologist and then ecologist and so many ist were added to my name and then ultimately i became a expert in uh out of science school science activity  and unesco accepted me as expert and resource person and sent me to work two three places along with an australian resource person and a canadian resource person  so the credit goes to our my great country which has a variety of states and very intelligent people we are  i can tell you because i have seen many people and i have studied in united states of america also and i find that their entire life and thinking process is just mechanical whereas our thinking process is radical and rather more philosophical  that is why we think very high but when we achieve little we get frustrated unnecessarily because this is just because when you think high and get little bit less you get frustrated nothing else  we are no way inferior to any nation in the world  and i am very sure and very hopeful that india will emerge  as one of the strongest and well built nation uh by the year two thousand is over  and uh regarding this particular programme i have only one thing to say that if india has to sustain as a great nation it will have to show the greatness which is required for a nation as well as for individuals  and the greatness in indian philosophy is dhairya  that is patience  you have to listen to others with great patience tolerate his views vidya education another aspect   dhairya vidya and then bravery you are coming from shivaji's place who was the i think bravest person in our country ever born  and of course patriotism is there  now this is all regarding that dhairya business  whatever we are going to do because tolerance comes when you  tolerate others  there may be hundred and thousand views about presenting a particular question or pasen presenting a particular question a subject in the text  say for example when somebody asks me what is the culture of india  ? which they said they say sanskriti  from which period we should count the history of india from vedic period aryan period or the medieval period or post independence period ? the that india which was existing in vedic period is no more that india existing  the india of medieval ages have also gone  and india born in nineteen forty-seven is the real deadline  from which we should think ahead and think about building a strong nation whatever is there it is we cannot call it partition india  in fact that much part of india was made free and made available to us  to live in and to work  the government of india is uh very much worried about certain aspects of national integration  and also atrocities on women uh either in the written form or verbal or gestural or what sort what may be the gists  say for example if somebody quotes a particualr religion  or a text of a religion others get hurt  now why should we do it ? if he is if if my words are hurting somebody we should avoid speaking those words avoid writing those words avoid seeking questions like that  so if if you want to maintain this secular infrastructure of this country we have to be very cautious in dealing with variety of people  and accordingly this committee has been set up to scrutinize  the question papers of maharashtra and gujarat to see if there are some anamolies and also to suggest methods of avoiding those anamolies  recently we received a letter from the council they they also want the original question papers which you will be scrutinizing so we will be dispatching this whole bunch to the headquarters also  so that india remains as india  india remains as a secular india  and uh nobody should have any sort of grievance that this was done therefore this has been this has happened  so to build up a real strong national character this step is essential  we have al already analysed the textbooks of various languages and various states on several aspects like uh bias uh religious bias or political bias or the  atrocities on women folk and bias also i remember one instance in a textbook it was cited that ram asked sita to go and fetch a bucketful of water from the well the objection was raised why seeta should go to fetch water  why not ram should go laughter  uh the male dominance is not liked  of course we should do away with that  too much dominance of female is also not good  it happens in our homes laughter  so we do away with that and you do away with this  laughter to make our li life  happier  so all sorts of things are there and there is no end to it also don't think that this will be the final  you may be again invited another team may come to do further uh  screening of the question paper  because if somebody wants to be hurt he need not even  read your text he may just simply see your face and get hurt  laughter  what we see that uh some people say that i am allergic to that gentleman whenever i see him laughter i get annoyed  it's alright you have every right to be annoyed  that is what happens in the college also  wherever there is a society of human beings some people you will always find annoyed annoyed unnecessarily no reason behind it but simply they are annoyed that's all  and you can't do anything  similarly here also you see only that the religious questions and the questions regarding to a particular religion are not there and if they are there how they can be moulded to keep the uh views of the people in their desirable limit or you can say that this it should not be feeling should not be hurt  now as a teacher i find that our role is the most difficult role which the society has given to us  we have made it easier by simply visiting the class and  telling whatever little you know to the students and then thinking that your job is over  but if you work very hard to achieve your goal you will find that your life span is very little  i feel that at the fag end of my career say only five or six years are left i feel that i have been able to achieve very little in this and a lot of things are to be done  and i wish that i live for another hundred years to see  a real good teacher being produced it's very difficult when i see the plight of our young people when i see the unemployment when i see the students struggling here for nothing  and uhn others other such cases also i intend  and in this college also i am only doing my routine duty  routine duties are so heavy that you cannot just do the other things  so my pound of wisdom is almost going to dry  to keep myself fresh i still continuing continue  taking a couple of classes so that that compels me to learn  and to go to the class  otherwise this college or any other college they are all true reflection of whatever society we have  now when anything goes wrong the teachers are caught and blamed so as a community i am warning you especially there is nothing to warn to people of maharashtra and goa they are wonderful  in our region  when i make a comparison only last week on wednesday i was at ahmedabad uh talking to the chief executives of education department with chief secretary and education secretary and directors of education and boards and all these people sitting  i said if you ask me to compare between the different between different states of the region i will say  goa and maharashtra are the best because the people are there sincere they want to work they want to work hard  and then comes madhya pradesh and gujarat is the last state  and you must take care of this thing why gujarat is lagging behind ? why your teachers are not coming forward ? if we invite fifty teachers from gujarat five come  fifty-five are forty-five are absent without reason  then one of them remarked that it is because they are all doing tuitions  so that is you to that is you to go into it  and this is this condition so they said that i will send  one person top officer at regional college of education bhopal  he will be visiting us very shortly to find out the problems of gujarati students students of gujarat state  that how is it there problems are genuine they do not know any language other than gujarati  they don't neither follow english nor hindi and we don't know gujarati at all  so how can we communicate with them so they are sitting in the classroom with open mouth and blank faces  so i said you introduce english in gujarat state also like other states because english is going to stay in our country  it is such a language which cannot simply be thrown out by even order  hindi will replace english in some hundred years  it is not a matter of say a decade or two  so he is coming to study the whole thing and then he will make a report and submit it to the gujarat government  so teachers' job is a very difficult job i tell you  and more you get bobbed down into it more you will be in trouble  but you should be a real teacher not just an orator of your subject  and for that you have to have a very deep understanding  your of your subject  you know we are all using our faculty upto cognitive domain only and there only upto recall and memory type of thing that is knowledge  and in knowledge when knowledge enters you develop understanding  we have done away with understanding part  and when you achieve understanding then you develop application of knowledge and skill  that is why indians are more philosophical than more skilled people  so these things we have to inculcul  inculcate among the students  your job is very simple one  and i think such a galaxy of stars will be able to complete it within a day or two or three not more than that  and i will request doctor agarwal the moment you complete your work you may be free to go to your places because we want uh   we want only a report on the analysis of question paper  so i have to attend another meeting at four so i take leave from you people thanking you very much to have come to come  over here and to do this particular type of job which not  which may not be to your taste i am sure  but still we have to do with them thank you very much clapping
