 in hindi  you know that's right today was uh suppose to have been the first day of brave new india  a day on which we were to radically restructure our our economic policies and therefore transit on to a high growth path after a short period of painful adjustment on and that was what it was supposed to be how it turned out to be is really going to be our discussion we are likely to have with us on the panel today people who have been in one way or the other involved in this uh exercise to fashions a brave new india  i'll uh introduce them straight away  uh mr pranab mukharjee deputy chairman of the planning commission mr deepak nair chief economic adviser of ministery of finance government of india mr v k loria is here as an a   consultant  also with us on the panel uh on our side of the panel is in-house one word uh dileep cherian and therefore i'll  take off by asking dileep the first question dileep do you think uh the way the day has unfolded it was uh  brave new india in the making ?  i'm not entirely sure whether it's uh  brave enough  sure mr manmohan singh has done quite a few things that this country desperately needs   it's certainly an economist kind of budget with lots of political cheese cake thrown in  but the budget has to be really seen in the backdrop of the other major documents that was presented today which is the industrial policy  as it needed to address in some sense three or four basic needs of the hour  one the need for austerity  second a need to restore confidence in those who seek and ought to invest in india  and three to fashion as it were a completely new kind of economy  but to my mind the budget does do some other things that is including these areas  it certainly delivers as far as the capital market is concerned  i think it does some of the much needed reform to the money market   i'm happy to see that defence expenditure has been held at the level at which be held  and a lot of the restructuring in the customs duties to my mind move in the right direction  but that's not enough  i think it disappoints in certain other areas  uhm i am not entirely happy with what happened as far as the public sector is concerned  neither an industrial policy nor as far as the budget is concerned are enough signals being given as to what is going to happen in that area  not enough is seen as far as curbing of conspicous consumption  that has become a social problem in the country is going to be done  and i am worried about the signals that are sending out for corporate investment  and i think for some reason or the other perhaps for good reason of his own manmohan singh seems to have been dissident on three other areas  one is on the business of n r i except for what he has done as far as gifts are concerned  this doesn't seem to be enough incentive for n r i's  to invest back in india again  i am concerned about the hesitation to hit at subsidies  much much harder  and i don't see enough effort in this whole belt tightening exercise that we've been talking on for so long in tightening of government expenditure  so these to my mind are areas we ought to worry about  there are two more areas that i would think cause concern today  i am worried about the kind of unchecked growth of interest payment   it's forty-two percent now  and dr singh says that it is going to go up to fifty percent  if it's not checked by nineteen ninety-four nineteen ninety-five  and this would have been a very good time to get rid of that burden of debt release to rural sector which seems to  be uh costing the economy about for four thousand five hundred crores in the three year period that we are looking at  these to my mind are areas of concerned today   a summary of mr cherian's view is repeated in hindi  i see that uh mr mukharjee has got the congress manifesto open to page twenty-two which says which says  the economy uh mr mukharjee i'm sure you agree with dileep when he says that it delivers on a b m c  but i'm sure you have uh difference with him when  when he says that it's diffident disappoints  and areas of concerned  uh firstly i would like to point out that budget is one instrument followed with many other which reflects the   government's policy  and particularly this year's budget is to be reviewed  in the context of industrial policy resolution which has been announced this morning  trade policy which has which was  announced a little earlier and certain readjustment programme which have been initiated by the government itself  congress as a party was committed to the electorate of this country to restore balance in the economic system and  wanted to put the economy on rate  therefore certain structural adjustment were absolutely needed  if we wanted to come out of wood  to my mind this budget is an adjustment budget in the sense it has initiated a large number of message which will pay dividend in course of time  bold initiative was needed and bold initiative has been taken  uh pardon me for interrupting mr mukharjee now uh dileep made a point and he says that he is disappointed  uh at what budget has done in the public sector for instance uh uh  the expectation was that it would much more would be done  uh uh   i'm coming to that  if you look at the industrial policy resolution and the proposals in the budget you will find that what we committed we have done it  firstly the area of operation of public sector has been limited  and more areas have been open to private sector  this investment in the public sector has been announced in the budget and through these process public sector would be made  more accountable competitive and it would serve the social  obligation for which the public sector institutions are built up  even his comment in respect of the for instance uh our liabilities towards the interest payment i do agree that it is uh sizeably of high order  but what can you do ? no finance minister can say that he will not fulfill the commitment by paying interest on the past borrowing  therefore finance minister has made it quite clear in his statement that the distortions which have taken place will be ractified  over the period of year  certain time will be needed   that's why this year's borrowing has been  limited  even the reduction of non-developmental expenditure  non-planned expenditure is substantial  and the budget has given a clear message what the government feels uh uh may i may i just take up from uh there  deduction in non-planned expenditure is something that i would like to ask uh mr nair this question  uh may be we had a gap of information so therefore you could clarify if we have gap of information  is that you said deduction in non-planned expenditure is down by four point nine percent if you exclude interest payment  and in the very next line uh you go on to say that actually it is down by over fifteen percent  now these are two uh is it is it  that eleven point two percent went down on government uh on the interest payment  now let me explain non-planned expenditure excluding interest payment in terms of the budget estimates for ninety-one ninety-two is four point nine percent lower than the revised estimate  for nineteen ninety ninety-one  now if we had introduced low one word and expenditure  non-planned expenditure has con had continued in keeping with past trend  then the level would have which would have wished uh is the level from which have attend the fifteen percent production  so fifteen percent is ex-hypothesis so if you four point nine percent is with respect to the non-planned expenditure of past year  so if you  it is in a sense phenomi phenominal  figure it's not a real figure  because i think the budget says that it's sixty-two thousand crore rupees it would have reached had low corrective been applied that that refers to fiscal deficit  may i  you know i believe that the union budget for nineteen ninety-one ninety-two must be situated in the wider context of the crisis in the economy that is both acute and deep  micro economic imbalances lie at the root of this problem  the government has leaped beyond its means  it has done so by borrowing at home  the country has leaped beyond its means  it has done so by borrowing abroad  now i'm sure you would accept that neither the government nor the country can afford to leap beyond its means year after year  but these are now i am sorry i mean would you say that the kind of  pace at which the adjustment of living beyond one's means is being done fast enough  at this point of time given the crisis we have the adjustment could have been sweeped up and more substantive  the same incentive and the same one word is that as it was may not be there next year  when you two words when the finance minister present his budget  i do not agree  look any further postponement of micro-economic adjustment  which is long over due uh would make an exceedingly difficult  situation   no i'm not asking about the question i think two or three persons speaking together  no not at all uh i believe that what we have achieved in this year in terms of a credible fiscal adjustment which i hope would lead to micro-economical stabilization during the current financial year and continued fiscal consolidation thereafter is impressive  let us not think in terms of the coventional budget deficit  which is the borrowing the short term borrowing of the government from the reserve bank of india  let us look at the revenue deficit which is the difference between revenue expenditure and the revenue received to the government  or the fiscal deficit which is the difference between the revenue received and the total expenditure of the government that is met by borrowing  now what we have done this year is to reduce both the revenue deficit and the fiscal deficit not simply in absolute terms as compared to last year but in very substantial terms as a proportion of g d p  now the fiscal deficit is going to come down by two percent in point of g d p that is about twelve thousand crores   dileep that is not insubstantial that is very substantial now we are we're achieving this by two means  on one hand you have revenue received two thousand  crores of additional resource mobilization that is both progressive and non-inflationary and two thousand five hundred  crores a few words  so we come to mr loria uh let us get quick comment  dileep on what mr mukharjee said then what mr nair said and then uh no as far as the forces of adjustment having begun i certainly have no quarrel but i think this we didn't have very much choice  the second factor we need to look at in this budget is the context in which it was written in a sense  meaning we have to make sure that we confirm to certain needs of the international community which is one of the potential lenders  that needs to have confidence in india  the point that is some how seems to worry is that i worry because the political will to do change is most when the crisis is more secured  and i do think that the backdrop of the kind of manifesto that the congress had which before it came into power as you hear allowed for many of these changes  some of them are there in the industrial policy some are there in trade policy but more could have been achieved is what i feel  and if the pressure is off i worry that the pressure on the ministry on the finance ministry in a sense to do this is to be  reduced   dileep let us now speak of uh some way   where you left off that   a few words yeah okay   a summary of mr mukharjee's view is repeated in hindi  vinod let's now get the voice of uh industry and uh the professional sector  mr loria what do you think uh there are some confusing or uh  one can say not very uh encouraging signal for the corporate sector for instance the deputation has been stuck  uh for instance the cooperation tax has gone up  and then the three main fears of industry which was in both  confession which was uh the liquidity squeeze and which was inflation are still there are still hanging over industry so how do you expect industry to react to this budget ? well i will put it this way  uh i i first like to make a very brief comment on what i think of the budget i think it's one word   sure  and i it we may not be awakening to a brave new year  but we have certainly not going to awaken every year to a brand new budget  this has set the pace it has set a new path  and i think from next year onwards we will not wait for this day with bated breath
