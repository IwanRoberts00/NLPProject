suddenly pain in the chest occurs unexplained sweating is here
 and breathlessness may be there  and  suddenly or within a few
hours  or the same day at any time  a person can die suddenly 
""
now this death  when we say death  this is apparent death 
and this is uh  clinical death  there are various names for it 
""
it means  that the heart has stopped beating  say  and
there is no respiration the person is not breathing 
""
so that is but  the brain is still functioning 
""
so till the brain is functioning  the man is not dead 
""
he is not really  dead  so he is not  biologically dead 
""
so  that  period is only about four minutes or so 
""
if during this four period of four minutes  before the  
 br    brain   death occurs  we can revive the
person we can make his heart beat again and his respiration come up  again
 then the man can be revived  and he survives 
""
now it has been  this period of four minutes is too short 
for any doctor  to reach any place because    th   
this   sort of death can occur  at any situation 
""
you are in the factory you are in the office  you are in the
college  wherever you are you see wherever you are on the road side 
this sort of thing can happen at any time 
""
now when it happens  and there no doctor can reach  to do
anything 
""
so it is the passerby  the standers-by the people in the house
 who can  do everything to save  the life  and follow the
technique of  c p r that is cardio pulmonary resuscitation
""
it is a very very simple technique  and anybody can learn it
  music for sometime 
""
""
so friends   we'll  just learn the technique of
cardio pulmonary resuscitation 
""
by cardio i mean heart  pulmonary means lungs  and
resuscitation means revival 
""
learning the technique  of reviving heart and lungs when it
fails  is what we call as cardio pulmonary resuscitation 
""
before we actually learn  what is c p r or cardio pulmonary
resuscitation is   it's  uh imperative that we should know  as
to where the heart is situated  and what exactly is its function 
""
that heart  is just like a size of the fist  and is situated
in the centre of the  chest  with the strenum or the breast bone in
front  and the spine  or the backbone behind 
""
and uh  it pumps the blood to all the tissues of the body 
almost trillions of cells of the body  and the main target organs like
brain  which is the master controlling function of the body  the
kidneys liver and heart itself 
""
if the heart fails  that is the pumping action fails  the
death ensues 
""
and this death  is of two types  a clinical death  or what
we call a temporary death  and  a biological death  or a permanent
death 
""
the time interval  between this temporary death  and the
permanent death  is just four to five minutes 
""
it is this time interval which is crucial  and we have to take
all the measures  of c p r  at this junture 
""
now  before we learn the technique of c p r  it is very very
essential for us to know  is the individual alive or dead 
""
if alive  is he sleeping  or he is unconscious  and there
are certain parameters by which we can easily determine  whether the
individual is dead or alive 
""
like for example  we must try  to say ask some question to
the patient  are you okay  ?
""
if he is not  if it there is no response  then we can just
pinch the skin  or we can press over the  upper portion of the eyes we
can just have a deep pressure 
""
if there is no response  that means the individual is not 
uh not in a sleeping state  but he is unconscious or he may be dead 
""
now how to distinguish whether he is dead  or  he is
unconscious 
""
we can easily see  the chest movements  or the breathing
movements 
""
if a person is unconscious we can see there is a breathing movement
or you can bring the palm of your  hand and put it just in front of the
nostrills or over the  uh mouth  and we can    fe  
 feel   some warmth of the air 
""
or  we can just bring the cheek  in front of the mouth and
the nose
""
and if we can  feel the warmth of the air  we can say that
the individual is unconscious  but not dead 
""
and the third thing commonly which we should feel is  we can see
the carotids  the one of the arteries  which is very close to the adams
apple or what we call as the voice box or a sound box  there is a groove
on the side of this apple 
""
uh this uh  uh  adams apple  we can just feel the
pulsation 
""
if we can feel the pulsation  we can say that the individual is
unconscious but not dead 
""
if you are not able to perceive the pulsation  and we say there
are no chest movements no signs of respiration and  uhm uh pulsation or
heart pulsation we can say that the individual is dead 
""
and then we have to keep certain  do's  and
 don'ts  in mind 
""
for example  we should never try to keep a pillow under the
head 
""
now why it is so  ?
""
the principle is   i'll  just explain you 
""
whenever a individual breathes he breathes either from the nostrils
or from the mouth  and whatever air he inhales  it goes through the
windpipe and goes into the lungs  and the air which is inhaled  goes
into the windpipe and the lungs expand  and the chest moves 
""
if  for example we just keep for example we are keeping a
pillow under the head  this windpipe is obstructed  and there is a
narrowing of the windpipe
""
you can see here  this red one this is windpipe it gets choked
 and there is no  free passage of air into the windpipe  and an
individual instead of saving him  he can just uh go into a sudden death
""
""
so we must make an effort never to put any pillow under the head
""
""
the second thing which we must keep in mind  we can put any
pillow or anything  under the legs 
""
by doing so    wi    with   the effect
of  gravitation  we can push in  atleast  two to three bottles
of blood  into the brain 
""
and just by doing so  a patient may have a enough circulation
in the brain and he can be easily revived 
""
just by a simple technique  of raising the legs  or raising
the  pelvis of an individual 
""
the third thing  we must never put in  any water  or any
  sol  any solid  in the individuals mouth 
""
there is a risk  as the individual is either in a temporory
death or in a permanent death  whatever you put in the mouth will go into
the windpipe  and the windpipe will get choked and there will not be any
passage of air into the windpipe and person may die suddenly 
""
if at all we find  that there is any vomitous  or there are
any secretions  any throat secretions lying in the mouth or there is some
foreign body or there is a  uh food material  or there is water
accumulated in the mouth our effort should be  to put in the finger 
and  wipe out the whole mouth and keep the patient  or the individual
 uh head on the lateral side  either on the right side  or the left
side  whatever is a convenient 
""
the next thing which we must keep in mind is  we must assure
 that  there is  not a inch of crowd around the individual  if
there is a lot of crowd  we  obstruct the air to go into the patients
uh  vicinity
""
and we should see that there is a free entry of air  into the
individual or who is a victim who is almost in a process of death 
""
so these are certain   do's  and 
don'ts   which we must keep in mind
""
once  we do so  and we find  that still there are no signs
of life  then we should start the technique  of what we call as  c
p r or cardio pulmonary resuscitation  and uh  this can be remembered
 by simple words  of a  b  and c
""
by a  i mean airway  and b  is breathing  and c 
means circulation 
""
once i say a a  airway  means how to take care of the airway
 and b  is breathing is the process or the method  by which we can
blow air into the individuals lungs  to give him life  and c is the
circulation  that the technique by which  we can revive the heart which
has failed so as to achieve the circulation in the brain and all the vital
top parts of the body 
""
this is what i meant by a  b  and c 
""
now how to  do this technique  of a b and c   we'll
 learn in a step wise fashion 
""
the first and the foremost  a means  care of the airway
""
""
our aim is  to keep this windpipe which you have already seen
 in that model 
""
but we must see the patency of the airway or the windpipe 
""
so we have to keep the  victim's  position  in that
fashion  so that the windpipe  is absolutely patent  and we can do
so  by  chin lift  or head tilt position 
""
means we can give this you have to elevate the chin  and just
 you have to press back the forehead of the individual 
""
by doing this doing so like chin lift and head tilt position the
wind pipe becomes absolutely patent 
""
this is what i mean by a
""
it is very very simple  anybody can learn it 
""
and just by doing so atleast twenty percent of the lives can be
saved 
""
 it's  such a simple technique 
""
and after doing so if you find  there are any signs of 
breathing  or any signs of circulation  then we are not to worry much
about it 
""
and if you find  there are no signs of respirations  and
there is no signs of  uh circulation  we should start  with another
step of b  what we call as breathing 
""
now this breathing  can be  uh learnt  in two ways 
""
like uh  we can give either a mouth to mouth breathing  or a
mouth to nose breathing 
""
and one should never feel shy  that may be of a opposite sex
may be a male female may be young or a old individual
""
our aims and objective is only one  and that is  to save the
life  irrespective of the sex and irrespective of the age of an individual
""
""
and this can be achieved by  bringing our lips  in front of
the  victim's  lips  and  make it a  absolutely airtight
seal  so that  when we blow the air into the patient into the 
victim's  mouth  it goes straight away into the lungs 
""
and we must ensure before doing so that we  keep the 
individual's  position in the chin lift and the head tilt position 
""
and the second thing is  whenever we blow air  into the 
individual's  mouth  we must clinch at the nostrils 
""
if we do not do so  then whatever air is blown  into the 
individual's  mouth  will leak out from the nose and we will not
achieve the goal 
""
 it's  very very important and simultanously we must watch
for the chest movements  that is our technique or procedure  of giving
the air is alright 
""
and if it is not so you will see there are no chest movements 
or there is some leakage of air  either from the sides of the lips  or
from the nostrils 
""
and this can be done  suppose for example if i am alone 
there is only one rescuer  instead of two  then we have to give a
mouth to mouth breathing by  chin lift head tilt position  clinch the
nostrils  and bring your mouth  so you have to give  sudden 
short  blow of breath  into the  individual's  or  victim's
 mouth 
""
for example if there is a fracture  or there is a bleeding from
the mouth  or there is a vomitous  or there is some foul smelling
coming from the mouth then you can start with  mouth to nostril breathing
""
""
and our aim is again same our objective is same that we have to
keep  the  individual's  position in the same fashion  chin
lift  and head tilt position 
""
and we have to see that the mouth is closed  when we give a 
mouth to nostril breathing like this 
""
once you do so we must always watch  for the chest movements
""
""
if our technique is right  the chest will move  and we will
be sure that we have given the blow or breath  exactly into the wind-pipe
""
 that's  how the lungs expanded  and the chest moved 
""
once you do so  and we find there are still no sings of
breathing there are no signs of uh  circulation  we start with c 
""
by c i mean circulation 
""
now how to achieve the circulation
""
the technique is very very simple 
""
like for example you can use your middle finger  and the index
finger  you can keep it  exactly in the centre of the lower chest 
""
there is a notch here 
""
if you see here carefully  that is a notch 
""
here the two halves of the  two halves of the chest  bony
cage they meet
""
this is the notch  here you have to keep your fingers  the
index finger  and the middle finger 
""
bring the palm of the other hand  and keep it over the breast
bone 
""
remove this hand  and put it over the  other hand and
interlock it 
""
and you have to make sure  that you give this procedure of
what we call as  heart massage  or what we call as compressions over
the heart  to revive it 
""
you have to see that you just lie absolutely in a  straight
position  you do not bend your elbow joints  and you give enough
pressure  so that  there is a compression  of about half inch 
to one and a half inch  just indepth 
""
we should not go  beyond that 
""
and you can start giving compression
""
like for example  you can give compressions like this  one
thosand one  one thousand two  one thousand three  one thousand four
 one thousand five  one thousand six  one thousand seven  one
thousand eight  one thousand nine  one thousand ten  one thousand
eleven  one thousand twelve  one thousand thirteen  one thousand
fourteen  one thousand fifteen  and after doing so  straight away
start the same position  chin lift head tilt position  clinch the nose
 and give mouth to mouth breathing 
""
then continue this procedure  till  you see the signs of
life  in the form of respiration or in the form of uh  uh circulation
achieved 
""
if you find that still no signs of respirations  we must
continue the technique  till we feel the  carotids artery here main
artery here  or we see some sort of breathing  and the  pa  or
 some sort of regaining of consciousness
""
if it is not there  we have to continue it there are certain
things which we have to keep in mind  when we do this technique of what
we call as a close cardiac massage  or a compression
