so you are doing this work no the project   haan i'm what i'm  doing is he has collected some cassettes and uh how you how the english is spoken in different uh like how do you speak english in classrooms colleges uhm and how do you uh while conversation while conversing how do you talk and all  so he has recorded all those in that uhm all those in the cassettes  and i have to input them just   uhm   uhm   only just typing work you printed out over there  yeah one word  just typing work i have to do  not writing the program and all and execution execution  it's not like that laughs  but uh this these languages what i'm learning  na they are completely different completely different from what  i'm what the work he is doing like  why i asked you is because i wanted to know how you can use those languages  haan haan  like  no you can use them  uh like it is not be like our courses like if you do and all those  uhm like we work whatever theory we learnt uhm  that is actually totally not applicable  uhm  ahn ha  uh in practice practice yeah  you know like what are the metric system   one word on paper  one word   haan haan  ahn  actually it is uh in practice we use the uh foot and pound or those f p s system uhm uhm all those yeah yeah  so you have to convert all those in the metric system   yeah everything is done in one word  and one word and all those things  so what are you doing is very conversion it becomes difficult like  difficult  difficult in the sense you can't be uh if i say this room is three metre uh if any then i can't just immedietly convert it like yeah  or if anyone asks uh what is size of this say this big big column uhm  so i can i can be able to i would be able to  tell him uh metric system   metric system  that will become difficult and common people they  don't understand you have to take paper yeah and sit  yeah  so like that i thought in in practice it will be like theory and practice but it's completely different  now suppose if i go like i have completed my d c m yeah  if i go as a programmer and all what i have to do so that i'll i probably may not be knowing yeah i thought that way  yeah  you have to learn from someone what is to be done and then you have to do that according to it at least you are a one word   i thought like that no no   one word  then what are your what all subjects are you having  uh i'll tell you later uhn  uhm because i don't have have that syllabus right now   what do you mean  like uh what are your subjects you learnt in civil  in civil yeah  in civil uh construction management construction and uh that irrigation and hydro-electrician   one word in diploma one word  then that environmental engineering uhm uhm and applied electronics all those uh designing of sectors  theory of sector like that all those  now again now a days actually you know in america and all  everything is done on uh by machine uhm uhm only in india there is manual work yeah laughs  so now now a days most of job one see is it requires uh this like uh amp ample of plenty of  time   time yeah  it consumes and if you want to do some changes again you have to consume a lot of time over there yeah  so on computer it becomes easy uh like i have seen one paper two words you know this uh we had the programme of the design of uh taj mahal and so we got it making changes according to one word his point of view yeah  there is one knob and you just fix on uh moving it uhm uhm  and it goes on changing  uhm uhm so that give me the inspiration like  uhm uhm i could do all that uhm uhm like  you are doing it on the computer yeah graphics graphics yeah all graphics and uh  so how to like interior also you can do now this so that will be the next step yeah like because this knowledge now now a days what  i'm learn learn what we are learning it is twenty years old yeah  this is twenty years old out of india yeah  outside india  yeah  yeah  so now you want to yeah use it like  yeah  we should no some advance technique computers and some yeah so that and apply it accordingly yeah  that's why i'm uh i want to learn yeah   that's why i was telling these problems are one word admission over there one word  so now it's quite difficult  yeah it will it should be like and according to my point of view i don't know how far it will be applicable  but it should be  yeah  like once you are intro introduced to that system so it becomes easy for you to grasp yeah like you know you have to one word and all those things uhm  you know this was there is uh little bit of uh computers uhm  like just a basic knowledge and uh some small programmes and all like to design structures road traffic and all  you know i don't know any thing about these one word   two words  uhn that only manual just theoritically   one word i know but uh regarding deep knowledge i am not having about it  one word  so flat now whatever flat designing and all actually if you start uh calculating the designs structural design of the building uhm then it becomes like uh taking all the loads and all accurately  uhm   uhm  uhm uhm  it becomes very difficult  two words  and also it takes long time long time  so with on on computer it will be able to computerise   you're able to computerise  computerise everthing now  yeah what you all have done in diploma one word   it's good simultaneously doing b e in civil like it's useless just doing going on doing the same yeah yeah if you do something yeah  what all a few words  now when af after completing my b e i  shouldn't feel that i should have done computer  now everything has been computerised yeah  so i'm lagging i shouldn't feel that i'm lagging behind like   lagging behind yeah  i should immedietly get a job or i yeah should i should immedietly start my own because actually see now in uh say in civil actually girls are  very few like  yeah  yeah  hardly now this year i i think so i'll be the only girl in my class my god laughs  yeah like that  and uh usually there are no girls in this field so now again after completing my b e if i if i work as site engineer it will be difficult uhm so this year also i saw after my diploma also many of the guys like my classmates they got job uhm uhm but i it was difficult for me because la  they don't prefer ladies like site engineers and all those things yeah and designing then they want all those uh uh this uh technical students because they can uh use them for just uh few  like uh pay yeah ahn two hundred three hundred four hundred rupees uhn uhn  so that is for for diploma engineer you yeah  need something na   yeah  yeah  just can't work on atleast you for experience you can work without taking any  uhm uhm uhn salary or something uhm uhm  but uh you can't just go and yeah  and say i'll i'll work uh for a hundred rupees  yeah  uhm uhm or two hundred rupees that two words  no yeah  so that is two words actually  and even i've seen i have seen many of my friends my classmates only in my class there were eight girls uhm uhm  uh whole year for diploma  now they are working here for just some two fifty four hundred five hundred two words  you are working here  yeah in kolhapur  in kolhapur  now actually my uh some of my friends they have  their own firm  so whenever they need me they call me uhm uhm  and they ask me to come for designing and all even from for letter drafting like we have some mutual relations like uhm homely relation family relation like  so i i do their work but i don't take anything  if at all one word my some some uh min  minor expenses and all  uhm  uhm  like petrol and all sometimes they give like uhn  means like if they take my bike laughs  uhn uhn  they put the petrol and give one word and like that uh like uh   all the maintenance work and all they do uhm like for a bike or whatever it is uhm so i don't get a salary as such because and that too uh their job is like they are out of uh like out field  uh they don't they don't have a office or anything like that this is where you gain experience na  yeah well and good  i'll be whenever they need me they call me uhn   i'll go to their house uhm then they tell me whatever even from for  letter drafting yours is like  yeah ours is like   one word clearly discuss one word and we do  but i don't like a working like like a job and like a boss and uh this thing employee yeah  i don't like that relation like uhm  so it becomes difficult na  there should be a friendly relationship between  yeah  yeah friendly relation  so those uh they have their own firm like not a  one word not a full fledged firm  it is not a full fledged firm uhm  so but just if you say this it is just the beginning yeah  so we just helping them  so sometimes i go over there uhm uhm  so say for six months i have been assisting them uhm  so now atleast whenever they and their main job  one word they do many one word like they have many this one what you call distributorship and one word agencies  and all  so they have to go out  uhn ha  uhm uhm in the morning and in the afternoon and all if at all any  if uh even if they have to draft any a single letter for any company and all they ask me uhm  in english it has to be done and everything english  in english yeah  so my english writing is better uhm than what i talk  uhm  yeah  then that's why they call no you talk well laughter  and over here since we uh after my college uh school   uhm after uh tenth  uhm  uhm so ever since uh my since eighty-nine i have not spoken i have not spoken english or kannada to anyone why with anyone here  why why like in the class in my college like uh it is some what odd yeah  or people think uh talking in english is somewhat  yeah showing off yeah showing off laughs  so that accent is losing uhn here you lose  yeah   two words  when you have uh some when you learnt any language or something you should have a mastery if you are in contact with it  if you are in touch with it then you'll have the mastery or hold or you get an accent or like that  yeah   yeah yeah yeah  yeah  right from the one word school days itself now see   one word six years have passed uhm yeah i think yeah six years have passed  so over here everything you are an english medium student i think yeah english medium then you should be in touch with english language yeah but over here they literally no one speaks in english yeah  everyone speaks   one word pure marathi  generally every time even kannada i'm literally i am forgetting everything laughs  and i actually it's becoming difficult for me to read yeah  because i have i have never read anything since after my you learnt it kannada language   yeah  i had a subject no one word two words    two words  from eighth  from eighth yeah  some fifty marks uh something like that  third language  i scored thirty-three in it out of fifty
