 a interesting also 
""
three four books are there  maths  english   
science 
""

postal course is very good
""
""
 haan   no this is also correspondence
course  but we have to do  all that craft things and uh   
written  means journals we have to do 
""
nice  and by that way  by the way we understand no how to
learn  teach properly to  the k g students no
""
""
 books  
""
""
uhm 
""
""
even  uh usually we start by  uh a b c d  means uh
 direct writing but it is actually we have to  teach them the strokes
 and even pictures we have to draw by that  they will uh uh  means
understand  how  we have to write  how to
""
""
but really it
""
""
sleeping lines  standing and all that
""
""
but you teach the students 
""
""
where ?
""
""
in your programme  in your course
""
""
no  we just have to prepare the  journals   and
thereafter 
""
""
 but it is just like   something like the postal
same like the postal one
""
""
 haan  yeah
""
""
so you can get the experience
""
""
uhn 
""
""
in our postal course we have to  go to the some school and
teach them and then they will give you certificate    uhn  from
that school
""
""
 uhn  
""
""
okay 
""
""
then i have to submit that certificate to the 
""
""
certificate
""
""
from where i did this postal course
""
""
okay 
""
""
this is the very uh aid
""
""
uhn 
""
""
but that way we will get the experience    ahn 
how to teach them and how students can encourage 
""
""
 ahn  
""
""
no i think there may  uh there may be  such thing 
that we have to take the classes but  now as i am working here means
working as a teacher then it will be not necessary to  attend again
further class
""
""
yeah
""
""
uh school or classes so  uh even uh  i mean uh 
have completed the project  and that journal and craft also 
""
this saturday i think one  lecture is there

""
yeah
""
""
we have to  refer only  one word  to  one word
""
""
""
uhn too many things we have to do
""
""
but its only that we can do  in our convenience
""
""
you can do it

""
 it's  not   that  we have to do  one
section today
""
""
 uhn  
""
""

even cough  was  is also there 
""
""
my younger daughter also suffering from cold  cough 
very horrible 
""
only  last week  my father-in-law was  not feeling well
my mother-in-law was suffering  one word  
""
and my younger daughter also    uhn   one word 
 otherwise you can
""
""
 uhn  
""
""
yeah now no  they are going to uh take the
""
""
yeah yeah 
""
""
collect laukik no today rickshaw is not there so  they
came his teacher  so means uh  i had to go early no  one word 
""
""
 one word 
""
""
 yes  yesterday we were we were having  bissi
  for for all our  all of our  society member
""
""
this year also 
""
""
yeah twenty members are there 
""
""
and how many uh  rupees   ?
""
""
uh hundred  rupees  we are collecting means
totally  two thousand  we'll   take out two  names  and
then distribute the amount uh  to two two members 
""
then  we have to prepare  tea and biscuits 
""
""
biscuits
""
""
yeah 
""
""
i have also  bissis   two hundred 
rupees  a  bissi 
""
""
yeah 
""
""
then  we have to means  uh that prepare some heavy 
fo   food means  pau bhaji     ah  and all
that  uh  bissi  and  twenty  rupees bissi
  and there are fifteen  ladies are there
""
""
 ah  
""
""
okay 
""
""
so you will get  three thousand  rupees  if
you get them  one word  
""
""
means uh  twenty ladies means uh  meeting each other
 its very nice no
""
""
nice 
""
""
so  and there only is  one word 
""
""
in pratibha nagar also there are uh   bissi
 but i didn't take part 
""
i had to  well after my second delivery i didn't take 
""
but it is very difficult to maintain two two  bissis
""
""
the  bissi  was fully programmed    uhn
 so it was in our home
""
""
 uhn  
""
""
means it may be of uh  that breakfast also there
""
""
yeah  but when it is in our home it is a very big  we
have to prepare some  one word 
""
""
uh
""
""
 one word  food  na 
""
""
yeah 
""
and what is your idea about  taking uh uh means english talking
classes  ?
""
what is your idea about english talking classes is there no 
""
""
i don't no because i have no idea how they will teach and 
it is it is uh  school onwards i didn't get
""
""
ahn 
""
""
i don't have and  i don't have experience 
""
""
because so many will go  uh
""
""
no but that is  that is another thing
""
""
because so many
""
""
one book is there no rapidex
""
""
rapidex   english speaking  course no it is also
nice  uh but uh
""
""
 that is a  
""
""
the same thing  if we can read the book in sometime 
we'll  go to class
""
""
uhn 
""
""
the same result only this  conversation is not there 
""
""
so many will uh rush  to the classes but i think 
classes is not uh  proper because  english speaking means it will come
by practice   yeah yeah  i think so
""
""
 yeah yeah
