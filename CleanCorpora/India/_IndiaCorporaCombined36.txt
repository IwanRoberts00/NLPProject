see yesterday i ran into smita  so uhm her friend laxshmi she was suffering from her father was suffering from asthama  so here he has been admitted in the hospital somewhere in rajarampuri  so who is the doctor  some irani irani  so i checked the reports of his blood you know all were normal  but the doctor is saying there's a pu puss formation in the lungs yeah  so i asked him i asked him what treatment does  is he going to give  so his thinking is that it can be removed only by surgery  but we can do even homeopathy for that yeah i know   homeopathy is the best treatment you know   i've even i was telling her the same thing  but then she said ki i said see the puss formation is going to take place again after the surgery uhm and asthama is such a disease that it can be completely cured by homeopathy only  uhm   disease   homeopathy  you just ad advise her then if if she wants but her father you know he he is against restrictions of eating and drinking like he wants to drink coffee all the time  he drinks at least ten cups of coffee   yeah  but that is an antidote again  yeah coffee coffee and onion raw onion   onion  that is an anitidote na  you can try again because if the performance is  it can be cured   asthama can be cured in a sense asthama and but he is not ready to listen na  uhm uhm that's why  he doesn't listen only but you can try again very stubborn person laughter  we can try again   what's wrong in trying again  i don't know they had referred to some doctor  but then he doesn't pay attention to all this na  all these things you don't drink coffee or eat raw onion etcetra only these two things and what else he has to follow  do you think you know what he thinks actually he doesn't believe in homeopathy cough there lies his problem people don't know about homeopathy yeah that's why   that's it na so i told him  ki shireen's dad was also suffering from asthama  even shireen was even saying ki  her dad was suffering from asthama and cough uh one of her uncles is a homeopath  he was a allopath before but then afterwards he studied homeopath and now he is a pure homeopath   even  there are many people that way yeah even dr shinde etcetra  so then uh like shireen's father was cured by  his uncle na   yeah  her uncle her uncle even my mummy now he is not at all suffering from asthama you know not at all yeah why don't you try to convince him  i i didn't try to convince him i tried to convince laxshmi first of all you will have to convince laxshmi yeah yeah we can even one or two words family there are  pe people you should have said ki what's the harm of trying just trying it   there's no side effects of homeopathy  anyway he's not going to get ano another disease he doesn't believe in that that small one word   one or two words  those are going to create a effect and that his asthama  which is almost i mean it's very chronic that is going to disappear   we can take him to some doctor like   who who are the renowned homeopath in kolhapur  shinde and all na   yeah  maybe they will uh convince him because that because finally what are in his we don't have any uh i mean we don't want to earn and all that we just want to cure like that yeah that's what the thing is  we can take him to a homeopath  we can ask the homeopath to make that interest in that person  because at this age if he if it is one word than a surgery   uhm  i don't suppose he will uh get again the uh health and all the things back  uhm  and now he is quite old no yeah that's what yeah at this age if is he going to have any surgery   he's almost seventy over  seven no sixty-five  sixty-five still but won't be able to reg regain all his health yeah that is also true  even my mummy is suffering was suffering from rheumatism  na she has taken rheumatism is other horrible disease yeah rheumatism and we cured by allopathy no there are some diseases you know like which can be cured by homeopathy only  she had taken the treatment  yeah only homoeopathy and the one is the is the uh rheumatism   rheumatism  rheumatism then skin diseases stones kidney stones you know i am telling you yeah only homeopathy can cure it   yeah  the stones can be passed to the urine only by homeopathic medicine but that is one problem the people don't believe in homeopathy still  but now-a-days many people are diverting to homeopathy   but the even the allopth is preferred but that is only in the urban uh cities  yeah precisely they are mbs actually mbbs no yeah  then  but giving a homeopathic treatment in the rural areas yeah these propoganda should be made na about homeopathy   let's see when we become doctors   we'll try  we'll try our level best actually right from now we should start the start i mean uh to yeah creating i mean we should as soon as we learn one word we should start giving the medicine know  we should let other people know importance of homeopathy and how it cure up the disease  even mental symptoms can be cured by homeopathy yeah yeah psycho psycho yeah   one word  because each each persons constitution is different  allopathy allopathy what they do what they do you know  like know we all are suffering from a common disease say fever  they will give the same disease uh same medicine to everyone   like  but homeopathy doesn't see that first he will know her constitution is weak your constitution is tough  so it depends na like for her i'll  give some else medicine the doctor will give you something else   no you one word   yeah  i know that is a one word  when they give preference to physical over individual constitution as well as mental constitution  we can find even uh each and every constitution we see  the crowd also we can get many yeah definitely   yeah  and we can distinguish between them  i hope but the homeopath has to have that knowledge over the material material and uh  yeah if he is wrong somewhere whole practice is going to but actually homeopathy has no side effects na  so but still so when that one is going to ha happen and we have one or two word   one or two words  but by reputation you can do it but he has to have his reputation  if the one word if he gets no yaar now even i a normal doctor  like even a mbbs doctor he takes five years yaar to settle himself in any town or a city  but he has to increase the power in that patient like today today one word sir was not saying or what if you treat one patient he will go on telling all the all the people yeah yeah and he will create a broad board of you that this is the doctor he will refer all the patient go to this doctor and all that   that's there and then you become famous   that's there  you may have the tact yaar  really tact is two words  i think mane sir has that tact you know yeah see he has got the  and pratap kulkarni  pratap kulkarni he is also very  he's an homeopath then what  i didn't know that  a few words  of course he was a student from no he was not no no  he was from our college   he's a good homeopath  yeah i didn't know yaar really  even i one or two words  but how come he used to come i knew about pratap kulkarni but i didn't know that  he's a homeopath no i didn't knew  and he used to come na during the  time of our strike and all that   yeah  that was a very bad phase of our life  horrible  horrible  strike laughter  i just want don't want to think about it i wish i would write a autobiography of myself about my medical education you know laughter uh ten year plan with two years of uh having a strike yeah and the remaining six years because i i was in the strike and a few words  really it was a horrible scene  yeah  and remaining because i didn't study laughter  i hope our colleague student don't come with us that class missed i swear   one or two words  how could we face one word my god horrible what do you think he'll come or not  one or two words  i don't think  i think he'll come he personally is not interested or uh his parents are not interested he personally is not interested his parents are interested more probably his mother is interested in sending him then what is the one or two words  because she is not instead of doing d a yeah d s m is more  better i think  yeah  no actually he just wants a degree yaar   he always one word hospital yeah   that too a few words he is already a settled doctor he needs just needs a degree he knows all the practical appliances everything  even yeah how to give an injection to give i v this that yeah he sits in in his father's hospital not a clinic  it's a hospital only yeah i think even she must be well let him not come of course let him do d s m and he's going to waste all his certificates  yeah he's not going to get back his certificates and money na  thats right that is okay instead of wasting thirty thousand and again fifty thousand in one word  yeah now he'll have to give donation in d h m s college also  he's not going to get it just plainly like that  you know they are asking fifty thousand   he's getting in free seat no no somebody told me what about archana  she's taken her archana she's  taken some short course computer and  archana  one year course she can complete her this thing graduation no but uh about her l c and certificate   that will also take take a long time  and i think she will take out duplicate  duplicate from where bombay bombay we get then how they got their mark list and leaving certificate in duplicate that is the main thing when you get a mark list you get a leaving certificate that's what i enquired you know  but again that caste certificate problem has arrived na she will do when she have when she will have to take a passport for this thing backward one word certificate  certificates na  but if you need a for the passport you need one word  duplicate do  no i don't suppose but you need always orignals if she has a passport it's well and good otherwise great problem yaar   yeah  that she has i think therfore she has to she will have to take help from her father-in-law  yeah that way her father-in-law is quite  but it's better ki have an original i know now it's impossible
