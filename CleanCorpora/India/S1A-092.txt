so  any way let me see i might receive her call one of
these days
""
""
ah ha
""
""
 she's  going to  stay longer she might come down
""
""
""
i see
""
""
then  maybe  i'll  have to plan to take her to
panhala or some other places bijapur   or something nice places 
""
""
 yeah ah ha   you can show her these places
""
""
yeah places also 
""
""
and  are you going to bombay  to visit her  ?

""
""
she is happy that she is retiring she is  very tired now
""
""
""
yeah  always this  how long she was working  ?
""
""
uh she is working mean  quite  many years some 
before working here in the bank she had work was working some where private
""
""
""
ah ha 
""
""
now she is completing sixty 
""
""
so
""
""
she has joined before   nineteen  sixty-eight
""
""
 at least  
""
""
more than thirty years   she must   one word
""
""
""
 service  
""
""
yes yes
""
""
yeah 
""
so naturally she must be tired   of all these 
""
""
 i know  
""
we are feeling tired now itself
""
""
yeah   laughter 
""
i am waiting for that 
""
""
to get retire
""
""
yeah 
""
""
anyway you can  you can  hope for it because your son
is grown up  after   two  years he will go start working 
""
""
 yeah  
""
""
oh yeah
""
""
so you have it stand a chance isn't it  ?
""
""
yea  it's  so nice  laughs  
""
and  i heard  fr  from my brother recently
""
""
i see 
""
""
his son is uh  now they are getting some proposals for
him
""
""
oh
""
""
so they are thinking of getting him married 
""
""
isn't he  he is very young isn't it  ?
""
""
yeah he is quite young but  now-a-day  think he is 
marriageable age  laughter 
""
""
so
""
""
so  now they are   a ac  actually his mother is
very impatient 
""
""
i see
""
""
for him to get married   that's  why they are
trying now 
""
""
 accha 
""
""
so i think  most probably they will fix it in decemeber
""
""
i see 
""
""
so   i'm i'm  thinking of telling my son  to
come down  during that time  so that he can attend the marriage  
  accha   and have fun at least
""
""
  accha   
""
""
yeah  you're  correct 
""
""
ah because   he will be coming on 
""
""
 he will be coming after six years  
""
""
yeah  and after six years will be coming 
""
""
uhm
""
""
so  if once  after one and half years he comes and
visit that will be nice 
""
""
