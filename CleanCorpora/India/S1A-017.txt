""
""
so you had been to your place 
""

""
so if any nice experience you had been with there in tumkur 
""
""
yes to start with  i left  nipani hostel at three 
o'clock     uh  and i was waiting for bus  in nipani bus
stand for  for an hour 
""
and it was uh different experience for me  and afterwards  i
reached belgaum safely 
""
and uh the tragedy started there    uhn 
""
and i took a belgaum and dharwad bus that is beautiful  new bus
infact 
""
and it took two  two hours  thirty minutes to reach dharwad
""
""
 uh  
""
""
 uhn  
""
""
my god
""
""
and i was the first man to go to driver and to scold him 
because see whether you are a driver or not  first of all i asked him 
laughter 
""
he was doing in  driving like a lorry no
""
""
ah ha
""
""
in fact i was the first man to go and ask  see what you are
doing like that
""
""
i think some fat people are there in the bus  he thought
 it's  a big luggage is there in the bus  so  so instead of
thinking that  it's  a bus he must have thought that  it's  a
lorry
""
""
yes yes
""
""
now you said that
""
""
no  it was non-stop bus moreover 
""
  just   just   i went and asked him 
""
i was first person to go and ask   why you are driving
like a lorry  
""
no sir i am new just an unexperienced man   i'd  to come
uh try on this 
""
then just i asked him  hey why did you come to uh this one 
in the night  and other things i asked 
""
but he replied sir safety is required 
""
safety is required  that is for us and not for you
""
""
 laughter 
""
  safety   safety   is first than everything
else comes next    yeah 
""
you must be facing it but whether it is your place or not
""
""
 yeah  
""
""
yeah yeah
""
""
did you meet basavaraj  that in uh nandita building i mean
 you're  when we were in degree  na   we had one fun
""
""
it was a nice thing about basavaraj 
""
""
he was there 
""
so he was very lean personality  laughter  as if you
dissecting  you'll  get only some five to six kilo of   
flesh 
""
""
 flesh  
""
""
he was telling one day to my friends  he had uh applied
for this    lic  lic for two  lakhs  
""
""
 lic  
""
""
two  lakhs 
""
""
two  lakhs 
""
""
how can it be man  laughter 
""
he is not even thirty-eight thirty-five kilo
""
""
only five kilo of flesh is there   he's   
given two  lakhs  
""
""
 even if we sell it   it will around  two
hundred  rupees   laughter 
""
""
 that's  how happened
""
""
and if dinesh was for two  lakhs  he was
telling  and that was a beautiful joke  we had experienced
""
""
and when you were in degree  na   did you
read any of  endumari's  novels 
""
""
of course not 
""
""
not of course not  fine
""
""
i have read i have read
""
""
you have read
""
""
i have read 
""
""
actually i have read almost all of his verses
""
i liked it very much you know 
""
so even some of your bright point of your first person as the
techniques second person every point of your techniques he has brought 
""
and uh  i think recently in one magazines  it's  uh 
on the doom innocent electrical  he brought even that  uh who  your
harshad mehta also there
""
he has brought in there 
""
""
really
""
""
he has expressed very nicely here 
""
""
and in fact when you take up this uh endamuri 
veerendranath's  novels   it's  very thoroughly when you are
entering to degree or  some pg courses
""
 it's  the real thing that we can enjoy in degree or  pg
courses
""
""
actually i wanted them to be translated to english 
""
""
definitely definitely good better and read them  laughter
""
""
""
actually i don't read kannada novels
""
""
is it
""
""
it is
""
""
then   what what novels  do you read
""
""
 then you better read  
""
""
english
""
""
english
""
""
uh  whose novel have you read so far 
""
""
hardy 
""
""
hardy you read it as a  laughter 
""
""
 you've  read hardly   you've  read it hardly
""
""
hardly of  hardy's  novels 
""
so   and uh 
""
""
 and uh    and  that's  the fine thing
""
in fact uh  we have to read those things initially   
because that should have 
""
""
 first we should read enough uh  
""
""
yes initially
""
""
we can read our own
""
""
it can suggest  it can suggest many ways  to read other
novels english novels particularly
""
that the best point of  if  you'll  if we take up
endamuri as  our model  definitely we can grasp enough 
""
that was my point of view  about endamuri
""
of course i read others uh endamuri this one k t gatti and satarnas
also but  it's   it lacked something 
""
""
uh but even in english writers you know i read jacquelins 
of course though  though they are the best sellers 
""
i read jacquelins susan  and herald robins  and some such
other
""
supposing your  laurence  sanxaz   such novels 
i've  read 
""
but not that much general matter is included in their novels 
""
there is some plot the  hero comes and he does something
""
if heroine he goes somewhere and thus they run  the villains
come and it ends there 
""
but uh one of her novels as jacquelins susan an american novelist
 i like the novel  uh which one that is uh   valley of dogs
  in which he said  one line beautiful line comes 
 we all have different sides that we show to different people 
""
""
uhm uhm
""
""
ah quite natural idea present my madam before you  anyway
away  and i show some regards to her in different way 
""
and  uh  i've  uh my teachers image in me   that's
 it uh they all play the different one 
""
so these three will not come at a time
""
""
yeah 
""
""
 that's  why my david is different from the david i
reference before prakash 
""
""
uh that one should not  come to know what the other said
of  is my said is enough 
""
then the friendship breaks
""
""
yeah 
""
""
oh  that's  what i think  what do you say 
""
""
what do you say mr david
""
""
david has uh many fine experiences in some or other way
""
""
definitely definitely definitely  from the fair point of
sex 
""
""
you tell something about uh david 
""
""
yeah
""
""
yes somewhat you are saying 
""
""
  you need   you need   that one you
know means that i i should be comfortable with his endamuri narayana
""
""
no problem  laughter 
""
""
no problem any narayan will do 
""
""
any narayan will do for that matter  our narayan will also
do
""
""
uhm
""
""
he will give somewhat
""
""
or narayan is there is no  he gives different sort of that
altogether
""
""
yeah
""
""
and some here in never
""
""
no in fact i was adjusting with that since these but i loved
it 
""
""
to survive
""
""
to survive
""
""
to survive
""
""
survival of the fittest he is testing 
""
""
so this is philosophical touch
""
""
yes it does we have  we have told  and uh mr david
 is going to 
""
""
tell something about his uh native place 
""
""
should i
""
""
ah yes in fact
""
""
please please
""
""
good it is a nice place malnad it is called no
""
""
yeah 
""
""
we have nice weather 
""
""
i see
""
""
 es  especially in shimoga we have
""
""
ah
""
""
uh sand mud and all no
""
""
yeah yeah 
""
""
you know  you  you go out uh for walk  you'll 
have a nice  uh what 
""
""
ah
""
""
nice  it's  got uh fragrance of  this lands and the
   yeah yeah  you can speak well said
""
""
 yeah yeah  
""
""
and uh  so in fact when we have  when we have come to
this pg you no  we had altogether different type of experiences here 
""
""
why that  i'll  be expecting so i think some said 
some different kinds of things of pg no  when they came she has got so
nice campus and that day first time when i came here to nipani 
""
again i  lost first period we together   lost first
period  of our uh  first teacher 
""
so actually i was even when i
""
""
 yeah yeah  
""
""
 what's  the teacher
""
""
 a few words 
""
""
 a few words 
""
""
i i heard a lot of things about him 
""
actually first time we went to sangli 
""
there one professor pardy is there 
""
he called us he  of course he would give seat afterwards uh 
he told that
""
now you go to  uh sangli 
""
  arjunnagar  there c t patil   kulkarni
 professor is there  you tell him my name  to him 
""
so   influence 
""
""
 arjunnagar  
""
""
 kulkarni  
""
""
 influence  
""
""
 it's  not influence because he just he guided 
""
""
they were of course classmate  of course friends uh
colleagues 
""
so we came to tell his name here 
""
but uh we did not meet him
""
he was there was uh  on the he was on leave for some three days
""
""
so and we met professor s t naik  and some other uh naiks
we met 
""
so  laughter 
""
""
some other naiks
""
""
yeah naiks mean uh they have different meaning  laughter
""
""
""
 theek hai 
""
""
teachers professors 
""
""
so we met the  one word  participant first class we
met  first period he met 
""
uh he lost that uh first half  he was dealing with the
statement first half  seond half we met 
""
so on the very day we can recognised    definitely 
this will be first lecture
""
""
 definitely  
""
""
because in after all the degree in our degree we had only one
good teacher
""
filomina philip from bangalore 
""
oh yes she was a wonderful lecturer  and was giving you know
""
""
she was so wonderful    uhm  i mean
""
""
 uhm  
""
""
uh so wonderful means you cannot explain it    her
knowledge 
""
""
 ah ha yeah yeah   yeah
""
""
  such a   such a   nice lady with uh
affectionate feelings towards the students  uh she did all
""
""
and moreover  she's  being a christian    uhm
 as we all get
""
""
 uhm  
""
""
her pronunciation you know  how fast she was pronuncing
""
""
just like your
""
""
bbc news  she was also uh telling everything in the class
""
""
""
and in fact when i had been to bangalore  the other day
 i couldn't meet her
""
""
uhm uhm
""
""
moreover she was not there and uh  i didn't have any time
to meet her  and i came back to my pavilion
""
""
you know  it's  natural if people go to bangalore and
they don't meet  laughter 
""
""
she was in bangalore
""
""
except except those few  those
""
""
the only thing you can't get in banglore is time  time
  and   and   of course you can have money also 
""
""
of course you may not get university buses also  
laughter 
""
""
yes yes
""
""
we have plenty of university buses but you won't get 
""
""
it is there  it is there 
""
""
you don't go to city bus only for uh  reaching your place
you know   laughter 
""
you will have to go and search for some seats  to sit on it 
""
""
yes coming back to arjuna nagar this thing   what what
  what   we were discussing 
""
""
yesterday no 
""
""
about the college 
""
""
about the college right  city college you heard of it
""
""
oh you   was   were   telling uh
yesterday you told that he met uh you
""
""
ah ah i i met him on the way
""
""
ah yes   where   where   did you meet
him
""
""
i see
""
while going to belgaum  he was in the bus
""
surprise visit
""
""
 that's  quite surprising
""
""
yeah there was lot of discussion about this uh  waiting
for godoth and  even macbeth
""
""
i see  that is the thing whenever you meet at whatever the
time may be   you'll  listen to his
""
""
and this is  this is the relevance of this
""
""
yes
""
""
suppose uh this should be there you know 
""
""
yeah
""
""
if you are dealing with history you should always be kinds of
  the stretch  
""
""
 know about history  
""
""
you should have given them situation with your day to day
life and you should refer to the students 
""
""
day by day
""
""
so that the relevance will be there 
""
""
there lies the greatness 
""
in fact when he is uh  dealing with the english literature he
covers sanskrit literature kannada literature
""
""
greek literature
""
""
greek literature everything  british history everything he
covers 
""
it has nothing  in fact  and  that's  why
""
""
as though
""
""
so it was i was unfortunate  because i couldn't hear any
lecture from him
""
""
ah ah
""
""
yeah definitely correct
""
 that's  why we decided uhm to him 
""
""
of course he said that he would come  here
""
when he comes here he will inform us  and have a
""
""
yes yes
""
""
  live discussion on  
""
""
 and then   you went to  tumkur did you read
any  this uh  did you go to our uh library  private library
""
""
this time infact i had programme to go
""
in fact i  it was not in my  programme to go tumkur as such
""
""
uhm
""
""
it was to go only hubli  and to madras
""
""
ha you wanted to visit many places 
""
""
yes in fact it naturally once uh
""
""
oh once uh  laughter   a few words 
""
""
yeah yeah
""
""
it has become such that the visiting places is the only
business
""
""
definitely definitely
