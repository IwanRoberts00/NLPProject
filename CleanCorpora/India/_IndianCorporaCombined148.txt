in all good ever hope to be  that then what they conventional wisdom  until beginning nineteen eighty-seven all india radio undertook a series of broadcast in india a new experiment in integrated social broadcasting of a style magnitude and complexity unprecedented anywhere in the world  these broadcasts have been a spectacular success  the credit for this goes to the vision the dedication the committment and the leadership of one man  his name amrit rao shinde  his job director general of all india radio and right now as you can see he is with us in our studio  mr shinde sir thank you very much for joining us in the studios of the morning show  now you began with the series on social forestry in nineteen eighty-seven  then you moved on to method of science to jeevan saurabh  to radio date and so on what is the origin of this idea ? how did you decide that radio should now play some kind of a more active role in social broadcasting ? after the introduction of colour television in india  uh in fact we in broadcasting the professionals were little disturbed because the listening has shifted to television  and because one factor was dominating  the programme pattern of radio was not very attractive to the listeners  secondly the television the new media which was progressing in this country and expanding uh with a great speed was able to provide a lot of entertainment good entertainment quiet good entertainment  so we were worried that how we can shift our programme pattern in such a way where we can attract the listeners and keep our uh uh listening to the optimum  in search of this we have arranged many seminars and workshop at different places  i have moved from places to places i have discussed uh the problems with professionals  and uh we come came to the conclusion especially in the light of success of radio form  forum especially programmes for the rural audiences that if we go in for subjects and programmes which are directly concerned to a listener and where they are in need of some information or where they are in need of some guidance and where they are uh looking for more kind of education  i think that area if we adopt and feel what the listeners see in that programming i'm sure this uh we can achieve the success desired  and the first experiment we started at a i r bangalore in nineteen eighty-seven  the programme series was known as nisarg sampada  social forestry  and this programme was planned in collaboration and cooperation with this uh one word forest department of karnataka government  and we worked out thirteen episodes  and uh those thirteen episodes were evolved after discussing with various communicators experts and at taking a tryst in the field  total of programmes we took in the field and uh we assessed the success of the and impact of the programme on the listeners  and then we made some changes in the formats  and we thought we should use two-way communication system  to be more effective  and that is what we adopted and it proved very successful  this particular programme was subsequently introduced on all india basis in fifteen languages  and for that purpose we invited applications from our listeners to register forest one word  so response was our plan was to register about one  lakh listeners throughout the country  but the response was so tremendous as we got hundred and forty thousand and we felt that it is important for us to one word  we requested the listeners the register has stop  so that was the uh response in the beginning  then after the completion of the series  duri come series we got number of letters and it was  unmanageble for us  and we conducted open book examination to just assess  how much our programme has been successful  how much information the listener has retained  it is not only that it they listen it  but whether have they have acquired this and retained it that is very important factor  and through these open examinations we observed that more than seventy-five persons percent of the  registered listeners appeared for the open book examination  and their degree of infor knowledge was about seventy-three percent correct  and large number of of exa the prizes were given to the first and that was the how we got into the new format uhm uh sir did you face any kind of scepticism laughs  when you decided to launch this revolutionary series of broadcast  ? yes of course because uh among we professionals  there is always a tendency that we always uh want to glorify the past  and uh there is always a resistence for new ideas new experiments  and it was there  and people thought but who is going to attain and suggest after all people know about it  they are for years together they know about forest what new things you are going to impart  and it is a very cumbersome thing with no achievement about it  but i said let us try and do it  let us see how we get this one because unless we try  we will never know whether we are going correctly or not correctly or whether we should pursue this particular format or not  and after the efforts were done the series was introduced and concluded  we found it was the most successful format that's good  to a listeners beyond our expectations   pichhle sal all india radio ne ye abhiyan kiya jisse jis karyakram ko aap ne radio date ka nam diya hai date standing for uh what what's the actual name for  uh radio date date drug alcohol tobacco  education right now you did this in thirty episode which is the largest radio series of its kind anywhere in the world right  uh what prompted you to go in for this ? what have been your experiences ? what were the shortcomings if any that you noticed ? and what is your assessment of this experiment ?  right  see uh as a broadcaster we always lookout for some area and subjects  and any problem we come across we always want to see from the angle of whether we can use this subject for programming and we can  use our uh technique of communication for the wider uh  information and acceptance  uh it is actually i myself was a chain smoker  for ten years i was smoking fifty cigars per day  and nineteen sixty-two i left it once for all for one or two words  one day i was coming from uh malaysia via singapore at the airport i saw a very good looking charming one word  air-hostess was sitting there  and within two minutes i found she started smoking and the whole  her uh uh facial expression that whole thing has changed  and that struck me whether this particular subject we should take in  because uh tobacco as you know there is no control  you can sell tobacco anywhere and talk to anybody  there is no control of smoking  any person from child five years to ninety years smokes no control over it  no restriction on the place of smoking  there is restriction for the drinking  there are dry areas but for tobacco consumption there is no restriction no law at all uhm  so i thought this is area which is common so commonly  spread over this ha ha habit or what can say addiction so radio can play very important role because the reach of radio is very much high and interior area especially  and uh among the underprevileged classes so we thought we should work out on these bases  but how to work out how to go about it  so we actually uh approached the i c c m r uh to whether they can help us with this research and uh information whether we can uh work out and then in collaboration with this  we evolved this series like radio date  because they adviced that that we should also include drugs and uh  uhm alchohol also as a part of the whole series and that's how we started the series  and we involved number of experts who have done lot of research work in tobbaco areas and it was found that the every druggist or alcoholic person has graduated from smoking   uhm  uhm he initially smoking smoked and then he has gone to that level  so everybody was con uh convinced that this series must be taken very seriously and we should do uh something  and contribute something substantial for the improvement of this one word health and over all atmosphere  and thats how this we started working on it  and then thereafter we worked out the format  and same methodology adopted  first we we conducted a workshop in fifteen languages  we prepared prototypes  took the one word in the field tested them and came back and whatever the deficiencies we found out  during the testing they were removed  and then final programme was gone mass production  and the same technique was adopted we invited application called the registrations  because we wanted that our listeners should be the same listener throughout the series and he should be seriously involved  and we were happy to know that everybody were listener  who registered himself was communicating with us  and the impact was so tremendous that there number of people who wrote to us that they've given up smoking  uhm  yes now i c m r is conducting a post broadcast research at bangalore and calcutta  that those people who wrote to us and they gave up the smoking or drug addiction thing  what is happening to them thereafter ? uhm  so that was the impact of this particular series  as a television person uh my heart is with television  laughs  you will appreciate that  my mind agrees with what you were saying sir  but now this experience that you've gained from this earlier series on methods of science jeevan sourabh jo aapane kiya aur ab radio date ka aapane jikar kiya to jo aapko tajurba huwa anubhav huwa hain uske aadhar par ab aap kya karne lage hain ?  ab hamne ek naya serial uh kiya hain  human evolution manushya ka vikas  ye serial ek kaafi lamba serial  hoga abhi tak mere khayalse kisi dunya mei aise vishay par itna lamba serial banaya nahin gaya aur manushka  vikas ka jo hissa hain we were one word much of the  one word isme bhi hamane bahutse institution  ko liya hai tata fundamental research bhi isme  involve hain aur uh this national council of science and technology also been involved  some eminent scientists are involved dr s r rao and some persons  and we have worked out the one word now doing last one and half year we were working on this project   aur ab ye saara complete ho chuka hain do june se hum ye shure kar rahe hain  aur is serial ka bhi technique wohi hain  ke registration of the listeners   aur uske baad listener se  communication  two-way communication technique wohi tarika hoga  aur uske baad in between we are going to have survey conducted  to see the impact of the series  the whole object appears our object is to generate a scientific temper   ki log har cheej ko vaigyanik drishti se dekhe  ek aadat ban jaaye ki har cheej ko ye aisa aisa kyo hota hain ? kaise hota hain ? manushya kin kin awastha se kyo gujara hain ? uska behaviour mein ye parivartan kaisa aaya  ? why that one word changing ? and we have come from where to this stage ? and what is next ? where are you going ahead ? so this kind of the different of facets of the human evolution  are going to be discussed in this series  within a particular series like this one on human uh evolution the sub-subject how do you decide then ? that subject we discussed with various uh experts  and also we conducted surveys and we try we to assess ke which are the areas where the information is required more  and where are the areas where the information is very less available or the common listener has no access for that information  at his level in the villages or interior areas or in uh rural areas  so that kind of information we want to see it is vital information  and without that information the further information which we are going to give to them will not be relevant  so so that we have to link up those areas and see that there is no gap of information  as well as information which is needed to the listeners is given  uhm  let me be the devil's advocate for a moment  yeah   ye ye your experience obviously has demonstrated beyond the shadow of doubt that radio is still a very effective medium for social education and social change  then what about uh family welfare family planning   yeah  that is another aspect i'm telling you because family planning i think we are putting out more than six thousand programmes every month  and there also the success is so great that the latest surveys all the surveys which have been conducted for different places  have been uh uhn shown that the first source of information on family welfare was radio  uhm all right now on the table in front of us mr director general there are  these little kits lying would you like to tell us what they are ? so this was the kits which were one or two words  method of science  so these kits were where you find the one word is there let me it is on do you it yourselves i can just show you this this  now these are the lenses which were supplied  because there was some certain uh lessons were there and certain experiments were shown to the listener the kits were provide provided to one lakh forty thousand uh people all the registered  and this is the stone covering that particular experiment  so that the listener can himself try this experiment at home how the things work  ah  and we also provided a chart a big huge chart was shown to them  this type which one is it ? is it the chart ? yeah  this is it  you can see this is a chart of uh mega of science  see here here  so every thing was available in advance with the listeners i see and that before the days programme was started they had to read this particular portion and also the questions were raised what kind of uh uh questions they can raise it  and when they listen the programme and then write to us and experiment with this kit  uhm this is obviously a new concept in distance education yes yes uh sir ek sawal aur uthta hain ki jo baaki antarashtriya radio sansthaye hain  jo aapne abhiyan kiya hain aur shandaar aapko safalta mili hain un hone isme kuchh dilchaspi prakat ki ?  ye iske baareme hamne baat ki thi pichhle dino  asia basic broadcasting organisation ki meeting  hui thi singapore mein  wahan par iske upar kafi charcha hui thi aur khaas taur se jo vikas sheel desh hain jo uske sadsya hain unhone hamse iske baareme kafi material manga hain aur usse uh doosara  experiment jo hamne pahle kiya tha uske liye hamare paas bhi   ghana se log aaye the yaha dekh neke liye ki hum kis tarahse  one word kar rahe hain kaise ja rahe hain aur communal broadcasting uh association ki jo meeting hui thi usmein bhi ispar kafi charcha hui  aur woh log hairat me hain ke radio can do so much  and uh how it is possible without the visual aids ? merely if it's a stromg medium we are able to go ahead well the director general gave us a peep into the future what comes after the serial on human evolution ? see uh we are thinking on some social uh areas  and we are conducting some surveys to find out which are the areas where because without the input from the research we do not want  to going go ahead  because we want to be very sure ke this particular area needs the radio has to play a role  and then we identify the subjects and then we work on this basis but our aim will be only to take up the social issues  well sir thank you very much for having been with us on the morning show as uh they say more power to your lungs  as you do this on radio and we in television will be watching carefully somewhat enviously but we will be watching nevertheless thank you very much mr director general for having been with us our guest this morning was shri amritrao shinde director general of all india radio and we have been talking to him about this spectacular unprecedented experiment in terms of social integrated social broadcasting that have been carried out by all india radio for the first time  in the world
