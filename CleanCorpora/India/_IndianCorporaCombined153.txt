 ( 1) inderjeet kumar  uh our finance minister whom i respect a great deal  noise but one thing on which he has not been able to persuade me to agree with him that we are not ready getting into debt  or we have not even now what to one word  now it would as it is if you look at the budget  already you see a very interesting figure noises uh a few words and uh budget came have even graphically  a few words the break up of the rupee as to how a rupee come and how a rupee goes  and when the break up you see you find that twenty-seven  paisa in a rupee go towards the debt service charges  now these twenty-seven should be very telling when you realise  that our defence budget which is of course more than anything else is thirteen paisa in a rupee   that is your debt service charges are already more than twice of your defence expenditure  now i must compliment the finance minister because his persuasion in washington always gets him more loans  and since for everytime he comes back he comes back with a bag full  and then bagfull ultimately has to be paid  we have created an impression in the country that it is a day of jubilation when we get more debts  as it is one word even in families when we start celebrations as such  when more debts are required various things just out  when the truth comes home and things become very difficult the learned finance minister would have seen the latest report of the u n d t which i had a had a time to glance over  now the whole system of international monitory system is so manipulated that the more we give the more we want  you won't do it and if you look at the logic of debt trap of any society that is what is happening  because devaluation is manipulated  ever since we have launched on this tryst with  globalisation the indian rupee has been constantly devalued  about some times formally many times and more times informally  and today i think if i have mentioned somewhere in my article recently which is gone down by forty-two percent  uh i hope i'm saying the right figure  the end result is that you find that you go on pay  there is not a single country as much a few words  and this is the irony of the whole thing that the more you pay the more you owe  and this will go on happening in our case also  we will be happy for a while but i don't think we can be happy  for a long time  everytime uh the new one word policy if i may  quote myself in the article that i have just written the use of this policy has been uh reversing many sound economic policies  that we have followed in the past  what was our past ? our past was primarily based on self-reliance  our past was on import substitution  and for number of years following the nehruvian outlook  this society has built itself  it is not as if we are a new country like any african african country in dark continents  we are a country who have built in last uh uhm so many years after freedon to come to occupy a very respectable position so far as industrialisation goes so far as our economy goes  we are in a mess because of the debt that we took  who took the debts ? how debts were taken ? how debts were squander ? i will not enter into that area because i know who did it and i know on what we spent  but the main difficutly is different now  let me see we make this country believe as if self-reliance and  and import substitution were dirty words and we must get out of that and launch launch on the new era  then we go on doing this one word  so therefore you see that increasingly now we are getting into  more and more debts and even the experts have said by the end of the eighth plan if we continue doing what we are doing our our debt service charges will be approximately thirty-two percent of the revenue earnings  well it is for the learned minister to decide whether that will be a good day for india or that will be a day for celebration for india  that is for him to decide i don't know i hope i will not live enough long enough to see that day i don't want to see that day  because i come from that generation which participated in freedom struggle  i also belong that to that generation  which took pride in the policies that nehru followed  and we still continue to take pride in that  and if those next generation which thinks they are wiser now than nehru of course they are welcome to it  i will not question their wisdom  but i will also say at the same time that what we are doing  needs caution and needs understanding  the new budget that we have seen is gradually shrinking the nations building prospects  the honourable finance minister can get up and say that well  this year i have given more money for education than he gave last year  that is no comparison because last year it was worst so it is slightly better than the worst that is not the issue  the issue basically is that everything that builds the nation ultimately is shrinking  and everything that doesn't build the nation is expanding  so therefore this is the policy that we are following  i if i get timing sir i would have spoken at length about other dimensions of the of the policies that india is following  my young friend mr minister of state for foreign affairs is sitting here  i would have discussed the foreign policy also and i would have discussed the various things that are causing us anxiety  and i think it is not him a few words but one or two points i want to make  and one point basically is about the kashmir today  i think this is something which you must think over is everything happening there alright  have we not reached a stage when i think as a nation not as a party whether we sit on that side or this side  as a nation we have to sit up and uh see what we can do look at the entire situation sir that police was involved  the para military sector of police which have gone out there some times cause us anxiety  and the prime minister of india does not think it good enough  to call even a meeting of the all party to discuss this kashmir situation  kashmir has been one word from one situation to another  and if there is any area where we should be axious today i think something has to be done  a few days ago i have mentioned also about i o c conference unfortunately yesterday i was out of town so i could not come to the constituency committee meeting  but what i see from the reporting i i spoke to the government of india on that  i think the policy that we are following regarding i o c needs to be to be redoubled  i think i o c is a platform which is converting itself into a into sort of a follow on organisation of what pakistan says  we have several countries in the one word organisation who are very friendly to us most of them who are they  and i think that is uh we should definitely who are they pardon who are they  oh i beg your pardon i i beg you pardon i accept that but mean the same thing a few words   uh whether you put organisation first or islam first it doesn't make much difference  it is so typical to us  it comes to the same thing  the main point that i am trying to say is that in recent time and i hope my young friend will kindly help us in that and help the country in that  that redoubling of the effort is very much called for  and i think on a on a bilateral basis particularly we must make these friends feel and rewrite that friendship in india has always been very profitable and will continue to be profitable for each one of them  be the africa be the asia or be the arab world   india's history has been that in every crisis of this region india has upheld their cause  i think it's not that india's got in danger today i don't see so  but definitely they their diplomacies must see through the type of propaganda that we are being subjected to  and i think that is where our wh  whole effort has to be concentrated on   already   a few words   who are they   who are they   who are they   a few words    ( 2) manmohan singh  sir i am very grateful to all the honourable members  who have taken part in this debate on the budget for nineteen  ninety-three ninety-four  as i scan through the record of the debate i could  defer a couple of issues which have educated the mind  of the members  and i thought the best use i can make of this reply to the debate is to clarify some of those issues  i sincerely believe that many of these issues which have been raised in the debate they are taken care of adequately in the budget that i presented in one word  before i reply to the various points that have been raised in the debate i would like madam to draw the attention of this august house to the basic objectives of the budget as outlined in my budget speech  i will state six basic objectives  the first one to bring about a greater sense of fiscal deficit and to that extent and fiscal deficit has to be reduced  two the rooms for many facilities made possible by insistance consolidation of last twenty-two months has to be used to step up investments and expenditure particularly on anti-poverty  programmes and on social services  three we should plan for a strong industrial recovery in ninety-three ninety-four leading to a great boom in succeeding years of the eighth five year plan  four we must set the pace with steps to form towards a simpler tax system with moderate rate and greater purpose on voluntary complaint  five full force must be given to agriculture agro pertaining activities because agriculture after all is the foundation of our economic growth  six we must devise a policy in one which gives export  the highest possible emphasis making it truly international endeavour  it is against this background that i would like this house  to judge whether the budget meets the challenge uh of the time or not as i mentioned madam there has been concern about inflation  i heard the concern of the members of this house with regards to inflation  but we must also look at the improvement that has come about  in the inflation situation  mr balanandan referred to various statistics  i don't want to go into various statistical squibble but i challenge everybody that by any yardstick whether if you mention the average rate of inflation or twice the rate of inflation whether you mention the whether you take the consumers' price index for industrial workers or consumers price index for agricultural workers or wholesale price index on every considerable index in this last year  there has been a distinct very credible improvement on the inflation front  we are today on a point to point basis with inflation rate of no more than six point four percent which is a trend rate of growth  if you look at the past forty years of indian economy  i am not satisfied with this performance  i believe in the next two years india must gain hike today the rest of the world uh do does not tolerate an inflation rate of more than three to four percent you must therefore have the ambition to bring our inflation rate further down and that means there must be greater fiscal discipline  we must press ahead with the task of fiscal consolidation and this year fiscal deficit will be about four point seven percent of g d p  next year we must reduce it to four or even below  that is the only way we can bring down inflation  the experience of last one year clearly brings out two things first of all if you want to control inflation we must have a strong sense of fiscal discipline  second the supplying side of the economy must be well managed  and last year we clearly saw despite administering one word and prices of fertilisers despite increasing in prices of  one word commodities and steel and coal and petroleum products inflation rate was brought down  and that brings infact to the supreme necessity of keeping the fiscal system in good shape  the central government has made the sincere effort in the last twenty-two months to bring the fiscal house in order  i i urge that the state government need to do the same thing because there are today in the state sector several public sector enterprises particularly state electricity board state road transport corporation irrigation department which are a next burden on the exchequer of the state  several honourable members referred to a need to increase investment in agriculture  i hear that concern but agriculture basically is a state subject and you cannot increase investment in agriculture if state finances remain in such shambles as they are if we lose roughly six thousand crores on electricity generation in our country the national goal is a minimum rate of return of three percent on fixed investment in the power sector but as again three percent goes last year we had combined rate of return in the country was a negative figure of over twenty-one percent  launches of state electricity board amount to six thousand  crores per annum we need power  without power there can be no meaningful economic development and yet how is this country going to find the sources for the generation of power if the power sector is being sore on it and to have year after year losses as high as six thousand  crores per annum so i urge members honourable members that we must evolve a viable national consensus for sound fiscal management of our economy
