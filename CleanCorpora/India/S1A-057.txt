""
 uhm  
""
""

""
""
ah yes  you see he is a good company
""
""
yes he is good 
""
then uh what about our local political scene there  do you know
anything 
""
""
i fear  uh i don't know 
""
we are here for more than uh  three weeks
""
""
uhm 
""
""
so  i'm  not in a good position    uhn  to
 speak about the local politics of tamil nadu
""
""
 uhn  
""
""
but i received a letter from my friend yesterday
""
""
ahn 
""
""
he has told that there is    ahn  a hue and cry
over the reservation issue
""
""
 ahn  
""
""
ahn  about what
""
""
for the entrance examination  uh for uh admission in the
professional group  in tamil nadu
""
""
ah ha 
""
""
now we have reduced the reservation   from 
sixty-nine percent to  fifty percent
""
""
 ahn  
""
""
above 
""
""
so all the political parties are opposing it and uh 
""
""
uhm 
""
""
uh  agitating with uh  in a  vigorous way  
 oh ho 
""
so each and every party is uh  having a  bandh 
 everyday 
""
""
 oh ho  
""
""
and you know  the petition of student  is   
ahn  taking a serious turn  half or so
""
""
 ahn  
""
""
are schools and colleges running there just now 
""
""
actually they are running
""
""
ahn 
""
""
uh but now and then  they closed because  every
political party try to  have a  bandh   on a particular
day
""
""
ahn 
""
""
and the  leader of the main opposition party dr karunanidhi
has also been arrested 
""
""
ahn ahn 
""
""
and i don't know  what about what happened to him afterward
whether they  released him or not 
""
but  something is  wrong with the state of affairs in our
state 
""
""
what do you think sir about this  election reservation in
karnataka 
""
""
i think they should not have introduced  it all of a sudden
""
""
they should have introduced it gradually 
""
""
ahn 
""
""
say  sometimes  it may affect the people 
""
""
ahn 
""
""
who  who are aiming at something 
""
so  they should have announced it earlier    or 
they should have  uh introduced the scheme  in a gradual manner 
""
so that nobody will be affected 
""
""
 ahn  
""
""
ah uhm 
""
so  you say that there should be a psychological preparation for
the people to accept this election
""
""
yes yes certainly 
""
people are not prepared to accept it all of a sudden 
""
because this people never expected that  they would announce it
at  this junction  even when they call for investigation  they did
not mention it clearly mention about anything 
""
after receiving all applications and  fixing the date for
examination and all
""
""
ahn 
""
""
and they come out with this announcement people will certainly
get scrabbled  that is uh  i think they  wonder     ahn
 would be criticised for it 
""
""
 ahn  
""
""
moreover the political parties are uh  aiming at
""
""
ahn 
""
""
uh utilising response into  in   their  favour
 yes
""
""
 for  
""
""
for their coming up
""
""
role 
""
so  there is no wonder there will be some concessions 
""
""
will it be useful for common persons 
""
if so  uh upto what extent 
""
""
i don't think uh it will not benefit much  but anyhow 
  uhm  some uh  bright people have uh  some chance to come up
""
""
but  at the cost  cost  at the cost of uh  the
downtrodden people 
""
""
 uhm  
""
""
will it be harmful  if uh  shall we say uh  from
different uh as you say it is  downtrodden people
""
""
yes  certainly it will affect some genuine cases 
""
""
if it is genuine cases we may  accept it as common one
""
""
yes 
""
""
but uh will it effect  the nation as a whole 
""
""
no i don't think  it will affect the nation
""
but uh     ahn  on the whole the people  
 ah  uh  to some extent    ahn  may be affected 
i think so 
""
""
 ahn  
""
""
 ah  
""
""
 ahn  
""
""
well uh  in my opinion i think that this  reservation
 uh quota 
""
""
uhn 
""
""
uhm should have    uhm  should be applied
""
""
 uhm  
""
""
uhm 
""
""
only for this non skilled job 
""
""
no 
""
then    ahn  once again the criteria of casteism will
come into scene you see 
""
""
 ahn  
""
""
uhm
""
""
the people who are  employed in uh  very  luc 
lucarious job    ahn  they will become  another upper class
""
""
and these people who are  employed in skill work they will
become  the lower class  because    ah  uh  the
casteism  the origin of casteism was on that basis  in the beginning
""
""
so once again we are going to that  line 
""
so what i say is  the people a particular community people who
were uh  who were  supressed     ahn  for generations
together  and there is no harm in giving them some chances to come up and
uh  this must be the  main issue 
""
""
 ahn  
""
""
 ah  
""
""
 ahn  
""
""
uh  i do accept it
""
""
uhn 
""
""
uh whereas  skill  is the only factor    uhm
 uh  which can make a nation    uhm  progress 
""
""
 uhm  
""
""
 uhm  
""
""
but we have  we have to do some sacrifice 
""
i accept all those things  because the  efficiency  uh
intelligence  everything is    uhn  a plus point 
""
but  even then
""
""
 uhn  
""
""
uhn 
""
""
we have to do something for the    ahn 
upliftment of these people 
""
and more important  the people  from upper caste should come
forward for that 
""
""
 ahn  
""
""
uhm 
""
""
then only  there will be 
""
""
but you see 
""
""
if we do that  there will be social harmony  there
will be  a good understanding among the people 
""
but  now a days it seems that   it's  working in the
opposite direction  that percentage  people  when they have to get
some important post  they don't think that it is for the benefit of the
society  and they they think that  its for their own benefit and all
 their personal gains 
""
""
you see sir  some people say  you know that is  in
railways    ahn  and the post office sir
""
""
 ahn  
""
""
yes 
""
""
uh that  additions  of uh  the personnel  in
those department    yes  have considerably  gone down 
  yes  only because of this uh  reservation
""
""
 yes  
""
""
 yes  
""
""
yeah true 
""
""
unskilled people
""
""
uhm  they say it is baseless 
""
""
the unskilled people  uh come to the top uh  they ar
not in a position to cope    uhm  uh  with the 
necessity    uhm uhm  uh towards high post or high rank
""
""
 uhm  
""
""
 uhm uhm  
""
""
uhm 
""
""
uh  so they say they say  uh that standard of service
   uhm  has gone down
""
""
 uhm  
""
""
instead of say uh  that is the only resaon for the 
uh down coming of the  services  there are so many factors but to think
 to some extent it may be true true 
""
because  those people have not yet been given a chance to 
act in that capacity 
""
there are so many factors like that 
""
but  outright we cannot say that all those people who come
under the    uhm  reservations  are not being or inefficient
""
""
there are so many people they can  they could uh shine like
anything 
""
here in our case  there are two  such persons that belonging
to  schedule caste
""
""
 uhm  
""
""
uhn
""
""
but both people were very efficient and they were uh 
upright they were honest they were intelligent  and they were up to the
mark 
""
they their services were  highly useful to the department
concerned
""
""
yeah yeah
""
""
and those people  when they left their post  they left
with a good name  good integrity  everything 
""
so we cannot say that  it is the main factor
""
some people may say like that because  you see railways and uh
postals were once upon a time  dominated by a particular community 
""
nobody will have entered that  job  l i c  railways 
post office and banks 
""
because i have got my own experience  even though i  came
 with a very good uh  marks in the ten plus  i was subject in 
english 
""
though  in both  one word   and three or four banks l
i c  in the oil field    ahn  i requested them even though i
belong to a forward community  i still didn't   got   get
  
""
even though i belonged to a forward community i was  oppressed
there because i do not belong  i was not belonging to  a particular
community   that's  the 
""
so i find that  these people should be given some time  now
but  there should be a time limit 
""
and there should be some other issue 
""
creamy layer should be  avoided 
""
they should break brought to the  they should be brought to the
 for a period like that 
""
this scheme was well i think 
""
and actually downtrodden people must be  given some importance
""
""
that  that's  where we come  uh we must also
""
""
 ahn  
""
""
ah yeah 
""
uh  i accept uh  your point  it helps us 
""
that means    uhm  as a poor nation   
uhm  should strive forward  and should thrust for the  skill 
""
""
 uhm  
""
""
 uhm  
""
""
skill is very very important i don't  i don't deny it 
""
""
uh only  by using that skill  that bring sense  uh
we can make our nation strong also 
""
""
yes i accept it
""
""
see as one thinker say  india is a rich country  but
with poor people 
""
""
but was it uh
""
""
our natural resources must be  exploited  for which
 uh both uh intellectual skill  and uh manual skill    are
required 
""
""
 you see  
""
""
yes yes it is true  but our uh  constitution makers
 they introduce all these things  in the hope of  some good deed
""
""
but you see our people  are misusing it to some extent 
""
because take this minority issue also  minority   
like  minority issue
""
""
 what what  
""
""
 haan  
""
""
they were given protection  in order to  have a good
chance  to  come up here
""
""
uhm
""
""
i mean in all aspect but  most of the people are looking
for this originality moreover there is uh  many people are misusing from
here self benefit 
""
and the people from those minority community are affected much
""
""
only by that  route constitution is affected 
""
for example educational institution are started by minority
community people  but the teachers working there are not success like
anything they are remained as it is  they are not given  uh their
salaries  they are not able to  protest it that uh  any treatment or
anything like that 
""
so  the intention is good  but the implementation is
something wrong 
""
so we must find some way of  otherwise  we cannot say that
the  system is itself is  fully wrong 
""
thats my opinion 
""
""
 it's  a nice opinion indeed 
""
needs of the best  one word  but direction is one
""
""
thats what is important i accept it 
""
because  when uh  when we go through this uh  experiences
 first hand informations  we feel that  our people are wherever
they go wherever they belong to which state they belong to which religion
they belong 
""
most of the people think that  everything should be placed for
their own purpose  as to a  draw that line 
""
""
because it is the guidence of the politician
""
""
yes certainly  they are men
""
""
yes they are now 
""
""
now politics has become a profession  once upon a time it
was a service to the people 
""
but now people think that it is also a kind of profession 
""
so all the people will say please  others  and make this
   their way 
""
""
 right    it's  become a no capital  one
word 
""
""
yes certainly 
""
the capital which only the rowdys and  goonda  have
 that's  all  what else 
""
""
okay sir   it's  a pleasure uh  thank you
""
""
to chat with me 
""
""
what 
""
""
thank you thank you 
""
""
thank you
