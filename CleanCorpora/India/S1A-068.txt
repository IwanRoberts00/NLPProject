""
""
uh this morning i was talking to you about  uh anxiety and
 uh my doctor has diagnosed uh anxiety uh neurosis
""
""
yeah
""
anxiety neurosis
""
""
yes  uh i am prone to worrying and  uh it can  uh be
really very difficult no
""
when there is an event  ahead of me like a journey or something
 it builds up
""
and any other certainty or any worry you know figures it out
""
and uh one doctor friend said something about the autonomic system
""
""
and  uh my cardiologist says that  uh when i have time  he
will conduct on me a thyroid test 
""
""
yes
""
""
so what is that 
""
""
actually doctor  gup  anxiety nerosis is not very
uncommon disease
""
i would say  it's  very common but it is not uncommon
""
""
uhm
""
""
and  this's  particularly influences everybody easily
is  you will feel that you are vulnerable to the evil 
""
""
uhm uhm
""
""
whether they are physically weak whether they are  uh
travelling in a
""
""
uhm 
""
""
so  to get certain amount of worry and what the term we use
of that you set a  uh of small small things    uh um 
""
so  it's  not uncommon 
""
and the best way to succumb to it  is not to succumb to it 
""
""
 uh um  
""
""
i see
""
""
and to avoid it the best reason i will give is that  you
should think yourself  that after all what is going to happen to me 
""
""
uhm 
""
""
just as last night i said that  i'll  get down at
parliament street at eleven  o'clock  what will happen to me
""
""
uhm 
""
""
and then immedietly i questioned myself what can happen to me
""
""
""
uhm 
""
""
nothing 
""
""
uhm
""
""
 i'll  get a cab
""
see and go
""
""
uhm
""
""
the best thing to avoid it that you reason it out
""
""
like
""
""
then after all what will be the result of this anxiety  
 one word  
""
""
  what'll  be   the worst comes then
""
""
yeah
""
""
yeah
""
""
and this  only increase your anxiety
""
but if you will reason it out 
""
""
yeah 
""
""
that these are the possibilities that can happen 
""
okay i am prepared for it
""
""
uh  uh
""
""
you know that a woman she is  a  apprehensive about
many things
""
what one can take from me
""
""
yes
""
""
oh this my small  attache  e-acute 
case it can go i won't worry about it
""
""
yeah go and
""
""
you want my watch no okay
""
""
gold chain i won't wear
""
""
no i won't wear
""
i i will not wear anything because physical hurt
""
okay if  i've  got the cash  i'll  give it to him
""
""
uhm
""
""
that is the best way
""
""
so  that's  one way of avoiding
""
""
one way of avoiding
""
but if you have got this is functional anxiety
""
""
ah ha
""
""
but if you have really some  uh medical problem that is to
be checked
""
for example that  thyroid
""
""
yeah
""
""
say for example  hyper thyroid people
""
""
uhm
""
""
they get particular  anxiety and for that they do certain
tests of mainly that  t three t four
""
""
uhm
""
""
thyroid distribulating harmones in fractions    uhm
 and  t f h 
""
so those who have got the defiency of thyroid they will have more t
f h
""
""
 uhm  
""
""
ah ha
""
""
means that their pituary body is going to  uh some extra
factor by producing more thyroid stimulating harmones
""
""
i see 
""
""
t three and t four are less  better indicator but t f h is
 good indicator  to diagnose early t f h see t three and t four they
are directly related with hyper thyroid 
""
""
so it can have a physiological correlater as well as a
psychological one
""
""
yeah  and most of the time it is psychological 
""
""
so  uh you have told me the way to fight the psychological
fear
""
""
 that's  my way
""
""
and  uh the physiological thing will require some kind of
pathological test 
""
""
yeah 
""
""
so i should go in for that 
""
""
well if you feel that you really may have thyroid problem you
should go
""
but  for thyroid problem there are one two indications 
""
one is that loss of weight 
""
""
uhm
""
""
number two is
""
""
steep loss of weight
""
""
yeah steep loss of
""
""
i have maintained my weight from   first 
""
""
 and    uh rise in  one word  blood cell
""
""
""
 one word  means hundred twenty
""
""
yeah
""
upper limit of the blood cell
""
""
so  i have neither of these symptoms
""
""
yeah 
""
""
my i mean i have less weight but it has been constant for ten
years    uhm  like this
""
""
 uhm  
""
""
yeah
""
""
or around the sixty-three    uhm  for  uh kgs
""
""
or maybe  it's  less i don't remember but it is constant
""
""
 uhm  
""
""
and
""
""
and dr shastri you have seen me i don't think uh you notice
much   difference 
 
""
 no no     no difference  
""
""
 and then   then there are other things that find
 one word  in the finger
""
""
ah ha
""
""
and then the  one word  falling here the  pro 
 one word  of  one word  they are late symptons
""
""
i see
""
""
but early is the indication of the thyroid  rise in the
   i see   a few words 
""
""
 i see  
""
""
uhm  uhm 
""
so actually  uh i have  been a diabetic and  uh uhm 
i had a cardiac kind of uh thing so
""
they made me  do the  uh this  one word  test
""
""
yeah 
""
""
and they said  it's  positive  which means you
know there is some error somewhere twice i did it
""
""
uhm uhm
""
""
and  uh my physicain wants to do it again   an 
and  maybe i am mixing up several symptoms 
""
maybe  that's  not serious  because i don't get any 
pain in my chest
""
""
uhm uhm
""
""
so this might be atypical  but  uh when i sort of run
 for example yesterday i had to run a bit  to catch a bus  so i am
a sort of that you know my breathing rate increases  otherwise there is no
problem and it comes down  uh after sometime 
""
so  uh do you think i really have a problem there
""
""
this is i cannot anwer
""
""
uh yeah
""
""
say for example after the age of forty or forty-five  you
are arrested to  just uh  this is sort of breath like rise  rise uh
 and  get  getting up by stairs    uhm  or running or
strenous exercises common people heart is taking more strength that is 
two words 
""
""
 uhm  
""
""
i see
""
""
and  so we diagnose it as a cardiac problems
""
you don't have to wait for angina
""
but if  you've  two times your  two words  is tested
 two words  which means that  you've  a minor degree of 
circulation problem
""
""
ah ha
""
""
only a minor degree of
""
""
yeah
""
""
and then you are regulating the life  uh life in a better
way
""
""
yeah
""
""
mild exercises if you really  two words  that vital
 capacity
""
you doesn't do as your doctor suggests
""
i will never say that   you don't do  what your
cardiologist said is
""
""
 yeah
""
you see  
""
""
yeah
""
he suggested these tests he said first thyroid test 
""
""
uhm
""
""
for this anxiety thing    one word    one
word 
""
""
 yeah  
""
""
uhm
""
""
then he said another test we will take
""
""
uhm uhm
""
""
and if necesary we will do angiography
""
""
yeah 
""
angiography is the last thing
""
i won't advice you to go through  lightly 
""
""
lightly means
""
""
i know you will see the all process of that you are really a
cardiac patient to go through the  uh angiography
""
""
so that will depend on the kind of uh    yeah 
results that the  one word  tests show
""
""
 yeah  
""
""
i hope so
""
""
yeah
""
""
i am not a cardiologist   but i have a  general
knowledge of a medical doctor
""
something a methodologist i know a little more than uh 
""
""
 but they do  
""
""
yeah
""
""
other discipline
""
""
the  set of  uh intriguing think is that doctors don't
look at the  the the fregment test  uh you know print out very  one
word  you know 
""
they just look at the summary given by
""
so  uh and that doesn't show where the narrowing is
""
""
no that doesn't figure in the narrowing is
""
and you know that  regular  test when a patient is really
prominent  one word  of narrowing the  process    
uhm  so that you can see can sometimes specifically in the angina when you
know might have cardiac effect
""
 a   a  and  uh in faction    uhm 
and in fact
""
""
 uhm  
""
""
 uhm  
""
""
as a result of the effect
""
""
as a result of effect but that occurs only in those who have
got a serious  two words  
""
""
  i think 
""
""
 they will not   ordinarily occur  in a person
who has got minor problems
""
and then there are indicators that the doctor will ask you
immedietly to stop 
""
""
yes of course
""
""
no no further tests should be   done  on him or her
""
""
""
 yeah  
""
""
yeah
""
he was uh  an m d  young and and he  was present and he
monitored 
""
so i think we have several monitors like heart rate and blood
pressure and
""
""
definitely 
""
""
but i overheard saying you know if change back to normal very
quickly
""
""
how is it
""
""
like  they accelerate the pace of the    yeah 
uh the mill 
""
if  it's  twenty hours twenty  uh twelve minutes thing
""
""
so i think  uh six seven minutes you know i was getting
restless  and then uh they slowed it down 
""
""
 yeah  
""
""
you see on that question normally uh uh experts the
cardiologist should decide but for me  i'll  not tell you straight way
""
""
i see
""
""
see we have not don't being a cardiologist i hope so that i
am fully fit to answer this big question 
""
""
yeah
""
""
uh if i am faithful to myself  but if  i am  getting
this question and it should come back to normal i would say that  a few
words  
""
""
yeah
""
""
you have got mild
""
""
yeah
""
""
general common sense you can say
""
""
right
""
you see 
""
""
see these days we are  getting more and more tests than
""
""
well it is good that it is diagnosed it 
""
""
yeah
""
""
because this should be done when and where the  one word
 expect 
 
""
well you could perhaps you know get back to diabetes  uh i am
a little affected  uhm if you can  uh repeat i mean uh problem that
justification of that  one word  uh  one word  for both of us
""
""
""
yeah 
""
actually my diabetes is under control
""
in the beginning i had no concept of calories and so on 
""
the usual notion given  two words  sweet 
""
now  uh you know for a year i i joined a diabetic clinic which
is exclusive for diabetics 
""
and the doctor you know uh  say he didn't say this like i
gathered from end to end so that i was not a serious case and  also allows
to  uh go  two words  go and prepare  because the gap between
dinner and the breakfast is to be very long 
""
so the whole thing is that  uh you should control the quantity
of calories that you take  rather than  uh actual items 
""
so this is under control but i think over the years i have 
developed all kinds of psychological hangups and fears 
""
and this anxiety thing for  adra  adrenil or something you
know
""
""
yeah
""
""
is discharge of its own 
""
and once or twice i had to cancel my air journey 
""
and uh once it so happened you know that kind of fun as you might
have to go to this university to pick up the  one or two words  
""
and i said you know i am going to take an early morning flight to
madras and then from madras i have to take a plane to tirichinapally and 
""
i don't want to do all these and  you know this builds up high
 raised height of anxiety  and the second that i start  booming 
and panting and all that 
""
my son became nervous and around ten pm  there came a phone
call saying  are you travelling to madras tomorrow 
""
in those days the airlines people were a some kind of go slow or
non-coperation thing 
""
they said the flight is likely to be  uh delayed indefinitely
""
""
i see
""
""
i said  can i cancel it 
""
he said  yes 
""
i said  do i have to pay any charge 
""
he said  no 
""
and immedietly  immedietly this thing was over 
""
""
this is
""
""
all my anxiety   was over 
 
""
 ah   
""
""
 laughs 
""
uhn doctor i think that you should consult a psychiatrist  
 uhm  but in my own way i will say that psychiatrists create more
problems than solution
""
""
 uhm  
""
""
i know
""
""
more solution
""
so i said that you try to reason out within yourself that  
 yeah  after all why should you have this 
""
""
 yeah  
""
""
yeah
""
""
 it's  getting a little psychological also
""
""
is it psychological    uh  and  uh like uh 
last month  i was told that i had to go to japan
""
""
 uh  
""
""
uhm
""
""
 it's  a rare opportunity  and uh i was an invitee
of japan government
""
i my passport has expired 
""
i had to get a visa and all that 
""
so in my you know  uh waist on the right hand side  i
developed some pain  laughter 
""
and uh i thought it was my being kidney thing because diabetics
are likely to get    uh  kidney and i had no time to go the
hospital because i had to go to the passport office
""
and i noticed that on fourteenth of  this june  when the
passport was handed over to me at six pm that pain  dis dis 
disappeared immedietly
""
""
 uh  
""
""
uhm uh
""
but you   go   went   to japan then
""
""
ah i went to you know because you know i got executive class
ticket  uh madras uh hyderabad madras madras singapore singapore uh tokyo
and then back to singapore i made a stop over in singapore 
""
in uh tokyo myself and nihalani presented they told me  deputy
chairperson
""
so i presided most of the sessions    uh 
""
for two weeks and my contribution was valued and all that 
""
so i really enjoyed it
""
but this anxiety thing occur occasionaly there also
""
""
 uh
