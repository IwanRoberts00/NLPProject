sir at the outset i wish to bring to the attention of this house the dignity of the two institutions the institution  of rashtrapati and the institution the governor of the state sir rashtrapati's address is an address of the policy of the government that it will follow and also the achievements of the government  sir political and economic stability are the two sides of the same coin  we cannot for one without the other  sir this government which came to power two and a half years back was facing a political turmoil in the country  what is this government even though a single party with the largest members in this house was a minority government  and we know the difficulties of running a minority government which has to take a number of bold economic decision  but within two and half years we have proved that this government taken taking bold political decisions and economic decisions could attain majority  sir this is two and half years there is a political  polarisation taking place in this country  it is this political polarisation  it is this political polarisation where anti communal  forces and democratic forces coming together under the leadership of the congress party that has given  a new political stability to the nation  sir this government has taken decisions on all subjects  whether the government was in a majority or whether the government was in a minority  and for the mandal issue we could find a solution in a very democratic manner and all the backward communities in this country are happy because they have got their due share in the governmental machinery  for about this congress party has taken a stand from the time of pandit either this issue has to be settled amicably by discussion between both the parties or the course of law has to take its verdict and that verdict has to be deeply seen  sir coming to the economic front we have taken very bold decisions  and you know when it came when it came to power two and half years back what was the economic situation  the inflation was at its highest up about seventeen percent   the if the foreign exchange reserves was kept  four thousand crores in two and half years back  now it has grown eight times more  it is all around twenty-two thousand crores  so situation the over all situation is very comfortable this comfortable situation could be achieved because of the drastic measures congress has taken  sir in the seventy-nine prelinary session of the inter-national conference at tirupati narsimharao has explained in detail about the one word  an important one or two words speech  since the beginning of the era of plan development the indian national congress has been inspired and guided by the vision of jawaharlal nehru  he has strong sense of wisdom and deep understanding of the  distinctive of the indian resource let him to one or two words  all topman approaches and evolved india all synthesis  for the diverse influence which was inherently just humane  pragmatic and uniquely indian the use of developed development planning was an instrument to achieve this stand and ensure the material well being of the masses and the dignity of the indian  so sir we have never deviated from two words  and sir when our farmers are taking up this current  we obliged in this house on one hand we have been  one word what the political parties have been demanding that the farmers should be given a regularising price  there is no party in this house which has not demanded that  every party is demanding that the one or two words  and when we give regularising price naturally it has to be  passed on to the consumers  in four one or two words exports enable to march ninety-two ninety-three the growth of three point six percent april to december ninety-two it was only three point five percent  april to december ninety-three it has gone to nineteen point  nine percent  now sir coming to the employment we have taken a number of steps during last two and a half years  the jawahar rozgar yojana  the nehru rozgar yojana  then other programmes other employment oriented programmes  yet there is the unemployment in the country  sir the achievement of scientists the achievement of in the in our research field sir the the the the launching of the  agni is something which is tough and fearless   it's an achievement of a group of a community of scientists who have been denied a number of facilities foreign facilities foreign technology  but within themselves they could they could find out ways and means solutions so that today we are proud that agni  has been launched  just like the agni has been launched in the space  and i'm sure sir sir this government will be able to give a new thrust to our one word a new thrust to our economic structure a new thrust to our industrial strength so that there is economic prosperity in this country then the peaceful the political situation in this country only request is that all democratic forces should help us  should support us this is my request  i listened with care sir to the speech of my honourable friend d s p mathur as also the second of professor thomas  i also read sir with great care the text of the speech  which is really a not so much speech of the head of the republic as it is in articulation of the governments view point  also what they have done in the year gone by and what they intent doing in the year that is facing us now  so i could not help but carry an impression that the  that the that its a its a tired and a desperated emotions  a tired and desperated address  it was it was uninspiring in content and i was struck by the fact of the recourse that government could take of loading this speech with the a great deal of anti-statistical assertions  i found the address somewhat self-satisfied and  one word  the great deficiency that i find is the disharmony between the assertions of government and uh what i have observed as a crippling citizen that has one word many parts of national endeavour  and national life  there is an impression being different and impression that is attempted  an impression that was attempted to be created in the speech itself  has been one word all to do as if some kind of an imaginary  hump has been crossed  let me put it to the treasury bench if now through an immorality through a performing of the participatory system of government is through one word of defaction  if through creating splits within one party after another you have rearranged the arithmatic  if you had simply rearranged the arithmatic let me division not  in variety of thoughts that you have crossed some kind of an imaginary hump and now rosy pastures upon the green pasture lie ahead of you  these are the first assertions that made by the head of the republic and by the government is about the north-east  these are his first assertions sir to create the situations with regard to insurgency in the north-east has shown improvement i do not know sir to what i should attribute such an assertion  that insurgency in the north-east is improving when the governor of manipur and nagaland has himself without going into all the quotation from his report to the president it might be again be repeated the governor of manipur and nagaland has said but clearly amongst other things that the above state of intense insurgency  and internal disorder and you would observe mr speaker sir that he is not talking in the past tense  he is talking of position as it exist in that part of the country in the month of august to october of ninety-three  the above state of intense insurgency and internal disorder is due to lack of political stability and will lack of an overall perception and monitoring of the worsening situation by the governmental security forces over after long period  you must have heard in the one word of government  cannot be made by agency of government itself  and if you want to argue sir that this civil citizen his observation is limited to manipur and nagaland then at all i am not convinced that the words that have been put into the mouth of the  head of the republic by the government  i do not know to what i should attribute them  is it a step by the government to mislead the nation ? is it an attempt by the government to draw one word over the reality in the wake of the situation that prevails in the north-east  ? or is it is it an attempt to to denigrate the institution of parliament and to treat the entire exercise of the  address to the joint session of the parliament as a perfunctory exercise of little importance fairly to a one word sir that the situation that we face in the north-east is of extreme one word  and the most extreme serious  i one word in totality the assertion of the government  that the situation in entire north-east is improving  it has not improved  and the sense of complacency about improving that the government seems to be putting across is a very mislead sense and it will be extremely challenging to the republic  thanks oh thanks to very briefly mention just two or three aspects of the current situation of jammu and kashmir  there is an assertion made in the president's address  and an assertion which suggests that it was the strength displayed by the government in the unfortunate in incident at hazratbal which restrained the demonstrative itself through success we have not yet sir not yet not till today the parliament has not authoritatively been told as to what actually happened in hazratbal  the government has not yet come forward to tell  i repeat that demand we must come to know what actually transpired in hazaratbal during that period  how did the situation come about that the army was obliged to take seige to that uh shrine ? and what transpired when the siege was subsequently attempted ? what was the arrangement that the government made with the seventy or eighty those who were in those that were inside the shrine  ? and how is it that when those that were inside the shrine  when they surrendered whom did they surrender to ? what was the role of the army ? and how thereafter sir that out of those seventy or eighty that surrender we do not yet authoritatively know what the correct figure is there is not a single one now sir is in prison  not a single one is today charged as a serious terrorist  meriting those serious try  we were told that there are three or four or five  i don't know how many foreign terrorists of foreign nationality where are they now ? and these are not small issues that the nation can just take lightly  i put it to you sir that in hazratbal it was india's  great good fortune which saved us  that this government made every possible mistake in the handling of the situation that it could have made and that is in hazratbal the siege finally got lifted and with those that were inside  surrendered  they did not surrender sir because of the so called  patience shown by the government they surrender because of certain chances which are entirely of  recording broken  it was incapacity incapacity to think incapacity to act  miserable failure uh serious challenge to the nation as such  i demand sir that unless the prospects of hazratbal  incident are shared with this house we will continue to hold i certainly will continue to hold that in hazratbal this government in charge is making every possible mistake that it could have every possible wrong that it could have for the nation  and if the nation still survives it was not on account of anything that the government did  it was despite what the government did  it is not a question sir of this disarray simply at the level of hazratbal  it is a disarray that start from the top here  that is disarray in decision making in the union home ministry itself  it is opened up we do not know dealing with kashmir  the honourable the home minister for home makes one statement with certain assertion is definitely the honourable minister for state makes an other assertion  his excellency the governor of kashmir makes a third assertion the army is left out on its one word they make certain suggestions  the security forces are left on the limp they make another suggestion  that disarray this total lack of coordinate arises not simply in the metalistic sense  it arises principally sir from the conceptual or a  what is it that we are one or two words what is it this government is trying to do in kashmir ? where are we heading do you know sir ? and i'll be happy if i'm proven wrong  and i will i would demand of the government to share with us the figures and to explain to us that if these are government one word then how was such incident take place  i demand of government to share with the house the reality of what is taking place today in the district of toda in one word  in one word i demand of the government share with us  what is taking place today by the raising of the head of insurgency  in the district of jammu in udhampur  i demand sir that this the government owes not just to the parliament this the government owes to the nation  unless the government share all this with us in this house  the government stand charged of neglect a very great neglect of a very great national priority  and finally what about those three hundred thousand  kahsmiri pundit who in their own homeland so many years after the raising of insurgency in their own homeland are homeless no one can disappoint for them  this government does not have time to even visit the camp the pathetic plight of this three hundred thousand pundit  for the last three to four years  i charge this government for the most inhuman neglect of its own citizen  this is the most telling example of the blindness of this government in the face of human misery  sir we have this yesterday celebration of presentation of the budget  i accept that this uh his address to the uh joint session of the parliament is not a debate on the budget  i am not going to even attempt that  but because the speech of the president makes a reference  to economic reform programme and suggests to the joint-session that the economic reform programme of this government is really their answer  to all the ill one or two words reflects the country therefore very briefly i consider it my uh obligation to put to you my perception of where the government has brought the country  just look at four or five simple assertions that i will take which are not assertions that i make uh one or two words they call it a very one or two words  these are the assertions that the honourable union finance minister has himself did
