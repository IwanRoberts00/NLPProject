mr boris yeltsin of russia had an extremely successful visit to india last week  and such were the one word reception he got in the central hall of praliament when he addressed that august body that people were asking whether he is more popular in india than he is back in russia  during his visit he signed ten agreements  and it appeared that the old relationship between india and the soviet union which has collapsed with that counrty  now there appeared to be a new beginning with the new russia  now obviously russia is not the soviet union   india's relationship with russia has to be on a new basis uh completely different basis from that with the old soviet union  to discuss this we have with us two distinguished panelist  they are mr jagjeet singh who is the director of the institute for defence studies and analysis  we have mr vijay karan former director of the cbi  jagjeet tell us over all in the ter te   terms of structuring a new relationship between the two countries  in terms of the totality of the vision where do you think we stand with russia ? and how is this different from the old relationship with the soviet union ? well i think obviously as you mentioned very rightly   tha that there is something we also need to keep reminding ourselves that there is no soviet union  uh this is uh not totally a new country but substantively  new leadership new system new approaches have and which has  substantial amount of domestic problems the economic social political uh in the larger context of course it remains one of the  key uh great powers of the world much depends on how it's  own cohesiveness in all respects shapes up  uh but what what would have imagined uh swami that uh given the nature of the previous relationship and the fact that most of the people still are similar and the some fundemental uh geo-political realities  in fact this sort of visit should have taken place much earlier but still i think uh uhm coming as it does it is time does reflect hopes return to realism in moscow as well as a certain amount of  fresh thinking on both sides to to look at this relationship and try to build it up uh with the changed circumstances on the changed parametres  yes in fact i think the internal affairs ministry had made an official announcement about boris yeltsin coming almost one year ago  that's right and he never came and it was a matter of some embarassment  and i think a very large number of people had come to the conclusion look this is a terrible mistake mr boris yeltsin  no longer heads a super power he now head merely a poor country  and a one word of europe  that his main priority right now is to get as much aid and other systems as he can get from the usa from europe investment if he can from japan  and that he is now going to be in the struggle to re-establish himself with the west and japan and that he is no longer going to worry about old geo-political strategy which made india a national ally of the soviet union  and yes now that he has come in a sense people are once again  getting a whip of old nostalgia saying haan   that even if it's not quite the same love affair can we atleast hold hand  uh mr vijay karan how do you see this new affair developing  ?  haan  well i agree with you there were there was a state of uncertainty before he came because of the announcement that he will come earlier but he didn't come  at least that uncertainty has been re  removed and his visit has shown a certain degree of keenness on the part of the russian to continue good relations with india otherwise i doubt them first  the russians would have been so forth the russian president for instance so forth right on india's territorial integrity on  the kashmir on pakistan etcetera so i think also i would rather take the first step russia when you think in terms of uh may be uh another regional grouping in in the long term if it one word off the emerges of any other threat in islamic law emerging in the  one word in the horizon or the western powers again there are some problem so may be they wants want to keep india on the right side you know good relationship india a good relationship with india as as a long term measure  it is interesting point you're raising  alright suppose russia feels some kind of threat from an islamic block what role would it expect india to play then  well may be if let's say an islamic block emerges and it it becomes enemical to india because of say pakistan or bangladesh or together they otherwise i do not see an islamic block really posing a serious threat to india but because of pakistan and bangladesh if it poses a threat to india and if it also poses a threat to russia than there are there is we can do something one word  jagjeet do you think i mean there was an old  ge geo-political relationship based on the ussr as a global power yes actually russia is not a global power  and yet there is a point which vijay has just said about the potential of trouble in central asia  uh which is an area which so to speak divide russia from india  do you think this have a serious issue uh which has agitating minds in moscow and does it have anything to do with the new relationship ?  yes  uhm well yes and n n no   in the sense that yes there is a different sort of perception about central asia uh let's say about a year ago in moscow  uh but i don't think that's the reason for uh the  type of attempt to build up a new relationship it is perhaps just one more factor in that  uh the the fundamental has not really change  russia in fact they are not one or two words global power just any way except the united states from from their point of view especially particularly in that respect so  uh that way it is not too difficult to look at russia uh more in the nature of uhm another great country uh great power  whatever terms you want to use it which has not only its own interest but which needs to co-operate with the larger number of uh centres of powers and areas and regions uh then just japan uh north america and and west europe and that's realism i was talking of that there is a return to realism which then uh makes the whole thing possible to establish a new relationship  central asia is certainly an important point  but not that that that's the driving force i i won't say it's the driving force  well i said that because i think the russian president did mentioned that may be russia china and india could emerge as a force together and could work together that's what he mentioned in the press conference well much depend that one word certain significant  you'll know that the number of people who were very upset in india with the end of the cold war threat   we'll now be in a uni-polar world dominated by the usa alas rus the soviet union is no more  some of the thing to be getting excited about russia i think or perhaps we will no longer be a uni-polar world perhaps we'll be able to use russia or some other people  ally with them or with you're searching a broader  group along with china  but does it is is that realistic ? i mean is there any sense in which the uni-polarity of the world i mean i don't think the world is really uni-polar but clear   to the extent  right to the extent that the the usa is substantial  doc uh if not do not completely dominant power  do you think russia can be used by us in any sense  to break whatever dominancy usa may have ? well first of all uh uh as you've said i mean  i'm one of the people who believes that there was never this thing called a uni-polar world i one or two words  except the united states always always even during the cold war held the primacy amongst states and that primacy continues  and the question was soviet union has uh created a capability mostly military to countervail that that one so that's one that has disappeared  what he take the military power and the balance of power unfortunately was being seen in terms of military power once you take that factor away then you will start looking at the uh strategic and security economic political interest of states  uh i personally if i think which which we're which mean inclined to look at this issue from the point of view can we use a country of against different country i i think there are natural areas on which co-operation will take place whether the scope of co-operation is greater let us say between russia and india than it could be between aryo - russia and united states or india and the united states  uh if the the whole uh thing is there is in a way uh you know prosperity has become one of the new urgent necessity throughout the world in russia and india and in whole of asia and even in the united states for that matter  and that's been altering the the whole structure  i think that we need to look at the whole situation more in terms of areas on which co-operation will continue and areas on which   they there will be differences of opinion  our challenges are really how best to strengthen the areas of co-operation whether it is united states or with russia or china or japan or whatever  and to ensure that the areas of differences or divergences   do not are not allowed to become uh sources of controversial matter that's that's the only way of i look at it yes fine i mean as it's very very clear that there is no sense in which india can aligned itself with russia against the usa i mean jagjeet has gone out of his way to say any friendship  we've is not you can not be aimed against anybody else  haan  okay lets get to some nuts and bolt of the agreement signed here and of the specific policy statements made by yelstin here the obvious one is kashmir  earlier there was considerable uncertainty as to what was going to be russia's new position  we had even indicated if i'm not mistaken sometime ago  are don't expect that we shall continue what the soviet union use to do  and yet it would appear during his visit here unambiguously came out with support to the indian position  two questions first does it make any difference ? in other words given that the usa has given one word  to india's position various other all security council were driven to india's position  does it really make much of a difference that mr yelstin has  one word around to one word  question question number two uh since this is clearly a message in trying to get through to us  what is their willingness which take the climate which we can capitalize on ? mr vijay karan yeah i think that the first question that is about uh doesn't matter uhm the fact matter because you can't uh wish away i mean the soviet union is not irrelevent i mean it's one mustn't obtained that after the break up of the soviet union russia has become irrelevent as you mentioned it's still a strong military power  because as member of the united uh security council that does count in the world it might be weak economically  a few words it's own problem  a few words  and uh apart from the russian the american the american question is there on what they want from pakistan for instance pakistan has i mean u usa  has sent a signal to pakis a clear signal to pakistan on terrorism if a similar signal can go from the sovi  from russia to pakistan  that's a few words  yes it is good uh i think we need to move on to  one word somewhere to centre pace of the visit  this should be the resolution of the rupee   rubel dispute between the two countries  and i think if this had not been resolved co-operation and trade co-operation military measures would have been held up  and this is such a complex affair that it might be a mistake to get too deeply into it  but as i understand this extremely complex affair roughly twenty percent uh of the increase in the rupee value which should have taken place after december thirty first nineteen ninety-one has not taken place  to that extent there is a kind of rise of thirty percent of the debt which nobody is talking about   one word were given not talked about  of the debt that remains roughly one third has been  reschedule on extremly softer terms  where our debt servicing liability comes down by about two third  this has been held as an arrangement that is fair to all and  will arrange will enable our bilateral relations now to go ahead on the trade side on the credit side on the defence side
