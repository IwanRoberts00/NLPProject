""
""

""
""
i like it fine the only thing it doesn't agree with my
constitution with weather 
""
yes i too find it uh little bit chill 
""
""
what about you uma 
""
""
no i think when i came here initially i wasn't well 
""
now i think i got accustomed to this climate and other thing 
""
how about you 
""
""
no initially it didn't affect me but i think  uh now my
resistance  is much less    uhm  and  i have got  sore
throat  cold
""
""
 uhm  
""
""
uhm  i think it must be also because that you are away from
your son
""
""
yeah ah 
""
""
by the way how old is your son 
""
""
he is twelve  and he is in ninth standard 
""
""
twelve and in ninth standard
""
""
yes
""
""
but it is very early i think in school
""
""
i i too think so 
""
he is very young  for the class 
""
""
how many kids do you have 
""
""
i have  uh just one 
""
what about you uma
""
""
i have got two 
""
got a son in fifth standard    ah  and a daughter 
she is admitted in kg in  one word 
""
""
 ah  
""
""
won't they miss you
""
""
definitely 
""
i have written to my son
""
and my husband also has written to me saying that he miss me a lot
""
""
what about you prabha
""
""
haven't you received any letter from home
""
""
i have written to them
""
 i'm  expecting a reply from
""
""
how many kids you have
""
""
two kids
""
both girls i have never left them alone till now
""
""
which class are they
""
""
fifth and sixth
""
girls in    yes  the problem of platting the hair
washing the hair
""
i don't know what they are doing at home
""
""
 yes  
""
""
my husband must be just keeping the cooker and they must be
eating just  daal  and rice
""
""
when you go
""
""
your husband is a good cook i think
""
""
no he not i don't say he is a good cook but he will manage
somehow i think
""
""
yeah yeah
""
""
know when we go back no i think  we'll  get a rosy
welcome home   welcome there 
""
""
 yes    laughter 
""
""
everybody would have missed us a lot no 
""
""
perhaps they will understand our value better then 
""
all the work which we did then
""
""
yeah 
""
""
sometime this parting is necessary no    yeah 
temporary parting 
""
especially  one or two words 
""
""
 yeah  
""
""
yeah  we'll  also realise their importance and 
they'll  also  one word 
""
""
ah yes
""
""
especially my  son's  case no  he is very much
attached 
""
i feel  uh that  this separation will help him to  uh get
 uh become a little bit independent 
""
but the only thing  i'm  bothered is regarding his studies
no 
""
because i help him a lot with his studies 
""
now   of course   he's  got to get the help of his
father or grand parents or someone else 
""
""
 uhm  
""
""
 ayyo  my daughters were saying you know 
  yeah  before i left they were saying   how will we study
""
""
""
 yeah  
""
""
because   i'm  the one who coaches them 
""
my husband comes at very late from work 
""
and he doesn't have much time to attain to their studies 
""
so all their studying the home work part and all that they feel as
if no  like  it's  like  even though i would they would have
felt  uh mummy is not letting us play and all so long 
""
now that uh strictness is removed from them  they i think 
they'll  feel a bit insecure 
""
so they were asking me
""
""
my son too needs me 
""
otherwise he won't touch the book 
""
i don't know what he  he is doing in my absence 
""
may be  he's  cutting his tution classes  and  uh
just whiling away the time 
""
""
but he is with your parents no
""
""
yes  a few words  pamper  pamper him a lot 
""
""
 it's  okay  just for a month 
""
for a change let him get pampered then he will change back to his
normal routine 
""
""
how about your hobbies and all 
""
what do you do during your
""
""
i i  i play with my son    yeah 
""
he doesn't like chess because he has to use his    brain
""
""
""
 yeah  
""
""
 brain   well
""
""
he like  shuttle cock better than that 
""
  so i play 
""
""
 no even for   shuttle cock you have to use your
brain
""
you have to    one or two words  
""
""
 no  one or two words    maybe that  
kind of 
""
""
 kind of   but it would be better than an indoor
game no 
""
""
no  it's  an indoor game only 
""
""
uhm
""
""
oh shuttle cock 
""
""
but i play it as an outdoor game 
""
of course when  it's  very windy we can't do that 
""
and he expects me to run about  just like  uh   
uhm  young girl    uhm  which  i'm  not able to do
""
""
so very often he wins  and i lose 
""
""
 uhm  
""
""
 uhm  
""
""
only you lost to your little son 
""
""
what about you 
""
what do you do during your spare time
""
""
  my hobby is tailoring  and   uh some
painting 
""
""
  a few words   
""
""

""
""

""
""

bathroom or in the kitchen  laughter 
""
""

""
""

""
""

""
""
i love singing  in fact i want to learn along with my
daughters

""
""
what about you

somewhere when everybody is watching tv    uhm  i will go and
sit and read
""
""

""
so while  while the milk is boiling  i just stand there with
the book in my hand and  one or to words  and i read the book 
""

""
there is scope for teaching
""
""
 a few words 
""
""
see many of they
""
""
  no i told you i don't like it 
""
""
 the teachers are very well paid   
""
""
i don't like to leave india
""
""
nearly fifteen thousand  rupees  per month you
know that 
""
""
whatever it is  i'm  not very much attracted by those
jobs
""
""
uhm 
""
""
because  i feel secure  when  i'm  in india
""
""
 that's  right 
""
""
and in case there is some  uh problem there   
uhm  both of us will have to come back and  we won't have anything
stable in india
""
""
 uhm  
""
""
brothers and sisters you have 
""
""
yes  i have two brothers and two sisters
""
""
oh all are in india 
""
""

""
she is in pondecherry 
""
""
 uhm  
""
""
what about you 
""
""
i have got only one brother  and he is employed in madras
""
""
my parents stay quite close by 
""
so i visit them almost every evening 
""
my daughter stays with them 
""
only my son stays with me
""
""
what about you  your parents 
""
""
i have    uhm  they are all in thiruvangal
""
""
 uhm  
""
""
oh in madras only 
""
""
i have one sister 
""
""
so   every week  or so you go and meet them
""
""
 a brother  
""
""
where is the time 
""
we never go    why 
""
only my poor  parents will only come
""
""
 why  
""
""
oh
""
""
i never stir out of the house 
""
in fact i don't even know who my neighbours are 
""
of course i know them  i don't mean it literally
""
""
no i know 
""
""
where is the time to talk  day today events with them

i think  it's  a waste of time no
""
once we enter the house if we talk to the neighbours uh
""
""
i don't know my  husband's  friend he manages to spent
atleast  one or two words  with the neighbours 
""
i don't know what they must be thinking of me  but of course i
""
""
""
even i i live in a flat
""
""
not  one word 
""
""
so naturally when there are forty-eight    flats
there  yeah flats there and so  inspite of that  just i won't be
able to talk for even five minutes with my neighbour    uhm 
""
means hardly five minutes i spend with them no
""
just while going to school   i'll  just say hello and
then in the evening by this all    uhm 
""
nothing at all no time to go and talk
""
""
 flats there  
""
""
 uhm  
""
""
 uhm  
""
""
and they are so helpful  because we are away most of the
day no
""
""
she is also  working
""
""
yeah when that uh  for metre reading when he come  
 yeah  sometime empty gas cylinders and all we have to leave down
""
all this my husband talk with them 
""
  i never 
""
""
 yeah  
""
""
 i never   manage to get all this done  when
 i'm  at home 
""
""
no you have no other go   you've  to do it
""
""
because  it's  an independent house and  uh no my
neighbours are not very close
""
""
uhm  so
""
""
but my son makes up for it 
""
there is a little boy there    uhm  so my son goes and
plays with that boy 
""
and they very thick friends
""
only we elders we don't have much time to  converse and talk
and all
""
""
 uhm
