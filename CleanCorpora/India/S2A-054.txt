""
""
so  today's   uh recipe is  the punjabi dish we
call  alu ka parontha  
""
it is one of uh  the most favourite dishes  can be  used
 to be  eaten at breakfast  or just at tea-time 
""
it may be a little heavy for the ordinary  people but i think
 easy to make  very tasty 
""
uh the ingredients that we use  are mainly potatoes  wheat
flour  green corriander leaves  salt  chilli powder to your taste
 and  green chilli 
""
take the potatoes boil them  till they are absolutely  soft
""
""
peel the potatoes  mash them  add the other ingredients 
that is  green  corriander leaves  cut them absolutely fine 
add  the salt  according to your taste  some chilli powder  and
a little of   ajwain  
""
mix all these ingredients  and prepare a ball of  the mashed
potatoes 
""
now this is the stuffing that we use  for the  
parontha  
""
regarding  the  wheat flour  take enough quantity 
for your guest  take a little water  and knead the flour by gradually
adding  the water to it 
""
see  be careful you know not to make the flour  very soft
the dough very soft  nor very hard 
""
it should be medium  enough  i mean easy enough to roll it
out 
""
make small balls of the potato stuffing  and also small balls
of the dough 
""
roll out  the dough  into a little round  shape 
""
yes in the shape of a small  puri  
""
place  the  potato ball in the centre  flatten it  on
the  puri   and now gradually cover it up with the dough
""
""
it   and it  becomes into a flat  little piece 
""
now roll this  whole piece again out  by applying a little
of the dry  wheat flour  and rolling it  with the rolling pin 
""
the shape should be absolutely round  the movements should be
smooth and equal so that  the potato stuffing  also moves  equally
within the dough 
""
otherwise the edges will remain without the stuffing  and they
will be a little tasteless 
""
once you have rolled it out properly into the shape of a 
chapati   you may put it on to a heated  tawa 
""
""
keep the gas at medium  heat 
""
when the  first side of the  chapati  is ready
you may turn it over  let it cook for sometime 
""
and now apply a little  ghee   or oil to the
surface of the  chapati  
""
turn it over  apply a little  ghee  to the other
side 
""
and now keep moving the  chapati  from side to side
 till it turns a little golden  brown 
""
this is  your  alu ka parontha  
""
 i'm  sure the aroma is coming 
""
well  serve it to your guest  along with it  see that
you add a little of  home butter  or amul butter  and then ask
 your guest whether they enjoy it 
""
of course  a little of curds  will add to the  taste of
the whole  dish 
""
this is   alu ka parontha  
""
in this way you can prepare  many other  paronthas
 also 
""
they may be  with the help of raddish  they may be with the
help of onion  and cheese  cottage cheese  or  even with the
help of green leafy vegetables  like  palak  
""
in the same way you can  as you have used potatoes  you may
use the raddish that is  grate the raddish  squeeze the water out
 use the same ingredients  and then stuff it into the  dough 
""
""
as far as onion and cheese is concerned  you may grate the
onion into the wheat flour  as well as the cheese  and then  knead
the dough 
""
and the similar method is used for green leafy vegetables like
 palak  or  methi  
""
cut them finely  wash them and knead them with the flour and you
have a variety  of   paronthas   either for tea or
for breakfast 
""
and one more 
""
""
you have a dish called  one word 
""
""
yes there are many other dishes there is no  uh paucity of
dishes where the punjabis are concerned  yes
""
now these are the simplest ones  you can have  uh what is
known as   chole bhature   which is a very famous 
uh punjabi dish
""
""
 one or two words 
""
""
right   chole   have to be soaked that
is they are white gram  they have to be soaked overnight  and uh 
so that they rise up and become soft by morning 
""
you may grate  or in a mixer you may mash about four big 
onions 
""
fry these onions to a golden brown 
""
similarly  add  the juice of say about four tomatoes  to
these onions after it has become golden brown 
""
then you may add  salt  and uh chilli powder  some of
the spices  which are also of course optional 
""
and after you have added all these ingredients  add tamarind
water a cup of tamarind water 
""
the   chanas  must be pre boiled  and after
all the ingredients have been cooked well  there should be no smell of
the onion remaining  raw onion 
""
you now add the  chanas  to the  cooked 
masala  
""
add a little warm water  and let the gravy remain as thick as
you would like it  that is your personal taste 
""
regarding the  bhaturas  bhaturas  are made out
of   maida   or white flour 
""
like  chanas  they have to be prepared the previous
 night  the arrangement has to be done the previous night 
""
the white flour  is kneaded only in curds  preferably 
sour curd 
""
once it has been kneaded well and thick  you don't have to make
it soft  you leave it overnight 
""
and because of the sourness of the curds  the flour rises up
""
""
next day  you make small balls of this flour  roll them up
with a rolling pin  and you deep fry them  in oil  on medium heat
""
these are what are known as  bhaturas   and with
 the  chanas  they form the dish  chole bhature
 
""
before serving them  see that you cut fine rings of raw onion
 long green chillies  and a lots of  fresh green corriander  to
serve with the dish 
""
""
uhm
""
""
anything more  yes
""
""
i do not know that punjabi dish and  one or two words 
about  samosas  and  a few words 
""
""
 kachoris  is from gujrat
""
""
oh  kachoris  are uh  uh chiefly marawari
dish
""
""
ahn
""
""
yes   samosas  are prepared universally
""
""
uh  if you want in uh punjabi  you'll  have then 
dahi balle  dahi balle  is another dish which is typically
punjabi 
""
""
like the  dahi wada 
""
""
yes  similarly  or if uh  if we can say 
 raitas  are something which is totally in uh punjabi 
""
that is it is prepared with  curds 
""
ordinarily people prefer even  in the south to have curds
directly  but punjabis would prefer to have curds with something in it
""
""
""
prefer that
""
""
so we have a variety of  raitas  
""
you  you may  set a bowl of milk  in the night  to
become into curds 
""
in the morning  you may  put it into the mixer rotate it 
and then you add a little  salt  chilli  cumin powder  and a
little of  powdered black salt to it  as digestive 
""
then it depends on  what you feel like eating that day which
 raita  you prefer 
""
it may be  potato  raita   it may be 
cucumber  raita   it may be  with corriander and
chilli  or  what we know what is popularly known as  kishmish
ka raita  
""
i think  in english we will call  kishmish  
""
""
raisin
""
""
raisin 
""
yes  it is raisin 
""
now  the difference between preparing of the other 
raitas  and raisin is that with raisin is that  with raisin it is
sweet  and the other  raitas  are  with salt and
chilli 
""
now when we prepare the one with raisin  you take about  uh
half a cup of raisin  you soak them into warm water  and leave them
for sometime so that they  get soaked 
""
you put about four spoons big spoons of sugar into the curds 
rotate it well  uh one fourth spoon of  salt  one fourth spoon of
  garam masala   that is all spices  crushed 
""
now that it is ready  you squeeze out the  raisin the 
water from the raisin and you add it to the curds 
""
this is a special dish  generally prepared on occasions 
because raisins are not  very expensive now a days 
""
so  when you have uh  what you would call a  dawat
  you would add  the  kishmish ka raita  as one
of the dishes  to the others  now things on the menu 
""
""
the last uh   dahi wada   what's  is
like
""
""
the  dahi bhallas   yes  it is known as
 dahi bhalla    in    bhalla  in
 punjabi   dahi wada  universally all over india 
yes 
""
""
  dahi wada   
""
""
it can be made out of  the  mung dal  
or the  udad dal  that is one is yellow in colour the other is
white 
""
preferably it is the white one that is the  udad dal
 that is used 
""
you soak the  dal  overnight  you rotate it in
the mixer  mixer next day 
""
and it has to become absolutely into a thick fine paste
""
but the paste must not become thin 
""
it should remain a little on the thick side 
""
once it is ready  you grind a little cumin seeds  you grind
uh ginger  and green chillies  and add them to the ground  udad
dal  
""
then heat a little oil  and make small balls of the  udad
dal   and leave them into the  oil 
""
keep turning them till they are a little golden brown  and
remove them  onto a piece of paper so that the extra oil is drained off
""
""
now take  a large quantity of curds  mix it well beat it up
well  add salt  chilli  and also a little cumin powder to it 
""
the  bhallas  which have been prepared  should
be soaked for atleast fifteen minutes in warm water 
""
as a result  all the oil is drained away into the warm water
""
and you don't get that taste of oil when you put it into the curds
""
""
then soak it in the curds  and allow it to stand for atleast
fifteen minutes  so that the curd penetrates into the  bhalla
 and softens them 
""
along with these it is always better to have   chutney
 
""
this is known as  khatti mithi chutney 
""
you prepare it out of  dates  that is  khajur
 and out of  tamarind water 
""
soak the tamarind for half an hour  squeeze it out  thick
liquid  add a little water  sugar  about half a spoon  little
salt  chilli powder  cumin powder and corriander powder to it 
""
mix it up beat it up well  so that all the ingredients 
form a thick  paste like substance
""
in the same way the dates are being soaked  the seeds they
have  the seeds are removed  and they are mashed with your hand  and
you they form an absolutely thick paste  and to that you may add or you
may not add a little salt and chilli powder and keep it aside  so that
when you serve the  bhallas   arrange them beautifully
into a dish  put a little curds over it  add a little   cha
  khatti mithi chutney   on the surface  and a
litlle fresh green corriander  and serve it to your guests
