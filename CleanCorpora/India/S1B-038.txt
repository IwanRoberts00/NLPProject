count down  to the ayodhya  climax is on 
""
and if you will stand  for a mixed  metaphor   the 
 everything is about to reach  a crescendo  in  the next 
four or five days
""
and we have  in this panel  uh  mr soli sorabjee  a
very well known lawyer  and  mr p upendra  member of parliament
""
i wish  we  to balance  the panel we also had somebody
 from the establishment  and  uh a member  from the bjp  that
could have probably  made for a more  more meaningful discussion 
""
but soli  why don't we get down to the the basic point  the
legal aspect of it 
""
uh the supreme court  has set certain things  uh just to 
to clarify things for the viewers  what is that the supreme court had said
 and what are the implication  of what it has said  ?
""
""
the supreme court has restrained  any construction activity
 on the site 
""
be it of a permanent nature  or a temporary nature 
""
the supreme court has also directed  that no construction
material or construction machinery should be brought at the sight 
""
at the same time  having regard to the religious sentiments of
the people 
""
having regards to the fact  the sculpture about the ram  the
supreme court has clarified that this restraint will not prevent  
karseva  in the form of singing of  bhajan   and
certain religious versions 
""
and that this part of the order the supreme court has emphasised
should be publicised and made clear to the  kar sevak  
""
so that norm of the highest court of the land has prohibited and
what it is  two words  
""
that is the net effect of the supreme court order as it is 
today in force
""
""
but even as you and i are talking  uh there is a matter
being before the supreme court now  just now    yes  and 
  which is  which which    which is   on what
basically focussing on that issue
""
""
 yes  
""
""
well the petition is there  i think  you  want to
know what contengency plan the state government has 
""
because assuming sincerity on the part of the state government 
and assuming that they mean when they give an undertaking  that they will
see that the mosque is not damaged  no construction activity takes place
""
""
but  the  both thing they are out of hand 
""
because after all  all depends upon how many  karsevak
 gather 
""
what sort of speeches are made by various leaders there  ?
""
suppose it leads to some kind of a frenzy or they result in a
situation  thereby the supreme court order cannot  be  comply 
one word  even despite the best efforts of the government 
""
then what are the plans the government has i think  that's 
the application which is being  argued at the movement 
""
 what're  the plans they have  ?
""
how do they want to prevent any damage to the  mosque
""
""
what is your reading mr upendra  because uh  kalyan
singh has  said various things on this on this issue  the chief
minister of u p  ?
""
uh  do you get a cacophony coming out of the  bjp
 camp  ?
""
or do you  do you see a co-herent line of action  being
outlined  ?
""
""
no there doesn't appear to be very co-herent line of action
 even among themselves 
""
uh different tones are being heard 
""
apparently there is a  difference of opinion also  among the
 leaders of the  bjp  vishva hindu parishad  bajrang dal
 and others  uh
""
""
as it is  that must be within the  congress
 camp also  i mean there must be difference of opinion
""
""
but more or less here the  issue is very clear that 
the mosque should be protected  and the  karseva  should
not be done in violation of the  court's  order 
""
this was  on this side the line of action is very clear
""
""
uhm 
""
""
but on the other side the matter has been  complicated
with the supreme courts effective intervention 
""
and probably now   the bjp  the vishva hindu
parishad the rss  and the  others  involved in this  are
in a fix to  decide what to do 
""
they can't abandoned the  karseva   straight away
""
""
and there has to be some action as announced by them 
""
because by announcing the  karseva   even before
the talks have ended  even before the final round of talks  are over
on the november eight 
""
i feel they have got themselve into trouble  inavoidable
trouble 
""
had they waited for the final round probably this situation would
have been avoided 
""
and today  a responsible particular leadership  i have
great respect for the leaders of the  bjp   who are no
doubt patriots 
""
they are very clear minded 
""
and the  bjp  the  major opposition party in
the parliament running four state governments 
""
for they can't turn down and say we don't uh  accept the courts
order
""
so  we'll  defy the court orders 
""
 that's  one predicament they are in 
""
at the same time they have to keep up their own mandate  of
building the temple  and going ahead with the construction 
""
""
so  they're  in a dilemma
""
""
yes just now 
""
and  two words 
""
""
dilemma  sorry   one word  go ahead
""
""
yeah
""
now it requires all the political sagacity on their part  to
get out of the situation  and uh i must say appreciate the  effective
intervention of the supreme court 
""
 they've  tried to save the situation both for the
government and the  the the other party 
""
and one should take advantage of this  position  and wriggle
out of this situation
""
i don't know how they will do it in the next few days 
""
""
do you agree with me that their intention now is to expand the
 the  the whole  uh arena of uh  shall we say contest  and now
mm mr advani is going to  start from  kashi  kashi vishvanath 
and i think  dr murali manohar joshi is starting  his  rath
yatra  from mathura  and they all converging  converging in uhm
 ayodhya on a certain date 
""
is this  do you think  they're  widening the area of
contention or  is this the only  uh diversionary move that they have
 ?
""
""
no they  they did a lot of explaining also  both for the
people and their cadres 
""
uh in fact all they have to accept the supreme court orders and
turn down the  uh contest and uh turn down the action 
""
they have to explain it to the people
""
probably that is the part of  is this part of  their
campaign probably these people  have   are going round the  from
the state 
""
but uh if you  analyse the situatiion in its entirety  two
years back when  mr  name  government fell  on this very same
issue 
""
the main issue was  how to protect the mosque  and today 
the   it has the  problem has been extended outside the mosque 
to the land acquired  by the u p  u p government  on which they want
to do the  karseva  
""
but the already problem has been now uh  extended  to outside
the this
""
""
 let's   one word  soli the other  other area
""
""
soli there is another case before the allahabad high court 
""
on the acquisition of the land  and the expectation was that a
judgement should come before the  dharam sansad  of the force
   uhm  and therefore the  one word  
""
but apparently  they  i they  have been  uh now they
are going to get the judgement only on the seventh 
""
  is is is that your    is that your  
understanding
""
""
 uhm  
""
""
well i don't know about fix case  but in their acquisition
proceeding  the acquisition proceedings have been challenged on the ground
that the land is not really acquired for a public purpose development of the
tourism
""
""
uhm uhm
""
""
 it's  challenged on the ground that it is for ulterior
purpose
""
but syeed what i want to  a
""
""
why did they arrange that
""
""
the fact is that  these orders are passed in interim
nations 
""
the allahabad high court has passed this order in it gives a
decision 
""
and  they've  been  one word  december  but it may
be soon thereafter 
""
so i don't see there should be any difficulty on the part of any
responsible political leader  in complying with the supreme court orders
which they do not construct till that time 
""
and in the mean time as upendrajee said there is a dilemma created
by their own  uh uh doings and action which very well they were very
respectable way of getting out of the dilemma  by complying with the
supreme  court's  order 
""
because supreme court has announced us  to its not its not
complete this of the  karseva  
""
the   karsevak's   aspirations also can be
fulfill  they don't feel frustrated  that they have it  will 
build up that they are going to  karseva 
""
okay have a  karseva  in a symbolic form 
""
held in this particular manner 
""
my uh problem is  that  why does i say we do not dump the
sincerity of any of the person  but suppose by their action or omissions
they allow a situation to be created  whereby the protection of the mosque
may become very difficult 
""
what i am trying to drive at is that there is still the
responsibility  on the part of the central government also to see that
the mosque is protected lest any untoward incident  may lead to unleashing
of passions and   argument 
""
""
 the state   the state government in fact has
complained  that  you've  been rushing in forces without taking the
state government into confidence
""
what is the constitutional position of that one ?
""
""
well that it is a debatable point
""
formally there was a provision in the constitution  i think it
was article two fifty-seven a  i may be mistaken i think it was that 
which authorise the deployment of military or other arm forces  in the
state 
""
now that has been deleted 
""
but at the same time there is another constitutional provision
which makes it the duty of the union to protect the state  against the
external aggression which is not here at all    uhm uhm  or
internal disturbance  that also  one word  will know internal
distrurbance or  to see that the government of the state is carried on in
accordance with the provisions of the constitution 
""
now one of the provisions of the constitution certainly is that the
order of highest court has to be respected 
""
if you do not respect the highest  court's  order  if you
flop the order of the supreme court then it is  very arguable that you are
not carrying on in accordance to the provisions of the constitution and that
may enable the central government to take the forces
""
but as i said i would not like to be dogmatic about it 
""
but  it's  not a question if i can say so syeed on
constitutional provision interpretation
""
""
 uhm uhm  
""
""
uhm uhm
""
""
the whole question is to see that the whole things are very
subject matter of the dispute if i may say so  is not damage or destroyed
when the decision is given 
""
""
right
""
""
no there is another point which i want to add here 
""
on this very point today the home minister made a clarification in
the  rajya sabha 
""
""
uhm uhm
""
""
he said that  the utter pradesh government was
informed of the  deployment of this additional forces in the state
 
""
 that's  why i don't think there is any scope for
controversy
""
""
no that mean   it is a    it's   
consent was not taken as a consent is necessary as  i've  said but
their  one or two words    really get great 
""
""
 but that    a few words   it's  not
uh  two words 
""
as far as that prior consent should be taken
""
the state government must be informed  central can move its
forces wherever it want it wants 
""
but deployment and usage must be with the consent of the state
government 
""
 that's  very clear 
""
""
now the other question which you in fact did not answer 
answer fully soli  that this act interim order  on the land acquisition
""
""
now supposing this the high court says  okay uh  it it
was  a  you did acquired the land for the right purposes and we agree
with you  
""
thereafter but  the purpose for which the land was acquired was
tourism  and religious tourism and so on and so forth
""
but if  taking advantage of that you go ahead and do 
karseva   then are you violating a court order even so  ?
""
""
you know    yeah  the question  is 
depends on the terms of the court order 
""
if the court order has restrained  construction activity 
  uhm uhm  till the decision is given then you violate the court
order if you do construction activity
""
""
 yeah  
""
""
 uhm uhm  
""
""
uhm
""
""
but syeed i think the crux of the matter is  and 
that's  another thing which i think we should all apply our minds to 
about why cannot the highest court  either by way of a reference or under
article one thirty-eight  by enlarging jurisdiction    uhm 
decide that the basic issue 
""
because now the controversy is narrowed 
""
now the issue is a historical fact  was there a temple  on
the site  ? 
""
 uhm  
""
""
uhm uhm
""
""
was the temple destroyed  ?
""
and has the mosque been built on that site after detroying the
temple  ?
""
because as far as  i'm  understood  the muslim
leadership has also accepted the position  that if it is established 
  uhm uhm  that there was a temple  and it was destroyed then the
mosque has no business to  be on that place 
""
""
 uhm uhm  
""
""
now  that's  an issue which is capable of judicial
determination 
""
i can't understand people saying court can't decide that  that
is something about religious 
""
we are not here trying to ask to determine the birth  place of
rama or whether he was there or not there nothing of the kind
""
just a historical fact  which can be established one way or the
other on the basis of evidence    and 
""
""
 now   if we go back on that point
""
 i if  last week i think it was that the whole debate
started
""
whether  one point reference can be made to the supreme court ?
""
