 music 
""
 music   this is the most essential factor in
the very existence of man 
""
but  what is music  ?
""
dictionary defines  music   as the art of
expression in sound  in harmony  and melody 
""
so music is not mere noise  it is a series of melodious and
harmonious sounds  very pleasing to the ear 
""
so  melodious and harmonious sounds  very pleasing to the ear
 make music 
""
these melodious sounds also have rhythm in it 
""
music must have been born  even before the language 
""
when man came into being on this earth  he must have heard many
melodious sounds around him   the rippling sound of water 
waves of sea  chirping of birds  rustling of leaves  
all these sweet sounds  probably gave him the knowledge of musical note
""
""
he must have later on given names to these musical notes 
""
every human being is born  with an ear for music  and loves
to sing  singing 
""
little children  illiterate adivasis  village women  and
all those who sing  but have never made a proper study of music  are
hardly aware  that the sweet melodious sounds that they are producing 
are composed of seven musical notes 
""
folk songs  devotional songs  film music  gazal 
thumri  classical music  even western music  all these different
types of music  are composed  of seven basic musical notes 
""
call them   do re mi pha so la ti   or
 sa re ga ma pa dha ni  
""
whether it is eastern music  or western music  these seven
musical notes  are universally accepted 
""
after the completion of these seven notes  the second octave
begins 
""
let us talk about indian music   sa  re  ga 
ma  pa  dha  ni   are basic seven notes  called
 shudha swaras  
""
there are five more notes  in between these basic notes 
called  komal  and  tivra  notes 
""
thus  all music  has these twelve basic notes 
""
let us take an example  of a very popular  but very simple
 bhajan  that every indian can sing   raghupati
raghav rajaram  
""
how many of us know  of what musical notes  this simple
 bhajan  is composed of  ?
""
let us see   bhajan 
""
let us hear the same tune  now on guitar   guitar being
played 
""
the same musical notes  are either vocally produced  or they
are played on the instrument  to produce the same tune 
""
it is indeed very interesting  to know who created these musical
notes 
""
about the origin of music  and the seven musical notes  there
are many stories  all different stories  in different countries 
different languages  and different religion 
""
hindus believe  that brahmadeva created music  gave this
art to shankar  who handed it over to saraswati  who is considered 
as the goddess of fine arts 
""
later  narad did penance  or  tapascharya  and
received the art of music from saraswati 
""
narad then taught music  to gandharvas  kinnaras and apsaras
""
""
bharatmuni  the great sage  is responsible for bringing music
on this earth 
""
even in the oldest of scriptures  we find the mention of music
""
""
according to one european story  this world was originally
created without music 
""
this world  was dry  drab and very uninteresting 
""
man and woman  were unhappy  and could not make love in this
atmosphere 
""
so god created  seven beautiful melodious musical notes  to
make this world  enchanting and lovable 
""
in arabian history  it is believed  that music originated 
from the bird  bulbul  
""
according to the african sage ifari  man and woman  were
bathing in a beautiful lake  and their movements in the water  created
lovely sweet sounds 
""
these melodious sounds created in the water  are the origin of
music 
""
well known musicologist rinsobols  also believed  that
musical notes  have originated  from melodious sounds  created in
the ripples of water 
""
the japanese scholar  shikoba  says in his book  that
music    is   has   originated in heaven  not on
this earth 
""
when man and woman were created by the god  they already had the
knowledge of music 
""
so music is always considered  to be divine 
""
the western scholar freud  always believed  that origin of
music  has its base  in the psychology of human being   sounds
""
""
the sounds uttered by the child   sounds  
crying  laughing  shouting   are learnt by the child
itself 
""
nobody teaches the child to cry  or to laugh 
""
similarly  the musical notes are created by the man himself 
when he was feeling happy and relaxed   sound 
""
another western historian says  that man has created music 
through his wisdom  and intelligence 
""
man has always been searching  different ways  to entice the
woman 
""
so  he has tried to attract her  by creating  different
sweet melodious sounds  and thus  music came into being 
""
well known indian scholar damodar pandit says  that the seven
notes of music  are created  by imitating the sounds of different birds
and animals 
""
the basic note  sa   is taken from peacock
  re   from chatak   ga  from
sheep   ma   from kraunch or crane   pa
  from  koel    dha  
from frog  and  ni   from elephant 
""
it is also believed  that as seven colours are emitted by
sunlight  so the seven musical notes  are emitted from  om
 
""
 om  is one letter word  containing three
letters   a  oo   and  ma 
""
""
these three letters  symbolise energy 
""
 a  symbolises creation  or creator brahma
  oo  symbolises  protector vishnu  and
 ma  symbolises  destroyer mahesh 
""
all these three energies together  form the trinity  or
trimurti parameshwar 
""
the basic original sound  used in vedas is  om
 
""
the vibration  produced by the correct utterance of this word
 om   are very very powerful  and the correct
utterance of  om   can awaken the latent energy of the
man 
""
the seven musical notes  emanate from this one letter word
 om  
""
and  the correct utterance  and repeatedly utterance of
 om  and the pursuit of  om   can
give the enlightenment of music 
""
in indian music  the seven musical notes are called  
shadaja  rishabha  gandhar  madhyam  pancham  dhaivat  and
nishad  
""
who gave these names  to these seven musical notes is really a
mystery 
""
 shadaja  means  creator of six notes 
""
the vocal singer  fixes  his basic note  sa
  according to the capacity of his vocal cords  and from this
basic  sa   he gives the ascent in ascending order 
the next six notes   re  ga  ma  pa  dha 
and  ni  
""
before fixing the position of the seven notes  one believed in
twenty-two  shrutis  
""
sounds  useful to create music  were first called 
shrutis  
""
from the twenty-two  shrutis  in one octave 
seven were chosen  and names were given to them 
""
 shadaja  madhyam  and  pancham 
 have four  shrutis  each   nishad  gandhar
 have two  shrutis  each 
""
 rishabha  and  dhaivata   have
three  shrutis  each 
""
during the vedic period  only three musical notes were used
 they were called   udaatta  anudaatta  and 
swaritta   or  prathama  dwitiya  and 
tritiya  
""
they were equivalent  to  gandhara  rishabha 
and  shadaja  
""
a little later  one more note  a little higher than these
notes  was used while chanting the vedas 
""
it was equivalent  to  madhyam  
""
later on  three more notes  equivalent to  pancham 
dhaivata  and  nishad  were added 
""
during  panini's  time  these seven  shudhha
 musical notes  were already accepted 
""
later on five more notes were added 
""
they were in between these seven notes 
""
no new names were given to them  but they were called 
 re komal  ga komal  ma tivra  dha komal  and 
ni komal  
""
thus  these twelve music notes  were accepted  and all
music is composed of these twelve musical notes 
""
they are little lower  or little higher than the  shuddha
 notes 
""
so today  we have these twelve basic musical notes 
""
music is normally composed of three octaves  each containing
twenty-two  shrutis  
""
the middle octave is called  madhya saptak   the
lower octave is called  mandra saptak   and the higher
octave is called  tivra saptak  
""
different permutations and combinations of these musical notes 
produce different moods  different  ragas   different
music  all very pleasing to the ear 
""
musical notes  are like flowers in a garden 
""
each flower has a different colour  different aroma 
different beauty  and different splendour 
""
each flower is beautiful 
""
one can choose different flowers from this garden of musical notes
 and form thousands of varieties of beautiful bouquets 
""
this music bestows upon the human mind  the heavenly bliss 
and creates a harmonious and peaceful atmosphere  for which the human
being strives  music
