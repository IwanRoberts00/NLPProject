in the last programme  we had seen  four basic consumer
rights  right to safety  right to information  right to choose
 and right to redressal  their concepts and connotations 
""
in this programme  we propose to concentrate  on 
consumers'  right to safety  which is the most paramount  of all
consumer rights 
""
now  when we think of consumer  safety  where wide range
of goods and services  to which  the consumers are exposed  in
relation to health hazard  or even for that matter  life and death 
""
take a small item  like detergents  and drinking water 
""
if the drinking water is not wholesome and potable  and free
from germs and bacteria  there are cases where  the people  run
into  cholera or gastroentitis  and succumb to death 
""
we had the situation last year in ahmedabad  where three hundred
and fifty people died  on that account 
""
take uh  detergent 
""
we do not realise but   it's  the poor or unsafe quality
of detergent  adversely affect  the human skin  and it also
affects  the life of the garment 
""
now  take the larger cases  of uh  aircrash  where all
the passengers flying by the plane  might die 
""
or take the  still worse  running out of the hazardous
chemical industry 
""
the  most known example could be  of the bhopal gas tragedy
 where three thousand five hundred people  are   report to 
 reported    to have been dead  because of  the leak of m
i s 
""
now therefore in this context  it becomes very relevant  as
to how the consumers  can  and should protect  both their health
 as well as life 
""
now  here  when we begin with the story  we should look
at some of the other items of domestic or day to day use 
""
take for example domestic gas cylinder 
""
there are cases where  the gas cylinders are exploded  and
resulting into  death of the house wives  and sometimes with even 
the babes in their arms 
""
take other areas   domestic electrical appliances
 
""
these are of day to day use  and there are cases of
electrocution  that because of some defect somewhere  person gets a
shock  and he gets killed 
""
now  take the other situations  where  uh the hazardous
chemicals are involved 
""
when  because of fire  explosion  leakage or spillage
 the people in the neighbourhood  so far the factories are concerned
""
""
or people travelling on the highway  when transportation of
hazardous chemicals is involved 
""
or people living in far away distances  where the hazardous
chemicals are stored  for marketing or distribution  and something goes
wrong 
""
or take another area  housing 
""
if the housing is not properly designed  and the construction or
 workmanship  are not of proper order  then they result into 
unsafe housing 
""
apart from the most obvious one  like the collapse of the house
 there are more subtle  forms of safety  like  from the  
  fl    from   the  uhm floors above you  if
the  water  or the fluid  from the sanitary blocks  latrines or
urinals begin to  uh drip  or begins to  uh percolate  then that
leads to a different kind of health hazard  arising out of dampness 
and arising out of  the discharge 
""
now  more obvious known cases of safety of housing happen to be
 one where  because of either the poor workmanship or a bad design 
where a part or whole of the house collapses  and as a result of which
large number of people  can die and do die 
""
and this kind of things we have to see even  more often in case
of public buildings  or public works like bridges  dams and things of
that kind 
""
so therefore the question that arises is  that if this is the
 manner in which  the consumers are exposed  so far as their health
 and safety are concerned  how does one go about it 
""
now one can talk of some measures that the consumers can take 
""
for example  if you are using a hair dye  you should ensure
to see that  the chemicals used therein  are not likely to cause
cancer 
""
or if you take the examples of domestic electrical appliances 
whether do they carry  i s i mark  given by  bureau of indian
standards in the country 
""
or  if you look at the detergents  whether they happen to be
of a good quality  and as a result of which  neither the skin  nor
the life of the garments are likely to be affected 
""
so  there are some areas where  the consumers themselves can
take care  in both ways  either in terms of the  following the
instructions  that are given  for the use of these products  or 
even before buying the products  one can take certain measures to see that
 they do not run into  unsafe goods 
""
there is another area of consumer safety  namely the
adulteration of food 
""
and there are cases reported time and again in the news papers 
where because of the food poisoning people tend to die  or run into far
more serious  physical ailments 
""
there are also very subtle kinds of cases  where  there are
some articles or some components in the food  to which certain people
might be alergic  and as a result of which  they tend to suffer a great
deal 
""
take another area  for example  medicine 
""
now ordinarily all of us understand  that medicine is supposed
to help us  in terms of the treatment from which we might suffer 
""
but there are  two kinds of serious problems with medicine 
""
take those medicines  which are available across the counter
 without  doctor's  prescription 
""
so in a sense  the patient  becomes a doctor  and 
when these medicines are purchased across the counter  the concern is 
how much information  the patient has  and is he able to take care 
when he uses those medicines as such 
""
you must have seen the reports of  couple of years back  when
because of the adulterated  or toxic substances in the glucose saline 
about fourteen children died  in bombay 
""
now  some of the medicines  across the counter which look
very innocent  they themselves can become  hazardous  in respect of
certain categories of patients like  children  pregnant women  or
aged people suffering from  blood pressure or heart trouble 
""
so therefore  uh even the medicine  which normally supposed
to help us  can cause this kind of health hazards  or the problems of
safety 
""
now let us take  some areas where  you are not able to
immediately connect  the use of the product or the existance of the
product with the safety 
""
take for example asbestos 
""
now the people who have been working in the asbestos factory 
there has been situations where  after five years of the retirement or ten
years of the retirement  the disease of asbestos comes on the surface 
and by that time they might have not only left the factory but they might
have left even the city where they were working  and might have gone to
their respective villages  and they are not able to connect  that this
particular  health hazard  has a reason because of their exposure 
to  the factory where they worked 
""
not only that  even the people who happen to come in contact
with the workers  they carry those fibres from them 
""
even  take the consumers for examples  where the asbestos 
material is used  either for insulation  partition  uh or 
roofing  or piping and all that  and in the course of time they
disintegrate and they affect the consumers as well 
""
and this is such a slow process  that it may take place after
six months after five years or fifteen years  and one is not able to
realise  the cause - effect relationship as such 
""
take another example  namely  the disposal of toxic waste or
disposal of uh  chemical effluents 
""
they might  take place in one city  and the effect  on the
 underground water  in the wells  or in the springs  might be
found thirty forty miles away  from the place where they were discharged
""
""
or  the toxic waste might have been dumped today  and may be
after fifteen years  some disintegration takes place  and the ground
water gets affected 
""
so therefore  you can see now from the various examples and 
kinds of situations that i have described  that the area of consumer
safety is so wide and so large  that one has to be extremely careful or
cautious  in ones own life 
""
now  there obviously will be a question  that all this is
fine  but what can be done 
""
now there are number of things that can be done and one can only
illustrate  as to how far you can succeed in getting things done 
""
say for example  take domestic electrical appliances and some
of the items that we use  in our homes day to day 
""
because of the public opinion pressure  ultimately  the
government of india came forward  and they not only made  the i s i
standards  compulsory  uh i s i standards mandatory  for these
domestic electrical appliances  but now in respect of some items for the
country as a whole  even the certification  by i s i  now called b i
s  has been made compulsory  and those items happen to be  like 
these electric irons  emersion heaters  radiators uh  then take 
a   the switches  two pin and three pin plugs 
""
now those about eight items  for which    no  
 not   only the b i s standards are mandatory  but even
certification  has been made compulsory  which means that  unless
these items carry i s i certification mark  they cannot be sold in the
country 
""
now at least one thing  that i s i certification assures you is
 that  if the certification is done rightly  at least they are safe
products 
""
they may or may not be of extraordinarily high quality  but
certainly they give you an assurance  that they are the safe products 
""
if by chance  some manufacturer  though he is carrying an i s
i mark  but those products don't confirm to i s i standard  then his
liability becomes much bigger 
""
and in any case  bureau of indian standards  helps you in
respect of dealing with that kind of situation  either in terms of
replacement of goods or any other remedy that may become available 
""
uh in case of gujarat  the state has gone even a step further
 that all those faulty electrical appliances  for which  i s i
standards were made mandatory  way back in nineteen seventy-six and
further amended in nineteen eighty-one  all those appliances now  are
required to carry an i s i certification mark  before they are being sold
or marketed  marketed in gujarat 
""
uh  one option is given  that either they carry i s i
certification mark  or they carry a certification mark  provided by
chief electrical engineer 
""
so this is one measure  where the consumers can feel reassured
that if they use the i s i certificated marks  electrical goods in the
home  or appliances in the home  they may  be reasonably safe 
""
another example that i want to you give is very interesting one 
uh but is a foreign one  where again it deals with the drugs 
""
this happened  in united states and particularly in the state of
california 
""
uh somewhere around nineteen seventy-one  or meaning around that
decade  a drug was introduced in the market  uh in the short words it
was called des d e s  and its full name is  dyfile  solbitrol 
""
now this particular brand of medicine  was introduced in the
market  to help pregnant women  to avoid miscarriage or abortion 
""
the drug was found to be effective  so far as prevention of
miscarriage  or abortion was concerned 
""
but  it had an unusual kind of  an  fact  not on the
pregnant women who took the medicine  but of the daughters  born of
those pregnancies  and that too after the daughters  reached the age
of puberty  between fourteen and eighteen 
""
and those daughters were found to suffer from cancer  and an
interesting question of law arose  that whether these daughters  born
of these pregnancies  have a remedy against  the pharmaceutical
companies 
""
you can imagine the difficulty involved  that the daughters who
are the victims    are not   are not   the consumers
of the medicine 
""
and their mothers had consumed this medicine  before fifteen
twenty years  when they were  in their mothers wombs 
""
and the matter went to the    califor   
california    state supreme court  and the court found a
solution to this problem  since this medicine  des  was
manufactured and marketed  by a large number of pharamceutical companies
 so what the court did was  that court asserting  the total sale of
the medicine  and in this way total  market for this medicine  how
much was the share  or the market share  of each of this particular
products by each of the pharmaceutical companies  and depending upon the
market share  of the pharmaceutical company for this particular drug 
during seventies  the court awarded  a total damage  let us say may
be  a million dollars or half a million dollars 
""
and and then  the court said  on the principles of
apportionment  linked with the market share  as to how much money shall
be paid  by each of the pharmaceutical company  to these daughters who
had suffered from cancer because of  the adverse effect of this medicine
""
""
as for a statistical information i can tell you  that there are
about one thousand such suits  filed in  the u s courts 
""
now of course this particular drug has been withdrawn from the
market 
""
so what one would like to look at  or look back and see  that
there are preventive measures  which can be taken by the consumers and or
the authorities concerned  at the same time  in the  unfortunate
event  of loss or injury sustained by the consumers  there are remedies
available 
""
and  american example goes to a large extreme  or a large
unusual kind of condition  where  one is not able to prove  the
cause effect relationship  between the particular product  and its
consequence and yet  the victims were able to recover  substantial
amount of damages from the pharmaceutical companies 
""
let us now come to the indian scene 
""
if on account of  use or consumption  of any unsafe goods or
 unsafe services  of which i gave a number of illustrations or examples
""
""
if the consumer  suffers loss or injury  what remedies are
available to him  ?
""
under the consumer protection act  of nineteen eighty-six 
three tier  quasi judicial machinery is being set up  consumer
grievence  disputes  redressal district forum  state commission and
national commission 
""
now if the consumer is able to prove  that  the loss or
injury  suffered by him on account of unsafe goods or unsafe services 
was on account of  the negligence  of the people who provided the
goods or services  the consumer will be able to claim  damages  in
respect of loss or injuries suffered by him 
""
so therefore  this new machinery  not only provide the remedy
 but that remedy is likely to be  most inexpensive  and least time
consumings  because they are starting on a clean slate  and they are
specialised tribunals
