""
""
 accha  this  uh did you convey that message
about  tin oxide ?
""
""
yeah i have conveyed to them 
""
""
ah
""
""
now  the fifty k g might be a problem
""
they are saying  uh take hundred because for  from the point
of view of packing and  transporting    ah  they are saying
take hundred  k g's  
""
""
 ah  
""
""
but hundred 
""
""
can i ask them for airfreight hundred  k g's   ?
""
""
hundred k g is too big quantity you now 
""
""
ah   that's  what they are saying    ah 
 i've  sent them a telex again
""
""
 ah  
""
""
yeah 
""
""
to see what they are  why they are saying that 
""
""
no but then i can do one thing
""
""
ahn 
""
""
if  you can ask them to  uh uh pay for the advance
""
""
ahn 
""
""
i can also arrange the advance 
""
""
 nahi nahi  they are not talking about money
""
""
uhm 
""
""
they are not talking about money
""
""
yeah 
""
""
they are only saying 
""
""
 haan  
""
""
fifty  k g's  will be  hundred  k g's  will
be economical 
""
""
 haan  
""
""
fifty  k g's  will not be economical 
""
""
no for air freight  fifty k g is okay for us
""
""
 haan  no  for you it is okay
""
""
yeah
""
""
but there is some other implication there    
haan   which might increase the cost  that is what i am worried
""
""
""
  haan   
""
""
no but let them  specify that no ?
""
""
 haan 
""
""
why there should be increase  ?
""
""
 haan  
""
""
why there should be an increase
""
""
no  i've  asked them why  ?
""
""
yeah 
""
""
so let them tell us  uh i mean i got the message
""
""
but i remember last time also they have airshipped fifty k g
""
""
""
no no no that was the first time sometime back
""
""
yeah 
""
""
when they first started 
""
""
but they can also help us     nahi nahi
  second time
""
""
  nahi nahi   
""
""
 nahi nahi   it's  not the question of
helping 
""
""
yeah
""
""
they should do it 
""
""
yeah
""
""
unless they have specific problem
""
""
 haan haan 
""
""
which i have asked them to spell out
""
""
uhm uhm 
""
""
 haan 
""
""
ah 
""
""
but in which case you know they what they say whether it is
fifty k g or hundred k g     haan   it will be
they will be able to air freight by the end of the next week
""
""
  haan   
""
""
oh but then what is the use  ?
""
""
ah 
""
""
you see by  by end of this month   i'll i'll  get
the consignmnet 
""
""
yeah by the end of
""
""
see my worry is    ahn  that between uh  end
of this month and  uh second week of  uh uh what is that uh january 
  ahn   i'll  have problems 
""
""
 ahn  
""
""
 ahn  
""
""
 nahi  what  i'm  saying   
yeah  if the air freight is end of next week
""
""
 yeah  
""
""
 haan 
""
""
air freight it takes about three days  na   ?
""
""
but it takes about ten days for clearance 
""
""
is that ?
""
""
yeah
""
""
 haan haan 
""
""
so now you see  they have to immediately ship  fifty k g
""
""
""
immediately they say  it's  not possible
""
""
 haan 
""
""
see they can  uh earliest they can dispatch before the 
end of next week 
""
""
end of next week is too long
""
""
 haan  
""
""
so can you please ask them that  you can also represent our
problem no ?
""
""
 nahi nahi   i've  already represented
 i'm  saying it is an additional requirement
""
""
 haan  
""
""
it is because  as as of the time  that'll  be taken
for the two fifty  k g's  to be received by them
""
""
yeah
""
""
they want fifty k g urgently 
""
""
but why at all they have shipped so late  ?
""
""
ahn 
""
""
why at all  they've  shipped so late  ?
""
see when the l c was open    ahn  during uh first week
of november
""
""
 ahn  
""
""
ahn
""
""
they have shipped by end of  uh uh november
""
""
 haan  
""
""
so that has caused the whole problem
""
""
yeah yeah 
""
but even l c must  was not the first week of november sir
""
""
yeah 
""
""
any way that there is no point in my arguing with you
""
""
yeah 
""
""
but the thing is this now they say by end of next week 
 is 
""
""
 but   i  i firmly believe that if you convince
them on phone     haan   they will definitely ship
fifty k g
""
""
  haan   
""
""
 nahi nahi nahi  you see the point is
""
""
 haan  
""
""
uh this the material may not be available readily
""
""
 haan 
""
""
fifty  k g's  or hundred  k g's  
""
""
 haan  
""
""
so they have to make it and then send it
""
""
 haan 
""
""
so that is why  they've  said next week   
but 
""
""
 any   way  they've  to manifacture it now
 <[   > we're  their regular customers 
""
""
 any way  i've     i've  no  i
don't want to delay any further
""
""
yeah 
""
""
suppose they say next week should i ask them to go ahead ?
""
""
yeah  you ask them to go ahead
""
""
 haan   but hundred  k g's  you
don't want  ?
""
""
no hundred  k g's 
""
""
but fifty  k g's  there might be some price
implications  i'm  trying to verify why 
""
""
see that is all negligible 
""
""
no any way  i'll  come back to you 
""
""
ah
""
""
ah
""
""
ah 
""
""
okay 
""
""
but it is  you've  to act very fast 
""
""
no no i can't act faster than what i am doing now
""
""
ah 
""
""
but only thing is  you uh as soon as i get the 
clarification for the price    yeah   i'll  ring you up
""
""
 yeah  
""
""
okay
""
""
then you will have to comfirm to me yes or no 
""
""
okay 
""
""
okay 
""
""
thank you very much
""
""

""
""
""

""
""

indemnity bond and hundred  rupees  stamp paper
""
""
 ahn  
""
""
ah ha
""
""
so that he can get a fresh cheque
""
""
why not we do one thing

instructions to their bankers    ahn  that this cheque has been
lost by  in transit
""
""
 yeah  
""
""
 ahn  
""

bond to be kept in their file 
""
""
 ahn  
""
""
 accha   but then then why it is to 
whomsoever it may concern why not in the directly in the favour of  
 b h e l

   issued by the  bharat electricals limited
""
""
 yeah  
""
""

""
""

""
""
instead of that we should address it  directly to the
bharat electricals
""
""

any indemnity bonds for any government customers
""
""
 ahn ahn

""
""
 haan haan ha  
""
""
and lending to  telco  
""
""
yeah 
""
""
you know because  telco  doesn't take
below one  crore 
""
""
 accha  
""
""
they are inter-related
""
""
so  they're  making a pool and lending   to
telco 
""
""
 yeah  they're    making a pool
""
""
is it like that
""
""
yeah   laughter 
""
and  they're  doing pool cost to cost you know
""
""
 haan haan ha  
""
""
the point one percent you know 
""
""
ah ha ha   accha   second thing 
""
""
yeah
""
""
this nagendrarao of  apple
""
""

""
""

""
""
 haan haan  
""
""
for the same matter 
""
""
yeah
""
""
and i told him
""
""
you refuses  na  
""
""
i i told him point blankly
""
""
very good
""
""
that  that will not be possible
""
""
yeah 
""
""
this is something like a  badla chahi ye  
laughter  uhn  so  in that case    yeah  if at all 
 he's  asking me the  exchange of some securities
""
""
 yeah  
""
""
yeah yeah
""
""
i i i told him that better we  we'll  settle the
account 
""
""
correct correct
""
""
uh 
""
""
so immature  jaisa  act  kare na
""
""
""
correct corect 
""
""
even this phono office no  how much  i've  to call
for this commission
""
""
ah ha ha  yeah  uh  so
""
""
i told him very point blank that if you don't give the
commission    accha   i'm  going to tell
 elpro  not to give you money again 
""
""
  accha   
""
""
is it  uh nagendrarao talked to you  ?
""
""
no 
""
""
 accha  
""
""
why he told you like that  ?
""
""
uh no nothing like that    but i thought that 
whether he has contacted me directly or  through you    oh  or
 he has at least kept you inform something like that
""
""
 he also lied  
""
""
 oh  
""
""
 nahi nahi nahi  in these cases street smart
you know 
""
""
ha ha ha 
""
""
that  you know about it
""
""
ha ha ha  laughs 
""
""
these  sindhi types 
""
""
 accha  
""
""
you know what he thinks  one word  
""
""
ha ha ha
""
""
i told him that you will not exchange securities
""
""
ha ha
""
""
he thinks  i'm  lying 
""
""
 nahi nahi nahi  infact he was totally under
the impression that if he talks to me he can convinced and he can okay the
deal 
""
something like that 
""
""
okay  he's  a big shot  kya  
laughter 
""
""
no no last  last time also    uhn  uh there
was a little bit resistance in the beginnig
""
""
 uhn  
""
""
yeah
""
""
and at least then we also thought that okay we will have also
to keep the relations
""
""
yeah 
""
""
and
""
""
whom did you exchange last time
""
""
uhn  ?
""
""
you really
""
""
no last time we exchanged  na  
""
""
yeah 
""
""
yeah yeah 
""
""
 accha  
""
""
we exchanged last time  and last time then he reimbursed
us   tisco  some  securities    uhm  in
exchange of   auto light  
""
""
 uhm  
""
""
 arre  you gave him  kya  ?
""
""
 nahi ye to   that time we gave it
""
""
 accha  
""
""
uh but with the clearcut understanding    ahn ahn
 that this type of deal will not be entertained in future
""
""
 ahn ahn  
""
""
 accha accha  
""
""
so  whenever  you'll  be dealing in the securities
please bear in mind    yeah  and how come your securities
department is not aware that some securities are  uh pledged   
 wohi    wohi haan  pledged with some other
person  and will not be available for selling till this particular dates
   correct  and they are freely  entering into any sort of
deal    yeah  and then asking us  to exchange some
securities 
""
""
 yeah  
""
""
  wohi   
""
""
 correct  
""
""
 yeah  
""
""
these guys  i'm  telling you 
""
""
ah
""
""
very poorly managed
""
""
ah ha ha 
""
now now also he is telling me like that only  that if you
insist on settling the account we can even settle the account
""
""
 haan 
""
""
 lekin apko  interest  dena hai to
muzhe kuch kamana bhi hai  to   with that one  i'm 
requesting you that you please release this one  karke 
""
""
 nahi nahi  i didn't follow   one word
 again 
""
""
uh he says that   now when   i'm 
borrowing from you    yeah   i've  to earn also
something    uhm uhm  and with that one  uh this particular
deal  is giving me some good amount of profit    ah 
""
so  if at all you are exchanging these securities   i'll
 be  uh good in the market  otherwise i will have to  go back
on my words  
""
""
 yeah  
""
""
 uhm uhm  
""
""
 ah  
""
""
tell him to go back   laughter 
""
these guys are all these all   natak haan 
""
""
ha ha ha 
""
""
 he's  used the money for bill discounting 
""
""
ha ha ha 
""
""
not for uh  this thing 
""
""
correct correct 
""
""
so  you tell him not to give the money 
""
""
correct
""
""
 two words 
""
""
let us see
""
""
uhn 
""
""
perhaps
""
""
anyway now he is acting smart because it is already due
 na  
""
""
 accha accha accha  
""
""
 ekvees ko  due  hai na 
""
""
ha ha ha 
""
perhaps this vivek chaubal     haan  
or  nagendrarao     haan   some uh 
somebody from these two  they will contact you    yeah 
 to  
""
""
  haan   
""
""
  haan   
""
""
 yeah  
""
""
 i'm  putting my foot down
""
""
correct corect correct 
""
""
you know what they are thinking is that   i'm 
refusing without asking to  elpro  
""
""
 haan haan haan 
""
""
because you know sort of i  they think that i don't want
to  exert and go to  elpro and company 
""
""
 haan haan haan  
""
""
i told him this  see   professional company nobody
 will do
""
""
 this this this  
""
""
this type of things are strictly business deal
""
""
yeah
""
""
how can they are even  i would have thought it twice even
before to request
""
""
yeah   laughter 
""
no another thing  i'll  tell you no some banks exchange
securities
""
""
 haan haan 
""
""
but if they exchange they charge them for it
""
""
yeah yeah
""
""
you know like  supposing i take and overdraft from  
let's  say  city bank  
""
""

""
""
and uh  for every certificate that i exchange they charge
some five hundred  rupees  
""
""

""
""
uh ha 
""
""

""
""

commented any thing but i have given my indication that this is virtually
impossible
""
""
yeah
""
""
but i will open up  just a topic as a sort of formality
with r k mehta

""
 chalega  
""
""
okay if at all he thinks that okay   we've  to keep
the relations and  we've  to think otherwise 
""
""
yeah
""
""
okay  then why why i should be  bad in their eyes 
laughs 
""
""

""
""

""
""
 yeah posing for the  one or two words  
""
""
