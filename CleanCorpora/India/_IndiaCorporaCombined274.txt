  graham greene recently celebrated his eighty-fifth birthday  he can now look back on a career in writing which has covered over sixty years  this programme pays homage to graham greene whom many critics regard as the finest author never to have won the nobel prize for literature  in order to understand what a writer or a poet is about  it is most important to know something about his background and his life  graham greene was born on the second of october nineteen hundred and four at birkamstate  uh his father was the headmaster of birkamstate school and that is where graham greene did his earlier education  he won a scholarship to go to belliol college oxford  and it was at oxford that he first started writing  uh his first work was a collection of poems called  babling april  soon after he left belliol he converted to catholicism  married a catholic lady  the marriage wasn't very successful and it ended in a divorce uh greene went through a very long period of extreme depression he continued writing  he wrote three novels none of them which he rated very high and although they were published he later disclaimed having done them and refused to allow them to be reprinted  he worked for a time in the times of london  and the spectator and did a lot of journalism and then he began his travels  he travelled extensively  he is one of the most widely travelled authors uh in the world today  uh he went specifically to look for material for his books  he stayed a long time got to know the people and got whatever he wanted for his novels  uh his first successful book only in terms of uh sales was  istanbul train uh based on the orient express  it wasn't very uh outstanding but it gave him a break he got recognised and was taken a little more seriously then he had been with his first three novels  then followed a veritable flood of books and of all kinds  books of poetry books of travel adventure detective stories essays  childern's books you name them and graham greene was writing them  uh it really in the sheer output it is hard to find anyone who did such a vast range of writing  therefore it is really very difficult to put any kind of lable on him because he wrote on just every single topic that even you can think of  however uh three or four of his books were really taken very seriously and uh one can see in those uh novels uh particularly the ones i will mention later were some kind of his philosophy of life comes through  now what kind of uh belief did graham greene have ? as i said before he is a catholic but in politics he was pretty close to being a communist  he is an extremely extreme leftist uh knew and admired people like fidel castro of cuba  uh he was denied a passport uh a visa to the united states because of his leftists leanings  it was again very wrong to try and lable him even in politics  he is convinced in his writings that you cannot really make black and white decisions or black and white distinctions there is a vast grey area uh which really has more truth in it  in his first volume of his autobiography called a sort of life which he uh wrote in nineteen seventy-one  he talks of what he calls an epigraph to his earlier novels and quotes bishop bagrum's apology and goes something like this our interests are on the dangerous edge of things our interest are on the dangerous edge of things the honest thief the tender murderer the superstitious atheist  now you can see the contradiction in terms here  and in the second volume he makes it even clear the second volume being known as the ways of escape   he talks of the appalling strangeness of the mercy of god  so you can see that there was no distinct line between right and wrong goodness and badness  while i was looking through uh uh notes making  preparing on graham greene to talk about him i was struck by a strange coincidence that he was born on the second of october which also happens to be mahatma gandhi's birthday  uh i don't believe in astrology but i was very curious to know  if there was anything in common between these two men as is maintained by astrologers that people born under the same combination of stars have similar careers  now obviously there wasn't really a to the outword eye very much in common  uh gandhi was a devout hindu a pacifist who only wrote because he wanted to convey his message  greeen on the other hand was an englishman a catholic and his primary interest was writing not a mission that he like gandhi had but there was one thing very common between the two  both were deeply concerned with the lowest of the lowly   gandhiji's interest was with harijans  landless peasantry and those who had been indiscriminated against in  his own country  he didn't bother about rest of the world very much  he travelled very little apart from his studies in england and this couple of years he spent in south africa as a lawyer and then once as the member of the round table conference this uh  representing the congress party all his travel was rest of his travel was in india  graham greene hardly ever lived in england his native country and he was travelling all the time  but while gandhiji looked to the poor in his country graham greene was most concerned with drop outs in of society in all parts of the world  his main characters are uh thieves robbers uh drug-pedlars the scum of society  now the other thing uh where the two have some kind of contrast gandhiji believed in the innate goodness of man  he believed that there is something fundamentally good in every person and if it appealed to uh the man could be changed completely now greene was not so naive  he does not believe in the innate goodness of man he believed that something good in the worst of us and something bad in the best of us  and he was closer to the reality  third thing which uh is of interest is that uh both were concerned with the struggle between good and evil uh the eternal battle between right and wrong  gandhiji uh being devoutly religious uh belief  believed that ultimately goodness always triumphs over evil   satyamev jayate  now again greene was not so naive to believe that uh the good always triumphs over bad that uh truthfulness always scored  over evil because he saw that many times people good people suffered and evil people prospered  uh i think these were the things that i think one should bear in mind when comparing the careers of these two people  now i come to some of his books to illustrate  i think the three best known uh and most seriously taken by critics are brighten rock is one and  power and the glory is another one and heart of the matter is the third i think they are the three most outstanding works of graham greene now brighten rock concerns itself with the career of a young delinquent a catholic pinky his one ambition in life is to get the better of olioni a bigger racketier who has made a lot of money  uh pinky has a catholic girl friend called rose  he is a drunkard he is a violent man  and in the process of trying to become the leader of the gang  he kills an innocent journalist  then he picks up the young protestant girl ida and they have an affair for a long time and ida ultimately really brings him to justice and he is taken arrested  here you see although greene was a catholic and his main character pinky is a catholic uh the person who betrays him but for the goodness for the right cause so that justice is done is a girl of loose morals a protestant girl called ida  you see this even in more uh clarity in the what i think is probably is very best novel the power and the glory this is set in mexico at the time of uh severe persecution by the state of the catholic church uh the police were hunting  for uh catholic priests murdering them bringing them putting them in jails  and here we have two characters uh catholic priest one is a drunkard uh he has a mistress he sired a bastard child through her  the other has taken a vow of chastity and yet gone and got married so both in that sense have defied with the basic tenets of catholicism  and they are on the run from the police  this priest who has uh sired a bastard child and is drunkard is successfully getting out of the country in just as he is coming close to the border and to freedom he gets a message that a poor peasant catholic person is dying and he would like his last sacraments to be performed  he takes the risk of turning back to go and perform the last sacraments is caught and executed uh by a police man who is also a good man but he wants to do justice  here you see the mixture of characters uh catholic priest drunkard uh siring illegitimate children and yet when it comes to the final test atleast giving up his life and becoming a martyr  and the third novel uh heart of the matter   it is set in west africa  here we have a character uh deputy commissioner of police uh scobie who is a good upright man  uh he has a rather eccentric wife louise who dabbles in writing uh he has a lady friend a young widow called helen  and it is going on alright till slowly he begins to uh get caught in a whole plot where a innocent journalist is murdered and scobie in trying to investigate is uh laid up wrong making wrong decisions and ends his life ultimately in suicide  uh scobie also is a catholic and suicide is a sin by the catholic church  and here once again clearly you see the dichotomy the conflict between good and evil between belief faith and uh reason and the way greene mixes these characters is absolutely masterly  graham greene undoubtedly is the most famous and highly respected english writer  in nineteen eighty-six he was appointed to the order of merit  in nineteen eighty-eight he received the british film institute award for his services to the cinema that he has not yet been awarded the nobel prize for literature is a puzzle to most people outside the british academy  people have asked why hasn't he been given the nobel prize for literature the greatest award ? well the answer i think is pretty simple  uh greene is essentially a story teller in the mau  somerset maugham's tradition  uh not one of his description really rises above straight writing  he hasn't got the turn up phrase  he is really a master craftsman only in as much that his writing is very constricted and there are no spare words that he uses  nothing embellished  and perhaps the people who decide on these things are more impressive with smart writing turn up phrase memorable description  or sometime the philosophy  as far as philosophy is concerned graham greene is far too subtle uh for people of who form the decision making body of the nobel prize committee
