yeah september and october we enjoy a lot uhm but summers are june and may and june it's really horrible because the temperatures shoot up nearly to fifty  degrees  so it is just the opposite  one word   ah  just the opposite exactly even in winters it's so very much cold in pilani no and summers are so hot temperature goes to nearly fifty winters temperature go in minus again because it's

association  close by  yeah yeah yeah   there's no differance as such you know oh yeah and we have different festivals of christians festivals and hindus festival in which we take part you know yeah you take part   you don't feel that differenc here they take part in our functions uhm our festivals and we take in theirs what i know you no   uhm   what are the festivals  ours christmas easter new year  these are the three main uhm so they all come and celebrate yeah we have holidays for our fe festivals and for their festivals also we have holidays oh i see our government is not showing difference like that okay yeah that is one thing is nice  uh and then their festivals like ganesh   chaturthi and   chaturthi yeah and then  uh diwali diwali yeah holi do you have yeah holi also we have uh  so you like holi yeah of course why not   you play  not much but i enjoy laughs looking at them  and what about and diwali  and  diwali also  they invite us and all no and we go to their place even if we don't go to their places they make it a point to get the sweets in the school or wherever it is otherwise they'll pack it and they will give you yeah  do you one word   uhm  yeah that's two words  they used to yeah  distribute them  and uh all illuminations and all everything is there yeah yeah yeah light lamp everything yeah yeah yeah it looks beautiful beautiful yeah specially in the cities if you go no uhm you can really have fun  uhm  and what do you do on your festivals  yeah i know we are having uh uh different clubs like uh uh town-wise or village-wise and each club is organising dances beach shows and all you know  uhm  uhm so you can have your choice otherwise even on the accha yeah we are having different beaches and all no people go on the beaches and they enjoy  accha  uh like we have have cer  we don't remain in the houses yeah yeah and houses no yeah we have pooja  and all these kind of things  yeah  ah we do all that and then you go to church or any other yeah after prayer home yeah we go the church and all mass uhm and then after that we go for discos and enjoy   uhm   go and enjoy  religious part is first and then the other things laughs yes for us no what happens is first of all we have to do all the pooja and all yeah that is religious you have to do that first yeah haan and i think that is that occupies our most of the time  haan  ahm particularly in diwali days they have to do laxmi pooja and all that uhm there so so really if you started seven till nine pooja  and decoration and everything that you must do previous day na  no previous day we never do no because the decoration and all  same day you all do i think uh because no no in goa we play we do the preparations much in advance not on the same day   what happens that we have probably because people are now in service no so they can't do uh before hand so only the day of diwali and all we we don't get so many holidays in between no one or two days  we have major holidays in winters and summer because of extreme climates  uh  like for example we have uh holidays for christmas no   uhm  ten days we have  you know we divide the days  uhm  uhm cleaning of the house or decoration of the house   oh yes making sweets and then for the tailor day uhm everything we do like this systematically and see that you are very much free on that day uhm festival day  uhm like that yeah  oh yes   uhm   uhm   uhm  for us no we get two days on uh diwali one diwali day and the next day same must one or two words holi diwa  holiday and next day uh  otherwise we don't get any  so one day that very day you get holiday so whole day cleaning up and everything then preparing sweets  uhm  okay how you will prepare the sweets means only your family members prepare take part in your preparation uh or some neighbours come to no help  uh   no  we make ours neighbour makes theirs and now a days uh most of the people going in for buying sweets yes by readymade  yes  even that is the style now so do you think all a few words   a few words  yeah that's the problem life is now becoming too much very busy and  very  yeah that's right earlier too my mother used to make everything at home she never bought anything from out now it is not possible yeah because you know every one is working   yeah   accha  okay tell me something about your school where you go and uh okay my school no is very far from my uhm  place i have to get up early in the morning uhm and by six i have to be on the bus stand  and then three four buses i have to change  it's very you know oh tiresome journey  and by the time i reach to school uhm you know what  i'll be and then after when the school gets over also after coming from that also i reach very late uh uh by four  o'clock like that  you must not be facing that problem you must be staying somewhere close  uhm   uhm   yeah   oh   uhm   uh uh  yeah in pilani we have a campus  small campus and everthing is very much closely packed there  uhm like so everything is so organised no that everything comes within that area nearly in two kilometers area whole campus has been made  uhm   everything is there   haan so one word  and uhm everything is close by you just go to our institute we have to go either we go walking or we have bicycle so nice it is yeah very nice we can't do that because you know mine is government school no yeah so even if i have to ask transfer i have to ask transfer in uh government school uhm private schools are there many yeah but uh they are of no use for me because i can't take transfer in the government school in the private school yeah i have to take in the government school because  uhm it is government school  uhm  so it will take some time uhm transfer and all  uhm  yeah and government schools i think are better than private schools that's what atleast everyone says right they say but in goa they have different view  laughs  their opinion is different oh yes it means uh in north india atleast uh because for studying point of view i think private schools are better but uh it depends everything on the headmaster you know if the head is good everything is good yeah that is there because if the headmaster or the principal is very lenient then the teachers are also uh uhm very lenient they do what they want and then naturally it affects the students  uhm  yes so if he is good then i think everything goes smooth  so your headmaster's like ah he's very nice to me  uhm very nice  in our pilani no  it's a private institution  uh but uh uhm and nothing is so much controlled by our director director we have director yeah  even we have in goa two or three words  so teachers it depends lot on teacher how how he  handles his class and all  so we have particular hours allotted to us  manages  we have to go there  finally okay everything is regulated by the director and all the staff authorities but we have so much uh like consciousness   yeah means we have to do good we have to produce good results because finally it reflects by on us that's no how you were teaching  yeah   yeah yeah  yeah but sometimes i feel that in schools that kind of uh  mentality is not see i will tell you you are teaching in the school is better  i'm sorry uh teaching in the college is better than uhm the school because in school there's lot of responsibilites are there  uhm  yeah in the in the college i think there is not much responsibility as such responsibilities like in the sense see you have to do your duty well teach and go like uhm okay prepare or teach and go but in the school what happens you have to see that these students learn uhm otherwise the headmaster will pounce on you uhm however that the parents also come and complain  yeah you can't teach in your own ways you know like you know if they don't know you should tell everything in english they don't understand you have to use mother tongue uhm and if you use mother tongue uh they they understand but the thing is that your language english language is going down you get used to that language you know  uh  uh so because of that way lot of you know difference  i don't like to teach in school i prefer in the college only uhn
