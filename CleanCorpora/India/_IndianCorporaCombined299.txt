 first read the abstract of the paper  titled development of grammar in animal communication systems  and in pidgins  this paper comprises three sections section one and two deal with animal communication systems and  section three with human communication systems  to study animal communication system the washoe project in which a chimpanzee learnt american sign language and the lana project in which a chimpanzee learns rudimentary language-type systems are described  the studies prove conclusively that chimpanzee separated from humans by a mere genetic whisker are unable to grasp syntax  the combination of a finite number of signs in an infinite number of new way  it separates language from other forms of communication  such as vocalisation facial expression gestures which are all paralinguistics features  specifically till date we have no evidence of any animal  spontaneously evolving true language without anybody to teach it  the only animal who does this is man  the focus in section three is on human communication systems  specifically how communication takes place among speakers of pidgin languages  theories which have been propounded to explain the origins of language are explored as the single mutation theory  the innate propensity theory the social pressure or need theory and the contact theory as they have specific relevance to pidgins a dozen examples of vendor's english  domestic's english and shipee english  subsumed under the conventional title of butler english an english pidgin spoken in india for over a century  recorded from nineteen eighty-two to nineteen ninety-two are listed they reveal modest language competence in pidgin speakers  at the levels of morphology syntax and lexico-semantics  extracts from tay boi a french pidgin spoken in vietnam are listed  similarities between it and butler english  and english pidgin can be deduced  this gives credibility to the claim that all pidgins are similar should refer to the innate propensity theory   as they are forged in condition where the premium is on transmitting facts withour frills it should refer to the social pressure or need theory and the contact theory  similarities between the chimpanzee's  rudimentary language type system and the pidgin  speaker's modest language competence have been noted and cross referenced  a common thread runs through the three sections of this paper  that language serves one basic function that of communication  at no point is it suggested that the three sections represent  a gradual progression  no doubt animal communication systems and human communication systems are different for example instinctive and interactive and innate and interactive   but they are also similar for example limited structures and innovative structures  finally the basis for any comparison of cross-species communication  is in the final analysis compassion for all forms of life  deve recording broken the paper comprises three sections section one and two deal with animal communication systems and section three with human communication system  i will concentrate only on the animal communication system  first of all what is communication?   hockett in nineteen sixty defined communication as an act by which one individual triggers the behaviour of another   s. a. altmann in nineteen sixty-seven stated that communication occurs when the behaviour of one individual  affects the behaviour of the other  although this definition is widely accepted by researchers  dealing with animal communication it suffers from generality  communicative features may be linguistic or non-linguistic  verbal or non-verbal vocal or non-vocal  verbal and non-verbal communication do not represent discontiguous processes  both are dependent upon similar complex coding and decoding cognitive processes and to the extent that these processes are comparable between species the abilities of different species to exchange information will also be similar  cognitive styles of perceiving and ordering the world are a combined function of an organism's innate neurological equipment  and his sensory-motor interactions minus emotion which is environmental surroundings  speech is a communication system superimposed on a biological process that of breathing  communication systems superimposed on two other essential biological processes are that of eating and that of sex  now here are some examples of how birds fish and mammals communicate  most of the communicative features are non-linguistic  non-verbal and non-vocal  i am going to specially talk about versatile behaviour  and intentional communication  biologists observing animals have noted that they are capable of versatile behaviour and intentional communication which lead us to the conclusion that animals can think  here are some striking examples of versatile behaviour from  the hindu nineteen ninety-eight  the galapagos finch uses specially shaped twigs to prise out grub from a hole  the green-backed heron breaks twigs into small pieces and floats them on the water  minnows that are attracted to the twigs end up as lunch  when the beaver's dam is damaged and it is forced to make emergency repairs it discards familiar techniques if they prove futile and tries novel strategies   termite's nests despite hot temperatures outside  maintain a certain level of coolness within  when two female gobi fish meet in a corner of a coral reef one of them changes into a male so that the two can mate   what's more the male fish can reverse back to a female  although not so easily  the fish opts for a sex change as a long search for a mate  puts them at the mercy of a predators   they are not good swimmers says phillip munday of the james cook university of north queensland in townsville  japanese researchers support these findings  finally wading birds migrate to new zealand after breeding in alaska a non-stop trip of eleven thousand kilometres  before they migrate they binge till upto fifty-five percent of their weight is fat  to compensate for the added weight they destroy a part of their internal organ like the kidney and the liver by up to twenty-five percent  when they land they rebuild them again  now information technology is perhaps the greatest revolution of this century  there is the internet which links people all over the world but would you believe that insects too have a similar communication system ?  just as we communicate physically and electronically insects communicate through sounds light movement and chemicals  i am going to give you some striking examples of intentional communication from the hindu in nineteen ninety-eight  in the insects communication system the chemical used as a communicators are called pheromones from greek  pherien to carry and hormaein  to excite  the quantity of pheromones used their effective distance and specificity all play an important part  for example a female sex phor   pheromone can attract the male from a distance of two miles or more  male moths fly towards the smell zone which increases as the male approaches the female  ants use these pheromones to communicate their message  as one or two ants identify the source of food they leave an invisible line of pheromones called trail marking  pheromones on the ground as they move which can be sensed by ants following  the ant is so meticulous that it chooses the highly specific  pheromone which does not evoke responses from ants of other species  thus each possesses its own language and higway code  ants produce a pheromone after their death the odour of which immediately provokes worker ant to remove the corpse from the nest some pheromones are used to warn friends of intending danger  if you disturb an insect in an anthill or a beehive the insect disturbed sents off alarm phermones which spread panic through the nest  dolphins sometimes referred to as monkeys of the sea they too communicate  they use unique signature whistles to keep in touch with others  that are out of sight says british zoologists and this is from the hindu nineteen ninety-seven  and do fish talk?  in a way they do  they tell each other how they feel by the way they wiggle and blow bubbles  fish which live at the very bottom of the ocean have a special way of communicating they glow with a bright light  some light up to startle their prey others just to say hello to each other the hindu nineteen ninety-seven  dr cyndy sims parr of michigan states that crows' long distance caws of which there are fifteen or twenty have different meaning determined by their form and rhythm  various vocalizations can mean stay out of my territory  watch out someone's after your lunch or help me get this predator out of here  she says that a string ko-ko-ko-ko-ko-ko  means neighbour you're tresspassing  in addition there are the many soft sounds crows make when talking with family members like gargles coos squawks squeals  and plaintive oo-oo's for example  squeal means teasing one another and oo-oo's   are cries of hunger from the hindu  nineteen ninety-seven  and now i'll conclude with the dance of the honeybee  for it is the dance of the honeybee that constitutes one of the most elaborate systems of communication c russell and w m s russell nineteen seventy-one  the dance was first noticed by pastor ernst spitz ner  spitzner in seventeen eighty-eight but it was left to an austrian zoologist karl von frisch to interpret the language of the honeybees  for this he was awarded the nobel prize in nineteen seventy-three  when a carniolan honeybee discovers a new source of honey  within about ten metres of the hive she returns to the hive and regurgitates drops of honey which are eagerly drunk by other bees  then she begins to dance round in a circle this is called  the round dance  during the round dance the bee runs in small circle  clockwise and anti-clock-wise alternately  the bees who watch her finds the new source of food  the round dance therefore tells other bees to search the near neighbourhood of the hive and the scent on the dancers body tells them what flowers to look for  but honeybees have been known to forage for food at distances of thirteen kilometres equivalent of thousand miles for a human being so when a honeybee finds food say between hundred metres  and hun and hun and ten kilometres she returns to the hive offers the honey she has found and performs a different kind of number called a tail wagging dance  in the case of the waggle dance the bee dances tracing a  figure of eight  like the round dance the waggle dance tells the bee that there is food available and what flowers to look for  but it also tells them exactly how far away the flowers are and in exactly what direction  the tempo of the dance conveys the distance to the food a quick step tempo indicating a relatively nearby food source and a slow foxtrot tempo a more distant one  even all this does not exhaust the language of the honeybee dances they can also vary in liveliness and total duration  they are livelier and longer the sweeter the food the easier it is gathered the better the weather  minute details have been left out such as the waggle dance making the same angle with the sun as the honeybee's flight-path did a complicated piece of geometrical calculation  but even from this brief description it can be inferred that the system of communication evolved by the honeybees is marvellous indeed thank you
