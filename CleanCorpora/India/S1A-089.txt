i am dr b d khane 
""
""
i am dr m p patil  department of history 
""
""
how are you patil  ?
""
""
fine 
""
what about you  ?
""
""
i am also fine 
""
""
what about your kids  ?
""
""
they are alright 
""
""
when did you come to the department today  ?
""
""
uh today i came  to department at  eleven  fifteen
""
""
""
what about your refresher course you wanted to go  ?
""
""
no no 
""
""
do you thing that refresher course serve the right purpose 
""
""
yes  some refresher course  serve the purpose 
""
""
but what about the most of the refresher courses  ?
""
""
most of  refresher courses are  uhm not conducted  on
u g c pattern 
""
therefore  the purpose  which 
""
""
purpose is defeated
""
""
uhm 
""
""
isn't it true with also post graduation teaching  ?
""
""
uhn  ?
""
""
isn't it true with post graduation teaching  ?
""
""
see if some  senior persons  uh attended this uh 
refresher course or  gave lectures  they are going to  be 
benefitted to even  p g  teachers
""
""
uhm  personally  i'm  saying that refresher course
 these are very frustrating 
""
""
no no
""
""
and then in same way the
""
""
my experience is not that 
""
""
i see 
""
""
because you know when  uh  i've  been in dharwad 
  uhm  there are some very good  uh resource persons 
""
""
 uhm  
""
""
uhm 
""
""
they  say like on  many knotty problems  like uh 
a few words   and ashoka inscription  so  there are some  one
word  where refresher are  useful  to even p g teachers 
""
""
no even i had a very good experience at in bombay 
""
""
uhm 
""
""
but if you take into consideration the overall picture in
india
""
""
 haan  overall be  specially in northern
india  uh  th  this refresher  co  courses are not conducted
 very well 
""
""
whole purpose is  defeated
""
""
whole  they had even  uh some refresher some university
is  even this uh  the people  would've  remained absent  and
they give these certificates  for example this uh  indore university
and many others 
""
""
it is waste of time 
""
""
yes the labour of time   has  one word  money
""
""
""
 is not money  
""
""
and the basic purpose is not served
""
""
yes  i agree with you  on that point 
""
""
even their teaching at post graduate level it is so
frustrating particularly use of english   medium 
""
""
 english  
""
""
because generally many of the students they offer  uh
marathi medium 
""
""
so the point is whether we should switch over to english 
  uhm  or whether the university should  uh uh incorporate
teaching into   marathi language 
""
""
 uhm  
""
""
 uh no it   would be better to teach in marathi
""
""
""
but then
""
""
because the majority will   two words  in
ninety-nine uh people percentage  they offer marathi medium 
""
only one or two students uh  if he will be outsider or
non-maharashtrian he only offers english
""
now what is the purpose  purpose of teaching in english 
english
""
""
but in that case the university education  will uh 
lose its uh national uh  no only maharashtra  one word  
marathwada nagpur
""
""
yes 
""
""
uh offer this marathi in which  in instead of english they
 teach in marathi
""
""
they have to teach in  one word 
""
""
but thereby they will lose the national character 
""
""
how  ?
""
""
that boys from karnataka they can't come to  maharashtra or
the maharashtrian can't go to
""
""
but even in uh  foreign countries uh  they teach in this
their mother  tongue no 
""
""
but the problem with india is of uh  more of linguistic
problems 
""
we should have to have some common language 
""
and that apart we don't have the  teaching material in regional
languages 
""
""
yes but that is not the problem even in japan  russia they
 teach in their own language 
""
""
but japan doesn't have the  linguistic adversity  as
much as we have 
""
""
you know we have no common language no except hindi or this
  e e  english 
""
even this hindi was  is opposed in  uh south india 
""
""
uh considering all this problems  what i feel that we
should have english for higher education  isn't it ?
""
""
but some nationalist leaders they oppose now this  uh in
 teaching of english 
""
""
that is the problem with our whole education    yes
 structure 
""
""
 yes  
""
""
yes 
""
""
we just carry on the show 
""
""
show yes 
""
""
but the purpose is  always    defeated  
defeated
""
""
uhm 
""
""
so what else we can do  ?
""
just to  rise over this frustration 
""
we don't have the  uh satisfaction  work satisfaction 
""
""
yes 
""
but we have no other alternatives 
""
""
i think that is case in every  department  of our life
""
""
""
not in the department but all over india also  this problem
all we are facing 
""
""
the question of the work culture  is never promisive 
""
""
yes yes 
""
""
but it is good thing that  uh we have some  modern
transit here    laughter  uhm
""
""
study the art he scored more and this  one word  
and intellectual 
""
now  he's  uh uh facing his first uh examination  coming
november 
""
""
yeah but you also must have helped him as a parent 
""
""
yeah that support we give  i brought books uh  then
tuitions and all other things 
""
but the hard work is also credit goes to my student only 
because he  studied hard 
""
""
but beside the financial support one needs the moral support
too  that you must have done
""
""
we extended it 
""
we both parents  my wife and i 
""
then we create this  uh convinient uh atmosphere at home also
""
""
not disturbing him in  on any issue 
""
right from the beginning he was punctual in his study 
""
he got up early in the morning at five  o'clock   then he
 one word  in  throughout the year 
""
""
what was that 
""
""
total  two words 
""
""
uhm  he scored sir ninety-seven marks  for  two
words  into  now he is in miraj  in government medical college
miraj 
""
""
because again there is this  preference  for  uh
 one word  
""
""
out of hundred  uh seats  uh only twenty-four seats are
open 
""
remaining seventy-six  they are alloted to  this category
or other category 
""
only twenty-four seats are open to  these students 
""
and his uh number was ninety 
""
and how is your daughter  ?
""
""
daughter is fine 
""
""
uhm
""
""
i have not considered her anything to  do  if she likes
arts  she can go in for arts  if she is interested in medicine  she
will go in for medicine 
""
but actually what  i'm  telling her that you just  go on
working hard  don't think of uh  reservation or that sort of thing 
""
""
my second son is also clever 
""
he stood in  uh in the first  two words  
""
he is studying in tenth standard 
""
he is included in scholar batch 
""
in scholar batch also he topped  first uh  in this uh first
test  semester 
""
""
that is also true of her  she stood first in her school
""
""
but at the same time she  did not only study  but also
participate in other curricular activity  curricular activity  in
sports 
""
""
she is active  one word 
""
""
she is more active 
""
""
expected in  one word 
""
""
yes  so i always tell her that percentage is not that
important  but the knowledge is very important
""
""
my younger son is also   allround   allrounder
  
""
he took part in the sports  games 
""
he is good uh  swimmer he is good runner  he is playing
cricket  football 
""
  in   on   teachers day he become a various
teacher 
""
""
i think only that much we can do for our students 
""
""
yes 
""
""
because  reservation or no reservation is not in our hand
""
""
so only we can  give some kind of confidence in them  and
provide this sort of uh guidence to them   if you work hard 
some day  you  will  are bound to be rewarded  
""
and reward  come in their own way 
""
not necessarily that everything they should
""
""
hard work is essential 
""
""
hard work is 
""
""
to get any success 
""
""
and positive attitude is also very important 
""
one shouldn't get frustrated or disgusted because of this
reservation policy 
""
""
yeah 
""
""
they always say that there is always a room on the top 
place on the top 
""
""
because now a days there is a lot of competition in every
field 
""
""
competition is there but this competition is not healthy 
often it is manipulated competition 
""
""
  sir sir  one word   this uh 
reserved candidate  uh of fifty-five percent of student he get  uh
this  seat to m b b s 
""
but open candidate   who  who secured more than
ninety-one
""
""
 competition is  
""
""
  one word   
""
""
correct 
""
""
private college
""
""
uhm 
""
""
private colleges 
""
""
no no in the government college this reservation  due to
reservation    uhm 
""
but open candidate even ninety-nine three  he will not get 
""
""
 uhm  
""
""
now as we say that the purpose of refresher course is
defeated the same the purpose of   reservation 
""
""
 this   is also defeated 
""
""
they go to delhi 
""
""
 it's  a  one word  college  not a  one
word  
""
""
and it is aimed at electoral  benefit 
""
""
all our education policies should be over hauled 
""
""
yes 
""
""
now a days 
""
""
this is in our country  this is because the government
take the popular decision
""
""
yes 
""
""
government doesn't stick to  some basic level of standard
or basic criterias 
""
there is so much uh  corruption in education too 
""
""
yes there actually  that in a every uh 
""
""
so we study only for the sake of examination   
examination  not for the knowledge 
""
""
 examination  
""
""
knowledge 
""
""
and the examinations  are
""
""
because the students study only this  uh superguide 
""
they don't attend lecture 
""
they were not  uh punctual in their attendence in the class 
""
they don't read any english book 
""
they don't take notes in the class 
""
they only depend on this uh  uh super guides  or the
shortcomings 
""
""
these are the bitter truths of a democracy
""
""
yes 
""
""
since all the elements of  uh democracy are manifested in
indian experience
""
""
yes 
""
but even though the  uh all these are  two things  india
is a great democracy  you see in the world 
""
""
that is it has played ourselves  but in reality the
experience is totally different 
""
""
uhn that is 
""
in every country  this problem of this uh  corruption 
is going on 
""
in every country particularly in russia 
""
""
now other day i
""
""
the political and other economic condition is worse than
india in russia 
""
""
no corruption is uh  everywhere
""
""
corruption  one word 
""
""
but the degree  degree varies
""
""
in western asia the religion  uh west asia religion  is
very important for them 
""
the islamic  pe  people they  don't want any change 
""
islamic nations  they are static  they don't want any change
 any   progressive   progress   
""
""
in comparison between muslim country india is  better 
other day i happen to see the list of uh ten countries  in the world 
where there is least corruption 
""
the list is published in  times of india 
""
""
and what is the number of uh our 
""
""
there is not a single city from india 
""
i think only one asia i think japan    yeah  and
singapore  feature in that
""
""
 yeah  
""
""
no corruption there 
""
""
corrupt it is easy to do themselves    uhm  in
those cities 
""
there may be corruption  but it is not that  uh problematic
""
""
so the businessman they all of prefer that city
""
""
 uhm  
""
""
what is uh solution for  to overcome this corruption  ?
""
""
in our case the democracy has attempted to the problems of
corruption  for example  our  problem in educational field 
mostly they come from the  one word  uh elections  for the
academic positions  whereas in america there are no elections  for
academic position
""
""
academic position 
""
""
 two words  the criteria in  college uh 
teachers are bound to be elected
