""
""
a very good afternoon to all our viewers from us here at the
karnatak state billiards association match for 
""
the last and final session of the  world under twenty-one 
snooker championship  is about to commence 
""
and the man you see on your screens is ronie  o'salavan  of
england  fifteen year old  who has established a dominating  nine
frames to four  uhm  lead in this finals 
""
 it's  the best of twenty-one  so  he has to win just
two more frames  to win  the world under twenty-one    
snoo    snooker   crown 
""
his opponent who you see on your screen now is patrick  yelston
of belgium  sixteen years old  who   is   has  
uh  amazed everyone with his  tremendous sporting ability  and is
 is   in   happy  temperament 
""
ronie salavan  on the first session of this match which was held
yesterday  just managed to  get into a four frame to three lead 
""
but this morning in the  second session of the match  he was
virtually unstoppable  winning  four out of the five frames that 
 was was    were   played 
""
and the centre piece of this morning session  was a marvellous
break of a hundred and thirty-one total clearance  except for the black
""
""
uh  that  what you saw that  was a mis clue for ronie 
o'salavan  
""
and  uh he is uhm     it's   it's  a bit
   it's  a bit   humid out there although  the air
conditioning is on in the hall
""
 it's  a bit humid and possibly  uh that was the 
reason for  that mis cue 
""
now  let's  see here 
""
his opponent does  well his opponent hasn't done much in fact
 he's  left  the red hanging over the  corner pockets  the
left corner pocket on your screen 
""
the black is clear  so if salavan  can put this  with a
ton of  stunt  which he has done 
""
he can set himself up for a useful opening break 
""
 there's  a contrast in styles between these two players
with   o'salavan   uhm certainly i would say the more gifted of
the two  also being  the more thoughtful of the two
""
and i think that that is the right approach 
""
snooker is not a game which you can really  uh play with any
degree of carelessness 
""
you can play of course but you have to be careful  and i think
this is the difference between  ronie salavan  and his  belgium
opponent 
""
certain loose reds open 
""
and uh   o'salavan   can  take a heavy toll of his
 opponent's   careless safety shot   cough 
""
""
wondering if there is plant on after us  black which is
going to salavan 
""
a plant is  a shot  where you  pick the first rid hit
it on to the second rid  and make second rid travel into the pocket 
""
 it's  a charge 
""
that was a beautiful shot   applause 
""
he brought out the pink  and  he has now sink it in the
centre pocket and come  back towards this end of the table 
""
and position for any of the open rids  on the right hand 
right hand side of the screen that is  the one  he's  come for now
is next to the pink spot 
""
""
from where we are seating in the commentators box it seems as
if that red  his might not be free  or  yes   it is 
 it is   free  only it doesn't look like  from this angle
""
""
and  here's  his chance to put the blue and  turn it
into the cluster of edge to open them up 
""
 that's  not exactly what he had intended 
""
but  i think may be useful forty-five break
""
perhaps he will now opt for a safe shot 
""
sending the ball towards the bob cushion   applause 
""
so   that's  got to ronie salavan with a  good break
of forty-five 
""
""
nothing to play except safer 
""
 it's  the  one word  shot  extraordinary and
lovely hand between if the ball has enough run in it 
""
""
uhm  that's  the kind of thing that  yelston who
want to avoid  if he has any hope of  getting back into this match 
""
cannot afford to play careless shots and open up  the edge to an
opponents  who's  playing in a good form 
""
will you agree with that arvind ?
""
""
definitely but at the moment the way he  has  played
that rid  it might have been a shot to nothing shot  whether he 
took a wild swing
""
he has gone back to the bottom of the table 
""
so he may not have just a intellect to pot it 
""
he might have intended to pot it as well as  end up towards the
bottom because the ball had sufficient run in it 
""
anyway  a shot that is being played now by  salavan leaves
him a red which is reasonably easy for his potting skill 
""
and now  this will show whether the young man is going for his
 game or whether  he's  going to be   play   playing
   kg  
""
he can pot to brown in the corner pocket or snooker in behind the
brown 
""
 he's  slumped didn't had a good follower 
""
he knows  that though his opponent has got  forty points
ahead and  may be he can possibly make up his by  sneaking   
well  few points 
""
""
 well  
""
""
that was a very good shot 
""
but 
""
""
his intention in that particular shot was to play it with a
lot of left hand spin to take the ball  off the cushion closer to the blue
so that the blue could be potted in the centre pocket 
""
but  he hit it so hard that the spin didn't really have time to
react 
""
anyway  he did a marvellous job in that uh  clean pot on the
blue ball 
""
he just landed it   in   into   the bottom
pocket 
""
he is attempting a similar shot now in the corner pocket now 
""
may be worry of uh  his waist coat or his  sleeve touching
the yellow  he played that in very much of hurry and missed it 
""
and  that's  the first decent uh  opening 
""
salvan has really left this shot with that careless shot for he
should have easily  potted that rid 
""
uh  now the    bel    belgium  
player definitely  should  level scores or go further because all the
reds are  in a position that he can manoveur them open 
""
and he has  opened out one red  comfortably  except that
he has to play it with the rest because he might  not be able to reach it
being a left hander 
""
there again he went to playing with the  rest with his right
hand instead of now the normal left hand that he uses to  play his uh 
a  inactive pots 
""
going for the pink ball  clean as a whistle  follows without
those two reds 
""
now left on with the red  in the centre 
""
very well done 
""
perfectly in position for the pink 
""
a soft stunt loosen the  a red into the corner 
""
perfectly in position for the black 
""
and this is uh  said for certain viewers viewing this game 
on your black and white screens 
""
a frame which should have uh  for all practical purposes 
gone to ronie salavan  is now coming back  towards the belgium 
player 
""
 there's  no place for the black ball to be spotted on his
own spot
""
the red is occupying the black spots uh   blacks'  area
 and as such  is been  the black still spotted on the yellow spot
""
""
now beautiful shot there and he is  right in possession for
that ball   applause 
""
break of thirty-five which puts him five  points ahead of uh 
 ronie's   score 
""
uh ah   applause  beautiful shot  he played well for
remaining position for the blue 
""
he might even attempt the black because he got the angle to come up
comfortably 
""
that was a  very hard shot that he played on the black but the
ball didn't really  travel as much as he wanted to 
""
 he's  done a damn  good practice of  play that 
damn good shot on that actually  he could have uh  this was a careless
shot because he couldn't reach  and he played a haphazard shot 
""
""
 it's  a pity that after that  i think that that he
should have played this shot over reaching with the rest  and giving
salavan a chance  to uh  get back straight away 
""
of course as you can see the yellow is tied against the 
cushion  the bob cushion 
""
and uh  it will require some effort to  to pot it in
position  uh correctly for the green 
""
well i think salavan has done quite well to get where he is  and
he can stun it off the bob cushion 
""
and  i'm  sure that  yelston must be kicking himself
right there because  he could have wrapped up this frame if he had just
taken a few seconds more over that safety shot 
""
now this is a crunch ball  the green  he can get this 
""
""
it has come a little too much  for salavan has to use the
wrist 
""
""
one point behind 
""
""
yes indeed   applause 
""
""
ronie salavan has tasted blood and he wants to get this match
over as quickly as possible 
""
so  he's  now gone into the lead  by three points 
he needs the blue and the pink  to wrap up the frame 
""
oh  that's  it   applause  before two frames of
the match and the first frame of the last session has gone  o'salavans'
 way
""
 he's  now  just one frame away  from winning  the
under twenty-one world snooker championship 
""
and uh there you see yelston  with his  left hand over his
eyes
""
 i'm  sure  he's  rueing that  rather dreadful
safety shot 
""
uh  looking a bit dejected  but   that's  only to
be expected
""
if he had  to have any sort of chance of getting back into this
match  it was important for him to win this first frame and he certainly
had an outstanding opportunity of doing so  that  as we said before
 that hasty  shot  cost him the frame 
""
well he is off some of the  yes and now beautiful  first our
view of the whole  arena  very handsome arena 
""
the karnataka state billiards association is very fortunate in
having its own premises  and having such a  wonderful match room 
where the scores of the famous   that's  been played  in the
final 
""
""
first sessions score  as you can see on the board 
thirty-nine sixty-two  loosing the first frame  and uh 
subsequently  twenty-four seventy three 
""
the scores actually  are the other way round 
""
uh some of them have gone 
""
""
yes  there's  the scores are quite right because it
was 
""
""
no the scores
""
""
yeah you are right you are right 
""
first two frames were taken by yelston 
""
""
 yesterday's  score 
""
""
 yesterday's  score 
""
""
not  todays'  first  sessions'  but 
yesterday's   and then it was uh  salavan  who got that got
the 
""
""
yelston has just broken up for  the  fifteenth frame
of the match  and  should he loose this of course  young ronie
fifteen year old ronie  o'salavan   will be the  nineteen
ninety-one  world under twenty-one snooker champion 
""
""
feels extremely the pity but uh  there is an applause
that brilliant shot on the last but one red 
""
fouled uh  spoiled his  safety shot  and  what could
have been very interesting match is now going to be  possibly 
salavans  uh very easy manner now that the fight is  obviously out of
yelston   applause 
""
""
he has  tied  our  equation  and and it is
great but as such
""
""
no doubt about it 
""
""
now  let's  see what what he does  i mean he is
quite remarkable this man 
""
for his adolescent as i should call him being sixteen years old
 sixteen years of age 
""
""
looking for the plant  and  trying to slam it now
this was the shot which uh  if played a little carefully  could have
uh  brought him back very much into the game 
""
but the way he   is   has    burst the
back   he's  still not run left ronie a little easy  on this
""
""
 he's  lost the black alright  and if ronie goes for
this  last set of the screen on your left hand side as you see or the 
one level black spot the second one 
""
 that's  the one i mean and   he's  got it well
""
""
if he gets that now that  he's  got this  a colour 
bringing him back up the table  will probably  put that to  any
sort of a challenge that  the belgian might have  had in mind 
""
""
with all those reds spread out on the table it looks like a
christmas tree  and uh  here  o'salavan   his now in a in a
difficult position because  he's  right on the cushion  and 
he's  attempting a slice  which he has got in fact  and uh 
this must be uh well
""
""
 two words  
""
""
so not much damage done  uh from  yelston's  point
of view  uh as a result of that  wide slash that he took at the red
  applause 
""
""
round of applause for getting himself out of that self
imposed snooker 
""
ronie  o'salavan  five  patrick yelston  six 
""
and as i said before  o'salavan  needing just  this
frame  to win  the title 
""
""
now well  planned safety shot but  he got the edge on
that rid  still didn't uh  remain in the centre area 
""
however the long pot was won and  it was played well by 
patrick yelston 
""
this is again an opening from which the belgian can  make 
a good number of points  that depends whether he can  muster up all
the guts that are required to face a situation like this 
""
""
provided he doesn't get a rush of blood to the head and do
something silly 
""
""
you know  it's  uh  is quite possible because 
you've  seen him break down on the easiest of shots 
""
this is the longest that he has    take    
taken   to plan a break if you noticed mike 
""
""
yes  same stroke that strike me i must confess 
""
first time  we've  seen him  thinking  so much 
""
uh  this is just  just he stress at that 
""
""
actually what happens when a person is a very fast player
 tries to think and play a slow game 
""
his reflexes are fast his uh  brain muscle coordination is
fantastic and  uh he doesn't  have the ability to  cope to the
slower situation that he has to  at times  plan and do 
""
""
so the score is  patrick yelston twenty-two ronie 
o'salavan  five with  with this break in hand 
""
and it certainly could be  by the looks of it  uhm  a
winning situation 
""
all the reds are spread out fairly easily  fairly comfortably
and 
""
just needs to keep his cool and  the rest will fall on place
""
""
""
brushing some of the dust away from the  area of the pink
 must have felt that there is something which might  obstruct the few
balls around 
""
the following up for the black off a cushion  black ball on
the spot  comfortably  to go round  off a cushion
