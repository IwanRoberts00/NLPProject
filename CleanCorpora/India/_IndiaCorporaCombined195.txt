 in hindi  another arjun award winner this sandhya agarwal  and of course we have the cricketing manager of the indian side  uh the third arjun award winner santarangaswamy managing this team  diana eduljee  quite a delivery indeed but the batsman there on the crease  unable to study the ball unable to read the ball are not taking chances of leaving the crease  diana  left arm round on the leg stump  no attempt for a shot  and thirty nineth over completed with diana completing her sixth over two maiden ten runs and one wicket  in just misfield you see franklin and jose now discussing as to the strategy what should be adopted at this stage of the game the fortieth over will be in progress the run rate here as given by our scorer immediately and  it's two point four one  two point four one a very low rate of scoring  not a recitable total to bowl at and australia will have to do something about it right now  before it's too late to recover from the say of ninety-four for six  pramila  see it's pramila from the darya ganj end amar  yeah  and still a spin attack going on although there is a slight breeze on the uh ground today  a little breeze the flag swinging the flag are waving and you can see that the pacers although not very successful they haven't been operated for a long time   it's the spinners who are taking the field today  and first ball fro from pramila  going away from the point  two runs three runs  uh ninety-seven franklin moves on to eight ninety-seven for six the fortieth over in progress  how many overs have all today could you let me know number of overs the pacers bowl today  so it's uh one three o five  five overs five overs each five each ten  so ten overs have been bowled by the pacers see it's pramila the right arm spinner  and the leg stump ball punished but diana right there  the stroke coming in directly to the wicket keeper's hand and the australian run restricted to only two  only one run being taken ninety-eight for six  wonderful throw from the boundary line  for franklin and jose we have told you about the  achievements of franklin young player an upcoming player from the australian squad who ha who are visiting india for the first of the match in the series  here is pramila right arm elbow moved up and on the off stump first into the covers  a little misfielding  single there ninety-nine  quicking towards that wretched mark of hundred but number of overs bowled a little too many for this total ninety-nine for six  appeal jose out and the appeal there  the response is positive by the umpire  you see the batsman returning  and abhay what do you think of this ball ? jose goes back for total of individual total of seventeen  this this session always necessary to know what type of bowling is there and she has come on last evening say she is a  off spinner  she is very success successful  bowler in the nineteen ninety-three world cup where she had a  very good throw with wonderful fielding  she is a very good fielder also  and she is coming up from the darya ganj end  she gave her to guess that sneak off jose and anju jain was right there behind the stump collecting it  anju you can see her there now reaching which is behind franklin  and that's a wonderful shot off the toes turning the body a little bit and uh between the mid wicket and mid on  three runs  they wouldn't go for the fourth  a very fast running between the wickets  before aarti vaidya return to ball three runs added hundred completed for australia  hundred and two in forty point two overs and time taken of course time is not required in the over match  and now we can get a little flavour of the one day match  being played here between india and australia  very good delivery bringing in the ball a little diana eduljee  for a minute difficult to suspend  very articulate vital spot read the batting and there she is frightened one this time  two fielders outside that white line  faster one  not bowling to the field at the moment the faster one wanted to see how the batman  ca respond to such delivery the long off and long on kept but  the last delivery was flatter and faster  and batsman number eight has twelve runs to the credit and the  by the spinners and of course the spinners have been doing remarkably well in this match  franklin taking t s pramila  pramila is the captain of the champion side which won the rani jhansi trophy the air india team and this is t s pramila  another mis- fielding  little bit of mis-fielding there at mid wicket and before the ball is retrieved by lea francis one run added hundred and three for seven franklin thirteen  valuable thirteen valuable runs at this stage  although the rate of scoring is low  australia now moving up on to the target for better total  the weather brightening up a little the sun streaking in  and just when the lunch break is coming the weather  improving  t s pramila bowling franklin  quick  bright facing t s pramila  bright she is giving all the strike to franklin  and bright played this ball uncomfortably losing her balance going on the off side and not being able to maintain her balance to go for any type of stroke  see here pramila elbow high right arm going over  and this one bringing this one ball from the off stump so as it has to turn a little before she could try this ball  but not a good choice to get her fetch her any run  the score remains at hundred and three for seven  the forty second over being bowled  slightly delivery on the off stump but a vast covers head  two runs easily  the cover being too close not moving behind fast enough to get underneath the ball two runs added to the total hundred and five for seven  the forty first to point two overs at the moment the score is hundred and five for seven  diana eduljee that mesmerising left arm spinner of india  operating from the club house end  on the leg stump  a lovely bit of fielding indeed  and i think the indian squad now with a little bit of strike from the australian side has awakened up to good fielding and ria sen good cricket after a long time  a little subdued moving that has gone brightening up now  short pitch right there in the middle  fielded no run as aarti bajaj mid off  left arm going round  not a good contact and finally shastri there at mid wicket at the square leg  the bat and the ball not in a perfect condition of contact  uh delivery on the leg side open up too early the batsman open up too early uh and uh another uncomfortable defensive half defensive stroke didn't go for a hit neither did she come for a forward defence  hundred and five for seven  bright two franklin  attempted cut and of course successful with it  two before the ball is retrieved by aarti vaidya and returned to the wicket keeper  two uh added to the total of australian total of hundred and five now hundred and seven for seven  hundred and seven for seven three wickets remaining two overs remaining  this forty fourth over being bowled  t s pramila from the darya ganj end bowling to bright faster delivery and came in straight to the keepers hand  anju unable to read that delivery of pramila came off herself lucky not to get it touched it with bright  variations in pramila's delivery the last one came in the last of her delivery bringing in the nineth over with two maiden sixteen runs being given away she's captured one wicket so far  at delivery and that is the intelligence diana applies whenever she bowls to cricketers bowl to the opposite side  she is always leading the batsman she saw batsman ready for setting out and uh coming close to the ball and uh here she is  with that classic delivery of hers in the last over  so franklin returned to the pavillion at the score of hundred and seven  and here is the last wicket  so it's collin rose collin at the crease now to face diana  five balls remaining   two words one day international women's  cricket match which is being played between india and australia  welcome to the nehru stadium where the second one day international between india and australia is taking place  we are with you when the third over is taking place  and rose collin just about to bowl the third over  this is the first ball in the third over a beautiful ball it is  and i must tell you my co commentator today is a great cricketer chandu sarvate who is going to give you the  commentary in hindi in the second one day international match  the first ball from the australians where india took three runs and after that in the second over was a maiden over and this is the third over the second ball of the third over  it is anju jain who is facing rose collins no runs to be taken  and it's a the australians w have already proved their ability in the fielding in fielding as well as they have done a good bit of bowling in the end  and this rose collin who will be operating the opening bowler  she is operating from the club house end  the morning is bright and sunny and just lovely for cricket  so this is going to be a fifty over match each side  three overs there is third over being bowled five runs and uh the indian batsman now facing rose collins is aarti vaidya the left handed batsman  and this girl rose collins has been swirving the ball  with this weather and have been able to really disturb the batsman from the very first over  a six footer she said her mother is six feet four inches  and quite a good height for a pace baller  i must tell you about this girl rose collins who got a very good average in the first one day international  six overs two maiden she has given only sixteen runs  the runs given away matters in the one day international  the bowler from the other end is now joe grace  in the first one day international it was anjelo o'neil  from the other end but now it is joe grace who is bowling from the hospital end five for no loss india five for no loss  facing is aarti vaidya and the bowler at the other end is  joe grace  joe grace's average in the delhi one day when she came in to bowl after five bowlers her average was seven overs four maiden eight runs and two wickets  and that effort of hers has brought her into the opening bowling stand and she is bowling from the hospital end now  and that was a marvellous ball going away that too from the left handed batsman that is coming into a right handed batsman  and joe grace a left hand middle order batsman the vice captain of the team the right arm fast medium bowler has been utilising the  weather today  the bright sunshine has got a little bit of air we can see the swerves in the flag and the flags waving  joe grace coming in once more  aarti vaidya  and that's olivia who returned the ball and before that we already have runs added to the  indian total three more runs added and valuable three runs  and of course this wicket as mister salvador told you uh is a good wicket   bahut acchi  joe grace from the hospital end  and she has been able to really beat the batsman once more aarti vaidya playing early the ball coming in a little late  and being wrapped up in the pad  and aarti the left handed batsman the opening batsman of the indian team score has been quite successful scoring twenty-nine runs in the first one day international is now facing joe grace  so that was the over of joe grace  and in this over she gave away only two runs  quite commendable bowling and of course always disturbing the batsman  she has been able to extract and get swing the ball keeping a little low of course and that is one reason why the batsman possibly are not being able to go for runs in this early part of the innings  rose collins to resume one slip   we'll show you the field placing  this is rose collins getting ready just seen beside the captain  that's how her runner is a right arm bowler   in hindi  so that was before julian langle returned it  runs added to the indian total and total moves on to eight for no loss  eight for no loss  rose collins about to bowl  the ball again came in to the left handed batsman and we see the ball swirving out  going out through a right handed batsman at one slip  this is a left hander aarti vaidya though the ball is  moving away from her  and the first odd right in on the wrapped up on the leg  and there is an appeal from rose collins  turned early the ball came in late  and aarti vaidya caught there a little outside the wicket according to the judgement of the umpire  and there she is just about to resume  but she has to really be careful she has not been meeting the ball quite well this morning  and right on the stump once more but very careful this time is aarti vaidya  taking her legs no gap between the bat and the pad and she is playing with that one slip you can just see in fact there are no other closer seen but of course there is a double gully wide apart
