hello you know his importance i deserve as a direct student of gujral and the influence is very much there  that is why it has that philosophical basis  and uhm if you do not understand phenomenology lot of modern critical theory will not be understood because you know they based their idea on phenomenology  the idea of subjectivity we all these days we talk about subjectivity and phenomenology emphasises subjectivity you know how the subject is constituted interesting  idea and as a feminist literature feminist theory you always come across the idea of subjectivity how the subject is constituted  woman as a subject how it is constituted  uhm it is a cultural construction it's not a biological construction like someone who would say the woman was not born she was made  i am not a bo i am not a born woman i was made a woman  so the idea of subjectivity is not a very simple idea it's  very you know the historical construction of the idea of the subjectivity and phenomenology emphasise the idea of subjectivity and subsequently it became a problematical idea that uh  the notion of the subject the constitution of the subject how the subject is constituted is not an easy thing to say you know  it's not something that is result uh taken for granted  and the relationship between the subject and the object who is the subject who is the object ? uh sometimes you feel that the object perhaps is the subject you know so subject object axis is very complex and phenomenology i repeat it emphasise that notion of subjectivity  that's why it is called subjective criticism  whose subjectivity you can ask ? the readers the writers there is also narrator involved in the process of narrative the all subjects the reader is a subject the writer is a subject the character who narrates is a subject  so whose subjectivity and how one subjectivity is imbricated with another you know these are all complex say philosophical problems particularly when you deal with the narrativity you come across these kind of interesting uh i would say that colonical  of very interesting notions about subjectivity  and that's why you know subjectivity objectivity is a very is a false notion according to these there is nothing called objectivity you cannot be objective  objective  you assume that the whole world can be reduced into some kind of  immense neutrality which is a kind of objectivity  is it possible to do that ? the world also as a subject is constituted by your consciousness if individual response to the world in his own particular way where to get the sense of objectivity how is it that you want to be objective ? what is the basis of objectivity ? and who actually makes the basis ? the very fact that you define objectivity you are already  implicated into the very definition which is your personal definition  that is why it's a very very false notion the idea of objectivity there is nothing called objectivity  one is relatively uh you can say uh relatively know like subjectivity and objectivity or subjectivity refers to the subject objectivity refers to the object  and the does the object exist independently of your consciousness ? how does the object get a realised do you  perceive a thing all of you in a same way  when you come into the room your eyes you know glances at something not the entire thing and the same eye of another person doesn't glance at the same thing  so there is all like all i say you the sense of perception  had already reduced things into some kind of selectional it has already selected which thing to see and which thing to exclude from vision from perception  so the act of perception itself is a selective art and when the process of selection has already taken place in in a mental uh you know when when it is in a mental process that the idea of objectivity is lost you don't see the whole world together at a time  you see piecemeal and it comes to you through fragments  and the very fact that you will be selective uh whether you like it or not you are selective in your glance in your vision that actually negates the very idea of objectivity  how do you then make sense of the world ? if the world is such a vast thing which you can't see at a time everything how do you then make sense of the world ? can you really objectively say that the world is like this ? you know so these are all illusions and uh western philosophers particularly created the notion of objectivity as an idea it's a kind of platonic fallacy you can say something  exterior exists and we intuitively realise it's sense it and the very idea of intuition perhaps negates the idea of objectivity that you have some intui intuition in your think in your perception that negates the idea of subjectivity  uh objectivity so phenomenology says that objectivity is nothing it's  just an illusion and everything perception is personal subjective you see things the way you want to see them sometimes you refuse to see  deliberately you do not like to see things because you don't like to see them  but your vision is always selective in its own way it always selects things from a mass of events mass of things that you  uh are scattered around you you select a few because perhaps in a very i i interesting   way logical way become some to your uh thinking  so you select something that confirms to your line of thinking and so on and so forth  so basically any kind of response is a subjective response that is a case which phenomenology makes  you read a text you like it or you don't like it yes  sir phenomenology is the operate experience at subjective level yes but uh at its various uh student criticism like uh as you referred to rather the guidance of these landmarks feminist criticism or even black literature and so forth and so on cough  there since phenolism phenomenology applies to a sort of group volunteers yes it is a group concept i think so how this various or even the idea of new colonisation example literary criticism or literary creation so all this interpretation are can be traced back to the idea of phenomenology only in a way  you can do that you can say that  if there is some if there is a kind of group response and the collective response to something like you have mentioned the feminists or the blacks there have been from the third world any way cough but if there are variations if you look at the individual but there is something called and i that is why i say that and it varies from group to group it varies from person to person and within group there are lot of divergences and you can take note of that  if we account for all those divergences within the commonality which is a kind of one word imposed upon those desperate tendencies in individual perception in fact every individuals movements breaks down before it  takes off   naturally naturally nature of the very idea of phenomenology naturally so it is the very basis of human perception  you  a few words they were talking about their commonwealth now they say yeah about these this whole idea but you know commonwealth of course is a very hetrogeneous concept there is no commonwealth response  a few words  yes you can say there may be a third world reference  but they didn't  but they didn't talked about it to start with see they talked about it but you see how can you then say the australian response is similar to indian response or the canadian response commonwealth within commonwealth if they belong to the first world but still they didn't talked about it see this is as i say it is a desperate ideas yoked in violence you know it's kind of hetrogenity and that also is a very debatable idea  is there any communality of this kind of political term which unites the erstwhile colonies but the response of a canadian response certainly is closer to the american response than uh uh an indian response and you can't uh uh say that a first world country like canada  uh response this in the same way as a third world country so there is a lot of variations but uh phenomenology doesn't talk of course of a group response kind of thing they talk of individual and they don't really like the idea of this collective response is like collective action and if they name it some we will talk about that later on a slightly when we talk about to reader response criticism  but the collective response idea also is self contradictory response cannot be collective because two people two persons do not think alike  and you group them together and say you think alike and you can't control human thinking it is so spontaneous  your own response is so spontaneous you can only politically manipulate the whole thinking process even to suit your convenience it is a political manipulation of human mind can be controlled technologically you know but human response certainly tries to evade this kind of technologing of the spirit  spirit could not be technologised in way you want them want it to be technologised but you can't even say you can't say there is nothing called collective response  blacks certainly think in their own way there is communality of interest  there is certainly when it comes to the the question of white domination they certainly respond in very general way about the notion of domination ideology power and so on and so forth and that is the kind of but it is not perception these people deal with more intensely deal more intensely with how you percieve things how things get realised in your consciousness get realised in your perception how things take shape in your mind so it is the the the kind of ideatic according to ferrel you refer you induce it to some kind of ideatic  ideatic reflection or ideatic uh uh reduction ideatic reduction or reflection idea if now reduced to that level of perception  perceptual you know  and a concept arises out of the innate perceptuality of her idea so that innate perception you perceive then you conceptualise first is perceive you perceive in your mental eye and that perceptuality of every ob the object gets realised  through your perceptuality your perception  there is no object until you see it in your mental eyes  it's not just a visual perception but is a very uh as you know is a very is a mental perception  you perceive the object and suddenly the object take shape in your mind then you conceptualise about it conceptualisation is a cerebral process that takes place only after the mental perception takes place has taken place  this is the way all visible objects are reduced to modes  by which you perceive an inner reality  as i say that it has some complicity with the plutonic idea of essence that the whole world is reduced to the object in a very miniature way in a miniature way the the visible world that you see is a miniature copy of the idea the essence which has occured it has that kind of traditional plutonic kind of notions of the visible and the invisible axis  what you see visible is only a manifestation of the invisible perception  the mind works in its own way and makes things possible so the object gets realised to a mental process and then it becomes manifested through the phenomenology of the object which is a manifestation is possible because of the mental perception  this is the idea of the ideatic reduction bracketing  everything is bracketed between you and the others so you operate at a very higher level of uh uhm  relationship between the object  so the objectivity is not uh nothing is objective per se  there is nothing called objectivity per se you know  objectivity is a realisation of the higher mode of subjectivity  objectivity the id object objectivity is the whole idea the objectiveness objectivity the object uh the objectiveness the object the objectness objectivity is objectness so the objectness which you call objectivity the very quality of the object is manifested through your subjective perception that is why where do you get the idea of objectivity  uh without you know some subjectivity  subjectivity makes the objectness possible objectivity is possible  so the object and subject come together in a very mystical way and that is why consciousness is the consciousness of an object you cannot have subjectivity without objectivity  you cannot have objectivity without subjectivity  this is the subject object relationship and uh the whole world the whole perception of the perceptual world is possible  because of this axis because of this relationship between the subject and the object  am i clear on this ? okay this is the basis of phenomenology and as you know  as you know already rightly pointed out that this is the fundamental  uh way by which you realise the object that you see around you the world comes becomes visible because of the mental  already mental process which was on and you create the object in your own perception
