in english studies  there is  unit   module two
 unit  two point two point three  teaching literature in english
 what are the approaches to the teaching of literature in english  ?
""
what are the emergent areas in literature in english ?
""
what are the research possibilities  ?
""
so     a a    and   also uh 
module three  you have uh  no i am sorry uh two point three 
module three  research areas in english studies what are the new critical
tools evolved by the more recent critical method schools  ?
""
what are the trends in contemporary criticism  ?
""
what are the new approaches to research in linguistics stylistic
etcetera  ?
""
so it is hoped that some of the things that i  speak to you
about will  inspire  one or two  to  go along these lines 
""
of the two lectures  first uh  on   auchitya
  as a    cri    criterion   of 
literary assessment 
""
yesterday  i  distributed a handout  listing the eight
major theories  not the minor ones  eight major theories 
""
and the first of these  which is the most  notorious 
rasa  theory  we discussed yesterday 
""
today i am taking up  what is listed there as number four 
 auchitya  
""
i have a  for distribution  a bibliography  a select
bibliography of books and articles on the application of  indian literary
theory classical indian literary theory  to uh    litera 
  literary   works  especially  uh to modern writings
 uh  which are available in english 
""
so you will get a list  and uh you can you can choose  i
won't be commenting on that list today  but i shall like to  comment
on this yesterday we didn't have the  black  board  today we have
something which is not quite so black but   we'll  be able to use
that   clearing the throat 
""
the   bb writing  these diagram i mention briefly 
which is like uh teaching science in the  in some of the old colleges 
""
imagine this is a test tube  because in the laboratory they
didn't have a real test tube  so everything was  the work of
imagination 
""
but today i think i will  draw the diagram which is provided by
 kuppuswamy shastri as i mentioned yesterday  and uh  that two
triangles  and two circle  indicate the  relative importance  of
the eight  fold system 
""
uh there are some college who would  prefer one  theory to
the other theory  but i  i have a attitude that each theory has its
own  specific application 
""
no single theory  not even from the west  will explain the
whole of the literary process 
""
and the relevance of the theory depends on how  liberally 
how critically  how meaningfully we apply this  theory 
""
what can a poor theory do  if the user of the theory is not 
imaginative enough to apply it  intelligently 
""
so  we have the  three major theories  dhwani 
rasa   and  anumana   or  anumiti 
anumiti waad  or  anumanaya   inference 
""
these three are linked together  by   auchitya
 
""
that is without  auchitya   neither 
dhwani   nor  rasa   nor  anumiti
 by itself can deliver the goods 
""
everything has to be  used in a proper way  that applies to
the application of any literary theory as well 
""
the blind application of any theory  will not  help us in
appreciating or understanding or interpreting literature 
""
the smaller  triangle   guna  a  guna
  theory  the  alankara  theory  and 
riti   theory  these are of different schools 
""
and i have given the  names of the people  major critics who
have advocated this  with the basic texts 
""
and linking  guna alankara  and  riti
  we have the  uh smaller circle  which will represent
 vakrokti  
""
for most of these translations are available in english but as i
said  translations were made by  sanskrit scholars who knew  their
kind of english  and therefore  uh the translations may not satisfy
the requirements of  teachers of english 
""
but it is good if teachers of english can  take kindly to some
of these tools of research  and develop them  in the complete
confidence that  we are free to interpret any theory we handle and we
ought to do that not merely  borrow them wholesale 
""
so unless you breathe new life into these these are not going to
help us 
""
we have to deal with modern literature  we have to deal with
literature written in a foreign language 
""
and uh we have the gap of  thousands of years  atleast two
thousand years perhaps 
""
so we have to take these into account  and uhm what we get from
these texts is only the insights 
""
some  evidence of  efforts made  by a people so long ago
 to understand the literary process which  which in fact defies
understanding 
""
no  poet no  musician will explain to us everything about
his own art 
""
musicians are most tongue tied in this you know you sit and listen
to me  i won't  talk 
""
it is a musicologist who will talk about it  and he can do that
because his  mastery is comparatively  limited 
""
there are many things which cannot be  uh talked about 
which cannot be diverged which cannot be even apprehended by the performers
""
""
so    ther    there   is an element of
mystery and we have  eight different ways of probing into the mysteries of
literary  creativity 
""
we will take up  this  auchitya   theory
today  and uhm  i will try to  apply it  to  sophocles
edipus  rex edipus the king  a greek play  which is cutting
across  uh  not only time but also space  not because the greeks
had come here  at the time of the chanakya serial  but because 
uh there is a common ground 
""
the humanist  outlook says that  there must be  certain
common grounds but you have to dig deep  may not be on the surface 
""
at the appropriate level you will find the connections  just as
we can discover that we are related to  the eskimos in some  way if
we go back  far behind in history   clearing the throat 
""
the whole paper has been written out  uhm and you will get
copies  before it appears in  some book 
""
so i will  read it out with some comments here and there 
""
now scholars from the time of bharata  have been conscious of
this principle of  auchitya  
""
it was shemendra of the eleventh century  who devoted a whole
treaties  to its discussion  and thereby raised it to the level of a
basic requisite of all successful literary creations 
""
bharata thinks of it as a principle that ensures  guna
  or qualities and eschews or removes  blemishes or 
doshas  
""
according to him the bharata  the violation of  auchitya
 of some kind or other might be responsible for any one of the ten
 identified  doshas  
""
that doesn't mean that there are only ten blemishes or ten kinds of
blemishes 
""
ten have been identified  because uh  you can't  uh list
all possible types of  blemishes  we categorise 
""
that we do in modern times also 
""
the concept of  auchitya  is employed in bharatas
prescriptions  for the successful staging of plays 
""
although the word  auchitya  might not have been
used by him 
""
in the same way bharata then  one word  vamana anandvasna
 have all recognised the importance of  auchitya  
""
but it was left to shemendra as i said the earlier  to project
the view that  auchitya  is a fundamental principle  and
that all other qualities will fail to have their effect if this principle is
ignored 
""
so  rasa   without  auchitya  will
not work  that is called  rasa auchitya   he list them
all 
""
shemendra has identified  twenty-seven or twenty-eight aspects
or areas in which  auchitya  can be perceived 
""
now we must remember that these are  these texts have come to
us in a mangled form  parts are missing  and the works of many
scholars have totally disappeared  they are only remembered as 
abstract names 
""
uh but what what has been saved or salvaged  gives us some idea
of what can be done with some of these tools 
""
these may be brought under five or six broad heads  these
twenty-seven or twenty-eight aspects which he has listed  under names for
instance   pada vakya prabandha   uh i have a  list
of uh these items and their translations 
""
i think  i'll  read the  english translations also you
know  the the   auchitya  at the sentence level  is
called uh  vakya auchitya  auchitya  at the discourse level
 is called  prabandharth auchitya  
""
then  we have items under  kavya shastra  guna
alankara  and  rasa   that is uh under metaphor
 kavya shastra  and under poetics we have certain items 
uh like  rasa auchitya alankara auchitya guna auchitya   so
 guna  by itself will not be a  guna   if it
is in the wrong place  if it is not used with  propriety 
""
on the other hand  what may be called a  dosha 
by itself  may become a  guna  if it is  used with
 auchitya 
""
yesterday we pointed out that uh   jugupsa  
and uh  bibhatsa  which we find in uhm uhm  naipaul  may
be considered  gunas  in his type of work  not in somebody
elses  kind of work 
""
so there is a kind of  uh a justification on the basis of the
appropriateness of the whole thing to the  literary context 
""
under  vyakarna   which is the major concern of
these uh  scholars  we have   pada kriya karaga  linga
vachana visheshana upsarga nibhava  and   kala  
or uh words level  verb level  case  gender  the appropriate
gender has to be used
""
i will  in my comment on uhm  sophocles play  i will
comment on some of these 
""
uh the use of number  use of adjective the use of preposition
 the use of article use of tense  there should be  appropriateness
in all this grammatical features as well  in a  perfect work 
""
but perfect works are rare and therefore you will be able to 
identify violations of these  auchitya  which is called
 auchitya bhanga  
""
under  loktantra   shemendra lists  as i said
yesterday  desa  kula  and  vrata   or
place  race  and conduct 
""
and there  you can bring in all kinds of sociological criticism
""
""
if it doesn't  suit  the particular class or race that is
presented in a work
""
for example if the   nishada  character the
woodsman character in a play  speaks a high level sanskrit  utterance
you know that will be inappropriate 
""
so  propriety or appropriateness  has to be observed in the
kind of characters that is presented  and that was the  idea 
otherwise it can violate
""
so there is a  chance for  sociological criticism to find
its way if this is expanded but unfortunately  uh it had not been done in
ancient india 
""
then under the  title under the section  kavi 
 or the poet  we have a   tatva 
""
""
what is  vrata vratasan  ?
""
""
 vrata  is conduct  behavior 
appropriate behaviour for that man you know
""
if a priest is presented as a character i think he has to 
conduct himself in that way 
""
that  that's  the meaning i give to it you know uh uh  i
think i have every right to use the ancestral property in my own way 
""
and uhm when i have the term  loktantra  and 
that's   kula  and  vrata  i think  we
have to get at them implied meaning 
""
literary criticism is also  interpretation of critical theories
not only  critical works i mean creative works 
""
interpretation of critical works also has to be done  that is
what uh  abhinav gupta did to  anandvardhana  when he
wrote  lochana   as a commentary  on uh 
dhavnyaloka    it's  an explication   it's  a
creative  expansion of the basic ideas of  anandvardhana
  which had continued for uh  centuries until everything
seems to have stopped  with jagannath pandit and appaya  richir 
and that is the thread we have to pick up 
""
 it's  very un  palatable to english teachers  to try
to do something which they have not  done  thirty forty years ago 
""
uh and the  indian language teachers are also very reluctant to
do this 
""
they haven't done this apart from discussing the theory they don't
 seem to apply this to any modern novel 
""
 premchand's  novels could be  discussed in the light of
some of these  a total interpretation of tagore  is possible but  we
have failed to do that 
""
and uh  i am here to  pain you by saying that we haven't done
many of the things  and explanation is  the british were there and we
could not do 
""
an english teacher need not feel that english is the last vistage
of colonialism you know 
""
teachers of english are not yet to perpetuate  uh western values
but they can  accept  everything from the west provided they are
understood and absorbed into the system in which we operate 
""
then uh   tatva  satva  we have the  uh
 clearing the throat  the  the principles observed  the level
of consciousness of  satva  abhipraya  or the intention
  swabhava  or character  and characterisation which
 is  becomes uh very important  substance imagination situation
thought name in the naming of characters  in  aashirwad 
or benediction 
""
so in every aspect if you take a  play for instance  you
will find examples of all these  and a a total interpretation of any
single play by using all these insights 
""
now some of them may not be applicable  to certain works 
every theory has its  built-in  limitation  and a theory survives
because of its acceptance of certain limitations 
""
if we recognise the limitation we can make use of it 
""
and uh if doesn't work  throw away the theory  and not the
literary work  this is the basic principle 
""
a theory may not apply because  a theory is a very broad
generalisation   it's  only a model 
""
and under  kavyangas  which are not totally listed
 three have been  uh identified  patra  prameya 
and   sandarbha   characterisation or  rabatra
 or  patra   and  prameya  or theme
 and  sandarbha  or context 
""
so uh if  a uh good interpreter of this theory can  develop
even as shemendra  discussed this theory in a book  one word 
study  in the eleventh century 
""
we could  elaborate each of these  and give it meaning
because   it's  a part of a total scheme 
""
and if you find any one of these not applicable to a 
particular work i think you can reject that or ignore it for the time being
that is how literary criticism is possible
