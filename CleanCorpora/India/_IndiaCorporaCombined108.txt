all right now we've been looking at catford's theory of  that doesn't mean uh you should not write  okay just because it's being recorded doesn't mean that you shouldn't take down notes  of course you will have to  uh let us first look at the way he uh we have seen at uh we have looked at his theory of language  this is basically a model of language description which is borrowed from halliday  uh which is known as a scale in category model of uh english  grammar  now let's turn to his discussion of and classification of translation type now catford's theory of translation is essentially a product oriented theory  why do we call it a product oriented theory ? because his main attempt is to look at different kinds of translation and classify these translations into different categories   he's not looking into the mind of a translator  he is looking at the object of translation  the object that the translator has produced  which means that he is looking at the empirical product of translation  what has been actually produced  and he is not looking at what was going behind the translation in the mind of the translator  so this theory is often called a product orientated theory of translation because the approach here is empirical  it tries to analyse classify categorise translations  products of translations into different types  now for catford a theroy of translation is essentially concerned  with a certain type of relation between languages  and therefore he calls it a branch of comparative linguistics  now in this he is very much his approach is very much like the approach of halliday  halliday also if you remember argues that translation is not an independent branch of dis or discipline    uh it is a branch of comparative linguistics  where you compared languages so to establish the comparability between languages  how far they are structurally similar or dissimilar you use translation  catford however goes on to define the translation process  further  he says translation is always unidirectional that is you can always translate at one time from one language to another and not vice versa  that is translation has a direction from english into marathi or marathi into english unidirection  one direction  at one time you can't translate from both english into marathi as well as marathi into english it will have to be a unidirectional process from one language to another  that language from which you translate is called a source language and the language into which you translate is called a target language  and translation is defined as the replacement of  write down the definition please the replacement of textual material in one language that is s l by eqivalent textual material in another language  now obviously there are two key terms in this definition  one is textual material and another is   eqivalent textual material  the term eqivalent  so essentially he is talking about a particular type of text and a particular type of eqivalence  these are the key operations key terms in translation  so before we go on to to discuss the term of the term   eqivalent let us look at the types of translation  uh that he argues there exist  these categories of translations or types of translations are  proposed in terms of extent of translation level of translation and rank of translation  level of translation extent of translation and rank of translation  let us first look at the classification according to the extent of translation that he proposes   there are in each of these there are two types of translations for in all there are six categories of translation that he proposes  so according to the extent to which you translate a text  how much of the text you are translating in a syntagmatic sense  in the linear sense syntagmatic means linear  so are you taking the full text for translation or are you taking only half of the text for translation ? how much of of the text are you taking up for translation based upon this this is known as the extent of translation  now he says if you take the entire text for translation it is known as full translation  if you take only half of the text it will be partial translation so full versus partial translation  now this text may be anything alright it may be a single poem it may be a book of short stories  collection of short stories it may be essays a novel whatever  it can be only a sentence also  text will depend upon how much you have taken as a unit which can be once again of course sub-divided into different units if you take the totality of the text in translation uh you translate the entire text it is full translation if you translate only part of it it is known as partial translation and this relates to the term extent of translation so he proposes three terms extent level and rank  and the first classification according to the extent is full versus partial translation  now in partial translation once again obviously some parts of the text are left untranslated  this may happen for various reasons for example if you are translating the description of a marriage ceremony uh from marathi into english  if there is a sentence sanaiche mangal sur  hote ghumat hote  how will you translate the term sanai    you can't because there is no equivalent for  sanai  now in that case probably we'll have to keep some of these terms just like that in the translation  you will have to say uh i don't know how you would translate this into english but you will have to keep the word sanai  if you might probably say shahnai   okay to make it sound different from the marahti item but you are not proposing any english eqivalent term for  shahanai or sanai  so there may be different reasons why you increase parts sometimes there are no equivalent terms there are no equivalent concepts also  in that case case you will have to keep the term as it is uh in the uh translated text so there are different reasons for why you uh have to adopt the processes of partial translation  now the other uh distinction that he proposes relates to the level of language in question  this classification according to the level of translation uh  is proposed as total translation versus restricted translation  now total translation means translation made at all levels of the source language  when we looked at the theory of language that he was proposing he discussed  he said that he talks about different levels of organization of language for example there is a phonological level there is a morphological level there is a syntactic level  these are all different levels of language now what level are you translating for example he gives later on an example of if you write indian airline  the word indian word indian airline you can write that in english i n d i a n a i r l i n e s or you can also write write it in e and then a nukta on top d with kana matra ya and  na this is also possible you can use uh devanagari script in other words so in restricted translation in total translation you are taking you are proposing translation equivalence at all levels of  the text morphological syntactic etcetera and graphalogical also  now the problem is only uh you don't have equivalence between graphalogical level  you can't have equivalence between graphological level because these are two substances so there won't be any equivalence between these two but you can say that there is equivalence in sentence structure  noun phrases uh word okay or uh clauses main clause-main clause relative clause-relative clause this can happen so in total translation equivalence are proposed at all levels in restricted translation you have you have  replacement uh of only of few levels okay uh once again the third is uh the rank of translation now we use in traditional terminology we use free  translation uh as a term literal translation or free translation  now catford classification of translation type here  unbounded and bounded translation   bounded is rank bound translation and unbounded is translation which is not rank bound which shift up and down on the scale  now let us look at what this means exactly  if is there is a sentence which has a noun phrase and a verb phrase  you translate noun phrases as noun phrases so article by article adjective by adjective a noun by noun  phrase by phrase clause by clause  this is that is the rank of there are different ranks we know  the rank of clause sentence phrase word and sound  your translation may be tied to these ranks  as i said article by article noun by noun adjective by adjective adverb by adverb this is verb by verb this is possible when you translate like this it is known as rank bound translation  sentence by sentence translation that is also rank bound translation within that sentence you may have rank shifting  when we were discussing the scale of rank rank shifting  we discussed that phenomenon of rank shifting and we said that when a sentence a clause for example functions as part of n p we say that a  clause is actually in the higher category and the word or the phrase is actually in the lower category  but a clause can function as a part of the phrase  right ? when we say the boy who was standing in the corner  now who was standing in the corner is a clause which is part of a phrase noun phrase  here we see rank shifting taking place  where rank shifting takes place we say that it is unbounded translation  it is not rank bound  sometimes in traditional terminology when we say that this translation is literal translation and this translation is uhm free translation these are the terms which we usaully proposed you might be asked a question on this uh the difference between traditional terminology of describing translation products and  terminology used by catford  now in traditional terminology we use the term free and literal  in both senses  right in when we talk about literal translation  we may mean uh word by word translation   literal translation word by word or we may also mean sentence by sentence translation  the traditional classification is rather vague  sentence by sentence also becomes literal word by word also becomes literal or meaning by meaning also becomes literal  if you translated a phrase such as kakhet kalasa  and gavala valasa  if you translate this literally word by word it will give some very funny meaning i suppose in english  that will be literal translation where you are totally ignoring the meaning uh you are translating each word but that meaning is not going to be the meaning of that particular proverb there  there can be also example i gave you some examples from the bible je majakadun tijmadhye janmvile te  a case of rank bound translation case of rank bound translation case of literal translation  but remember rank bound is much more clear and definite clearly defined because you know that this is the rank of clause or sentence or phrase or word or sound for phoneme  whereas in literal translation the term is rather vague because in literal translation it can be anything  it can be sentence uh by sentence translation word by word  meaning by meaning okay  but literal translation will always be rather awkward  unless the two languages are absolutely identical which would very rarely be the case it would be a very awkward translation  whereas unbounded translation see we are establishing  clarity between the terms that catford proposes and the terms that have been proposed in traditional translation criticism  catford proposes terms like unbounded and bounded    bounded is according to the traditional terminology literal translation  and we saw the difference between these two terms  in uh unbounded translation you can take liberties with the text that means that sometimes a whole sentence may be translated in a word it is possible to do that  or one for one word you may use one sentence  sometimes in unbounded translation catford doesn't discuss this possibility but it is possible to even delete or add portions of the text add to the portions of the text or you can delete some parts of the text this is possible
