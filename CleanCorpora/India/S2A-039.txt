""
""
 i've  also wanted to enlist you  uh another very
important  writer  margaret  atwood  margaret atwood and
robinson they each together  are  very much nationalists 
""
nationalist in the sense  that they have  raised their voice
 against the  imperialistic dominition of their country 
""
the situation is something like this   cough  on the one
hand there is the imperial  britain  from which they have not been
able to see the  a few words  
""
so the britain  is the exploiting power  the conventional
 relationship with britain  on the one hand  and  america on
the other side  because across the border is america  which is as
well  capitalistic exploitative  society 
""
if they don't  uh  bow  or  if they don't release
them  or if they resist  the  influence of the neighbour 
then this is a very difficult situation 
""
resisting a neighbour is more difficult than resisting somebody 
at a distance  because  you can't  you have to come  into
contact daily  contact  with the neighbour  with whom you have to
workout a relatioship in which  there will be co-operation  and wanted
or unwanted help 
""
you can't escape the influence of neighbour 
""
and the neighbour is another evil  which wants to dominate  as
we have seen at the very outset that there was a clash of interest and ideas
at the beginning which  brought out uh two nation of canada and america
  cough 
""
so america  wants to exploit canada  capitalistically 
""
and there is another type of relationship with britain 
parental relationship  that too is very painful  to receive at 
what has canada to do 
""
where is the choice  ?
""
either you say   good bye  to your parentage  or
you say good bye to your neighbour  or you allow yourself  to be
doubly  exploited  
""
both of them are exploitative 
""
this is the worry 
""
and margaret atwood  has raised her voice  particularly 
against   the  what is called  the fashion of   women's
 liberation movement that swept  the whole of europe  some decades
back 
""
we saw to liberate  the western women  margaret atwood says
 through her fiction  that it is not feasible  it is not possible
 it is another way of  uh self detention 
""
the books  which she has prominently  written  which
are which have made her prominent  are   the  adable 
women   and  surfacing   both the books
 deal with this problem of  influence  of the neighbour  and
of them  of you know 
""
the west  uh the the  women's  liberation movement  is
  europe's   gift  in which  the women doesn't know what
exactly she should do  in order to be called a  liberated women 
""
so she is advised to  say  good bye to all the
conventions  all the conventional morality  like  the institution
of marriage 
""
again  about  amphly  and clara  the two women 
characters in the  adam and who   have been discussing this 
""
clara is a married person 
""
joe  the husband  of clara  is always impregnating her
 and then  every time there is a  child 
""
and who nurses  the child  ?
""
the mother only  gives the birth  the rest of the  care
is taken by father  feeding  washing  clothing  everything 
""
his  poses  according to our  writer  atwood is
problem of  father image  and the mother image 
""
what will the child  think  ?
""
who is the father  ?
""
the child will more likely answer  a person  who feeds 
who cooks  who washes  is the father 
""
who is the mother  ?
""
a person who sits  enjoys  sleeps  reads  writes is the
mother 
""
there is a clash 
""
there is the projection of the clash  of values 
""
the value system  will stand changed 
""
and our  one word   goes a step further 
""
she says   why worry at all  admitted  that a
 women's  life is made unfulfilled  until she has a child 
""
""
that is the question of  women  but that does not
necessarily mean  that she should marry  where is the logic 
marriage is a social institution 
""
it does not necessarily mean  for someone to produce children
 that he or she should marry someone 
""
you can have the children even outside the wedlock 
""
so you chose your man 
""
you know  one word  him  a child is born  good bye to
the man 
""
the child will also mean   i'm  the mother  my
fulfillness in my lap  to hell with you man get away from you  that
can be one solution 
""
the problem will be  the problem will be   laughter 
how do you know  who is the boy  you see  there is a real problem
""
""
if you are  a woman liberationist  and if you are a woman
 you want to break away from all of the convention  may be  then
you should actually prefer  to be the mother of a girl child 
""
this is what the logic is 
""
but no mother  no mother has ever thought of  a child
inside the womb as  there for a girl every mother thinks of  the child
as he 
""
what is this he  ?
""
why always he  even though you are claiming or shouting from the
rooftop that you are liberated woman that you are no longer a slave of man
""
""
the same problem  of slavery  man's  slavery  you
have become over traditional in mental theory of the covention  which
accords greater status higher status to man 
""
so  even though you are a liberationist  you are still
thinking of your child about whom you don't know  as a he
""
it means you are still pining for a male child 
""
this is a thought this is a very embarassing  for  for all
 women 
""
so our uh uh puts up this question  to which there is no answer
except that  ultimately  we arrive at a conclusion that marriage 
is a co-institution 
""
it solves many problems  not only of the personality  of the
feminist  but even of cohesion  of harmony  in the society 
""
and thereby she seems to reject  this wave of  women's 
liberation  that has come from europe
""
the  parental  left 
""
in such a theme  she finds   that  a terrible mistake
""
""
there seems to be an american  in the pristine forest  she
finds that americans are  poaching  americans are there looking for
 the  wealth which they can exploit the natural wealth 
""
so if they are  boating  in the lake  the american is
always interested  in finding out whether there is a good amount of fish
 which he can  perhaps later  how to exploit it 
""
in the forest  pristine dense  green forest  our 
margaret atwood finds  uh beautifully located  huts  over which
the americans c i a agents have an eye and they want to have 
""
such properties  where they can plant themselves  in order to
espionage 
""
so  we can say  that here is a writer a woman writer 
who has very much identified herself  with the problems and establishments
of her country 
""
she has identified  but she has not been able to find an answer
 and this  inability of the writer to find an answer  to the complex
problems of   two words  full  and neighbourly  uh compulsion
 which has created a very ordinary event situation
""
 it's  at the present  incidentally is the hallmark of
women creative writing 
""
and  they are  uneducated   they can't meet  seem
to know what exactly they should do 
""
so this type of situation  has attracted  or marked the
writing of  the character 
""
uh however there is an exception 
""
that too is a little  along the line  because we have so
far discussed  english speaking novelist  writers 
""
let us go to the french  canada 
""
and i have selected and talk  for a few minutes 
""
 i've  selected  to introduce you  a very prominent
french  canadian writer premjeet roy 
""
premjeet roy  has written a novel  uh  where 
the  hen's  will nest  where the  hen's  will nest
 
""
this is  a novel about  a very very remote area 
uninhabited  by  the people 
""
and there is only one family  after  traversing the land 
crossing various streams and waters you reach a place  where there is only
one family 
""
and that family is a french speaking catholic 
""
and this  lousina  the woman  has a problem 
""
she has eight children 
""
she is an educated woman 
""
she occasionaly visits  uh centres 
""
uh let me introduce you to which we can call  centres of
civilization 
""
she keeps in touch with the  modern world in order to know that
 the progress  or the new i mean uh  or the new things  that are
happening 
""
must be known to these people and they must not be deprived of the
 of the latest  only because  there is some problem  ?
""
is it because of me  ?
""
uh uh i hope  these external things are not against me  
laughter 
""
can we do something about it  ?  interruption 
""
so she occasionally  i don't mind if  uh it doesn't work uh
 interruption  but this will continue yes 
""
so she goes 
""
she has a problem  of education  of her children
""
she is living  as a family unit in a remote  forest area
""
""
and she is very much worried about the education of her children
because  the canada government stipulates   that's  in order to
 sanction a school  there should be atleast six pupils 
""
she has five 
""
at present she has five  and one is too small  to be
admitted or enrolled  as a pupil 
""
but she nevertheless  writes to the government  and they
mercifully appoint  a teacher 
""
the first teacher  is a catholic  woman 
""
the moment she comes  she endears herself  mixes with the
family  becomes a member or part of the family  teaches very
meticulously 
""
she is very punctual 
""
she wants  to take full interest  without wasting a moment
""
""
so one year passes 
""
the education of these children for one year has taken place 
""
there is a transfer 
""
the next  woman teacher  is an english  woman 
""
and the moment she comes  she finds  fault with everything
that exist there 
""
she starts complaining oh  what a stretch i have had to travel
  i'm  tired and  i'm  bored   i'm  as if  in
a  in an undesirable situation 
""
i feel very much  unhappy here 
""
and what are these people   lousina's 
""
they have not provided  a good accomodation to me 
""
the food also is not  palatable to me 
""
the children are also very dirty
""
they don't have good habits 
""
she starts complaining 
""
she complains and complains 
""
but she stays on 
""
and  she's  looked after by lousina  as she did in the
case of the earlier teacher 
""
she was a french  here is an english 
""
she does not give any chance  of complain to this woman 
""
but this woman by nature is fussy  as we call such people 
""
she is also transfered 
""
and when she is transfered she realises oh  the place was 
not so bad after all 
""
i could have  stayed on
""
why have they transfered 
""
the two types of attitude at the beginning and at the end 
""
and lousina does not feel  uh  that she should complain
against the teacher because she finds  the great advantage  of an
english speaking  teacher being made available to her children because
otherwise  her children would never have a chance to learn english 
particularly in the context  of the modern world in which english has
become a lingua franca 
""
if  her  childre  her children  were given 
education or instruction only in french  they would  lose the
advantages of  the world wide  uh  contact  spread of
kmowledge  etcetera etcetera 
""
so she  feels that  it's  a very good event  that
 this  coach   as the british teacher have come  and 
she feels thankful to the  arrival of these two teachers
""
however  the third teacher is a male 
""
he is a french  male  a bachelor  unmarried 
""
when he comes  he doesn't take any interest in teaching
children
""
he says   teaching will take place afterwards  don't
worry
""
let me go to the nature  let me enjoy i feel very happy
""
 i'll  shoot   i'll  fish  
""
and he would retire to the jungle  put a cap on his eyes 
and sleep there 
""
and he says  education will take place   we'll 
see  to that part of duty later  let me enjoy 
""
he enjoys  he always 
""
he starts calling her mama   oh mama  
mother 
""
and  he is interested in eating good things  always demands
this and that does not feel shy  or constraint 
""
and then he also receives  the transfer orders 
""
he does not disclose it 
""
but all of a sudden there is a change in his attitude 
""
he becomes very serious  in teaching  these children 
""
and they realise that this man has a wonderful store of knowledge
""
""
he teaches them wonderful things very advanced things 
""
and before he goes  he completes  what he calls his course
""
""
so there is no complaint 
""
lousina loves to have this man  as a teacher 
""
she says   why don't you stay on   ?
""
 write to the government  we'll  also write 
that your  stay here should be extended 
""
the man says  no  thank you for all the hospitality and
the care you took of me 
""
but   i'm  going on promotion 
""
and  i'm  going to a place where i would like to make my
career 
""
this is not the place  where i can make my career 
""
so even though i love the place  i have enjoyed it but mum 
i will not tie my career  
""
we will leave the narrative here and discuss the merits 
because  we find the time constraint 
""
now what happens is this  canada is a bilingual country 
""
as i already said at the  said at the outset  that there are
 language problems  and there are  nationality problem 
""
there is a talk of separation 
""
but here is a message  from  a french woman writer  who
seems to be advocating  the coexistence  of the two  and not
encouraging the separation or division in society in the polity 
""
 he   she  seems to be possessing  that english
 is alright for the french  because the french  as you know 
hate  english 
""
they hate everything that is english 
""
they would not  speak a word in french canada  if you talk
to them in english 
""
that is not acknowledged 
""
so this type of hatred should cease  because english 
learning  has its own advantages 
""
and she seems to feel it  that  there could be harmony 
in the society only if we didn't talk of the differences 
""
at a party she invites  she invites  all the types of
people available there
