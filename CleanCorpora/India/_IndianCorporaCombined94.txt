 raj bhavan   raj bhavan  now i called your residence yeah i was told that you are going to airport right  so uh you will be coming there along with him or no no no uhn he is going to raj bhavan   uhn  ah  i'll come back to campus uhm uhm then uh i'll probably you know still little bit ahead of time uh  and then somebody will go to dr one word  will go to raj bhavan to bring him i see  i was looking at the airport uhm whether he wants anybody to come there  uhm  yeah  or he'll come earlier yeah  now uh you see is the speech going to be recorded  no we wanted to record uhm the taperecorder doesn't seem to be working  uhm  uh do you have a transistor recorder ? uhn i've uh i don't have a transister recorder but you know my friend as you know dr s v shastri uhm uhm  uh he has come here for today uhm and he is doing some u g c project uhm uhm  for which spoken english so he wants to record uhm uhm so he has got a taperecorder and everything ah  so he was keen to record that   ah  uh you see the he shivaraj patil's and the text of his speech is ready uhm and he's suppose to bring it to the airport uhm but still he will deliver it  yeah  so you can bring it it may be good if you can record it  uhm   uhm   yeah  yeah but only i wanted your permission no it'll be a welcome uhm because university is saying this thing is not working ah so if you  maybe come a little bit earlier yeah then they can plug in and test it yeah because you that mike condition system we don't know  uhm   ah   yeah   yeah   that's right  so he'll be there before i will you know come with him   ahn or he may come directly uh before four thirty  ahn  very good that'll be nice uh so you will be there  i will be there and muralidhar and gosaval yeah but your those people will have to be told yeah oh yes i'll if i'm not there  uhm you'll have to wait yeah  untill muralidhar yeah because he will be there till  everything starts  uhm   yeah   yeah  and he has got a very sophisticated system like in the t v  uhm the person you know if he puts that uh to his shirt  uh uh then the voice is recorded very accurately  that is how he recorded for the last time  uhm   ah  no but in this in this case uh  uh i don't know whether that would be possible  we have a system whereby uhn see it is connected from the mike   uhn  mike that type uhn that will be better  uhn  yeah because he'll be speaking into the mike yeah any way if uh will he will   let him bring it  supposing his equipment has separate mike uhm that also can be put it put there yeah and we can put it somewhere some side table uhm uhm  it will be good if he comes a little early uhm  so it can be tested  uhm  yeah  sometimes uhm instruments of this and that won't match  uhm   that's right  so so i am going to airport okay that will be twelve thirty he is coming   okay  yeah so i want detail no ?
