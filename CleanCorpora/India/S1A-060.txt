""
""
uhm  so your basic specialisation is actually literature

""
but uh 
""
""
who are the authors you are reading  ?
""
""
well uh uh  ma  reading or  uh teaching  ?
""
""

""
""
teaching well we start from the  middle ages 
""
so we start with harbeley and  uh    uhm  we go
on to  uh the eighteenth century voltaire  rousseau    uhm
uhm  uhm  then ninteenth century we have all the romantic poets 
""
""
 uhm  
""
""
 uhm uhm  
""
""
uhm uhm 
""
""
and uh  the realist flau bert
""
""
uhm uhm 
""
""
madame bowary    oh  this this uh  well known
author
""
""
 oh  
""
""
uhm  uh alright coming to your evening courses in the
certificate of proficiency course  uh what is the text book you are
following  ?
""
""
uh we have this book called uh  
alizee-acutes de francais  
""
""
  alizee-acutes de francais
  
""
""
yeah   it's  a  it's  a  it's  a a
very recent uh  book 
""
""
uhm uhm   they stated all the new methods 
""
""
 taken in   all the new methods and did well 
but uh    uhm  it is a good book
""
""
 uhm  
""
""
good book
""
""
good book yeah 
""
""
is it one   book for the  entire certificate
""
""
 no  it's  the three  
""
""
 it's  no  it's  uh  yeah entire certificate
is one book 
""
i mean we have three  uh three volumes 
""
the   first one  second one third one 
""
so those we use for the certificate uh the diploma and the advanced
  diploma 
""
""
 oh you have  
""
""
 advanced   diploma
""
""
so we don't always uh  finish the entire book itself
""
 it's  a little too much
""
""
uhm
""
""
so we say about the  three fourth of the the book we do
with the c o p    uhm  then we continue with the diploma
""
""
 uhm  
""
""
uhm 
""
""
three fourth of the second book and then we continue with the
third book uh  the second and the third book uh  for the advanced
diploma
""
""
uhm
""
""
of course we supplement it with  our own materials 
""
""
uhm uhm 
""
""
what is the book uh you follow for  uh russian ?
""
""
uh you see we have several text books available but  uh i
normally use uh  a book called   russki yuzik dlya vsekh
  that means you know  russian for everybody
 
""
 it's  called  russian for everybody  
""
 it's  a whole set of books actually  it has one text
book
""
""
uhm 
""
""
and there is one latest stock  so a lot of conversation 
jokes  anecdotes  they are all there 
""
then a book of exercises 
""
these excercises they normally do at home
""
""
uhm 
""
""
then we also have a book called  you know  
reader 
""
""
uhm 
""
""
uh   kniga dlya chtee- acuteniya
  this is a book  there are some stories etcetera
there
""
""
uhm 
""
""
they read it like  non-detailed text
""
""
yeah 
""
""
plus there is a  small dictionary  which gives all the
words which are used in the text book and all these books 
""
plus there is one small reference grammar 
""
now this grammar  uh explains all the grammar used in  you
know lesson-wise again
""
""
yeah 
""
""
so  that way  it's  a nice compact one 
""
""
yeah actually our courses has a casette which goes with it
""
""
uhm 
""
""
it it has  uh uh book meant for the teacher  guide for
the teacher
""
""
uhm 
""
""
and uh it has a book of exercises    uhm  like as
you said we do these excercises we give them these exercises to do at home
""
""
 uhm  
""
""
uhm 
""
""
and uh  there is a casette which goes with all  the
lessons in those  uh in the books are recorded on the casettes plus there
are some oral exercises on the casette which we do in class uh
""
""
uhm uhm 
""
""
then which is not always very convenient because when we have
a very big class of about hundred students to get them to hear the whole
casette is  uh  it's  quite difficult  so
""
""
our set also goes with a casette but it is optional
""
sometimes casettes are available  sometimes they are not
available 
""
but when they are available they are very useful
""
""
yeah 
""
""
so that way  if there is a casette then you don't even
need a teacher
""
you can really learn the whole thing from the text book  from
the  whole set
""
you see it is a set which is very useful it is good 
""
i like that very much  but in fact i started this thing only to
ask you about this 
""
the problem we face is  there are good text books like this uh
  russian for everybody   but they are simply not
available  now because of the soviet   union  one word  and
all 
""
""
 yeah nor did our books    uh our books are not
available either because uh  i mean they are available but uh  they
cost about three hundred fifty to four hundred  rupees  each
""
""
""
uhm 
""
""
which is uh 
""
""
very high
""
""
too high   students  can't expect students to buy
them at all
""
""
uhm 
""
""
so what we do is we get them xeroxed 
""
""
uhm uhm
""
""
means we don't get the book of exercises xeroxed  those we
pick out exercise which  can be done by the students
""
we get them uh  typed photo copies    uhm uhm  just
a few of them
""
""
 uhm uhm  
""
""
uhm uhm 
""
""
and uh  the others we do in class
""
""
uhm 
""
""
but the book as such we get it xeroxed  the main book 
""
""
uhm uhm 
""
""
and uh that it works out much cheaper than  buying the
book
""
""
uhm uhm 
""
""
means cost about eighty  rupees  to get 
 the  them xeroxed
""
""
uhm 
""
""
i think okay  only thing you miss out of the colours and
uh  means there is a lot of play on colours etc., in the  in the book
 pictures  full of pictures you lose out on all that  you know
without uh  with the xeroxed copy
""
""
uhm  always this is the greatest problem we are facing
""
we just can't buy books they are simply not available 
""
library of course has several copies  but then these are all
part time students    yeah  so we cannot give the books to them
from the library   if they take and if they don't return   
it's  a terrible problem
""
""
 yeah  
""
""
 in fact they are not even among uh  
""
""
yeah they can sit and  read it 
""
""
right they can sit but at home you   required  
require   a text book when you are learning
""
so  text book   has a 
""
""
 so what   have you been doing  uh have you
been xeroxing them or uh 
""
""
with some great difficulty last year we could get uh  a
couple of books for some students 
""
so they were even sharing books like uh  one book for two
students  whatever was available 
""
i don't know what will happen next year  next year
""
""
can't you get xeroxed copies  i mean uh
""
""
now xeroxing the whole set or whatever  you know there are
lots of pictures  photos etcetera 
""
and you cannot avoid it because uh  you know photos are  are
going with the text 
""
""
yeah
""
""
so every thing is  uh text is there photographs are there
 pictures are there  diagrams are there  all these things are there
""
""
and if you want to take photocopies of the whole thing it become
very expensive  extremely expensive 
""
""
or may be you could  uh may be get out some copies from
the library and keep them with you and give them to the students in class 
""
not let them take them home 
""
""
but if they don't   return   if they don't
return means it will
""
""
 but uh  
""
""
ha no  you don't allow them to take it home
""
you allow them to read them in class
""
""
but at home
""
""
atleast in class they will have a book 
""
""
but they  badly require a text book at home   
yeah  how will you do the exercise  how will you study 
""
you have to kind of  after going home you have to revise your
lessons  you must read what has been taught in the class
""
""
 yeah  
""
""
yes exactly 
""
""
so you have to have the text books
""
so  it's  a great problem we are now facing 
""
i don't know what will be done in future maybe    they'll
 
""
""
 but   couldn't you have chosen  uh some other
book which   is uh or  readily available
""
""
 now the other  
""
""
the reason uh  problem now is that in fact no book is
available  not a single book is available  even those which are
popular
""
""
not even wagner is it 
""
""
 wa  even wagner which is published in delhi  
and which is not available now 
""
""
i thought wagner was available in uh  in uh
""
""
yeah right now in advanced diploma i am using wagner  and
even that is not available now 
""
""
oh so  you've   you've  still uh 
""
""
still i couldn't.
""
we are producing a possibility of it. 
""
nobody has got 
""
""
so you are still continuing with wagner you haven't thought
""
""
""
no wagner i use for the advanced diploma course  third
year course  first year second year i follow this  russian for
everybody    that's  what i   did   do 
 with my students now  same batch which i now  and then uh i have
switched over to wagner now  now they are doing on wagner  in higher
diploma
""
""
but that  is it the other two uh volumes  to wagner or
is it just one book  ?
""
""
one book 
""
""
 it's  just one book
""
""
wagner is a one book   of the huge   sixty-two
lessons
""
""
  it's  huge  
""
""
i did my c o p to advanced diploma with wagner   
yeah  russian
""
""
 yeah  
""
""
uhm 
""
""
but for the c o p we found it was uh  too  too 
authentic  
""
""
uhm  it is  it is like an encyclopaedia
""
""
 it's  like an encyclopaedia  it's   uh 
it's  like a dictionary
""
""
how exactly
""
""
with a list of words which are very difficult to learn by
heart and specially long russian words which are impossible to remember
""
""
 it's  full of words words words words  it's 
like  one word    in telugu   and then actually  when
we were planning this  there was one problem i was thinking about  i
thought i will discuss this with you because you know you teach french and i
teach russian 
""
i also read some french 
""
i did two years of french here  uh tutkar taught me  shastri
taught me  sometime nelu also taught me for sometime 
""
anyway  and you read some russian 
""
""
yeah 
""
""
see one observation i made always was  while doing this
french  and while teaching russian 
""
you know my observations are based on uh  not only just my
first hand experience  but also  looking at the syllabi  various
universities  i know the  syllabi of uh  nagpur university  uh
poona university   i've  seen  uh even  j n u's  
syllabus  our own syllabus  of osmania university i know very well 
""
what i  somehow you know see is  that in the french courses
 there is some what uh of you know  uh a little more uh emphasis on
the  oral skills  speaking skills  where as the written part 
somehow gets slightly diluted   it's  not  uh taught in such a
nice fashion as the oral skills are taught 
""
in the russian  it is the other way round 
""
""
yeah   there is  emphasis on the  wri  on
  the written  uh yes 
""
""
 in russian  
""
""
 on the written skill  
""
""
yeah  in the russian classes  uh you see we  
given   give   them so many exercises they go on  doing
them like mathematics  so they are very good at reading and writing 
they write well  they answer questions they do exercises  but when it
comes to free conversation like this oral conversation you know just speaking
like this in  uh among people  they are so shy of doing it 
""
they can't do it  russian students somehow just can't speak
russian  whereas french students i feel when they write they  uh commit
quite a number of mistakes you know  lots  of mistakes  but when
they speak they are so fluent you know  they just  very fluently speak
 even among themselves  even when nobody is watching even when there is
absolutely no need for it  i feel french students you know  uh they
love to speak french
