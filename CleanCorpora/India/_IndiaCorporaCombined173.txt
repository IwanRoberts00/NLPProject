hundred and  thirty to nineteen hundred and fifty  uh in this thesis mr jadhav has studied the interaction between the congress party and the different peasant movements  that were launched in maharashtra from nineteen thirty to nineteen fifty  uh there was a very close connection between the growth of congress party and different political movements that were launched by peasants  so the peasants played peasant leaders played a very important role important in maharashtra after nineteen thirty  uh the leaders of bahujan samaj joined congress in nineteen thirty  in nineteen thirty-seven thirty-eight keshav rao jede become the became the president of maharashtra pradesh congress committee so there was a close interaction between the peasant leaders and the congress party  and there was a conflict between the peasant leaders  and uh congress party bosses like shankar rao dev vallabh bhai patel  and balasaheb kher  in this thesis uh mr jadhav discusses the performance of  first and second kher ministry the first ministry was formed in nineteen thirty-seven  under the leadership of balasaheb kher from nineteen thirty-seven to nineteen thirty-nine the kher ministry uh passed many uh legislations regarding the abolition of rural indebtedness or implementation of certain land reforms  the second kher ministry took over in nineteen forty-six  the performance of kher ministry from nineteen forty-six to nineteen fifty is also discussed  during that period the kher minis kher government has passed this important uh the legislation that uh the land reforms legislation that is land to the tiller  and uh there was a close competition between the rural congress leader and the congress bosses  and because of that there was a conflict between mr kher  and mr keshav rao jede and because of that conflict ultimately there was a split in the congress party in nineteen forty-eight and a shetkari kamgar party was established so all these things are discussed by uh mr jadhav in his thesis now we can recommend certain names as related to  so r v one word can be  one minute   two words   two words   two words  mohe  how about two words ?  haan that is two words  you know that   one or two words   one or two words  he is always one word out of contact he has retired  he can contact  a r shinde  what are the next ? what you think  dileep   i think you are very fond of him   actually one or two words included in that uhm  his name was also excluded in that list   diwakar one word  dole  dole is there  hukkeri college  now we should be  we'll add this   one

good for this  congress party uhn congress party and rajshekharaiah will be good for  this theory  haan theory  so then another  these three uh  there addreses we'll have to bring  no one word no problem no problem  the next uh thing is that this one  one student has submitted synopsis for one or two two students have submitted   submitted synopsis for the registration of ph d  now one is dinkar patil the other is n r patil  both the patils again  uh now patil dinkar patil wants to do on political leadership of shri vasantdada patil special reference to his role as chief minister of maharashtra from seventy-seven to eighty-nine  now the guide is guidance of rasam madam uhm  first one reserve it  n r patil  n r patil one word  so it is forwarded by you uhm so that is why you have signed  uhm  uhn yes yes laughs   one word we have to know whether  how far the guide has taken into consideration the various works done jamadar has submitted dissertation  uh previous works have been concentrated on uh the cooperative movement not on vasant dada patil  as a chief minister's work has not been done  he wants he wants to purely concentrate on  as a role of a chief minister   as of chief minister accha  but then you have but that i think he uh  included a chapter on vasant dada patil  but that  vasant dada's role in pre-independent period nineteen seventeen to forty-six  vasant dada's political activity involvement in forty-six to fifty-one so this is all before becoming the chief minister  vasant dada's role as an m l a in nineteen fifty to seventy-one  then comes that is  that everybody know that he was a chief minister vasant dada's role as an immigration   irrigation minister  that has to be done  chapter two vasant dada's patil uh role as  chief minister  that is alright  chapter three vasant dada patil's role as chief minister no the title concerned with political leadership no    that is in consideration  with special reference to chief minister's role affair but the content is  which also as a backdrop you want to tell it as a  want to pass  as a historical background background  background  in the introductory chapter  introductory chapter he should uh he should vasant dada's  introduction  so all the chapters are or based on vasant  dada's patil role as chief minister and the period that is different periods are given specific  dates have been given actually   chief minister   different periods  seventy-seven to eighty five eighty-six eighty-five  eighty-five   eighty-five  then the last chapter you concentrate on that only seventy-seven to eighty-five lot of materials are there  haan  ten years is enough  ten years is enough  and if and if if chief as chief minister  yes  we will record that also  see the problem would you have be  language again whether you will be able to do in english or not  laughs  then afterwards you may again sub require to   submit a an application asking that all materials are kept in marathi and so he would submit it in marathi and all  actually it is going to be very difficult uhn  most of the students are writing in marathi   uhn   marathi  so i think tentatively in principle we accept it  that he may be allowed for registration uhm  but the first chapter has to undergo as we feel that  uhm   we'll put it in the introductory part  no no again how one or two words  look men don't even mention vasant dada's role as pre-independence you can just give a biography  finish  up to uh this one word sixth chapter is not necessary uhm  sixth chapter  from seventy-seven to eighty-five  uhn you just put the title instead of eighty-nine there should be eighty-five  political leadership of shri vasant dada patil with special reference to his role as a chief minister of maharashtra from seventy-seven to wait nineteen eighty-five  nineteen eighty-five and uh there are only uh there are breaks  it's alright  but then the changed synopsis making certain changes in chapter one  to this we'll have the p g section to write to him accordingly yeah   we'll refer to the synopsis again  the changes recommended  now what will be the changes recommended  changes that is from period from seventy nineteen seventy-seven to eighty-five  i think he has included in chapter one all those things   no which you recommended   no  pre-independence to a period vasant dada's  political activities and involvement in nineteen forty-six  his role other than as a chief minister  sir we'll conclude   everything has been included in the introduction  so i don't think there is a need of recommendation no you change the this   we'll change only the last chapter  say introduction delete the last chapter  no let the chapter one be there  let it be vasant dada a biography itself  uh bio  biographical profile profile profile and you want them to include but don't mention these  subtitles uhn  historical biography whatever it might be  biographical  biographical profile profile haan  uhm the last two chapters ommited  now we go to another synopsis which has been submitted by n r patil  n r patil on  hindustan latex limited kanagala district belgaum  a government of india undertaking a case study of one word  what exactly he wants to do ? laxminarayan as a guide you better tell us  hindustan latex limited is a   if you write out  one one synopsis  if he reads i will write it out later on don't worry  okay  tell us  hindustan latex limited  if you read out   i'll read out the synopsis of the student  with uh some omissions and commissions  the title is hindustan latex limited kanagala  district belgaum a government of india undertaking within its parenthesis a case study of the one word organisation is working  so the title indicates that the candidate is studying  admitted to an organised outside of this undertaking public undertaking in his in his synopsis he mentions that there were just five  public undertakings with a total investment of rupees  twenty-nine crores in nineteen fifty-one which has risen to one hundred and eighty-six undertakings with a total investment of worth twenty thousand crores by nineteen eighty  this indicates that public sector undertakings are getting momentum in india  but uh as a guide i should say that number of public  sector undertakings in the country some are no profit no loss basis  some are only dealing profit making  and this actually this undertaking this hindustan latex limited kanagala was established by central health and family welfare ministry on march nineteen eighty-seven  so till today it is hardly some eight years old eight or less than that  this factory is now producing condom mala-d mala-n etcetra and transporting such goods to madras bombay calcutta surat delhi objective of the study the candidate argues that to study the organisation in administrative problems of the hindustan latex limited kanagala it is very essential to understand this study from its perspective of growth of public sector undertakings in india in general  and karnataka in particular  in this context the study tries to understand the origin and growth of this public sector with reference to the public undertakings in india  the major coordination administration the personnel and financial problem as well as problems concerning labourers will be studied  it also studies the production capacity cost of production and transporting goods to outside the country as well as within india  is has also undertaken  for this purpose he has mention his one methodology  it it says that the study based on empirical research  the primary data will be collected by using photo one word  techniques such as interview and questionnaire method  and candidate also argue that he intend to use questionnaire and interview technique for official one word as well as the workers to obtain as clear a view as possible we try to include the governmental official about the problem of raw materials for factory  cost and transportation in relative problems  minutes of the meetings will be used for the purpose of understanding crucial problems concerning this public sector  apart from this primary data secondary data will be collected by using annual report journals periodicals and other published materials relevant to the subject so the data and matter are the subject undertaken by the candidate he feels that he can manage the subject within uh  two words three years or four years which is required for ph d degree and the continuous chapterisation given by the candidate one is introduction second is the profile of the factory third is administrative organisation fourth is production and finance fifth is personnel administration sixth is conclusion and recommendation  so it seems that the candidate wants to comprehend the organisation working of the this public undertaking with reference to  certain broad areas like administrative organisation personnel administration finance production etcetera  i think the candidate can manage the work in the prescribed time limit in parts
