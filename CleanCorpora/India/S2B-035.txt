title   economic imparities of the new government
 
""
the speaker is   shri  prabhakar angre  
""
never in the post-independence history of the country  a
government  has had to face  massive challeges  such as the one 
which is two weeks old government of india  had to endure with 
""
though the government  is solidarily responsible  to find a
solution to economic problem  a lot depends  upon the present finance
minister  in formulating policies  which will take care of the
situation 
""
our main concern today  is to retain the status of non defaulter
 in honouring our financial committments 
""
for the first time after independence  our pay deficit  has
crossed  rupees  ten thousand  crore  
""
our balance of payment position is critical  mainly  due to
our sluggish growth in export  which have been below the set target 
and also a declined  in  n r i remittances 
""
we have had three successive good monsoons  inspite of these
 even the usual seasonal decline in prices of food grains  has not
been experienced  and the inflation  has already crossed  double
digit mark 
""
the economic imparities  before the new government are 
containment of fiscal and revenue deficit  servicing of foreign debt 
contracting  additional foreign debt  to tide over the crisis 
improvement in our foreign exchange reserves  and bringing down the
inflation rate  to four to five percent  within the next two three
years 
""
if politician colleague  of our finance minister  allow him
 to adopt pragmatic policies  and do not pressurise him for adopting
populace measures  he may be able to present a budget  which will be
indicative of his resolve  to take up  the country from its present
morale 
""
according to official estimates  the gap between government
revenue  and its total expenditure  represent eight point five percent
 of countrys gross domestic product  which is estimated in the region
of  rupees  five and eight thousand  crore 
""
""
only the revenue deficit  which was just  rupees 
 one thousand six hundred and sixteen  crore   in
nineteen eighty eighty-one  shot up to  rupees   twelve
thousand four hundred and thirty-six  crores   in nineteen
eighty-nine ninety 
""
our foreign exchange reserves  which were above  seven
million dollars in nineteen eighty  fell to four million dollars in
nineteen eighty-nine  and today  they are just sufficient  to cover
two weeks import of the country 
""
our debts service coverage issue  which was eight percent of
export earnings  in nineteen eighty eighty-one  is now estimated at
about thirty percent  whereas this debt level  should not cross twenty
percent 
""
according to a recent  world bank report   india's 
 trade regime  is restrictive  discretionary  complex  and
most difficult to administer  and hence  it needs to be drastically
over hauled 
""
the world bank  has recommended among other measures 
abolition of quantitative restriction on import  cutting custom tariff
 from an average of hundred and seventeen percents  to not more than
twenty percent  jacking up of excise duties to make up the short fall
etcetera 
""
the recommendations  do not appear to be palatable to many 
but in the absence of a more acceptable alternative  there is no escape
 from accepting the recommendations of the world bank 
""
it will be necessary for the country  to change its economic
policies  relevant to the nineties  and make a departure  should
have an extremely close  allies of  among themselves  so as to make
the maximum use  of the available resources 
""
the whole world is vying  to attract foreign investment 
""
the developed world  is waiting for india to open up  but it
will not wait indefinitely 
""
foreign equity  is recently    pre    
preferable   to foreign loan  and we should loose no time  in
evolving a clear cut policy  conducive to attract the foreign investment
 in our country 
""
such a step  will reduce our interest burden on foreign loan 
and to that extent  our balance of payment position will improve 
""
in view of the establishment of european economic community 
 india's  export  will have to face  a fierce international
competition  in terms of prices  quality  specification  and
delivery 
""
the country will have to evolve  positive policies to boost
export  including  those considering the trade union  which
sometimes  takes some action  detremental to keeping delivery schedule
""
""
our present export  are  only five point five percents  of
gross  national product  whereas china and indonesia  have achieved
the percentage of  fourteen and twenty-one percents  respectively 
""
the recent devaluation of  rupee   is expected to
give a  big boost to export  though other consequences  will have
to be considered 
""
other important conditionalities  prescribed by the world bank
 are export of nine percent in government expenditure  and a drastic
reduction  in agricultural subsidy 
""
for a popularly elected government  these are going to be hard
decisions  but its reduction in agricultural subsidies  is accompanied
by an upward revision of  procurement prices  so farmers lobby could
be quitened 
""
it is estimated  that the annual outgo on various subsidies 
including the concealed one  at the centre and state level  is nearly
 rupees  sixty thousand  crores   which
represent  twelve percent of our gross national product 
""
state electricity board  has huge accumulated losses 
essentially  because they are not allowed to charge  commercial rates
to the consumer 
""
in  in case of agriculture  we loose about forty-five 
paise  per unit 
""
this is the reason  why the policies of the government  they
are not economically viable 
""
if populism is persued beyond the point  it would become counter
productive and frustrating 
""
investment made from  borrowed capitals  should yield return
 higher than the interest rate  so that  they can take care of
payment of interest  and  one word  of the principal amount 
""
greater  and rising productivity alone  can lead the country
 along the path of stability  and progress 
""
all these years  the policy makers have found it difficult 
to  politically follow  what they should have economically followed
 and as a consequence of which our country  has turned now to be a high
cost economy  and we are  outcast  in the global market 
""
in nineteen fifty  india steel price was the cheapest in the
world  today it is the costliest 
""
 coal india limited   is over staffed with
about one  lakh  workers  and there is no political will
 to deal with redundant labour 
""
food subsidies  are given to every one  irrespective of his
income bracket 
""
payment as resources are vested  in keeping  loss making
public sector units alive 
""
a big chunk of bank funds  is blocked in sick unit  which are
not allowed to die their natural death  because of labour conflict 
""
the purpose of world bank suggestive reforms  has been  to
increase the productivity and efficiency of indian economy  upgradation of
technological base  and improve its international competitiveness 
""
these are the objectives  all of us want to achieve 
""
the suggested reforms package  is also gradual  and safe 
making the state regime  more transparent  less bureaucratic and more
liberal 
""
thus  it is not to be rejected  only because it has a
conditionality of the world bank 
""
the world bank  will consider a further plan  of five to
seven billion dollars  after examining  the austerity measures
initiated by the government of india  and hence  there appears to be
no escape  from choosing the fiscal course  that is a part of
international monitory funds standard prescription  for countrys having
serious balance of payment problem 
""
in the light of economic imparities  we have to address
ourselves to  the forthcoming budget formulation  and its provisions
must give clear signals  to assess international situation  that india
is serious  and has the capability to implement  some of the harshest
measures  to correct fiscal anomolies in the indian economy system  and
reform the situation  on all fronts 
""
this will convince international creditors  international
monetary funds and the world bank  the need to support india  by
providing  the necessary cushions against precarious balance of payment
position 
""
the budget  will have to spell out  a long term integrated
economic policy  covering digit matters  relating to monetary 
fiscal  industrial  in which would need a loan of  about ten to
fifteen billion dollar  to plan a definite programme 
""
piecemeal assistance  may not help much 
""
the budget  will have to lay a special emphasis  on export
promotion 
""
presently  export documents have to be signed  at two hundred
and fifty places  and hundred and eighteen papers have to be completed 
in the estimated time involved in this operation  is twenty-two hours 
""
the paper work as ten percent of the cost  in united states
only five documents are enough  for export clearance 
""
 india's  external sectors  have seldom seen the type of
problem which it is now witnessing  and overcoming the same  will need
 some very committed action from the government  and unflinching
support from the opposition parties in the parliament  
""
that was a talk in english entitled   economic
imparities of the new government
