my name is madhu purohit  i'm an automobile engineer i've done my  masters in motor vehicle technology from germany  uh i would like to talk about the topics that are usually taught in uh the automobile institutions like poly technique and even now some of the famous colleges like b v b college  uh they are adapting automobile engineering as one of the subjects for degree courses  uh i'm of the opinion that the topics that these people use uh some of it is basically wasted because they are wasting your time also and probably their own precious time  uh because they teach you so many things that are not directly connected to automobile engineering  and in order to probably create or get the best type of quality of people that are there abroad  in order to get that type of people you have to really have subject concentrated to the subject that you want to specialise in  you know we have electrical engineer or mechanical engineer  who are taught uh the production engineering  and say in what way is production quality control okay he is going to be a design engineer his job is to design not quality control it is upto each individual when he produces that part to see that the quality is alright  but this guy he wastes his time studying production engineering and quality control so many other things  i feel that in germany basically people are taught more direct pertaining to the subject  yes we were also taught  now i'm an automobile engineer along with automobile technology we were also taught about rocket technology jet engine or say gas turbine but we were not tested as such  that was just given to us as a background so that if somebody talks about jet engines or gas turbines or high breed engines we should know what he is talking about that's all  we need not have any special uh you know theoritical know-how and specification or any kind of thing like that  so that made it only knowledgeable  see we know of oh yes i know what gas turbine is about  i know what these things are about  but basic thrust was on to our automobile engineering only  pertaining to those  and that is what i was talking or rather telling these people that we should adapt more of that type of technology where in we can get better types of people  they need not then wait for gathering experience in some automobile industry or whatever  they need they could be immediately absorbed during their  for their work the type of work they want to  while as now here we have automobile engineers or mechanical engineers they just taken in as engineers and they don't know much about practical aspects  for that matter they don't even know much about theoritical aspects  because what happens is uh the theory is so res so restricted to their own this thing that they have they don't know  here idea is the institution place more emphasis on this type of  uh retention power you have not this concept whether you know the concept  they say alright i give you these notes and you see that  you learn so and you know if you don't write these notes and write the same things what are in the notes you will fail probably  and this is the biggest drawback  people are not given the time and even the opportunity to express themselves the way they want  now if i teach you something about one particular aspect i teach you the principle behind it  now if the principle is known you can always explain back phenomenon about that particular principle to anybody in any way you like as long as you bring the gist of the subject  and that is what you require  now i ask these boys who have done their diplomas and all that  okay what do you understand by this yes we had learnt it i do not know what it is  see because they are lacking that definition because they have learnt it only as a definition they have not learnt it as a theory as  a concept  and it is so shocking you know now people who came here i was  i had the opportunity of giving a lecture in k h k about four times and there was a course for training the trainer  so those people who are already training other people i had to go and give a talk to them  and i asked them casually how you know you will talk about engine  four stroke engine what is the four stroke engine ? can anyone of you tell me what a four stroke engine is ? and you'll be surprised not a single man was able to tell what a four stroke engine  and they are all automobile engineers  so what we lack is basics  people like to draw graphs that is something if you meet an engineer he will suddenly draw a graph  he says this is the talk and no power graph this is this graph  they are so much into this graphs and which is not necessary  they should know what basics is  now we have somebody selling maruti eight hundred  what is this eight hundred ? i don't know  so this is what is required that we need to do it our people should be given basic idea about all these then you go into details fine when somebody asks you know if my mother asks me a four stroke four stroke what is this all ? i should be able to tell my mother who knows nothing about technical stuff  if i can tell her what a four stroke engine is and if she understands that is the way you should teach somebody because all of them are novice  if you are teaching some technical student then i can afford to give them some kind of a technical definition because if i say  for every two revolution there is one power stroke  only a technician will understand probably what i am trying to say  if you are a non technical person if i tell you this it will mean nothing to you and this is what this is what will happen to students if you tell them this  they only learn this what i have told them okay our teacher has given our lecturer has given this if i write this i'll get full marks  now this is bad  what we have to do is come down to basics teach them basics  so the subjects also that are chosen should be related directly related to the subject there are thing that the students are may be mechanical engineering electrical engineering or design engineering whatever  so it is very important that we also have those kind of subject in oriental  then we have some people say what is the you know  future for an automobile engineer  you see we are looked down upon by the society at large  yeah i do not know really i'm also puzzled now how to really change this thinking because people here basica   especially in small cities like dharwad  when somebody says automobile engineer they really don't know much about it  and then they feel okay automobile engineer means somebody who does not have brains up there  somebody who is not fit for anything or any other profession he has to be an automobile engineer this is the understanding  and how wrong they are because now the automobile field is becoming so sophisticated  unfortunately we are about fifty years behind in our automobile field here in india  but with the finance minister uh  man mohan singh plans you know for reducing tax or you know giving free trade uh facilities to our business people probably we are getting in some new technology  and with the help of these tech these these newer technologies the cars are going to be so sophisticated that an ordinary man who used to think okay this is my thing you know that set up something on the roadside and do it he will be absolutely nowhere because he will not know what to do with these vehicles  and only a person who has educational or lot of an intellectual person with educational background in that particular field will be able to tackle this job henceforth  so but it is so difficult to tell now like you are there or you are there now to come and tell them look i don't mind marrying a guy who is an automobile engineer because he is also like a degree holder like any other guy what's wrong  okay he has to deal with car and he deals with some machine which you don't see  but cars you often see and you have that picture in your mind you know already preconceived  when you go on the roadsides you see some of these fellows who got no shoes they wear chappals some torn shirts and all that they lie down and they are so filthy from top to bottom that is the picture you have  and the moment you think of an automobile engineer uh this fellow also must be exactly like that and i don't want to marry this guy  so this stigma we have to one word it you know  there is a vast difference between a guy who has done his diploma and would like to work as an automobile engineer than  the guy who is working on the roadside  so the social stigma has to be of course like they say  charity begins at home  we have a to start from home  take my parent when i got married i told my parents look okay you don't tell the girl what my qualifications tell her what i'm  doing exactly  because i don't want her to get a shock because when i got married i was in australia  i had come here only to get married and she was in bombay and all that and i had to tell her parents and her that look i work on cars i literally i am underneath and i do get filthy  because i don't want her to let me and say oh you are such you have done your masters and all i had thought you would be sitting in some cabin somewhere and  nothing of that kind because this is what happens basically people tell something and there are some  you know difficulty sometimes misunderstanding somethings then i don't want her to repent her parents to repent  things should be very clear but like i say we should start from home  my parents okay they know exactly what i have done where i stand and what i do  that is what each person should start telling his parents and his friends because this is the only way  if i meet somebody directly and i tell them  look it will not appeal to them it has to start from home you know you've got better ideas coming from home you rather do things that your parents tell you instead of taking or making your own choice and saying i don't care what you think i like to marry this guy because he is an automobile engineer  no this will never work because we are so you know far behind still in these aspects  and that is why to change peoples attitude and you know it is very difficult  attitudes are something you can't change  that is what i am trying here in my workshop now to change attitudes their thinking of regular maintainance about cars  they think service means just wash and grease and finish  those people who come here with that intention in their mind i just send them away  i just don't entertain them because this is not a place only to wash and grease i have got diploma people here working  i would like to utilise them to utilise their know-how and tackle some mechanical problems rather than just waste their time in you know washing and greasing  i say why don't you fix up some mechanical substance there is some noise here and some noise there why don't you rectify that  but they don't have that  here we believe our indian people believe in breakdown maintainance  until the vehicle is running they just keep it running and one day if it breaks down on you then you think oh i should go to a workshop now there is no such thing called as preventive maintainance  that preventive maintainance is yes it is expensive and we do change or throw away parts which are still slightly good  otherwise they would have run  then people say why do you throw that it is still okay  so preventive maintainance yes if you want the down time to be less that means you don't want your vehicle to be you know  parked in the ga workshop for a long time because of non availability of that part or whatever because you didn't change it that time now it's totally broken so you have to wait
