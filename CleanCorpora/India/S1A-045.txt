""
""

""
""
anywhere because we are now  in whose who  so that 
tell me something more about that how  you happened to go inside 
""
""
well  it was a shock for me
""
""
 haan haan  
""
""
uhm actually i was not expecting anything 
""
one fine day one letter came 
""
you know joshi  this our  uh this man  yaar 
  diwakar's  husband 
""
""
diwakar 
""
""
he was in b e l no 
""
""
oh our joshi okay i i got  got him
""
""
okay you got him
""
""
 haan 
""
""
 one word  joshi 
""
he was that uh  there at my house that day 
""
i suddenly got that letter from one  editor
""
""
 haan haan  
""
""
and he told  we have selected you for publishing  uh
 who's  who  in asia and   some so called 
""
""
 but how how come   he got your address then 
""
""
then i started looking at it
""
it looked as if it had come through the  alumini association of
i a s c
""
""
uhm uhm 
""
""
because it was uh  styled in the same way that is he passed
 b e in so and so year from this college and m e also in this college and
""
""
uhm uhm
""
""
working in so and so company 
""
""
so his name also  got included into that
""
""
no he is not from i a s c 
""
then i checked up with two or three my friends who were in  i a
s c
""
""
 haan 
""
""
their names also had appeared 
""
""
so this was actually whatever uh  thought you you were
proud of yourself that your name is in  who's  who  but you don't
feel all those  bugger's  names also  laughter  not included in
that
""
""
not so but  it  the  initially pressure was very high
""
but now it is not so
""
whether  it's   it's  not that uh  something is
of great achievement
""
many people who have done  who had excelled in education also
there who had not excelled in education but some other field also are there
""
""
""
i see 
""
""
like that it is 
""
it is some achievement who has done 
""
man of achievement in asia or something like that they are probably
""
""
""
no  that's  what i was surprised because  laughter
 i don't know what actually you had done 
""
well  really you have to enlighten me on that 
""
""
that uh okay you have spoken for me also   laughter 
""
""
uh well uhm how  have you told this thing to your boss then
""
""
he don't know   it's  not worth because  the
bosses and other people in the factory
""
""
uhm
""
""
they  really are hell bent upon  pulling you down 
""
""
 accha 
""
""
in the sense  now  well i have been for  one word
 because to avoid those  fellas but uh  they are saying that we
will not complete    uhm  myself and  two words  simply
getting troubled
""
""
 uhm  
""
""
why why why they are not allowing you to  give enough you
are not allowed to do
""
""
no
""
""
studies or things like that or  collect some data 
""
""
no the thing is atleast upto this january i need free time to
study and  uh prepare for my comprehensive exam
""
""
uhm uhm 
""
""
and these buggers wants their own personal jobs to be done 
which are most silliest in nature 
""
and after getting some twenty years of experience    uhm
 you really feel  that technical knowledge is instead of increasing
getting  reducing
""
""
 uhm  
""
""
uhm uhm 
""
""
you cannot go on enlightening them on technical things simply
because  you will be getting in trouble 
""
""
i see 
""
""
now if you enlighten them  they will come to know  and
tomorrow they will pull your leg
""
""
okay 
""
but i didn't get personal jobs means which kind of jobs 
""
""
uh well some  small things  something to be done like
 uh one small simple problem will be given to my immediate work
""
""
uhm uhm 
""
""
 it's  supposed to be done by that fellow
""
""
uhm uhm 
""
""
he simply doesn't want to do it but want to show that he has
done it 
""
""
uhm uhm
""
""
so he will transfer it to me
""
""
uhm 
""
""
whereas there is some other related job to my phd work my
research work like some vibrations and other things
""
if i want to go and attend it  he says why you have to go 
""
let the requisition come from the department let the people call
you with a  uh  kumkum tilaka  and  haldi kunku
 and  akshata  then only you go    how can i
go 
""
""
 okay like that   you have got now enough  uh
marathi words for saying this
""
""
yes  laughter 
""
""
okay    uhm  no but uh 
""
""
 uhm  
""
""
no  it's  happening recently  very late uhm 
within this in one month
""
""
he only has suggested your name  name for this
""
""
no chance    uhm  no chance  that fellow he
won't do  cannot suggest anything
""
""
 uhn  
""
""
okay 
""
now  he himself feel that he should have got the chance to go
for phd or  something like that something    no no  nothing
like that
""
""
 no no  
""
""
he   cannot go 
""
""
 you know that  
""
""
you know  pucca  sure that he cannot uh 
""
""
yeah  he cannot go
""
""
yes  okay  so
""
""
now tell me something about  yourself your achievement and
 so on and so forth 
""
""
look  it is the same thing as you 
""
uh only difference is that  uh  i've   i've  not
also achieved anything 
""
but uh  lack of achievement uh  uh doesn't mean that now
 i'll   who's  who  i'm  still not there
""
maybe  i'm  trying to underachieve something may be 
laughter  hoping that some day my day also will come in a way
""
""
sure
""
""
right now the   it's  something uh  doing lot
of hard work and like that some project missions are there  and uh  
 with international company  then see what what has happened 
""
working hard
""
""
 i don't know  
""
""
specially today this software companies are  having lot of
 work actually
""
""
yeah 
""
""
recently i
""
""
you see they are growing growing too fast  that is that is
idea so  uh basically you are always under staff    yeah 
when you are working 
""
and  uh responsibilities are more and the things are going too
fast so i think  one of the  major problem in software world over is
that uh  we   one word  basically we always underestimate the
work 
""
that is the problem known all over the world
""
always we underestimate our work by  some three hundred percent
 laughter     okay  so that is that is our true problem
""
""
 yeah  
""
""
 okay  
""
""
and what about this uh  what is called as uh sending
programmers to usa as a cheap labourer
""
""
body surfing
""
""
yeah body surfing  i've  read that in computer
magazine
""
""
 haan haan  
""
""
september issue  they have send it 
""
that uh  simply one fellow with a phone will hire some guys 
  exactly  and send there for one year
""
""
 exactly  
""
""
yeah 
""
""
he will earn lot of money
""
""
 that's  true
""
there are some three hundred four hundred person margins in that
""
""
uhn
""
""
they tell you which uh  this thing but the person who is
going there that is also happy because  normally once he goes  he just
quits that company and joins another company there
""
""
but that uh    h h one  visa or something has
change no
""
b one visa is change to h one visa something
""
""
 what has happen  
""
""
yeah but still still  uh what has happened actually it is
not exactly the  cheap labour i will say that is also one portion like 
uh cheap labour but the one another uh major aspect is that  like think
about a situation like uh  would you like to go today  as a well
qualified person  and go  and work in shimoga  or some place called
shirshi  would you like to work like that
""
""
they will not serve
""
""
you won't like 
""
you like to work in indutrial base like bombay  pune 
bangalore  delhi
""
""
no no  not definitely with the bombay calcutta
""
""
okay prefer anywhere uh place in  let's  say  
 bangalore  pune  think like that place you won't like to go a
small place
""
""
 bangalore or pune  
""
""
that is what exactly happens  most of the jobs  some of
the jobs are in villages in us  and  people there don't want to go
there 
""
okay but a person going from us  uh going from india to usa he
feels that okay america 
""
""
america 
""
""
so he is ready to live anywhere
""
""
and and another thing  one dollar equal to thirty-five
 rupees 
""
""
yeah that is one of the thing
""
so  that is basically things which keeps you  it's  so
and there also  when you are in the small place  there of saving
potential is more and something
""
""
but one  one thing i
""
""
everybody is happy that that is the idea basically 
""
the person who goes there will be happy 
""
the person who sent him will be happy
""
the company who has hired him happy 
""
so everybody is  so far so far it has been very well situatiion
""
""
so it is a goody goody happy happy situation
""
""
yeah may be it may not be there after two three years when he
was there  then he feels that there are no chances of growth he cannot go
to big companies
""
maybe when he realise  when he has enough money then he will
realise that that there are no much chance of growth later on 
""
then then   he'll  try to
""
""
no but the thing is they want they they  they try to move
to better but they never come back to india 
""
""
no some   people are  there some people have come
back i know  lot of people in our country uh in my company actually have
come back 
""
""
 because that is  
""
""
uh ha which company 
""
""
so total eight minutes are over we need to continue 
na 
""
""
uhm
""
""
we need to continue  na 
""
""
yeah  we must continue other ten minutes  laughter 
""
this exercise we have to be pulled on  cough 
""
""
today what happened no    uhm  actually in the
morning  uh we didn't get our paper
""
""
 uhm  
""
""
uhm
""
""
so
""
""
you bought it uh
""
""
no no  we ourself enquired why i couldn't get the paper
""
so i went to that  paperwalah     uh 
and that i ask  i asked him  what has happened
""
what has happened  since today  next three days that
paper-boy who drops the paper  na   he's  on vacation
 on leave    uh  and  his manager or his uh  that boss
or whoever is  the owner  he doesn't know my house 
""
so he knew that uh  he can drop the paper but he don't know
where to contact me or anything
""
so i went there and now  then he said okay do you want todays
paper so he gave me
""
""
 uh  
""
""
 uh  
""
""
so that means you got up in the morning and went there as you
said 
""
""
no  laughter  yeah yeah  yeah 
""
so just now  it's  ten  o'clock  at nine and we just
now got up
""
""
i see 
""
""
we came  came to you for breakfast 
""
""
breakfast okay 
""
but unfortunately we have finished our dinner 
""
so there is a jet leg between two of us  laughter  
""
by the way that  i talked told you about  mahen satkarsh you
remember
""
""
yeah what has happened to him 
""
""
uh he  one of his friend it seems had some vacancy for
temporarily in the sense  he said he can manage for few days  and stay
with him     haan   till he gets the  place
there 
""
what has  one word  happened is
""
""
  haan   
""
""
he has talked to one of uh  persons from my company or no
""
""
""
uh i don't know i passed on the message
""
""
okay
""
""
what happened was  his company used to start at eight
thirty in the morning
""
""
uhm uhm 
""
""
he was under the impression it starts at nine
""
""
 haan 
""
""
so one day he was going through the  one word 
casually  and he saw the office time is at eight thirty to six or so
""
""
uhm 
""
""
so  he has to start  approximately two hours early 
""
""
oh
""
""
from here to majestic  majestic to  that golden
enclove
""
""
he has to start at six six thirty
""
""
uhn  and that was not possible then  what he decided
was to stay with some friends there
""
""
uhm 
""
""
and again that the body shopping is there 
""
he has been told not to go in for a big house  not to go in for
a
""
""
yeah i know  lot people are going any way
""
""
vehicle  and passport and all those 
""
""
ha
""
""
so he has to  be on a  temporary basis for sometime 
""
then go there  work for one year    uhm  find out
some job
""
but i  i doubt whether the visa will be  given properly or
not 
""
""
 uhm  
""
""
what happens if the  man going there and some working in
some tata  tisl or something
""
""
uhm
