madam principal prof surendragopal department of history and director i e s coaching institute uh officers from the university different teachers coming from different parts of the eastern regions students ladies and gentleman i am very happy that the course has been organised for increasing  proficiency in english  i am not uh myself a very proficient man in english uh being a student of uh mechanical engineering all throughout and as you know  the technocrats and scientists they mostly do through symbols  you will say is equal to we'll write a two parallel lines and it remain you see even the same thing  in fact uh any language is uh also a symbol  you have a vocabulary and you use words you combine them in such a way that it conveys your feelings  the general concept of having proficiency in english like a common man you will say if we get something written in a very uhm difficult or one word way they will say oh he is the man is very proficient or if you listen to a speech in which you don't follow most of the things then you will say that he is a very learned man we could not follow  but my concept is uh i mean and i think the people will also agree with me it's different  a man is having proficiency in any language if he is able to convey what he wants to  if you are not in a position to convey your feeling or your thinking or your thoughts then no matter which language you use  uh you are not fulfilling your objective  so i think this type of courses should we organised not only for those who are doing courses in english or uh those who have taken english as a subject but mostly for such persons who don't get opportunity to use english uh to that extent as is  done by other english student  for example technocrats or doctors you will see that these technical people even uh say for example a doctor he will write a prescription except a few those who are very brilliant otherwise also that you can't read the name of the medicines  i was very much surprised when you go to a compounder he will read and give the appropriate medicine  i was very much worried how that fellow can read and i can't read it  then later on i don't know whether it is a fact or uh not  but somebody said the doctor they can't write the name of the medicine correctly they will always commit a spelling mistake so they just give some kind of symbol and a person who is uh dealing with all these kinds of medicine in day today life looking at the prescription that what is the disease what is the symptom they will give you the appropriate medicine  so that is the story for a technical people and you have i don't know how you have invited me either it is by virtue of the position i occupy in the university or i mean unknowingly you consider me very learned man that i can speak on any subject given to me  originally i was asked to distribute the certificates only  and i mean i was very happy due to the simple reason that i will have the opportunity of listening to people having proficiency in english and at least i can uh learn how to write correct english  and increase uh some of my vocabulary  anyway i am very happy that inspite of a very adverse social and political situation due to election and uh  adverse weather condition this sweating and intense heat  temperature uh mercury uh going up to forty-four degrees centigrade i think during this period itself  lot of variation in the temperature  you have conducted the course upto the satisfaction of the participant as i could uh gather from the reaction survey  uh given by to a student you have stayed here you must i mean those who have come from outside they must uh have faced lot of difficulty i don't know whether you have taken them on some tour through  uh i don't know i'm i am not aware but i i i hope  uh they must have taken you round to the places uh like rajgir or say bodhgaya or some other uh uh places of tourist tourist interest  i especially thanks thank uh  those faculty members who have come from outside the state  by their presence our students have been encouraged  they have been benefitted and they uh will be benefitted in the long run even the course duration was rather uh only two and  three week  three weeks but a still a three week  weeks are sufficient for this type of courses i express my sincere thanks uh to uh the institute central institute of foreign language at hyderabad for selecting patna as one of the centre centres  normally now the concept outside the state is patna is a very disturbed place and rather it is very difficult in most of the situations to organise successfully uh such a course  i don't know whether it was well publicised or not because most of the participants are girls only few boys uh students i could find  and mostly they are from patna university mostly from here  uh so i believe it can be well publicise we can invite teacher  actually we really need to teach teacher how to teach english ? or for that matter how to teach uhm what you call any subject ? now this english is uh so much essential with the advent of computer and oth other electronic gadgets  actually now we have developed a language which can be understood by a machine if you are using mostly in uh computer side  there a still either hindi or english or for that uh sorry uh sanskrit or any other language they don't have any place  still there maybe with further development we can do it uh uh other languages also  but inspite of all uh uh effort efforts   by the government or uh by other agencies to promote hindi or any other language we can't do away with uh uh english  because it is a language which is a essential for at least scientific knowledge  in the scientific world you can't do with any other language except english even in russia or uh in france or any other country using some other kind of foreign language they've to write a computer programme in english  so they're actually mostly it is symbols but even using symbol with proper grammar of the machine language  becomes essential  with all these words i again thank all the participants and congratulate the student students for  a participating in such type of course  i am thankful to the authorities for giving me an opportunity to be with the learned scholar scholars  from all over the country or mostly from the eastern region state and the participants of the schools  thank you very much clapping
