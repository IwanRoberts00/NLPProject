of rest and then again back to office  actually it's a part of office only  yeah   that's right know why i asked know making breakfast and also making early lunch cooking up lunch for your wife and also you're going to office  uh no she is breakfast i make it uh initially we used to have a girl with us uhm uhm who would make the breakfast and then uh in between uh my mother-in-law was there  so no problem otherwise i make my breakfast uh myself also for my son and then my wife leaves uh my lunch ready because actually then i have to look after both the kids no   i've to my yeah she leaves she leaves she leaves much early seventy-thirty quarter to eight  so it's as kind of difficult life anyway  for us we have a very solid back up my son leaves around eight-forty  accha  and both of us leave i leave a little early that is  ten fifteen ten  my wife leaves around eleven oh i see  uh it is  oh for us we start work at ten-thirty every schedule you mean  actually it is nine-thirty to see start the office   start the in our  so i have to go about three four kilometres   i've my own scooter  of course then  it doesn't take much time you know  yeah ten fifteen minutes  and we are not uh we don't have to sign etcetra  no so it's not necessary that we should be there exactly on the time no need in my case i've to go yeah because otherwise even the non-teaching will start coming late  yeah  ah i mean it doesn't ha others will start uhn that's these are the problems and it  so how are you  we missed you last evening  yeah in any case i am leaving at two twenty in the afternoon telephone ringing  so yeah we are also checking out but you stay back since you are going today do you have any friends or i used to stay with uh someone nearby  when is two words  i went and i packed  unfortunately this boy was not very well oh  so i had to carry back and when i came back it was early morning   oh  it was high time you had left and i didn't know you no i was late very late i would have joined you i think but paul told me you went on  went on upto ten forty ten forty-five we had really began eating part of it began only after nine  yeah uh al almost yeah  yeah so after i came here in the  one or two words  oh ho wha what time did you come back  back i think by eight  oh i would have take him i didn't know because i you see my brother uh came to take i mean he is in faridabad  so he came all the way from faridabad and he had his car so he took me around  and then it was around eight-thirty there eight-forty  exactly we came back  and uh i saw sahu talking to a three wheeler wala so i told him are you going there he said yes  so i said you wait we'll take you  but i didn't know you were here otherwise uh he didn't have information you were here no i was also not sure i thought i straight away because i remember you told me in the british council  that uh you may not be joining us so but i didn't know it will go on upto  but it went on for quite it was such a informal nice free gathering and uh there was little tension because we knew nothing was going to happen today  yeah  how many of you were there at one i mean at a time  first eighteen   accha  second plus twelve  so thirty all together thirty plus again another twenty-five not forty fifty-five fifty-five  ah that lady from padma sheshadri school madras rajalaxmi is it  i met her last year yeah i know rajeshwari i met her in gandhinagar last year   she's good she's really good  uhm uhm but uh some of the rps that they have trained does not  uh of of your calibre they does not  not all of them are one of them   such conditions have happened by and large but most of them are good  any thing is there produced uh materials which uh do not require much uh resource personnel  uhm uhm no actually they had also to cover the whole of the country  so those differences are bound to be there  now i wonder how many people from the north east also were trained uhm there are there are many from west side  there are many from west side dominantly south and north why was it may be people didn't apply or uh no they applied uhm mainly they didn't qualify  uhm  mainly they didn't qualify oh accha this was through an interview  ha  but i was told i think nee nee neelam told me that  there was no interview when she met ha first time we didn't had oh i see accha otherwise they chose again   they conducted because of conducted  ha ha that they didn't have time and the number of applications were of course i  accha so you mean to say eh they didn't short list people for interviews  they short listed uhm on the basis of uh biodata  uhm  biodata then they consulted various organisation uhm uhm and then they close  on the second and first time commission was set up but then who who were on the selection committee uh the obvious british council  was one word himself there or the whole thing uhm uhm that c b s e who was from c b s e  c b s e i think director pramod sharma who is  a few
