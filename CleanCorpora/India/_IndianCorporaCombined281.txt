to most of us the term map is quite familiar  but still we do not understand the exact meaning of a map  perhaps we are not sure what a map conveys or what a map is likely to present to us  that shows there is a need to define the term map    map is nothing but representation of  the whole surface of the earth or part of the surface of the earth according to scale  when i use the word whole surface of the earth i mean the world  when i say a portion of the earth that means it can be a town it can be a village  now when i use the word scale the scale means that all the things that we find in the reality cannot be transferred on a map  you have to represent that's found in the reality  in other words that one inch if you draw on a map perhaps it represent sixteen kilometres on the ground  that shows the scale is one inch to sixteen kilometres  now if one has to explain the concept of a map let us take a very very simple example  you are calling your friend home for a dinner and you have given the address too to him  but he finds it extremely difficult to locate your house  after a few queries perhaps you feel that your friend is not confident to reach your home  may be you would like to take a small piece of paper and draw a few lines clearly indicating what is a road on which your house is located  what's a land mark which is quite simple to identify and how to reach your place  well this sketch makes the man more confident and he is able to get himself acquainted with your area and he will be able to reach home confidently  now what does it mean ? it means that you have drawn a part of the city in a small sketch to convey the message to your friend  i call this as the concept of map  well if you agree that any message can be transmitted in the form of a map  now we would like to know how often we use map  well how old is this concept ? you would like to know whether we came to know about maps only recently or it has a history behind  i would like to say that the concept of map was dates back to six hundred b c  greeks and romans were the pioneers to introduce the concept of map  perhaps you would like to know that in second century a d  it is ptolemy who brought the concept of the map for the whole world  however the accuracy of the map is not that encouraging very rough idea of the world was given  but very accurate map dates back to sixteen seventy-eight i would like to show now a map which is quite  accurate accurately drawn during the historical period here you have a map which was drawn in the year sixteen seventy-eight  and it is the history's first accurately drawn map it represents facts which is drawn with true to scale and the colour which you could see here is nothing but hand painted colour  after watching the historical map which is hand painted  the maps have gone a revolution in terms of painting and production   today's maps are multicoloured and looks  pleasant and more informative  but the maps have also incorporated concepts like  direction distance and location  these three concepts have been given more importance in the modern maps  i would like to show a map of tamil nadu wherein  the concept of location direction and distance could be  easily seen  we have a map here which is a representation of  tamil nadu state  if you look into this map very carefully the first thing that comes to your mind is the location of places  here i have the location of bangalore which is given in the form of a black dot and this is exactly known as location of a particular place  our next concept is the direction  i have here marked a red arrow line facing towards the top which is nothing but the northern direction  in other words most of the maps are prepared towards northern direction on the top of the map  well from the direction we move to the scale  the scales are given at the bottom sometimes both in the form of figures as well as in the form of equivalance roughly six point eight miles on the ground represented on one centimetre in the map a map contains two important components  number one it is a skill in art  number two it is the technical skill which is needed to draft a map  skill in art means the designing of a map  positioning of letters symbols title writing and drawing the  components inside a map which should be more pleasing aesthetic  to the viewer or to a map user  similarly the second part of it which i call it as a technical drafting is a very difficult job because the maps have to be  drawn according to scale and the information have to be transferred into a map in a systematic manner so that the minds idea follow the things in a very very systematic manner  it is very difficult to understand what is the step by step  movements  because a map is a highest form of graphic it is in a position to create a visual image in your mind  you will keep things in your mind for a long time to come  its quite easier to understand that map is a very powerful tool of communication  i would like to now explain how a written text and a map if they are together how do they convey the message to you let us look at a small piece of information which i have taken from a newspaper  we will look into that in a more systematic manner  here is a small cutting wherein you will be able to see the text which is written over here and simultaneously on the other side a map is drawn  perhaps you will understand that this map is complementary to the text  i do agree  but if you look into the text very carefully you will know that as you read the sentences it will go into your mind and you will be able to understand the news in a systematic manner  perhaps if you read only the first sentence and jump into the last sentence you will miss the message  you will not be able to receive anything  therefore you are required to move sentence by sentence to understand the message  so is the case with the map  if i have to say today i am going to deal with kuwait   that means first i should know where kuwait is located in the middle east  and here is the small insert map which gives an idea that where is kuwait located  from that you move on to the kuwait and its surrounding countries with physical as well as cultural features  so your eye and mind goes step by step from one message to another message  all these messages are slowly steadily kept in your mind  and you can retrieve this message in a more systematic manner  in addition to this possibly you not only store this message in your mind you will be able to interpret the news in a much more scientific way in order to understand the situation better  therefore i would say that map is a very powerful tool of communication  let us look at the map in the form of a globe  you are able to see this globe now wherein the land  sea are distributed in aesthetical manner  this is more or less true to the reality  but you will be able to see that the size of the land  especially if you could watch the greenland which is quite small in size as compared with the canada united states  etcetera  but if this globe has to be broken into several parts  and then represent in a plain sheet of paper how difficult it will be it will be definitely difficult to represent this on a plain sheet of paper because this will be distorted  once it is distorted the figures will not appear clearly  the shape size scale will all vary  therefore there is a need of mathematical calculation of  latitudes and longitudes to be corrected in such a manner so that entire thing can be transferred on a plain sheet of paper  for this process we use a technical term known as projection the projection is nothing but arrangement of latitude and longitude in such a manner so that you represent the surface of the earth any part of the surface of the earth according to correct shape  and size  here is a world map wherein the entire land and ocean is represented in a plain sheet of paper  you are able to see the greenland which is bigger than  canada  whereas in the previous scene we have seen in the globe that greenland was much smaller than canada this indicates that the representation of the sphere on a plain sheet of paper necessarily brings distortion of shape and size  now symbols are the most important components of a map  i would like you to look at the symbols which are given in a map drawn for india  if we look into this map it is a tourist road map  of india wherein the symbols are given in different forms  the first and the foremost symbol is the administrative symbols in other words the administrative symbols are nothing but lines  drawn to show the administrative boundaries  now this particular line is a line which separates india from nepal  and this administrative line is known as international boundary when we come down you will be able to see the boundary line which separates uttar pradesh from madhya pradesh  again this is another symbol which represents the  administrative set up of the country  after that the most important symbol that we would like to look into is the physical symbol  physical means that the representation of the physical details of a map  here we are able to see the river which is given in the form of a blue line  now usually the rivers are given blue lines mainly because one is able to perceive the reality in without much difficulty  after the river symbols probably the next one which attracts most us is the cultural symbols  the cultural symbols the good example will be a road  now the hyderabad is connected to nagpur via highway  which is given in the form of a red line  like this almost all the symbols are carried out in a map in a sophisticated manner so that each symbol merges with the map in a systematic manner the next important component is lettering  the size style direction of letters do indicate  different type of messages  the size of the letters do indicate the hierarchy of place names  the direction of letters also indicate the style as well as the slope of a river  similarly if a group of islands have to be shown they are written in such a manner so that it covers all the distribution of islands now in this map the first thing is that the title is written in a corner below which you will find the scale is written below the scale you will find the term legend  indicating that all the details which have gone into the map are given  in other words that in the format one should be in a position to read first this and then familarise himself with the details then go to the map to read the map what it is all about  the second most important thing that you have to keep in mind is  the design of the total format wherein you will be able to see  the inner line will give you the latitude and longitude boundary the outer line will give you the finishing for the entire map  all the details should come between these lines which are known as neat lines  in the black and white map you are unable to distinguish  between one region to another region and different symbols  whereas in a colour map the eye catches the difference at much faster rate  in other words from the point of your communication it appears that colour seems to play a most important role  if we look into these maps you will be able to see that  this is the map of the city of madras  it is a large scale map  but here we have the tourist map of tamil nadu which is a small scale map  so maps can be classified on the basis of the scale so that it is easy to identify the specific purpose for which the map is prepared  we could see today in the world the educationists school children scientists planners administrators politicians  business people all of them are using the maps in some form or other the man who draws this map usually called as a cartographer  the subject which deals with designing drafting and printing of maps usually known as cartography  well today we could see that the developments in the field of cartography or in the preparation of maps have reached such a high standard that computer technology and satellite imageries have come into a great way in expanding the scope of mapping the earths surface  maps are part and parcel of life  one is able to convey the message more effectively accurately  scientifically through maps  and it reminds us a graphical age in your mind the years to come  i am sure you will also agree with me that there is a need to create this awareness in the utility of maps in the man's  life
