""
""
in kerala know the guys are rather  uh i think they are
sombre

the one who are  uh born and brought up there know  they are
rather conservative 
""
""
we get lot of ruffians here

""
yeah i know    bangalore   i'm 
experiencing 
""
""
 bangalore  
""
""
nothing of the sort 
""

you should see at the way they behave in buses and all that
 alma 
""
""
uhm 
""
""
if she has got  one word   lot of experiences 
these guys in buses and all like 
""
""
 it's    arrogance 
""
""
 arrogance    i think it goes with the city
  laughs 
""
""
but most of the guys are like that you know you don't come
across decent guys 
""
""
 it's  very rare 
""
""
very rare 
""
""
i know what the  i think there is one of this
""
""
in colleges 
""
""
yeah in colleges you should come to my college and see real
 stuntsman out there    uhm   i'm  having a real tough
time categorising the sex you know 
""
""
 uhm  
""
""
they have so long hairs their hair is so long  and 
they'll  put a small   pony in  the back
""
""
 pony  
""
""
how  one word   that's  long 
""
""
yeah   at so long 
""
""
 anyone object to it  
""
""
no no  if they are neat see  they look damn neat
 yaar 
""
""
yeah 
""
""
the only thing is that their hair is long
""
""
yeah 
""
""
and you know  no one can question a person about it 
why you are growing your hair 
""
he has put a pony he didn't put a shabby 
""
the problem is when you see them in the back you know
""
""
yeah 
""
""
they will be wearing jeans  even seniors wear jeans and
t-shirts and you can't make out the  like that way know
""
""
really   it's  fun
""
""
 we've  lot of fun in theatres you know  we always
take the back seat and all that  for this guys distinct one  we keep
teasing them
