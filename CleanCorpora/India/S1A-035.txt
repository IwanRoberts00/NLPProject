 i've  been teaching for the last fifteen years 
""
""
fifteen years yeah

uh you  you have taught only in  one college
""
""
only in one college 
""
""
but my experience is varied 
""
i taught for  uh nine plus  c s  in trivandrum  in
marvines college trivandrum 
""
then uh
""
""
so naturally you are familiar with the trivandrum politics and
such a things 
""
""
yes yes  uh lot you know  because it was at the prime of
my youth you know i was in trivandrum
""
""
so  ?
""
""
so i was very much interested in the  uh student politics
in watching  how students take part in politics
""
""
very good sir 
""
""
and also  the various developments you know the 
communist government in kerala 
""
""
in sixty-eight you mean 
""
""
that is true
""
""
uh  in sixties-seven second communist ministry came into
power
""
""
power in kerala 
""
then uh  the emergency period you know  all this  uh
happened when i was
""
""
during that emergency period you   are   were
  in trivandrum  ?
""
""
i was in trivandrum 
""
infact i  appreciated one  aspect of emergency know our
people were all disciplined
""
""
 haan  disciplined 
""
""
but of course  freedom was curtailed you know 
""
some could arrest you and take you to the prison without
questioning 
""
but there was one thing i saw
""
""
see  one aspect is that in   our state  there was
not not such a misuse of emergency
""
""
 yeah yeah  
""
""
ah ha ha  that is true 
""
uhm i saw people you know in offices all going on time coming back
on
""
""
for we we didn't find it  ve  too much  uh that
troublesome
""
""
yes yes yes 
""
i would like to tell you something about my experience   as a
teacher 
""
""
 yes sir continue sir  
""
""
uhm then perhaps you may  you will tell me  uh your
experience about a teacher 
""
uh i told you that i taught for nine years in trivandrum
""
""
yes sir 
""
""
then  uhm i registered my name in the ministry of external
affairs  uh foreign assingnment   section  and  uh when
there was a chance for teachers in nigeria  the ministry supplied the
names of teachers who have registered their names with the ministry 
""
and i was called for an interview 
""
uhm they submitted the name in the nigerian high commission in
delhi  and people from  the high commisssion came to trivandrum to
interview 
""
and uh i was interviewed and i was selected for
""
""
 yes  
""
""
oh you were in  ni  nigeria
""
""
yes that is true  uh for a teaching post
""
""
hey that is very nice experience
""
""
yeah 
""
it was a very nice experience you know you are true 
""
""
how many years did you spend there ?
""
""
uh i spent  uh ten years
""
""
ten years
""
""
ten long years  a decade 
""
it was a pleasant experience  because that  uh there have
been an opportunity to get exposed to  people from different parts of the
country
""
""
uhm in the past many teachers from our state went to nigeria
""
""
ah ah   some  perhaps some of your relatives are
there
""
""
yes them
""
""
 haan haan 
""
""
 they've  spent five years or at the maximum ten years
there
""
""
ah ha ha 
""
then  one one thing i enjoyed about my  uh work in nigeria
was  we had annual leave you know 
""
after ten years we got two  months leave  and we could come
home  during those two months 
""
and that nigerian government paid for our  travel  and
""
""
the other leave allowances
""
""
yes yes  and other leave allowances
""
""
so every year you had   three or two months stay 
""
""
 every year i used to come    yes yes 
""
and it is not only for me for my whole family
""
""
ah yeah
""
""
my wife and two children  uh to and fro tickets 
""
and uh  that gave me an opportunity to travel through different
countries  visit uh
""
""
oh you visited other countries also
""
""
yes yes 
""
if i number the countries i visited i think it is about
twenty-three
""
""
how   laughs  surprising
""
""
yeah  that was one  uh privilege i enjoyed  uh uh by
my service overseas 
""
i could travel  i could go to u s a  to canada to england 
european  many countries in europe  many   countries in 
middle east  and some countries in africa 
""
apart from nigeria i could travel through  some other countries
in africa that  there have been opportunity to visit many  uh
countries 
""
so  that gave me an opportunity to get exposed to  
people 
""
""
 very good  
""
""
 then   after that ten years service you
returned to  trivandrum ?
""
""
yes yes 
""
i went in the year nineteen seventy-seven and  uh i returned
in nineteen eighty-seven 
""
and  uh i was planning to settle down in trivandrum i started
constructing my house 
""
""
there 
""
""
then yes that is true
""
""
then what happened  ?
""
""
uh then something very  providential happened
""
 i'll  call it providential because  i never expected
that such a thing will happen
""
""
you are a believer 
""
""
yes i believe in  uh  god's  plan in my life 
""
and  uh i saw an advertisement  in one of the indian kerala
newspaper  about a post in karnataka 
""
and uhm  naturally when i found that it was a post in  ke
 in a college  in a degree college  and i was eligible to apply
""
i applied for it 
""
and i waited for two months you know
""
there was no reply but all of a sudden  i got an invitation for
interview 
""
that happened
""
""
then the karnataka college
""
""
from karnataka college 
""
i had never travelled to karnataka 
""
it was the first time i travelled to karnataka 
""
""
though you have visited twenty-seven  foreign nations
""
""
yes yes  i  i visited many countries in  uh all
over the world but  i i had yet to discover india you know 
""
so i got an opportunity to travel to karnataka  for my
interview 
""
that was in the month of may  ninety
""
""
seventy-seven
""
""
uh nineteen eighty  eighty-eight
""
""
eighty-eight
""
""
yes 
""
then after the interview they asked me to join  in  the
month of july 
""
so i  joined the college 
""
""
as principal  ?
""
""
uh  not exactly
""
i was appointed as a reader in english 
""
there was another principal  when i joined
""
""
they had another principal means two principals  laughs
""
""
""
that is no  i was not appointed as a principal then 
""
and it also happened providentially i will say  because the 
then principal he wanted to go for higher studies in england 
""
he took one  mon  one years leave and  uh went to
england 
""
then uh i was the senior most person  in the college and so 
they asked me to
""
""
so you were promoted 
""
""
uh  yes i i was asked to be the acting principal for one
year  until he returned 
""
then uh  when he returned he didn't want to take charge as a
principal 
""
he did not receive his responsibility 
""
""
did he continued as a teacher  ?
""
""
uh uh  beg your pardon
""
""
the  that that fellow
""
""
no no no  uhm he  he returned and the management was
running a school 
""
uh infact the school is a prestigious school  uh with more
than two thousand students 
""
and he took over as   the principal  of the school
""
""
and the mantle fell on me  and i became the   principal
""
""
""
 in charge  
""
""
 principal   yes
""
""
so that was in nineteen eighty-nine 
""
and from eighty-nine onwards  i'm  the principal in that
college 
""
then you tell me something about your experience as  
teacher as  a teacher ?
""
""
 yeah yeah sir  
""
""
my experience is not that of a principal  laughs  or
anything like that  you know the background
""
""
