what i wanted to look at was  all communication  between
different workers in industries at different levels  in  various
organisations 
""
uh  and i was looking at
""
i wanted to look at in fact i was interested in looking at  both
 the reported use of   in uh  english in industries  and 
uh  the actual use of  uh english in industries 
""
uh  because i thought there would be a difference 
""
what you imagine you use  is not always  what you actually use
""
""
uh  you imagine you use a particular language  but when you
 uh when you  are  observed  you find that there is or you
observe yourself  you find that you are in fact  not  actually using
what you thought or what you imagined you use  uh in different contexts
with different people for different purposes 
""
so i thought i would study both the aspects and compare the two 
""
unfortunately for me  i was not allowed to record  anything at
all  in industries  because  for uh they felt that for security
reasons  they could not allow  tape recorders  on  to 
campus
""
now this is one of the disadvantages  this is one of the
constraints  under which i was working 
""
so i thought  well i confine myself to reported use only 
""
and how did i go about this  uhm  well  i thought i would
select industries in andhra pradesh  that is uh  for no other reason
except that i work  there and i thought it would be easy for me to have
access to various industries in andhra pradesh 
""
now how was i to decide  which industries i should take up for
 my study 
""
uh it would be difficult to decide and it was difficult to decide
initially 
""
then i thought  i would look at  uh a comparatively  uh
industrially advanced area  industrially advanced area  and a  sta
 uh uh uh  a district that was industrially backward so that i would
have the two extremes  uh uh for my study 
""
uh   ju   for that reason i said  okay
hyderabad is industrially more advanced  and karnool district  is
industrially backward  
""
so i took up  these two districts  the industries in these
two districts  for my study   cough 
""
now what kind of  study was i going to  get  a
representative industrial population from  that again was very difficult
for me to decide 
""
uh finally i did some reading  i uh  did a bit of study 
""
i tried to find out get information about the kind of industries
one could have
""
and  i broadly classified these industries  and there there
is a classification available  uh in the literature  uh into public
sector undertaking  and private sector undertaking  undertaking 
that was  the main classification 
""
and then the other  factor that i thought  might affect 
the use of language  uh was location of industry 
""
and this was very convenient for me to do  because karnool
district being backward had a large number of  rural industries 
""
now let me explain what i mean by rural 
""
 i  by rural i don't mean  a completely rural area 
because that would be contradictory in terms
""
you can't have an industry  where you don't have the
infrastructure for  for an industry 
""
so let us say  by rural i meant  very small towns  or 
uhm  probably you would understand  taluk  better  at
the subdivision levels 
""
so uh  i classified my industries  and i  selected
industries from hyderabad  public  and private
""
and then hyderabad  provided me with the urban sector  and
 uhm karnool with  rural  industries 
""
then i decided on how i was going to collect this data 
""
and uh  since i  had to  i was almost compelled to 
look at only reported use  i had to think about  how i was going to go
about  uh collecting data for reported use of english 
""
uh when i say english  uh please don't imagine that i  forgot
about the indian languages 
""
i always looked at the use of english   vis a vis
 the indian languages that the  employees there  uh in these
industries were using 
""
now as far as methodology is concerned i thought  i would go
about it  by  first of all observing what went on  in these
industries 
""
so general uh  observation  and i followed this up  by a
questionnaire  and i refined my questionnaire as i went along on the
basis of the observation   cough 
""
after  my informants filled in the questionnaire i went about
interviewing  some of them
""
i couldn't have interviewed  uh  all the informants because i
had nearly four hundred informants 
""
but i  uh took a fairly large population  and uh  and
therefore  i was able to uhm  interview quite a large number  of
informants 
""
uh  having collected the questionnaire  i would look at their
responses and then base my interviews  on  the basis of those uh uh 
of their answers to my questions 
""
one  to check whether they were aware of what they had 
answered  they were aware of the reasons for their answers 
""
also  to check whether they had  in fact  read the
questionnaire carefully  and uh  had answered these correctly
""
some of them  in fact it turned out that some of them in fact
were not aware of what they have done
""
they had just put   ticks  and 
crosses   uh  for the sake of  completing the
questionnaire 
""
so i had to do that to cross check  to make sure that they did
fill in  the questionnaires 
""
when uh  i  uh analysed this  i'm  i am saying all
this very briefly because i wouldn't like to go into detail 
""
i analysed  uh  these questionnaires the  uh  all that
i have collected and  also  uh  recorded my observations  of
their behaviour 
""
and i tried to look at  the association  or the relationship
 between  the use   their use of english  with  their
 superiors  equals  and their juniors  and  relation 
to  the social variables 
""
that is the relationship between their use of english with 
superiors  with equals and juniors  and with the social variables 
type  of industry  that is either public or private  location of
industry  that is urban and rural 
""
occupation  and for occupation i had  the uh  higher
level middle level and lower level of occupation 
""
education again  i had the higher level  middle level  and
low level of education 
""
medium of instruction in school 
""
and  i had  i i  i chose medium of instruction in school
because that is where  the the main differences is  some people have
english and some people have  a regional languages or indian languages 
""
and  exposure to english that is  whether they in fact 
were exposed to a lot of english  as far as their reading was concerned
 magazines  journals
""
now this would also be uh i i predicted that this would be  uh
related to their jobs as well 
""
depending on  what their job was they would probably read the
kind of literature that they needed for their jobs as well 
""
now in addition to this  i also looked at their attitudes 
""
and i must admit i found it very difficult to assess their
attitudes 
""
i did get some  uh uh a rough idea of what there attitudes were
""
""
uh and i    ag    again   related these
attitudes their attitudes to english  to the the variables that i had
taken up earlier type and location of industries  occupation  education
 medium of instruction  exposure to english 
""
uh  now   cough  from my analysis  of the
questionnaire  and on the basis of my observation of their behaviour 
on the basis of my interviews  uh  these were the  uh the
conclusions  i drew 
""
the most general  general conclusion that i drew was  that
 these people  who are professionals  who work in these
industries  had a very  functional  professional attitude  to
the use of english 
""
they don't have  a political bias  at all 
""
they are not bothered about  whether the language ought to be
taught  or introduced at school  or college or not  except 
when a except uh uh  they would be bothered of course  ex  only
when  they were  uh they considered the utility of that language for
their profession 
""
they felt  that  they needed english  for certain
purposes 
""
they needed english  to talk to  uh their superiors for
instance 
""
now  looking at the variables  i found  that  the
location of industry  was a very very important  variable  as far
as  the uh use of english was concerned 
""
it was a very important variable  which affected the use of
english 
""
employees in rural industries for example  specially those 
who had to deal  with handloom  for instance  who had to deal with
spinning and weaving  and who use only indigenous  uh technology 
did not need the use of english  as much as did those who used foreign
technology 
""
and  in fact their view on this was  that   they 
as long as they were   uh they were  not as advanced  as the
western countries  and uh one of them used the word begging-bowl 
""
they had to use this begging-bowl  for technology and knowledge
""
""
they would  be compelled  to use  those languages 
that helped them to have access to  science and technology  to all
knowledge that would help them to  uh  adva  uh to uh  to be
industrially advanced  that was their view about  the use of english
""
""
now  the other  the the the other variable that i found was
very important  was interlocutors that is those  uh they the use of
english  depended on whether  an employee was  conversing with his
superior  equal  or  junior 
""
and more english naturally was used while conversing with superiors
""
""
another variable that was important was occupation
""
this was another important variable that affected the use of 
language  and that also included the nature of their job 
""
those who were highly technically qualified naturally needed to
talk about technical matters  more than those who were dealing for
instance  with  administration who were not directly concerned with
production 
""
those who were directly concerned with production  used much
more english  and felt they needed much more english  because their job
required them to use more english than those who dealt with administrative
matters  there were for instance  the personnel  branch  where
they had to deal even with the  with uh with all those workers  from
the shop-floor  for whom they had to provide say even things like uniforms
and shoes 
""
now  they did not need english  to converse  with  
those uh with with  workers from the shop-floor and doors
""
so they needed to use english much less than those who were 
technically   highly technically qualified  and uh were required to
discuss technical matters 
""
uh  the another another factor that affected english  a
great deal the use of english a great deal was context 
""
this was a very important  uh factor  which affected the use
of english 
""
uh  formerly for instance when they were at a meeting  and
i sat in them some of their meetings 
""
when they were  uhm talking to  customers from outside 
when they were at the office doing their daily work and transactions 
they tended to use much more english  than they did  when they were
say at a social get together 
""
i attended some of their social get togethers  and i found 
that their get togethers were much more relaxed  much more informal 
and therefore there was less and less use of english  more and more 
use of indian languages 
""
uh uh i am afraid i coudn't quantify  the exact  uh uh use of
english  and   versus the indian languages but i can only say that
there was a client  english at the level of formality  and this as we
went down to more and more  informal levels  uh became  more and
more minus english  and more and more plus indian languages 
""
and also their attitudes  as i said earlier  their attitudes
to  uh the use of english  uh were all based on  the need for
english  the various functions they had to perform  and they felt 
that if a language  helps them to do the job well  well that was the
language they were going to use they were not bothered about whether it had a
prestige value or not 
""
for them  it was uh  and some of them in fact said 
sometimes it was an indian language that uh  works as a lubricant  they
call it a lubricant  if they wanted to  uh get a job done  they
would suddenly switch over  to their uh   to their mother tongue
 or to the local language 
""
they they didn't bother about whether it was their mother tongue
 certainly not  which ever language they thought  they could  
 effect     effectively   communicate in  was
used between them 
""
and of course  most of them felt  that english  was very
essential for science and technology 
""
now this is very interesting
""
it was very essential for an  individual's  job
opportunities and success at work 
""
it was very essential for interstate communication 
""
it was  not  at all essential for english at home  for
for communication at home 
""
uh about english for education  it is interesting to note that
 they had  uh  different views  some of them felt  that 
we should have english all the way  so that all the sections of the
people  would get uh  fair opportunity  to learn the language 
""
and therefore go up the social  scale  and also  uh uh get
more opportunities for work and for jobs 
""
uh some of them felt that there was no need to learn english at uh
uh upto primary school at the primary level  because we should be  we
should give our children more opportunities  to learn our own 
languages  indian languages 
""
some of them felt  that english should be introduced  only
 uh after middle school 
""
they they felt that there was no need to  do to  introduce
english  and after middle school too  it should be taught only as a
subject upto high school 
""
and it was only  uh they were all of course unanimous in saying
that english should be introduced only at the college level as a medium of
instruction 
""
so these are some of the   as if the the  findings of the
study  i haven't gone into very great detail  because that would have
taken me the whole day almost 
""
uh these are some of the interesting findings that  we  uh
that uh  i came up with  at uh at the end of the the the study 
""
