this is all india radio bombay 
""
it is nine thirty 
""
we shall now hear a talk  entitled  random thoughts
  by dr usha thakkar  
""
questions before us are baffling  and issues around us are
overwhelming 
""
when i start thinking about them  i get taken over by their
variety and volume 
""
and these different strands are woven together  and the emerging
picture becomes clear and grim 
""
and i start wondering  what is happening to us  as individual
 as society  as a nation 
""
crisis seems to have penetrated everywhere 
""
is it political  economic  cultural or the crisis of life
itself  ?
""
we see many young children  begging on streets  and working
in dangerous conditions 
""
we hear many incidents  about young women  being burnt for
dowry 
""
innocent persons  getting imprisoned in the trap of bonded
labour 
""
and the youth going astray  due to lack of direction 
""
we read about many massacres  in cities and villages 
""
we know many persons  who exchange their ethics and ideals for
money 
""
we are aware of many cases of bribery and forgery 
""
our attention is often drawn  to scandal in educational
institutions  the citadels of learning 
""
and nothing happens to us 
""
have we lost our sensitivity  the very core of human life  ?
""
we preach morality to children  and we talk of values to all 
but we do not hesitate in compromising  when it comes to personal gain 
""
we see nothing wrong in seeking personal  favours  for
gratification 
""
is this in accordance  with what we say  ?
""
and what impact is it going to have on the young generation  who
get bewildered and confused  by this discrepancy between action and
preaching 
""
corruption seems to have penetrated  in all spheres of life 
and worse then that  it seems that we have accepted  that it has come
to stay 
""
work culture gets adversely affected by this 
""
demands for rights are put forward  without due consideration to
duties 
""
previleges are sought without fulfilling obligations 
""
consumerism and hedonism dominate our time 
""
pursuit of comfort  mixes get oblivious of the means adopted for
the same 
""
the importance of money  is accepted unchallenged 
""
everything starts getting measured in terms of money  and then
 values are turned in prices 
""
people get  to use henry  millers'  expression 
 protected by money  learnt by money  dulled by money 
""
""
new inventions  advance in technology  and wonders of
computers have certainly opened new vistas for human beings 
""
but  we'll  not go in ahead without values and ideals 
pushes into an age of despair and destruction 
""
emerson had said that  the true test of civilization is 
not the census  not the size of cities  nor the crops 
""
no  but the kind of man  the country turns out  
""
unfortunately today we see  men surrendering their ideals to
expediency  and yielding their sensitivity to the pressure of power 
""
respect for human value  and constraints on  human greed 
and lust were never more important  than they are today 
""
gandhi had pointed out  that hankering after riches  forces
one  to exploitation in some form or other 
""
the modern civilization  with its emphasis on materialism 
and its basis of exploitation of the weak  is equivalent to darkness and
disease 
""
true civilization consists  not in accumulation of commodity 
but  in a deliberate and voluntary reduction of one 
""
politics  bereft of religion  is a death trap because  it
kills the soul 
""
unfortunately today we are at such junction in history  where
the line between good and evil  often gets blurred  and consequently
the distinction between heroes and villains also often gets blurred 
""
the practice of putting  profits before prudence  and the
instinct of putting  i  before  we  
have eroded the foundation of human values 
""
if humanity itself is lost  would a human being be a human 
or a mere robot  ?
""
in that case  what about future  ?
""
one undoubtedly is in agreement  which the russian poet andrei
muroyiv when he said  that  i am not interested in the twenty-first
century  if it will be only robots 
""
it can happen but it will be death 
""
we will be alive  but dead  
""
we start enumerating  the advantages and gains  profits and
pay-offs  and neglect  human values and human emotions 
""
we ignore the highways  and start getting lost  in lanes and
by-lanes where paths become narrower and narrower 
""
as a nation  we are going through rough times 
""
nationalism often becomes synonym  with  factitious 
politics  and this gives boost  to destabilizing and destructive forces
""
""
ugly forces of communalism  fundamentalism  regionalism 
and terrorism rock the tranquility of the country 
""
instances  of communal riots and political violence provide
material  for headlines to media 
""
events and happening  in the field of politics  indicate
clearly that politics  is the game of power 
""
the game of ruthless strategies  the game of selfish interest
 where moral norms  and high ideals are pushed aside  and where
credibility and accountability  become meaningless words 
""
problem of poverty has assumed grave dimension due to illiteracy
""
""
basic needs of food  shelter  and clothing of the people have
yet to be fulfilled 
""
rising prices  inflation  and unemployment  bring
unprecedented pressures on the common man 
""
today problems are many and solutions are not simple 
""
we have to accept the fact  that ours is a plural society 
where diversity in religion  caste  community  and language is
overwhelming 
""
this plurality  cannot be hidden under the clock of concensus
 nor can they be   blinded   branded   as
confrontation 
""
aspirations and grievances of various ethnic  religious 
linguistic  and minority groups demand special attention  to cultural
ethos and recognition to diversity 
""
as the noise over   masjid-mandir  
employment and social justice  ethnic diversity and minority rights  is
getting louder  law and order situation  is worsening 
""
the weak and the underprevileged sections of the society still
suffer from discrimination 
""
here i would like to focus on the status of women 
""
even now  after so many years of independence  women suffer
problems  of inequality and discrimination  dependant and domination
""
""
some individual women have achieved  stupendous success in some
fields such as education and politics 
""
the constitution has granted equality  and some progressive laws
are enacted 
""
but the majority of women are lost in the darkness of ignorance 
""
the literacy rate among women  is only thirty-nine point
forty-two percent 
""
the fact to remind  that india is a nation  where people
belonging to different  religions live and practice  their own way of
life 
""
the constitution did not establish a common civil code  and the
personal laws of different communities  remain operative 
""
it is unfortunate  that in a democratic and secular state like
ours  all the women are not on equal footing 
""
women of different  religions and communities suffer under
oppressive personal laws 
""
traditional norms of behaviour and inequality have taken deep roots
in our social system 
""
revival of religious fundamentalism  intensifies the threat to
 women's  equality 
""
it is sad to note that social evils like  dedication of
girls to temple  polygamy   and  seclusion of women
  have thrived  in the name of religion 
""
there are some laws  which provide protection to women  but
the cunning and conniving  do not take long to find the loop holes 
""
moreover  the process is long  painful and expensive 
""
the question remains  how many women would muster courage and
resources  to fight discrimination  ?
""
bigamy is still not extinct 
""
the provision regarding the age of marriage gets frequently
violated 
""
 women's  access  to rights  of property 
maintenance  inheritance  divorce  alimony and custody of children
 get limited 
""
many laws  lose their meaning in the absence of proper
implementation 
""
though it is one of the duties  of an indian citizen  to
renounce all practices  derogatory to the dignity of women  women are
often subjected to atrocity  like grave or physical assault 
""
trade in human flesh is still prevalent 
""
rape victims suffer from tremendous trauma  and damage to their
personality 
""
crimes against women  continue to rise 
""
there were more than six thousand reported  victims of rape in
nineteen eighty-seven  and more than fifteen hundred dowry deaths 
including burning 
""
the declining sex ratio  is an issue causing grave concern 
""
the nineteen ninetey-one census  shows only nine hundred and
twenty-nine women against  thousand man 
""
this is an issue  not just of number but a pointer at our social
reality 
""
neglect at every stage  is the fate of the women 
""
survival itself becomes difficult  as is evident from the misuse
of the sex determination test 
""
age specific death rate indicate  higher rates for female
children  and women upto thirty-five years of age 
""
the discrimination against the women in economic arena still exist
""
""
the provisions of labour laws and equal pay for equal work  do
not reach all women and  provisions are not properly implemented 
""
almost  ninety percent of women workers  are engaged in
unorganized sector 
""
studies clearly show  that modernisation and mechanisation tend
to marginalise women in many sectors 
""
the fact remains  that there cannot be division of women into
groups of working women and non-working women 
""
women work  but their work goes unnoticed 
""
invisible hands of women are always at work  but the data
system with respect to  women's  work is imperfect 
""
estimates of the average hours of unpaid work  done by women
 outside their homes vary from six to seven hours per day  with some
women working upto ten hours or more 
""
apart from the domestic duty  women are engaged in agricultural
operation  for an average of twelve hours a day 
""
they have to keep themselves and their families alive 
""
in rural areas  thirty to thirty-five percent of household 
are headed by women  still there access to ownership of land  and
property is negligible 
""
women find it extremely difficult  to enter the male dominated
field of politics 
""
the crucial fact is  that women find themselves being judged
 and often judging themselves by two different standards 
""
one standard is of traditional role of the private world  which
regards her as homebound  nurturing  submissive and emotional 
""
the other standard is  of her changed role in the public world
 which expects her to be ambitious  rational  progressive and
competetive 
""
this private public divide bring severe pressures on her 
""
other deterrants in her way are  approach of political parties
 prohibitive election expenses  demands of home  and family  and
fear of character assassination 
""
still we have a long way to go 
""
democratic notions of equality and liberty  have to percolate
in her day-to-day life 
""
journey of democracy  is never static or uneventful 
""
today realities are hard and challenges are tough  but we the
people of india have to give a positive response
