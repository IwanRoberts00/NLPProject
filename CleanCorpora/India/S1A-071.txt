""
""
well ranju we will talk about the procedure of the  con 
 uh   conduction   conduct   of  b s r b exam 
""
""
yes let it be  we'll  talk about that 
""
""
what idea we have  uh how we are called for the  ex 
exam 
""
""
first of all the board will  uh give an advertisement in the
paper  and full information will be given in that advertisement such as
eligibility criteria  time duration and the date of   conduction
 etcetera  conduct   
""

uh what are the different kinds of text  that are to be test
in the exam  ?
""
""
uh there are four kinds of tests in the exam  mainly uh test
of english language  uh english  comprehens   comprahensive 
clerical aptitude  numerical ability and test of reasoning 
""
uhm  i will tell you about the  uh test of english language
firstly 
""
in that   we'll   in that english language include 
uh  e du   spotting the error  uh completion of
sentences  rearrangement of sentences etcetera 
""
spotting the error means  uh in that we have to find out an error
 uh which one is the mistake we have to  find out and uh  answer it
whether it is right or wrong 
""
and in completion of the sentences  uh the appropriate word
should be selected and filled up in the blank 
""
and uh rearrangement of sentences should be  done accordingly
""
""
uh well  next comes the test of reasoning  in that uh  
 three topics are 
""
""
 in the english language   
""
in the  en  english language you are having a passage also
no  ?
""
""
yes  we have passage also 
""
uh  amo  from the passage questions will be asked  and
  uh 
""
""
 like  
""
""
like uh  the passage will be given  and then from that
passage we have to  write the answers  and uhm   they will 
one word  
""
""
 they will   ask questions for you  ?
""
""
yes 
""
uh questions also include the  words like this synonyms and
antonymns etcetera  from the passage only they have to chose the synonymns
and antonymns  and uh write accordingly 
""
uh secondly i want to tell you about the reasoning ability 
""
it includes series  uh analogies and classification 
""
uh series is uh  uh comparatively it is difficult from the other
two  that is analogies and classifications 
""
in series uh  two figures will be given such as problem figures
and uh answer figures 
""
uh in problem figures  four or five figures will be given 
and from that we have to  chose the  succeeding figure from the answer
figures 
""
we have to chose the correct one 
""
the questions include such as  they will ask  that is they
will ask uhm  uh we have to compare them accordingly 
""
we have to compare them uh  according to the clockwise direction
 ante-clockwise direction whether it is  the figure is uh  in the
left direction or in the right direction etcetera 
""
and in analogies uh  it it is also same 
""
it is also same as the series 
""
in analogies  problem figures and answer figures will be given
""
""
we have to compare  the first two figures of the problem figure
 and the third unit  should be found out from the answer figures 
 haan 
""
and uh    nextly   next   comes the
classification in the  in which we have we have to find the odd man out
""
""
okay  then what the what ideas are you having about the
clerical aptitude ?
""
""
uhn 
""
""
as as far as my knowledge is concerned  i know that uh four
addresses will be given
""
""
yes of course    uhn  you are right
""
""
 uhn  
""
""
four   address   addresses   is it is
correct  na 
""
""
yeah
""
""
four addresses will be given 
""
you have to chose  uh the in a problems uh problem part 
there will be given one address  you have to chose exactly the same
address out of those five options    yes  you have to chose
 na  
""
and  you've  you have to  tick off it
""
""
 yes  
""
""
tick off the right one
""
""
hey what is the   procedure  of  uh answering the
questions in uh  in this exam 
""
will you tell me about that that
""
""
 which  
""
""
well the answer figure also  co  means in the questions
we have five optionals for each questions
""
""
uhm
""
""
totally  we'll  be having two hundred questions  for
four test you know 
""
one test    consist   consists   of fifty
questions
""
and totally  you'll  be having two hundred questions 
""
in answer paper also for two hundred questions  in front of each
uh  means each answer you will be given five oval 
""
and in question paper you will be given optionals no  in uh
which one is the right  opt  uh which one is the right one no  you
have to uh darken the oval  in the answer  in the answer paper 
""
uh so which one you find correct  you should have you should
darken the oval  particular oval
""
""
uhm
""
""
and if you want to  change the answer  you should
completely erase the oval 
""
""
uhm 
""
""
if you want to change otherwise no  you have to completely
erase the oval 
""
you should not uh  leave  uh means there
""
""
any sign
""
""
yes uh  because the answer papers you know  they will be
feeded   under   into   the computers you know
""
""
yeah
""
""
so  they will be fully erased  they should be fully
erased off
""
and you should darken a new oval 
""
and if you want to uh  if you do not have to  you do not have
the time to erase also  you should cross the oval 
""
uh you should put a cross mark on the oval  and you have to give
the correct answer 
""
""
our total time duration will be given uh ninety-five  
ninety no  
""
it should be divided  eq eq     yes  in a
certain manner
""
""
 ninety-five  
""
""
 yes  
""
""
yes
""
""
it should be divided orderly
""
""
of course
""
""
first you have to solve english language and then you have to
solve reasoning ability

""
uhm
""
""
then thirdly you have to solve  this   numerical
ability 
""
""
 no i think   you are wrong 
""
secondly you  shou  you should solve the numerical ability
""
""
ah
""
""
means  ma   calculation should be finished off you
know first only
""
""
yeah
""
""
because uh  after after  means reasoning after you try
after reasoning  uh  you'll  be  you'll  get some difficulty
in solving the  numerical ability    uhm  because the
calculation sometimes will  uh they will be difficult
""
""
 uhm  
""
""
the time allotted will be    yes  uh of uh
ninety-five minutes  in that you should divide    yeah  four
