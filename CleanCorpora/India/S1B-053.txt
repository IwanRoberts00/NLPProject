the past  much sounded programme of bringing  uh
bringing the gap between the developed and backward regions in the country
""
""
this budget does not hold on   to the hope   for
backward state  like assam  for bringing the region at par  with the
rest of the country
""
""
  one or two words   
""
""
yeah every region   should be considered 
""
""
  one or two words    industry 
communication
""
""
before three we should finish 
""
""
assam and bodo  one or two words  land  the entire
north eastern region  is full of untapped  natural resources  and
mineral 
""
there are no provisions in the   budget  to combat the
waste  to find out   for the purpose of finding out   
and tapping the natural resources  for the   beneficial  
benefit   of the people 
""
""
 as to  a few words   
""
""
 no no finance  a few words    your party
time is sixty-two minutes 
""
""
and bringing material welfare to them 
""
assam is a state  where eighty percent of the people live on
agriculture 
""
  assam perhaps was the first state  where ceiling on land
holding act was passed  in the mid fifties 
""
""
  a few words   
""
""
the maximum amount of land  which an agriculturist can hold
 is fifty  bighas  
""
in the presence of decay  and natural division of family  the
areas in possession of  farmers  are diminishing  making the land
with farmers  progressively  uneconomic  making more and more
farmers marginal  and landless 
""
general provision in the budget for improvement of agriculture 
will not help  uh ah will not help the farmers of the state and special
provisions  uh for making industrial planning  has to be made
""
special agriculture in the field in the state it is the team 
one or two words  
""
there are no provisions  of mechanical agriculture  no
provisions for irrigation  and other  two word  to make agriculture
 one word   economically viable 
""
in the field of industry  my state  is the most backward
""
""
the industries in the state  has not taste its  exploitative
character 
""
the british  uh colonial  exploited the natural resources in
the state to their best  and the indian which is that has taken over 
only  saves exploitative  assault 
""
local  enterpreneur  are being discouraged  in their
attempt  to enter the field  and there are   one or two words
 incentives to them not to  try healthy  one or two words  
""
industrialists operating in assam exploit the natural wealth 
resources  all profit  take this out of the state  without
contributing to the welfare of the people 
""
the industries also do not help  in the solution  of the
unemployment programme  as they are reluctant  to employ local people
""
""
they  one or two words   for industries in the north
eastern region  would not  confirm anybody with  to the people of
the state  and the region
""
 one or two words  provisions are made  to encourage 
local entrepreneur  as part of industries by offering special concession
and in  one or two words   for encouraging them  to enter the
field 
""
there are  no provisions in the budget  for rehabilitation of
the non-employed  and  one or two words   by starting 
agro-based  heavy industry 
""
they are  uh no provisions  for meeting to the 
progressive unemployment  programme  and number of announcement being
in medium  and  it is uh  increasing  by last every year
""
the problem  is a real one and a serious one 
""
the use of the state  discoverings on  are straight away
emerging out of  uh deep sense of deprivation 
""
large numbers of youth  have taken up arms  others have taken
recourse to  extortion  one word  as national  a few words 
""
""
we are going to lose an entire generation 
""
militancy  and  militarian para military forces  have
been  a permanent picture in the state  and large numbers of people are
behind the bars under tada 
""
development was  uh kept to a standstill  for years 
""
the government has  to realise  that strong arm tactics is
not going to help 
""
there should be  special provision  for removal of  the
terrorist  and the development of the state and special measure  to
ensure economic development  should be started  
 
""
b) v m jadhav 
""
""
you know and everybody knows  that in june nineteen
ninety-one  when our government has come into power  that time 
economy was totally paralysed 
""
unprecedent balance of payment crisis was there 
""
international confiderate has been total collapse  and
industrial production was falling  and inflation was  on right thing
""
""
and then  honourable narasimha rao taken up the leadership of
this country as a prime minister 
""
and mr manmohan singh  when he became the finance minister of
this country  then whatever economically beneficial  for such largest
populated country of the world  he has  sort out properly  and he
has brought out the reforms 
""
and we are today  we are getting the fruits of  for 
those reforms 
""
madam you know  and i also know we talked on the state to state
""
""
you know that our maharashtra is most agriculturally and
economically advance state 
""
it is not only due to bombay 
""
we are running about one hundred and ten co- operatives sugar
factories more successfully 
""
we are producing forty percent of the national sugarcane 
""
we are producing the forty percent total of the national cotton 
and then most of the cotton mills and textile mills are concentrated in
bombay 
""
and if something goes wrong in bombay  if war started somebody
 from bombay  so total economy will be collapsed 
""
this is the wrong policy  please for the one state you adopt
this policy of the decentralisation  of the industries to the rural and
economically backward areas of this country 
""
unless you do that  our countrymen  our people  they will
never excuse you  either  bjp  will be  one or two
words  or any other party will be  one or two words  has no
meaning  it is totally insignificant 
""
but the main significant thing is that  then important thing is
that the people of this country must get equal benefit of our economic
policies  that is the main concern 
""
that should be main concern about the country 
""
i was reading in todays one of the press about the duncan agreement
""
""
government is going to accept the duncan agreement 
""
i don't know  i have not  fully studied the duncan
agreement 
""
but government how they discuss about the duncan agreement 
""
what is the duncan agreement  ?
""
what it is going to do harm  to  the farmers  ?
""
how it will be beneficial to the farmers  ?
""
farmers are against madam for  taxing the agriculturists  but
the thing is that you please see first what is their economic situation 
""
how much he is getting in his farm  ?
""
or how much output he is getting  ?
""
we have categorically demanded in this house  this agriculture
commodity should be given the regulatory prices 
""
you  one or two words  industry  you allow us to
increase the prices of agriculture commodity by the standard move  when
you  you you you just gather sympathy to pretend but do not hike  but
at one  at one  side you are not allowing to increase the agriculture
   pro    prices   of agriculture commodity 
""
madam about the modernisation of the industry 
""
so about the modernisation of industry  much help needed 
""
but i must say that  as i have stated yesterday also   
 wh    while   discussing about the  ntc  the
national textile corporation 
""
see modernisation process is a continous process  and any
industry is coming out  any licence is given  licence are delicenced
but it must be made compulsory that  they must have their own research
laboratory 
""
they must find out their own technology  and they must try to
modernise their industry  as and when required
""
that is very essential
""
our budget should not be the deficit budget  it must be the
surplus budget 
""
our export must be much more greater than the  import 
""
we are given several concession for the import 
""
we are giving several concession for the export also 
""
but we must  do  all this  at the same time we must see
that  what we are exporting 
""
and we must push the export of agriculture commodity 
""
because in maharashtra we are trying our level best to export the
mangoes  to export the  grapes  to export the  we are demanding
that you can give us the concession  to export five to fifteen lakhs of
cattle milk 
""
and if we export something  and we get this foreign exchange 
then we can give better prices to the farmers also 
""
so now the time has come  we are not to  think twice that 
we have to give this top priorities for the export of the agricultural
commodity 
""
madam i did not  i will not go uh  in the detail but i wanted
to demand in this house  as the discussion is going on  on the budget
 so that  special financial provisions have to be made for the 
development of economically backward region  for marathwada vidarbha and
parts of konkan in maharashtra 
""
in this very house   i'm   in this very house we have
several time demanded  that uh  category development board should be
created for the backward regions of  maharashtra  marathwada vidharba
and parts of konkan 
""
government has never agreed 
""
but at least you must make this situation higher than provision 
""
what is backlog of those region  ?
""
others is  if  then when you have to mention this special
financial assistance is given for the development of the economically
backward regions of this country 
""
another important thing is that  industrialisation of sugar
factory  spinning mills  food processing industries  horticulture
development programme 
""
whatever demands are from maharashtra they should be solved within
no time 
""
creation of proper road communication  conversion of state
highways into national highways  they are demanding this from maharashtra
for the last so many years 
""
special financial assitance for irrigation 
""
as the krishna and godavari valley projects are not completed 
""
if we could not complete those projects by two thousand ad our plan
will go  and whole maharashtra will not get any water 
""
so the special financial assistance should be given for the
irrigation project which are to come up in krishna and godavari valley 
""
and laying out a special pipeline
""
now  in this house we have this is the last discussion i am
taking madam
""
the  uhm while discussing the  one or two words 
questions and some other uh items  in this house i have said that i did
not take down the lpg pipe line  which is    co   
coming   from bombay high  to the jagdishpur  and even your
enquiry  a few words  said
""
on the same line  we demanded in this house that we must have
some  a pipe line which can carry the bombay high gas  from maharashtra
to southern india 
""
it must go from the maharashtra  vidarbha marathwada  then
karnataka  then andhra  then tamil nadu  so like this the several
pipelines which can carry the bombay high  surplus gas  inspite of
clearing up the gas  worth upto fourteen hundred  crores 
per year
""
you please have the another pipeline and carry out the gas in the
southern india  so that the farmers  there  two words 
""
so that our  farmers of the southern india will be benefitted
""
with this few lines i i suppose this so  one or two words 
and thank you very much for  one word
