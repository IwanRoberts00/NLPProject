begin the chapter  the indian constitution  
""
in that we will be seeing the salient  features of the indian
constitution 
""
uh  we know that india was not free 
""
nineteen forty-seven  august fifteen  india became free 
""
but along with freedom  we needed some  framework of laws 
""
laws and bye-laws for  a better government 
""
the british had laws but they were laws more favourable to them 
""
so therefore we needed to make laws that are favourable to  us
""
therefore we will see  the chapter   the indian
constitution    cough 
""
when we talk about  the indian constitution  we are talking
about  the ideals of the freedom-fighters 
""
the ideals of the people  the ideals of the people around the
world 
""
that is why  we are going to see in this chapter  what are the
ideals ?
""
or what are the ideas upon which  our laws or our bye-laws  or
our constitution is based ?
""
therefore we will consider  the salient features of the indian
constitution 
""
in nineteen forty-seven nineteen forty-six  we had the 
constituent assembly  or a group of people  who would be studying the
various constitutions of the world  and then formulating a constitution
 based on the study of the various constitutions of the world our own
constitution 
""
the constituent assembly was the large body
""
it was not possible  that uh  all people would take part  uh
in the actual work of framing the constitution
""
therefore a smaller body was formed  a smaller body was  taken
 known as the drafting committee 
""
the drafting committee  had a specific task 
""
the drafting committee had a specific task
""
number one  of studying the constitutions of the world and number
two  of  forming or creating a draft of our constitution 
""
what we mean by a draft is not necessary that it is the final product
""
""
no 
""
it could have changed 
""
therefore they made  a a draft so that we could study the
constituent assembly could study the draft and then if they required they
would make the necessary changes before the final constitution could be made
""
""
the chairman of the drafting committee was dr  b r ambedkar 
and it had  a  various members on it 
""
dr b r ambedkar was chosen because of many aspects 
""
he was uh  good at law 
""
he had studied abroad  uh he was an individual who was 
interested in uh  the upliftment of the poor 
""
he was an individual who was involved in the reform uh in the
movement  the national movement 
""
and therefore he was chosen as the  uh the chairman for the
drafting committee whose main work was to prepare the draft  studying the
various constitutions of the world 
""
therefore the drafting committee collected the work  of drafting
the constitution and placing it before the constituent assembly 
""
the constituent assembly published the constitution the draft of the
constitution throughout india 
""
all the members of the constituent assembly studied the draft 
""
all the members of the drafting committees studied the draft 
""
all the eminent people in india 
""
all the teachers  and those who were really interested in the real
ideals and the future of the country studied the draft 
""
and there was a provision that any individual who thought fit 
that a certain change must be brought about in the draft wrote to the
constituent assembly 
""
they made their remarks 
""
they said something in favour and somethings against  a particular
clause of the draft 
""
therefore  with this process of bringing out a change for the
better finally the constituent assembly took into consideration all these
suggestions  and made the constitution of india 
""
the constitution of india was formulated 
""
the constitution of india was applied 
""
the constitution of india is in use 
""
but many a times we don't realize  its important
""
we don't realize its salient features    in our   
in other   words important  essential features of the
constitution
""
and therefore we don't realize its importance 
""
we know it is there
""
but if we do not know what is in there ?  cough 
""
so  we'll  consider  some of the salient features of the
indian constitution  constitution 
""
the first thing that we will consider  is  the preamble 
""
preamble is the most important part of the indian constitution 
""
we could consider it as a  a  a magnacarta  of the  
india    indian   constitution
""
we could consider it as an important introduction 
""
  we will   we could   consider it as an
important uh  core of the constitution 
""
why because  in the preamble lies the important principles for
which  india uh  is known for 
""
for which the constitution was made 
""
for which the people of india fought  for which we live 
""
therefore the preamble is very  very important 
""
now we will see what is there in the preamble  for us to jot down
 note  offered to observe or study 
""
number one 
""
the main thing that is stressed in the preamble  is  the
soverrignty of the people in the world we   we  the people of
india  
""
we the people of india  formulate the constitution 
""
we the people of india make and  adopt  the constitution 
""
we the people of india have these ideas  uh in our constitution
therefore it is not  i  previously we had monarchy  a king would
have his own constitution  at his uh  whims and fancies 
""
he would have a constitution  and based on that the country would
be ruled
""
but sometimes  even they wouldn't follow what was said 
""
they would change  constitution would change 
""
the people would change 
""
and therefore it was i  i the king  or i the queen declares
such and such a thing
""
there was nothing  uh any more like that to be
""
therefore we the people  we declared to ourselves  we adopt
the constitution we  have these ideals for ourselves 
""
that is why  the power of the people is very much imposed  in
we 
""
and  that's  a very important aspect 
""
never before in india was such a principle stipulated
""
that is the basis of democracy 
""
we   that's  basis of uh  our functioning now 
""
it was not there before
""
but it happened  when we became free
""
therefore the sovereignty  of the people was established  or
made  clear  in the preamble 
""
the second point that we see  are the different principles that
are enshrined  uh in the uh preamble 
""
enshrined in other words mentioned in the preamble  stipulated in
the preamble  uh put forth in the preamble
""
and those principles are  sovereign   cough  socialist
 secular  democratic  republic
""
  india to be    india to be    a
sovereign  socialist  secular  democratic  republic 
""
now we will see what every word  means 
""
so that we will have a better understanding  of uh  the
preamble  and also of these basic principles which are there in the
preamble 
""
sovereign
""
when we talk of the word sovereign we know that prior to independence
india was not sovereign 
""
in other words india was not free 
""
in other words someone else was ruling  on our territory 
""
in other words the    pre    people  
were the subject  and the rulers were someone else 
""
also another aspect of this was that the people were not having their
own government 
""
there was one monarchy 
""
so all that was there prior to independence was different 
""
therefore india was declared to be sovereign  indicating that 
india is free  indicating that no other country has any power over india
""
""
indicating that  india is free to make its own laws and its own
constitution 
""
that is why that word sovereign 
""
sovereign means  all powerful  all powerful 
""
so it very plainly lays down  the principle of india being free
 india being independent  and that was very essential for us
""
that is why the people  or the freedom fighters fought for
""
they wanted to be free 
""
they were not going to be satisfied with anything short of 
sovereignty
""
therefore the first principle of being sovereign 
""
when we talk of the word socialist  or socialism  there was
socialism in the world uh  when india was striving for freedom 
""
socialism in russia  socialism in china  and other parts of
the world 
""
socialism was uh  stipulating or bringing out the idea that all
people are equal and therefore  the property  the land and the wealth
of the country must be divided equally 
""
in that everything belongs to the state  and nothing belongs to
an individual 
""
therefore socialism because of  india's   specific
condition  because of the condition of the masses which was very pathetic
in those days 
""
therefore socialism was liken by the people of india
""
and therefore it was framed 
""
but the socialism that we adopted was not  that of russia or
china  or not that kind  where everything was owned by the nation 
where everything was nationalized 
""
nothing was private 
""
it was of that kind of socialism that we adopted 
""
the  the peculiar brand of socialism that we adopted the peculiar
kind of socialism that we had  was mixed economy 
""
mixed economy means  that part of the economic activity in india
 would be nationalized  and part of the economic activity in india
would be private 
""
therefore all those important industries which are of national
benefit  are nationalized 
""
banks are nationalized  mines are nationalized 
""
all wealth of nations 
""
therefore those railways  are natioanlized
""
they are the wealth 
""
they are for the importance of all the people 
""
they are for the need of all the people
""
therefore those uh  industries or that part of the economy which
is required by all is nationalized 
""
and that part  which uh  remains in the hands of the private
people
""
there are some industries which belong to the private people
""
so therefore we have a mixed    eco    economy
  
""
nationalised economy  and private economy
""
so our kind of socialism is not that which is  likened to the
socialism in russia  or in china 
""
secular is the   next   next    uh ideal
that we have chosen 
""
secular or secularism  we might wonder what it is 
""
there are a few countries  in the world  which have a state
religion  specially in the middle-east  there is the state religion
""
""
but there are other countries who follow democracy which do not have
a state religion 
""
india was also a country which acquired independence in nineteen
forty-seven  where there were important  major religions in india 
jainism  buddhism  hinduism  sikhism  christianity and so on and
so forth 
""
now in a situation like this  the leaders were confronted with a
dilemma  or problem  where they didn't know what to decide  or
which religion should get importance  though there was a hindu majority
 there was a muslim minority there was a christian minority 
""
therefore importance could not be given on the basis of religion 
""
so they opted for a secular state  indicating that india  will
not  propogate  any state religion  that india is  secular state
 that india will not be biased  to favour one religion  and not
favour the other
""
therefore  all religions are equal in the eyes of the state 
""
no religion is more important than the other 
""
does not matter whether it has the majority  or a minority of
followers 
""
therefore this ideal  of secularism was very favourable so that
all could survive  within india 
""
so that all would peacefully live as they have been doing for
centuries 
""
the hindus and the muslims  the hindus muslims and the christians
""
""
these hindus muslims christians jains and the buddhists  had been
surviving for the centuries  together and therefore it was thought that
they would continue to stay  in a secular state together as they had been
doing before 
""
the next ideal that we have  is democratic republic 
""
democracy as defined by  abraham lincoln    it's
 a form of government  where the power lies with the  people 
 it's  a  form of govrnment  which is  of the people  by
the people  and for the people  
""
  a very a very uh   a very   ideal thought 
a very ideal uh type of government 
""
therefore whatever is done the people are responsible  whatever
is decided the people are responsible  because it is for the benefit of
the people 
""
and the functioning of that gevernment will also be by the people
 uh with the method of election 
""
so a very ideal pattern that was choosen for india was democracy
""
""
socialism was there    a very  a very    a
very   uh  likeable ideal  because there was a  a difference
of rich and poor in india
""
if socialism  uh if socialism was adopted in india as it was in
russia or china perhaps the   country   country   could
have been made economically different 
""
but in other matters it would have been different
""
therefore  they chose democratic republic 
""
we were free  and we will rule  the country that is why we the
people the sovereignty of the people 
""
republic in that we had our own constitution 
""
we did not mean the  uh the  constitution of another country
to rule us 
""
but we formulated our own constitution therefore it was a democratic
republic 
""
therefore  it's  a very balanced view that of the
constitution that we get in the preamble
""
we the people rule the country and  those principles which will
make india a strong state is sovereign  secular  socialist 
democratic  republic
