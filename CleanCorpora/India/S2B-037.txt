festivals are  rightly said to be the living history of a
nation 
""
they are inextricably linked  with the culture  religion 
philosophy and literature  of a people 
""
and are thus connected with the innocent of man 
""
india is a unique country in the sense  that it has such a large
number of festivals  which have become living traditions of a unique
nature 
""
they carry rhythm  the entire story of the growth of our culture
 mostly in a condensed form 
""
so much so  that it has become almost impossible  to single
out an incident or factor  associated with a particular indian festival
""
""
 it's  equally futile now to say  that a particular caste
or section of society  is primarily responsible  for a particular
festival  in the modern context 
""
 raksha bandhan  is  one of such unique festivals
 of our country 
""
 it's  a cultural festival of the aryan race 
""
it is celebrated  on the full moon day  of  shravan
  and that is why it is also called   shravani 
""
""
a very old name of this festival  is  rishi tarpan
 also 
""
on this particular day  brahmins used to put on new sacred
threads  or a  one word  
""
the rituals of  yadnya  were performed  and the
heads of  ashramas   tied sacred yellow thread  around
the wrists of the people  while chanting vedic hymns 
""
subsequently  this thread itself came to be known  as
 raksha bandhan   or  rakhi  
""
as said earlier  quite a few stories are associated with this
festival 
""
one of them reminds us  of the great  daitya 
king bali  living long long before ram  in the  treta yug
 
""
bali took a vow  of defeating indra  and ruling over the
entire universe  including  swarg lok  
""
he went to his  guru  shukracharya  bid to him
his compliments  and sought his blessings 
""
 daitya guru  shukra gave his blessings to bali 
with a holy  tilak  on his forehead  and a sacred thread
 or  raksha sutra  around his wrist  this made bali
strong  and invincible on the battle field 
""
he wiped out his enemies  and became the supreme power in the
universe 
""
during the later feudal ages  the kings and warriors used to
obtain this sacred  raksha sutra   from their  gurus
 purohits   or other brahmins  before going out to the
battle fields 
""
gradually  it became an annual ritual  and then a public
festival 
""
even today  a  purohit  can be heard chanting
  yen badhwa bali raja danvendra mahabalaha  ten twam
manbadrami rakshe ma chal ma chal  
""
which means  i tie you with the sacred thread  with which
 daitya raj  bali was tied by his  guru  
your protection may be sure  and firm 
""
well  there goes another story  that when the demons
attacked  indira's  kingdom  he prepared to fight them out 
""
before he set out  his queen shachi  put the sacred 
tilak  on his forehead  and the sacred thread  the 
raksha sutra   or  rakhi  on his right wrist 
which made indra unconquerable on the battle field 
""
even during the rajput period  history tells us  wives used
to send off their husbands to the battle fields in the same manner  after
tying the  raksha sutra   to their wrists 
""
subsequently  we do not know exactly when and how  sisters
started tying this sacred  raksha bandhan  around their
brothers wrists 
""
and the whole thing got converted  into the modern festival of
 raksha bandhan  
""
despite these changes  in the form of the ritual  the
importance of the sacred thread has stayed 
""
this thread  has always been reminding man  whether a
 gurus  deciple  or sisters brother  or wives gallant
husband  or any other common man  of his obligations 
""
even people from outside indian context  have been influenced
by the holy feelings  inspired by this sacred thread 
""
when alexander came to india  he perchanced saw an indian woman
 offering a sacred thread to a river on this particular day 
""
surprised when he asked her what she had done  and when she told
him  the significance of this ritual  he requested the woman to tie the
 sutra  to his wrist also 
""
and she gladly did so 
""
similarly the great mughal emperor humayun  stood against the
muslim ruler of gujarat  in order to protect karmavati  the queen of
chittor  who sent the  raksha sutra  or  rakhi
 to him  and requested him  to protect his sister 
""
in fact  this festival of  raksha bandhan  has
been a unique indian tradition  cutting across all the ages  and all
the sections of the indian society 
""
any man feels proud of the holy thread  his sister puts on his
wrist  and does everything within his power to protect her honour 
""
in the present context  the thread puts the burden of the
sisters protection  on the brother 
""
in this way   raksha bandhan  has acquired a new
social meaning  and a new social purpose 
""
but the tradition goes on  and on  restoring a gleam of
fresh love  and assurance  in the eyes of brothers and sisters  on
this unique day  
""
""
""
some time ago  i saw in some  friend's  house  i
don't remember now in whose  i am the master of this house  and i
have my  wife's  permission to say so 
""
to my mind the statement   is   has   acquired
the value of a powerful platitude 
""
all the honourable members of the fraternity  of the henpecked
 would probably assert  that a married man can do anything he likes
 if his wife doesn't mind it  because freedom is compulsory for him
""
""
he must enjoy this freedom  when his mistress is favourably
inclined after all the labours of love and household 
""
after all as arnold banard declared long ago  being a husband
is a whole time job  and as per the globally accepted labour laws 
every worker is entitled to personal freedom and entertainment 
""
of course without any detrement to his marital duties of all sorts
""
""
what he says is also occasionally listened to and honoured by his
wife  who is very gifted  that is  young and beautiful 
""
he has no cause to mourn  if she sometime discards his proposals
or even dictates 
""
isn't she his better-half  obviously therefore she often gets
better of him  and his arguments 
""
thus  what she hits  becomes history  and whatever she
misses  remains mystery 
""
she frankly admits  that there are two sides to every question
 her own  and the wrong side 
""
precisely for this reason  very often he proposes  and she
disposes 
""
it is a matter of common knowledge that the greatest philosophers
 poets  administrators and rulers  have seen the tyranny of their
wives 
""
plato and aristotle ruled the world in their own way  but could
seldom have their own way  with their wives  who believed  that the
road to success is sealed with women pushing their husbands along 
""
isn't their belief upheld by history  ?
""
who made kalidas one of the greatest poets and playrights of the
world  ?
""
who pushed tulsi to the world of immortality  and undying fame
 ?
""
modern poets are not less obliged to their mistresses and wives for
experiencing  real pathos in life  and then enriching  their
literary output with this ennobled sweet melancholy 
""
 fanny's  no put into  keats'  throat a number of
sweetest songs that tell of saddest thought 
""
i pity dryden who couldn't realise how unjust he was  when he
suggested  that he would be greatly relieved when the wife was gone 
""
he suggested his epitaph for her grave 
""
 here lies my wife  here let her lie  now she is at
rest  and so am i  
""
even today such a sick exclamation can sometime be heard somewhere
 but  that's  just unfair 
""
generals and great politicians are no exceptions to this general
observation 
""
one day when a grocer complained about mrs  lincoln's  burst
of temper  mr abraham lincoln the great american president  laid a
comforting hand on the  grocer's  shoulder and murmured  
can you not stand for fifteen minutes  what i have stood for fifteen years
 
""
well  president lincoln knew   the time heals all
wounds  
""
although he had to ignore another significant fact in order to keep
his cool   the time also wounds all heals  
""
this would explain charles haddons pergent humble supplication 
god  save us all from wives  who are  angels  in the
street   saints  in the church  and  devils
 at home 
""
we must give them their due  musn't we  ?
""
with sincere apologies to oscar wilde it can be said  that the
only way to get rid of a  wife's  callous rejection  is to yield to
it 
""
all you need in this life  in order to escape your  wife's
 summary rejection of your proposals  is ignorance and confidence 
""
you must drive out from your life all superstitions  like
science and medicines 
""
as george bernard shaw would put it   because a woman
cannot put up with these unhealthy things 
""
a woman is like an empire  in a way 
""
she makes quick decisions  never reverses them  and doesn't
think you are safe when you are out 
""
in these things as in most others  a  woman's  wit is
often better than a  man's  arm  and fate with her  is often at
his  wit's  end  
""
it must not be however concluded that i am a misogynist 
""
far from it 
""
although some left balanced male thinkers  describe a balanced
woman as one with a narrow waist and a broad mind 
""
i do not subcribe to this view 
""
 it's  true that in some parts of the world  even today
women do not enjoy as much lead of freedom as men do  but women are not
handicapped on account of this legal flaw 
""
thanks to the generosity of nature  they are blessed with so
much of irresistible natural power  that no discriminatory laws can harm
them 
""
however  there seems to be some gross misunderstanding among
some misguided husbands  who recently formed an association in new delhi
 to press for their deliverance from the tyrany of their wives 
""
i don't understand this  because wives in india hopefully 
have not yet taken to husband battering 
""
they do and probably justifiably so assert that an ideal wife would
be any woman who has an ideal husband 
""
this however raises a very feeble doubt in my mind  that whoever
it was  who first called women  the fair sex  didn't
know much about justice 
""
i hope my wife isn't listening to me now 
""
sometimes my doubting nature drives me to think that any fool can
have  and hang  the wisest man in the world  and so any wife can
drive even the most sensible husband to desperation  by just using a
disasterous word   no  
""
i think  it will do everybody good to analyse the situations 
in which she disposes as soon as he proposes 
""
the  wife's  genius is the first factor that makes her avert
to her  husband's  initiative 
""
do not therefore pity the unsuccessful lover of a women of genius
""
""
save your sympathy for the man who marries her  because not
before long  all is real and imaginary weaknesses and failures puts spread
in the world  like wild fire 
""
in such cases  the brilliant wife may not only dispose  but
go to the extent of disposing him off 
""
nearly the same thing holds good about women who are uncommonly
beautiful 
""
such a beautiful wife  may not only come forward to edit her 
poet husband's  poem  but may even venture to edit him personally
""
""
an ugly duckling might not display such a fiendish talent  and
other invitation to a possible catastrophe may result from marrying a woman
with relation  of whom she would always boast 
""
there may be extremely successful people in society because of
their wealth power or excellences in some art 
""
the wife would tend to pity her husband  and pity herself 
secretly  but whenever an opportunity is  is there  she would
spontaneously reprimand her husband directly or indirectly  for being an
inferior soul  or lesser mortal 
""
finally  the  husband's  indiscreet and total submission
to his better half  usually corrupts and converts her into his bitter
half 
""
the husband must realise  that his wife is a shadow  who
will turn  and run ahead of him  never to be caught 
""
if he runs after her  but who will follow him tirelessly  if
he even pretend to move away from her 
""
anyway  do not grieve friends  if she still disposes  as
you are on the surest way to greatness 
""
behind every man  with pull is a woman with a push  but
quite naturally  he proposes  and she disposes
