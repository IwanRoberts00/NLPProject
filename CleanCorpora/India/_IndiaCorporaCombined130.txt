 we're assembled here this evening to  discuss the aftermath or perhaps the most reveting diplomatic engagement involving india and pakistan on over  that kashmir issue  this is a subject which has really engaged the entire  sub-continent's attention for almost uh six weeks i should think and uh towards the end it came to almost a nail biting finish with the fate of the resolution the pakistan sponsored resolution uh condemning india for alleged human rights violation in kashmir becoming a subject of international attention  and it has been uh sort of great satisfaction uh in this country that at the end of a day under uh international pressure  particularly pressure from other third world countries iran and china in particular that pakistan uh withdrew the resolution and uh it is it's not quite something that need necessarily be interpreted as a victory or defeat but it was question of uh larger third world solidarity that uh was established in geneva and the another major point that came out at the end of the geneva conference was that certain issues like this perhaps which will  be resolved uh through bi-lateral negotiations this gives a completely new opening and to discuss uh  the fallout of geneva how we move forward from here and what is being what is the reason why india was ultimately able to pursue other member countries of the united nations human rights commission uh to support that the indian position of this we have uh a very distinguished panel here today  uh mr salman khursheed the hero of geneva who has uh  almost uh i would say battled night and day to prevent the uh pakistani uh diplomatic victory in geneva  uh despite the fact that pakistan has uh in the past uh scored over us on occassion and in the diplomatic arena it's been uh very very one word achievement salman  and next to mr khursheed is mr s k singh former foreign secretary who has also dealt with pakistan for a very long time i think uh uh apart from having spent time in pakistan  itself uhm as  i started in fifty-nine  in fifty-nine  one or two words  a very long time  and we've also with us mr rasheed talib senior journalist with aligarh background who has also been uh a commentor  on national and international affairs   i'll start with salman  salman uh the question that has uh occured to me time and again is how did we do it ? from start till the end i think there was a scale  by we finish this eager expections on one one hand  on the other hand we were also kind of uh preparing ourselves for defeat  there was a sentiment that so what even if the resolution  target pass have its own fault  so we work absolutely short so could you tell us little background of this how is that we how was this achieved ? so i've my own amnesia laughter i uh i i was quite confident i think our whole team was quite confident that we had uh a margin  a clear margin right upto the last date  uh perhaps on the day of the voting the morning of the voting  uh we sleep a little bit a couple of people uh slipped perhaps due to last munute instruction but it was our margin that we maintained throughout uh which was significant and i think important in leading to the situation which finally led to uh withdrawl  uh but i think what is significant is the support that we had from the european union  uh largely because of the report that one word  ambassadors had had given them  and also the support we had in the o i c group where it became very clear after the first few rounds of of discussions we had that they were not going to take a unified single position  and certainly the resolution of the o i c karachi was not going to be uh the guiding sort of spirit of their decision  i think that broke the back really off uh the effort by pakistan to get the momentum uh that could convince uh people that they could win but you know there has been suggestion from the pakistani side  and i think there are people in this country too who uh feel that actually how we managed it was the deal  the so called deal that india was supposed to have struck with iran and china  uh and that's what really tilted uh the balance that pakistan was have was forced to withdraw  how far is that correct ? well i i'm not quite sure that i wouldn't have said the same thing if i was in their shoes going back to their country uhm i want to make it absolutely clear absolutely clear  that there was no deal no negotiation no settlement  we didn't meet iran or china any more than we met the other countries  we talked uh very openly and we talked about our position  all that iran did at the time when they ask for adjournment   one word pakistan said was adjournment being asked by uh  iran and iran said it was being asked by pakistan was they rang us and said want to make a statement to which there will be a response from pakistan and they will withdraw  we said uh lest you waste your breath there are a few point on which we will object  uh we don't allow anybody to say that about the situation in kashmir  for the rest if you have something with pakistan we'll  sit and listen to it but we're not repeat not part of any tripartite or bilateral agreement on this  and that was it they made a statement uh china picked it up  others spoke  clearly lot of them said was this is a bilateral matter it should remain in the bilateral plain  pakistan then said we agree uh we don't want any further actions on our motion  that was it  mr singh do you think that uh there could have been something more than what salman is saying ? no i don't uh i don't believe that i i from my experience  pakistan after the kind of efforts it made  let me remind you third committee resolution withdraw  after that end of the the session of the un general assembly  immediately forty-seven or forty-eight or fifty missions sent to all members uh capitals of all members  then the prime minister identified herself prime minister of pakistan identified herself with this dark project as completion of her father's work  and thereafter she goes there herself  then all this feverish statements being made all over pakistan  all over their media and her the pitch getting higher and higher  then they hoping that it would encourage the militants in the valley  and then what happens towards the end they withdraw their pivotal of sentence on which they had based their entire strategy  that is to send a self finding mission against  india's wishes into a good part of india  then that is withdrawn and then they one word  actually i think china and uh iran good very good friends of ours and much better friends of pakistan gave them and  totalling or to save their face  because i i came in here as a minister that uh that uh  pakistan would have lost this  now why it happened is something we must generalise  because internationalising this dispute has a kind of chain reaction  it took it to human rights then take it to the general assembly and then in the general assembly nudge it to the security council that was the game plan and i won't be surprised if it remains a game plan for future  not complacently we shouldn't become complacent as s k has rightly emphasised but the question that a lot of people ask i guess that whether in fact there was a withdrawl  taken into view a withdrawl on which i wish the minister would shed some light because some people say that at the very last minute the chairman of it was the dutch chairman who said what is being deferred that iranians made a short speech because we objected  and uh eventually he said it is not on the agenda  for this uh session  now what is that the we a few words  well you know uh what you do with a resolution is that the resolution is voted uh upon if the sponsor insist that there should be a vote uh it could be defeated it could be accepted  once a resolution is accepted then it gets on to the record and a resolution of the kind they wanted was self  serving resolution that automatically will repeat itself every year with a report but uh serving from a fact finding instruments on  what uh you can do to kill a resolution apart from defeating it is to bring a no-action motion  uh which is not the preferred instrument now lot of countries in the west preferring not to uh to block action as it works  through through indirect uh sort of method  so we've not uh thought of a no-action motion we wanted to be consistent without transparency uh attitude we wanted to be consistent with openness  and we said nothing to hide no blocks   let's face it in uh openly let the best man win what iran has said was specifically uh uh request the pakistan to withdraw  i had said then that the commission be treat this matter as closed after pakistan withdraw it  what the chairman did was to take the request to pakistan to be the operative part of the request to the commission  and therefore rule so  we immediately protested and i must give credit to iran and i think this is an act of courage  because actually what they could have said well we try to help but it was ambiguous you know it's no fault of ours   iran took courage instantly in his act the ambassador uh one or two word said look what i said sir was that this matter be treated as closed no  action no further action period  so obviously there was no choice  uh chairman said yes i agree if that is the case  then no-action period  everybody clapped and it was over  that if no any more in of resolution that can leave on after this to uh uh be back uh to haunt till next year but of course this week like anybody else we are going in for new resolution well one thing chandran  uh to this question that during this very session there was another resolution pssed by consensus that was anti-terrorist   ahn right and therefore in this particular session on this two aspects of our problem terrorism which is being injected inserted into india etcetera etcetera ex exported   into india on the one hand and the human rights question on the other hand  human rights question is wiped off  during the session terrorism thing stand as a decision of the commission  ahn right  rasheed would you agree that the human rights question has been wiped off ? well i think these are technicalities what the minister has just said may be right on it that's what happened  but i think we should  a few words  as we were saying earlier that we should not become complacent because it's likely to come up again at various other forum and if it does what is going to be our strategy in other words what was a strategy that worked here and what should we do in order to you know take care of it next time right  yes salman i i think one question as writer point of view commented that perhaps okay we've succeeded uh it has been a great achievement but uh this is not going to stop pakistan  from its attempt to internationalise uh kashmir that is that is the possession uh because uh having a democracy existing then we we double the effort  now do we've a game plan as to how we're  going to confront this in future ? well on two things i would like to say one uh which uh i would uh point you through s k's notice because he has far great experience of bilateral work uh which is that despite our confidence that we would win  there was a danger and there always is in a vote of anything happening  uh the important thing is that if we had had a vote uh ten or twelve people would have voted  but the margins would not have been great we would not necessarily have known how the others felt  they would abstain it  pakistan could have again said it they were abstaining but they were in our favour  we could have got one or two perhaps explanations of vote that could indicate what the mood was  but what happened in this uh event was that many country spoke  and expressively stated that this was a bilateral matter  that this should remain bilateral it should not come in two words of an atmosphere of a place like human rights commission  i think this was a significant victory and i think we've  to take a cue from this  uhm in terms of strategy not victory in terms of you know between india and pakistan  uhm the the second important think really is the transparency it was not just practical transparency to ward off a resolution it is a policy consistent policy which uh has has input at every level ministry of home ministry of defence decision at the highest level in our country the prime minister's level  that we must be open and we must be transparent  we must not hide if there is nothing to hide  and if there is something wrong the transparency will bring it to our notice as well  i think this was appreciated commented upon by the a few words ambassadors it was commented upon in a statement made by greece on behalf of eu and in our international bilateraly this was a crucial thing  which turned the mood in our favour and uh this is really something that we needed to
