""
""
for the introduction  very kind of you 
""
a lot of work has uh gone on for long distance and particularly
uh
 as we noticed  in the infield area
""
but uh  there is  a a little scope left for improvement
in
the outfield because that wasn't quite uh  a part of football
occasion
""
""
uhm  the toss 
""
not immediately clear who won but uh  the two captains
mohammad
azharuddin  leading the indian eleven  and amir malik 
the wicket
keeper  one of the few experienced  boys in the
pakistani eleven 
""
""
yeah 
""
""
 it's  unfortunate that we haven't uh  had the
pleasure of the  to be say final of the pakistan eleven 
for this
match 
""
but there are a number of other matches coming  in india and
of
course in sharjah later so that uh  a lot of people are
keeping things in
reserve  can't blame them for that 
""
this after all is  primarily a benefit one-day match  and
the
two beneficiaries  former ranjit trophy stars  from
hyderabad 
jyotiprasad and habib khan  for whom of course this must be
a very big
occasion ravi
""
""
yeah 
""
""
true there is a lot of very good cricket coming up  in
sharjah  back in india and of course down under  for a few
month 
""
the indian eleven led by mohammad azharuddin  ravi shastri
shrikant will be seen back  dilip vengasarkar kapil dev who
 has 
such a scintillating performance in the past five days
""
everybody must be looking forward to see him perform again 
""
manjrekar and tendulkar  the dynamic duo from maharashtra
""
manoj prabhakar  kirmani is back but unfortunately he
doesn't
find a place in the  indian twenty-two announced yesterday
""
""
arshad ayub and venkatpathi raju  providing the local 
flavour 
""
and one of the many fine buildings hyderabad can  be proud
of
legislative assembly 
""
so we would be seeing it during the match very often 
""
but here is the pakistani eleven  led by amir malik  
""
wi    wicket   keeper jahur ilahi  young
brother of
mansur 
""
mansur rana who happened to be the son of shakur rana  one
of
the leading umpires of pakistan
""
shahid saeed  gafar kazmi  mansur ilahi another very
experienced player  suheil fazal  javed hayat  zakir
khan and tanvir
mehadi will wear the brunt of the medium pace bowling and 
sajjad 
akbar 
""
the drop man mujahir jamshid  who did very well in the under
nineteen sometime ago 
""
there was some delay in knowing the exact uh  content of the
pakistan eleven but we are glad that all the players are now
here though some
of them have arrived very late
""
but uh of course  cricket loving public of hyderabad and of
india in general  are glad that uh  the full contingent
has arrived in
time 
""
mansur ilahi  getting a liitle bit of batting in 
""
and uh near at the v i p stand 
""
""
a lot of hard work has gone in to make sure that this match
was held 
""
""
ravi i believe mohammad azharuddin won the toss and has
elected to field 
""
so we will see some  pakistani batting first 
""
mansur ilahi would be looking forward to give another
scintillating
display 
""
i remember couple of performances in the middle east where he
did
 uh exceedingly well some years ago 
""
but uhm  thereafter i think he has been sort of in and out
really 
""
""
yeah 
""
""
so he is a very explosive batsman and a very useful medium
pacer because i think one day cricket has given rise to uh 
to uh  an
increasing number of alrounders  where if you fail with one
 then you
can certainly try and uh  get into the limelight with the
other 
""
""
charu i think
""
""
i hear a section of the crowd  still picking up actually
still early in the day but thats by mid-day we do hope to see a
a stadium
 full 
""
here are the two umpires  doing duty for the match 
ramaswamy nearer us  and behind him  shivram 
""
the capacity of the stadium is around uh  twenty-five
thousand
ordinarily but i think it has been uh  bolstered a bit by uh
""
additional stand 
""
so  yes we do have a full house we can expect upto
thirty-five
thousand people 
""
both the teams were earlier introduced to the chief minister
""
with the chief guest mr n janardan reddy  a very staunch
supporter of
sports 
""
and in his uh  tenure already we had some very major events
in
hyderabad  particularly as you were mentioning earlier ravi
the pre-
olympic football tournament two months ago 
""
and as you had mentioned the stadium received a complete 
face-lift 
""
and  the facility is added particularly for the players and
uh
 others nearer the pavilion  are now  almost world
class
""
which is very good for any venue really 
""
true and being from hyderabad i can only add that the a p
government has left no stone unturned to make sure that uh the
finest
possible facilities  uh have been incorporated into the
stadium 
""
which had been languishing for a number of years i think it was
""
uh a basically in the year nineteen sixty-one or thereabout 
and since
then not much had been done
""
so the pre-olympic football was a big boon for sportslover in
hyderabad 
""
see because unfortunately although we have the benefit of this
""
beautiful breeze that you just mentioned i think uh  further
down in the
ground it may not be uh  particularly heavy at this point of
time
""
so it would be very hard  through the day
""
and october is uhm  not the coldest month in hyderabad 
""
it can get awfully hot  but if the cloud cover does take up
bit
during the day then in fact in the later half  we will get
better playing
conditions 
""
""
true
""
""
to remind you once again this will be a forty-five over a side
match 
""
the timings are uh  well nine thirty really but i guess 
it's  about to begin 
""
there will be a forty-five minute lunch break and the match will
resume at one fifteen  till the end of play 
""
the indian team taking the field  arshad ayub at front 
led
of course by the captain  azharuddin  who had a very
successful season
 for derbyshire in the  english county cricket league 
""
""
most of the summer
""
""
no he is a batsman for all seasons i don't think there is any
search of any occasion were uh 
""
the batting being open for pakistan by their captain amir malik
also very useful opener and to his right  in the green cap
 a county
cricket cap  jahur  ilahi who is  mansur's  younger
brother 
""
and to remain  in contention for the match  fourteen 
at
this age is really a  very fitting tribute to his uh 
physical prowess
 and of course his speed and effective diving behind the
wicket but 
like i mentioned earlier its a trifle  disappointing  in
one way to not
see him in the twenty-two probable announced yesterday 
""
uhm and i am sure he must be very disappointed particularly 
""
the selection is is  not an easy job at any time and i am
sure
the selectors  must know what they are doing
""
""
 meri khyal hai  
""
""
i think kirmani is at an age  almost  where he might
qualify as a selector 
""
""
 jee haan  
""
""
jahur ilahi  all set 
""
he will be the non-striker 
""
and to open the innings  jahur
""
""
amir
""
""
amir malik beg your pardon  who is also the captain
""
and  to open the indian bowling  manoj prabhakar 
""
only one slip  to begin with  dilip vengasarkar 
""
slightly dangerous way to begin  that edge carrying 
quite
safely the second slip  which of course didn't exist 
""
the ball stopped at the boundary  by  kanwaljit singh
""
who is also now a hyderabad ranji regular 
""
and two runs to  amir 
""
manoj prabhakar seeing the necessity of the second slip 
brings
one on 
""
there we have kirmani behind the stumps 
""
vengasarkar as uh  first slip  venkatpathy raju being
brought in  as a second slip 
""
arshad ayub  seen here with manoj prabhakar  ayub is at
mid
off 
""
 that's  a nice ball 
""
a very useful swing bowler  manoj prabhakar  particularly
proving himself in pakistan sometime ago 
""
and a very good run 
""
another out swinger  all four yes swinging out 
""
ravi if i am not mistaken i think uh uh   manoj's 
important weapon is his inswinger  which he swing by a yard
on occasions
uh  in keeping that in a bit of check right now 
""
""
it has been 
""
""
yes like on that occasion 
""
wide of the crease  a little faster action  and quite a
classic inswinger 
""
of course that one didn't swing too much 
""
that is record twenty-eight years old not a young been taken any
more 
""
debut way back eight years ago 
""
end of a useful over 
""
a quiet beginning  two run from the board for the pakistan
eleven 
""
the two men in for pakistan  amir malik their captain and
wicket keeper and jahur ilahi  the younger brother of mansur
 who will
now  take strike against  kapil dev 
""
i think the media has been full  of praise for kapil 
dev's
 uh incredible performance in the irani trophy 
""
of course it is uh a team game so  the whole team should get
the
credit but kapil dev is bringing out yet another magnificient
performance
with the ball  and with the bat 
""
ravi were you there in faridabad when this was going on 
""
""
yes same as old
""
""
and a hundred and seventy-five brilliant runs uh  way back
in the world cup 
""
""
zimbabwe   unnees sau triyasi 
""
""
true   and we were 
""
""
  jab bharat ne vishwa  cup  jeeta
  
""
""
we have got some  very low score for five when he went in
 resolute  thirty or some such thing
""
quite an incredible fight like that
""
five for forty-three is his best bowling performance 
""
thirteen years of international cricket 
""
now that is a very loose  loose enough  way down the leg
side 
""
but even  kapil dev uh  can have  situations like
that
""
""
kirmani i think caught by surprise having to  try way to his
left 
""
just about collected the ball 
""
so a wide  one more  to the pakistani eleven 
""
i think the laces may be  to blame them  tying them again
""
""
and kanwaljit singh  an offspinner  for the hyderabadi
ranji squad 
""
for kapil dev also two slip 
""
dilip vengasarkar  maintaining first slip position and 
captain azharuddin  at the second 
""
i think that one was not  a milimetre away from the central
stump  because played well forward so no danger 
""
in the second over  the pakistani eleven  three for no
loss
""
""
back foot into the covers  shrikant 
""
jahur ilahi opens his account  with a break 
""
manoj  at third man  gives only a single  and that
brings amir malik onto the strike 
""
amir malik on two  jahur ilahi  on two  one wide 
and
the total  five 
""
i beg your pardon jahur ilahi  has three to his credit 
""
a bit of lift on that ball  and amir  seeing it well in
time let it go through 
""
and kapil dev too sort of angling through his first over 
""
two slip  another young hyderabadi  doing some duty for
the fielding side noel david  is now brought in  at
third place 
""
little change in the fielding shrikant moved to point  man
in the covers  kanwaljit singh mid on 
""
down the leg side and kapil completes his first over 
""
gentle  nothing spectacular  especially one as a who in
one  is a battle squad thirty-two 
""
""
yeah 
""
""
the field for manoj prabhakar two slip  four men on the
off side  third man point  cover and mid off  and
three men  on
the on  mid on  mid wicket  and fine leg 
""
""
oh gone for four 
""
""
i think jahur played inside the line expecting may be uh uh a
bigger swing  but the ball pass straightning up the just a
bit  and
catching the off stump 
""
jahur ilahi  the first casualty for pakistan and ravi here
it
is again 
""
""
 in hindi 
""
""
its here in the loudspeaker on here somewhere  laughter
""
""
but a very good ball 
""
and uh jahur ilahi i think more just beaten by the pace 
very
quick ball 
""
next man in  mansur rana 
""
its right up  mansur gets the  thirty-sixth  outside
edge i don't think that was plan to go but it did 
""
i beg your pardon  that's  a  gaffar  kazmi  we
had mansur rana in our list 
""
so that is gaffar kazmi  now at the non-striker end 
having got in a single off the first ball he played 
""
amir malik  minor change in field placing  venkatpathy
raju
being brought in  at third slip 
""
that well guided  kanwaljit is  third man  and amir
gets single 
""
 that's  a real inswinger but uh  way out  way down
the leg side so not much scope for damage there 
""
but the kind of  the the amount of swing that we were talking
about earlier  i mean he quite did it 
""
slightly unusual in one day cricket we have three slips 
""
uh  that's  a crackling drive of the front foot through
the
covers  four runs 
""
we will have to beg your pardon one more time that is  the
pakistani paceman zakir khan in the green cap on the left now
""
""
credited with that for now uh you will have to excuse us the
pakistanis did come in at a very late stage and this is not
exactly their
regular eleven 
""
but as the match goes on i am sure uh  we will all be far
more
comfortable about players 
""
twelve for one  at the completion of three overs 
""
kapil dev coming in again 
""
for him now two slip 
""
noel david back at point  little point 
""
amir malik 
""
malik picks the quick single  inspite noel david rushing in
""
""
still early in the inning  so thats some good understanding
and
good running 
""
thats noel david  youngster now becoming a teacher in the
hyderabad ranji team 
""
azharuddin  lot of responsibility   in his shoulders
   on his shoulders   in the coming months
""
""
so far uh  declared captain for the sharjah  and the
india
pak one day series to be held in india 
""
later in uh  when does it begin now november isn't it  ?
""
""
yeah 
""
""
zakir khan  carefully to midoff and i think zakir will
get uh  to his own stuff  when they go into ball 
""
one heard a lot about him   in  in   in 
""
uh  for the year having gone by but uh  he hasn't really
become a
regular feature  of the pakistani  squad so far 
""
""
 iska matlab  imran khan wasim akram  salim
jafar    waqur yunus 
""
""
 waqur yunus  
""
""
waqur yunus 
""
""
lot of  despair  
""
""
aquib javed 
""
""
true  a run from fine leg 
""
ayub  doing fielding 
""
arshad incidently has done a lot of organisational work in this
match 
""
""
yeah 
""
""
i think some credit that this match is being held must go to
arshad 
""
in and out of the indian team for the past few years
unfortunately
 particularly for his uh  region or fans in hyderabad
""
""
out  good work by kirmani  diving way to his right 
picked up the ball from the front of uh 
""
""
first slip
""
""
first slip  and amir malik trudging back to the pavilion
""
""
the second wicket  down for the pakistani eleven  with
just
about   what's  the score now  ?
""
""
fourteen
""
""
fourteen runs on the board
