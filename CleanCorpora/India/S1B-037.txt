the  accord  took place under some very very special
circumstances 
""
to what extent was this this  accession  has the consent of
people of the state 
""
to what extent it has has the integration of the state into the
union  being possible ?
""
and what have been the deficiency  in this  uh process of
integration itself 
""
and perhaps  uh to examine these  uh major question to which
we must  one word  others  if we are ever to find the solution to
problems  that faces us  uh in the state 
""
we could not have assembled a better panel of eminent expert 
""
to my left is prof  a r punjabi  a well known law scholar
 from kashmir university
""
who is currently associated with  uh the jnu  uh in  new
delhi 
""
to the left of him  prof c p bhambri  a well known
constitutional expert and political scientist also from  jnu 
""
and  to his left  prof ravindra kumar  historian  and
director of the nehru memorial museum and  library  new dehli 
""
 let's  uh start at the beginning  and go back to the
whole  issue of  the accession itself before we come down to the
problems of  uh the present 
""
at present it is it is uh the anniversary of uh  the accession
""
""
professor punjabi  if i may put it to you this way  to what
extent do you think  that the accession of jammu and kashmir to the indian
union in october nineteen forty-seven  to what extent did it have the
consent of the  people of the state 
""
""
well you see this accession took place under various 
special and typical circumstances 
""
on fifteenth of august when two dominion came into existence that
india and pakistan  people of kashmir were too  struggling to have
 uh their own government 
""
they wanted to  end the autocratic rule of maharaja hari singh
""
""
and uh  they   want   wanted   to speak
with someone 
""
and the struggle was going on 
""
well in this independence act  provided the opportunity to 
the the prince state  to accede to the either domain  india or pakistan
""
""
but the maharaj of kashmir was undecided on this issue
""
he did not  decide and uh  he asked for time
""
in the mean time  he asked for a  one word  agreement
 which was agreed to uh pakistan and  india wanted some time and some
clarifications 
""
in the mean time when  all these things were going on  there
was suddenly a tribal attack  from  the  across the border of
pakistan on kashmir 
""
so this created a  one word  situation  whereby some
decision had to be taken  and  uh states defence was involved 
""
but at the same time  it was not the question of 
maharaja  alone 
""
there was  a very popular political party  who had launched
the struggle in the state for say since nineteen thirty-one 
""
so therefore  uh the accession took place under these
circumstances 
""
""
prof ravindrakumar if i may just uh  get to you as a
historian  how do you  uh visualize in this prospect  the 
struggle in jammu and kashmir of the national conference  of uh sheikh
abdullah  ?
""
i mean    ho    where   is this placed
in the history of our freedom struggle 
""
in other words  i mean is there a link between the struggle that
was going on in jammu and kashmir  and the struggle in rest  rest of
india  for liberation from british rule
""
""
of course there is a very close and integral link
""
and  i would like to add one or two observations by way of foot
note to what  my friend riaz has already said  in this regard 
""
i think the people of jammu and kashmir  under the leadership of
sheikh abdullah  were fighting on two fronts 
""
they were fighting the autocratic government  of the ruling
dynasty at the time  and the same time  they were fighting the british
in kashmir  as do the rest  of south asia 
""
so that it was this dual struggle which was carried on under the
aegis of sheikh abdullah  and the national conference party of those 
particular days 
""
i think it is important to remember that at the same time as 
the state acceeded to the indian union  a popular government  under the
leadership of sheikh abdullah was created  in shrinagar the capital of the
state of jammu and kashmir
""
so that  both the struggles in a way  came to a successful
conclusion 
""
but uh it is also important to remember here that an assurance was
given  by the uh  government in new delhi 
""
as was true  in the case of all sub-states say like junagadh 
or hyderabad  that the  will  that the decision of the ruler 
would be backed at the later stage  by an expression of will  by the
people of that state 
""
and i think this  in a way would make the accession  truly
 one word   and truly firm  as was done in subsequent years
""
""
prof bhambri uh  but don't you think i mean on the basis of
what  uh ravindra just said  do you think that though something you
see over and above distance uh  accession in human history  there were
certain special circumstances  which uh  the other just explained
""
and i think  uhm perhaps you could throw some light on the fact
that you see jammu and kashmir was treated on a seperate footing  and the
certain assurances that were given which were legal enshrined  in a
special status for jammu and kashmir
""
in a sense  give a very special status to the state 
""
some argue that that is the root  of the problem
""
 i'll  say that this is something which would serve as a
model for the future 
""
now where exactly do you think i mean what  uh if  uh was a
special feature  that were enshrined in the constitution  were both of
india as well as the constitution of the jammu and kashmir state  which
made  the the special status  or ensured the special status for jammu
and kashmir 
""
""
chander as ravindra riaz have very clear pointed out  that
instrument of accession was brought under special circumstances  to
provide first the  one word  foundations to confront the tribal
raiders 
""
at the same time even at that very critical juncture the historical
developments of  the content of struggle in  a few words  was
ignored 
""
they were always kept uppermost in mind 
""
and once this raiders issue is resolved  jammu  and kashmir
problem  not special  not particular  but specifically in the
context of historical development  would be taken care of  by the
constitutional makers of india  which were enshrined  under article
three hundred seventy 
""
that is  the provisions of accessions  and with limited
powers of the central government  especially on the defence and foreign
affairs  would be taken  of  care of by central government  and
later on  the democrate forces  in jammu and kashmir  as represented
by  the popular leaders under  sheikh abdullah of national conference
 would through their own democratic process  form a constitution 
""
and that constitution will provide them with the  beginning of
democratic involvement of kashmir society as far as the  and a larger
problems of indian polity of democracy 
""
which was a construction of  democratic technique  as part
of  constitutional  one or two word   it was accomodation of
special history 
""
it was not a concession to call it even special 
""
special means as a significant  one word  
""
it was not a concesssion it was a very legitimate  one word 
of the historically marked struggle 
""
and aspiration of people to be satisfied democratically 
""
and hence establishment of democratic polity in kashmir  as a
first step  is under this constitution
""
""
i see that riaz is getting impatient to  one word  also
""
""
see i think uh  we would like to push we should i think
take note of two important things that one  in nineteen fifty  when
the constitution of india was promolgated 
""
now we have article one of the constitution of india which define
the critical situation of india
""
""
right 
""
""
so by virtue of article one  of indian constitution 
jammu and kashmir state was placed in a part b state 
""
because there were a b c d four categories of states 
""
and jammu and kashmir fell in the category of part b state 
""
uh that is those states which were not directly  uh cannot have
the impression  of paramouncy  but uh  while the  result of the
process  of integration 
""
and in nineteen fifty-six of course in category b state were
abolished so  jammu and kashmir state fell in the category of part a state
""
""
 that's  one part of it 
""
second part of it article three seventy  which guarantee
special status under the  one word  
""
now  as far as article one  and is concerned uhm 
precisely because that article one was being debated in the constituent
assembly 
""
uh b r ambedkar said that  there is one special feature about
article one indian constitution that  indian union is not a volantary
union 
""
secondly that  no unit has the right to secede from the union
""
""
so keeping you  in mind that have article one  whether this
jammu kashmir state and the indian union  one
""
second is this  what  became perhaps  the uh at the root
of the tension between the state leaders and union leaders  was the extent
of other constitutional  one word  
""
because  after  determining the relationship constitutional
relationship by means of article one  of the indian constitution 
""
uh then just as this is quantum relationship 
""
but i think uh  the quantum  relationship  was not fully
defined to what was the problem
""
i think there was  some difference of perception  as well 
as for as the quantum relationship is concerned 
""
you know because i  i'm  refering to article one because 
very often that it is made important point of view often 
""
and i think that it is perhaps in this context then  george 
corobel  wrote the book  uh  danger in kashmir 
""
he was member of   uncip united nation commission india
and pakistan  
""
he said  it is amazing that nobody ever raised this issue
before security council  either india or pakistan  
""
that is perhaps the   two words  has report the article
one  one was recognised 
""
""
sorry for  minor  interruption 
""
the this question on article one in the constitution not only by dr
ambedkar remaining others  also showed awareness of some of this
secessionist movement even healthy movement in other parts of the country
also  especially north-east india 
""
so the assurance was given to everyone  including jammu and
kashmir the secessions  are rejected  
""
""
uhm yeah   but it is not 
""
""
 yeah i i think   i think this is an important
point the one which  you're  making but i will also refer back to the
 question of kashmir having a special status
""
""
i don't think kashmir had any special status at all in the
sense that  one word  state throughout the country there was an
understanding by the national status who came to power in  new delhi on
the fifteenth of august  nineteen forty-seven
""
when the popular will  of those who live in the princely state
 would be affected  in the case of kashmir  uh article three seventy
went as far as saying  that in actual constituent assembly within the
framework of article one to really define the precise nature of the
relationship  between kashmir and the rest of the indian union 
""
finally i would think that when that constituent assembly made its
announcement  in nineteen fifty-two and fifty-three
""
those announcement as  has been suggested by riaz and  one
word  shah but  two words  developing  and changing  uh
announcement is not meant to be a static anouncement at all
""
it was seen as a revolving  situation
""
""
 i'm  transgressing my role as moderator but i can't do
not quite agree  what your  observation on uh you know there have not
been a special status
""
because after all you see article three seventy 
""
and  you see from the  things that are enshrined in it uh
such as there being a separate uhm  constitution for jammu and kashmir
""
and some other  some symbol of uh  that that is there  a
separate emblem  uh separate flag and uh
""
""
of course
""
""
no  no i think you see these were uhm  uh has was wasn't
concession it as i said earlier  see this could  uh many people argue
that this could serve as a model for for their for their future
""
there have been demands from other parts of the country  that
article three seventy should be extended to other places 
""
on the other hand there is other tendency which says that this 
is  three seventy is the root of this problem and because we had a
special  relationship with kashmir the integration of kashmir  with the
main stream of india was never  uh complete
""
""
chander uh
""
""
uh how would you uh    a few words  
""
""
  a few words   
""
""
but i honestly want to say  ke   you're
 misunderstanding my position
""
what  i'm  saying is the communality lay  in the
declaration of the new delhi leaders 
""
that the  people's  voice would be consulted throughout the
region of princely states you know 
""
of course  the very fact that a constituent assembly was given
to  the people of jammu and kashmir means giving them  uh a special
status but that special status doesnot at all consent  that the place 
of kashmir and jammu and kashmir  within the indian union or the 
inter-media 
""
""
of course  certainly  certainly not
""
but uh what the focus of  uh what  we've  brought
perhaps i think you know  is the time we suspect  has come to see what
 we've  seen as  uh happening in kashmir over the last few years
""
actually i think uhm  very  very sad because in a sense that
kashmir  uh state have a special place in the heart of  most indians
""
and to see  what's  happened  to the valley 
""
 it's  something which  you know pain  all uh 
those committed to democracy and federalism in this country 
""
and considering that those indeed certain special provision made
for jammu and kashmir 
""
why ?
""
why did this happen i mean   what   where  
really we went wrong
