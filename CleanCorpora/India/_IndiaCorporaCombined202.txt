chalk with a chalk in my hand and a black board at my disposal because that is what we are all use to  but uh this is some sort of a formal lecture in a sense that i will not be able to move from the uh dais uh here  now i have chosen for my talk today a subject  india's science and technology policy and the possible role of universities in its implementation  while choosing this topic i had two view points in mind  first that as citizens rather than as teachers you should know in what direction our government is moving  what should be the basis of our technological programmes  and how should we really go about it  secondly i thought that as teachers of the university you should know what we should be doing in order to assist our national programmes and therefore partly informative partly i could say a request of what you should really be doing  now if you look into the history of mankind you will find that right from the beginning say from the invention of the wheel you have found that the scientific discovery has been followed by some sort of a major sociological development or economic development where the life patterns have changed  you as i said you could start with the invention of the wheel  you could come to the industrial revolution where the steam-engine brought the revolution or you could come to the present day where the computer uh chip is bringing about such a revolution  and therefore it is very essential to plan our scientific programmes  so you can say that the industrial revolution which swept europe say in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries highlighted the fact that the economic growth of a nation is largely depend upon the scientific and technological advances it can achieve  and therefore we must have a consistance science and technology policy  now you may have a policy it may be perfectly laid down  every step may be taken care of but you can implement that policy only  if the proper environment is present and if you have got a trained personnels to implement that policy  this applies not only to science and technology it applies to every aspect of life take even our teaching programmes  we may know that our m sc syllabii for example must contain a b c d  we also know that all these things must be taught but unless the whole atmosphere in the university is such that we can really teach those aspects and we got trained personnels who are capable of teaching we find that this sort of thing doesn't work  and therefore the first point we must always remember while considering any policy and in this case the science and technology policy is  that the proper background has got to be developed  thus you will find that when we finally come to the implementation of the national policies the brunt will have to come  on the university and on the teaching system because we are going to provide them the men who are going to later uh act and who who in the years to come are going to lead our scientific and technological development  now this aspect was well thought out by our national leaders even before we became independent  the science and technology policy gre owes a great deal to the foresight of pandit jawaharlal nehru  even before we achieved independence in the days of pre-independence uh you will find that in one of the in uh  uh indian national congresses he had outlined our policies in nineteen hundred forty-six when his discovery of india came out  there were statements which clearly showed that he realized  that the social upliftment of the people was not possible unless a basic scientific policy was designed  and i'll just quote one sentence from his  discovery of india which will let you know what his thinking was this in quotes is open quote it is science alone that can  solve the problems of hunger and poverty of insanitation and illiteracy of superstition and deadening customs and traditions of vast resources running to waste of a rich country inhabitate by starving  people  and therefore looking at all the problems he tried to set right the scientific background  and while setting right the scientific background he did not  think in terms of the natural uh resources alone in terms of say  laboratory development but he emphasised the need of what is known as the scientific temper  so the very basis of the science and technology policy as visualized by pandit jawaharlal nehru was the development of a scientific temper  even in any field this could be uh applied and it basically means that you should be able to think in a logical manner you should be able to find out what are the next steps you are going to do and what that is going to lead to  whether your uh actions are correct or incorrect whether they can be supported or not supported that is what the scientific attitude or the scientific temper or the scientific way of thinking means  and that is what he emphasised so the basic understanding is that you should first learn to think logically and to act logically  now with this background he set about uh to creating a background on which technologicl development took place  firstly we all know that he said that we have got to provide better technologies which would enable the country to progress more rapidly  the spinning wheel or the charkha had its own symbolic value it had its value as far as the villages were con   concerned  but simply by producing say khadi we would not survive in the world of competition and therefore for a even such a small thing as a  charkha he introduced the mechanized type of  charkha which is known as the amber charkha or it was known as the amber charkha in those days  similarly he said about building dams  uh he said about bui building   up heavy industries in fact the knowledge that the storage of water was essential for our agricultural development led to our policy of big dams it was at that time in the early uh the late uh say uh late forties and early fifties that we thought of hirakud and uh bhakra and so on  and in those days he emphasised that dams our are the temples of modern india he did not want people to go uh to uh a temple in the religious way think of a temple in a religious way but he thought that objects  which could be emulated which could serve as a symbol of progress should be our real temples  at the same time he set about setting up large research laboratories the first was of course the national chemical laboratory at poona then you have the national physical laboratory and a chain of national laboratories came uh forward  today there are people and there is who think that these steps were probably not in our best interest for example uh you may say that a dam probably gave us water it probably gave us electricity but it did not take care of the ecological aspects or of the environmental aspects  you can say that a national laboratory created certain small centres of excellence but the money poured into the national laboratory  deprived you can say the university these are things we which we find in hind-side but it is the fore-sight that you have got to build up a scientific base which was nehru's real contribution to our development  and in terms of this uh contribution the first thing that india did was in nineteen hundred and fifty-eight when it adopted what was known as a scientific policy resolution  do you mind if i treated it like a class-room sir ? because they will otherwise not be able to take down anything ahn it was at this point that we adopted in nineteen hundred and fifty-eight what is known as the scientific policy  resolution  now this scientific policy res  resolution was aimed at providing the basis for our scientific programmes in future  now what are the main points of this scientific policy resolution ? the first major point was to foster promote and sustain the cultivation of science and scientific research in all aspects  pure applied and educational  so the promotion of research was the main framework or the main bullwork on which our science policy was based  the second point was to ensure an adequate supply of research scientist of high quality  it was this was also considered necessary not only the scientific equipment but the scientific personnel  the third uh point was to encourage and initiate with all possible speed programmes for the training of scientific and technical persons  the next was to ensure that creative talent is encouraged  and finds full scope in scientific activity  and encourage individual initiative for the acquisition and desimination of knowledge and for discovery of new knowledge  and lastly to secure for the people of the country all the benefits that can accrue from the acquisition and application of scientific knowledge  so these are the points which i will give you later  but here we have got to emphasis the fact that what was required was one bui building up the scientific infra infrastructure  second building up this uh scientific personnel required third was to ensure that scientific knowledge was dessiminated to the people  and above all what is most important was to see that any scientific uh programme or any scientific discovery did not lie in science alone but it was transmitted to the people  now in much later you will find that uh in the late eighties this came out in the form of our technological mission which i will talk to about later  but the building up of the infrastructure the building up of the personnel require the transformation of information and the transformation of the benefits of science to uh the rural popu  uhn people or to the poorer section that was the main thrust or the main basis of our science policy as formulated in nineteen hundred and fifty-eight  uh the one word basic difficulty about this  scientific policy resolution which the lok sabha adopted was  it spoke of science but it did not spoke speak   of technology  so the next step came in nineteen hundred and seventy-three when a national committee for science and technology  was formed to advise on how the scientific achievements or the scientific material could be transferred into technology and that is when the people came in  now this uh committee on science and technology  presented an approach paper in nineteen hundred seventy three  so this is the science and technology committee report  and this science and technology committee report emphasised again four or five points which are firstly the resources allotted to research and development in india and other developing countries were grossly inadequate that was the first point  the second the transfer or import of technology from developed countries was not in the interest of developing countries  thirdly many required technologies could be indigenously  developed  fourthly quality and relevance of education in schools and universities had to be ensured so as to stop the stupendest waste in human resources  and next an adequate machinery had to be set up to monitor  evaluate correct and redirect various programmes in science and  technology  now if you look at the basic points of the report of the nineteen hundred and seventy-three science and technology committee you will find that they said what we are still saying in nineteen hundred and ninety-one that is the eighteen years later  we are not saying anything quite new we are again stating the same fact that we don't have enough money for research that we should not import technology from outside we should develop our own technology  the quality of our education should improve and that an adequate machinery should be formed to transfer the benefits of science to society so in other words though our thinking process have been proper  though we have realized what should be done though we know the path on which we have to travel we are not being able to implement it  and this if you can recall brings uh that out my opening remarks that what is necessary is not only a science and technology policy but the environment to promote that policy and the personnel to promote the policy  if after twenty years we still can not find an answer to  uh the questions which we set ourselves uh a long time back then there is something wrong and that wrong is that we have not developed the right attitude in which our scientific development can take place then the next step is in nineteen hundred and eighty  three when the government gave what is known as the technology policy statement  now this technology policy statement tried to say what should be our programmes of technological development  and this is essentially something which is more or less a repeat of what has been visualized in the science and technology  policy  so the government issued in nineteen eighty-three the technology policy statement according to which the basic objectives of a  nation's technology policy were stated to be firstly development of indigenous technology  second acquisition of imported technology and its efficient absorption and adaption appropriate to national priorities and resources
