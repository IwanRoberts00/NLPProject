okay ganga  okay ganga today i tell you uhn about the  uh terrorism in kashmir  you know uhm when we left kashmir no uhm  somewhere around in ninety ninety yeah ninety march  uh we have to face such a difficult time i can't tell you we left that uh place in the night time two o'clock  because the terrorism was so much means like it was so so much uhm widespread you couldn't yeah we couldn't stay there  like uhm those terrorists uh they wanted us to uhm uhm to accompany them in the revolt against india they want freedom so they told us that you also accompany us  and we'll fight against india we want freedom we'll have a separate state  but as it is hindus are in minority there in kashmir uhm   uhn   uhm   you couldn't  muslim is more  yeah muslims are more in number  hindus are in minority so hindus said no we will not uh  fight because india is our country we don't want freedom  so we won't accompany you in the job   that's why those uhm muslims they got very angry  they said no you have to accompany us accompany us if if you if you want to live in this place you have to accompany us  we said okay fine uh some people uh accompanied them and some people didn't  and those who didn't we were one among them  we just left the place in the night time because of people were trying to poison the water and then they were trying to put off the electricity in the whole one word in the whole city  and then again they were uhm trying to trouble us by invading our houses and trying to misbehave with our women and all  so it the turn took like that we left the city in the middle of the night and we got scared we didn't even take things along with us just the clothes we were wearing  we went in those clothes only uhn  so later on when we came uhn to uh to jammu we migrated from kashmir to jammu  then uh then there we couldn't adjust with climate and all  in jammu  it was very difficult because kashmir is basically a very cold place and uh jammu is a very hot place  the temperature is uh ranges from uh thirty to say forty or so  forty-five  many kashmiris died also in jammu because of hot weather  jammu  yeah uhm then uhm  then what happened  yeah something about kashmir i'll tell you because kashmiri in kashmir muslims are also suffering a lot  they are not earning that much they are supposed to earn  uhn  uhm i tell you like uhm uh in our kashmir no in  summer months we used to have some uh somewhere around uhm  i don't know it was the income was too much it used to be somewhere around in crores when it comes on state level  now it is nothing because the tourism is nil  those people are suffering   nobody can go  nobody can go to kashmir now because they don't want any tourists also   they're kidnapping tourists   that's why the tourists what they will do this this kidnappers to tourist  they might kill them or they might uh try to ask them uh like to do something or they might tell government to leave their terrorist in uh return  like we leave this tourist only if you return that uh  terrorist which you've uh arrested  means any terrorist the government would be arresting no the police will be arresting  those terrorists they have to leave  if uh  but there some tourist is there or no in kashmir  there are no tourists now the tourism is at nil  there are so many hill stations and uh beautiful lakes and forest and everything but all in vain now  only the export will be there because the fruits there are lot of apples and peaches and plums and pears  those all they'll export now means sent out of the kashmir  they won't keep it there because that is the only they have income for them  those people are also suffering a lot so many people have died  they were supposed to be a big big very big field there uhn you think it'll improve now  i don't think it will improve because those people already many have died no  so they want that let some more also die but we'll take the freedom once for all  but i think india also won't let it go because uhm if india  let's it go means it has to let go also punjab also then  it has to let go uhm then this naxalite uh problem also there they also then then also they have to give uhm this another state for them people for those people also  uhm i mean so so i think uh this problem will never end and uh sufferers are we people  we have left all our property there worth lakhs  of rupees  and all it is very difficult and especially for business people  they have just scrambled businesses all flop there nobody can uh rely upon business there  anytime it the shop may be burnt down or any time in cross fire your life is also not secured there  you may you go out of the house in the morning you do  you never know that you will come back in the evening because the condition is like that  in the evening time you are not allowed to keep the electricity on they think that uhm those uh security people think that you are doing any conspiracy inside  so for that also you have to take care you you don't have any freedom literally there because even now security forces are trying to  get the situation in normal  but that requires a lot of strictness and that strictness seems to be adopted to the people there  even they are getting against security people now  life is nothing  life is nothing that is not the question life is something but you have to struggle to achieve something  life is a dream   that's all  nothing  i think  missing my mummy  missing my papa missing my everyone what to do  it really yaar feeling so bored i mean in the hostel   one word you will feel bored yaar   because this not house yaar come on  you don't feel like to do anything na  i don't feel like to  i wish we had a long long holiday and we would go somewhere relax at a beach and
