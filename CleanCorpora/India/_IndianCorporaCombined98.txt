poona poona   poona yes  so they called uh students from our department yes  for the written exam right  after those who were qualified for that were called for an interview yes  and interview was conducted by uh you want all that  yes yes it was conducted by the now one word mr kardale  and one patanjali shetty yes  so they said whether we would like to do sports reporting yes  so i was keen on that also uhm  so then after that uh after a month or so they said that they are taking as reporter here in pune yes   indian express   yes  uhm  but that was uh they wanted me to join before my exams yeah  so i joined in april nineteen ninety nineteen  eighty-eight  so till nineteen eighty-eight you join indian express  yeah yeah  as a trainee reporter yeah  may first to fifteenth i took leave yes for the exams  yes  ah so i gave my exam during that time right  then i joined back ah  then what and the next thing was my result yes  i got a first class right  then in october eighty-eight i married yes  so after marriage sudha went to bombay yes so she got a   job   i also and that that time indian express was short of people in bombay yes  so for their desk ah pune desk  ah  yes  so i asked for a transfer ah and i was given it immedietly  ah  yes so i went there but sudha had gone over to bombay earlier yeah earlier  and how long were you alone in poona ? poona i would have been alone for say  two three months  no one month just one month yeah within one month i managed everything yes  okay so ah october fifth we married ah  by november tenth i was in bombay ah  so  ah  then i joined the desk there ah as a sub-editor  ah  yes  and at the pune desk right and uh then sudha got a job in free press yes and i was conf i went on probation in november itself that is after your pe period as trainee journalist you were on probation   probation  yes and provisional period was how long ? three months  three months yeah yeah and after completing the  two or three months i'm not sure about it yes  so after completing probation i became permanent yeah  but on the desk the problem was later on it came that pune edition unit every one will go for night shifts  yes some seven o'clock till twelve o'clock  everyday  that means everyday you would have been require to   everyday we have to do only that particular shift only yeah  because they didn't need for anything else yes so i ask for a transfer to the bombay desk ah  so when i went to the bombay desk uh they put me on two shifts one was the mid shift that is on two o'clock to eight  o'clock yeah and alternate we had night and this mid shift  yeah  yes  so that was also getting quite boring laughter  so i wanted to shift to that uh reporting yeah  so at that time i was i think right from the begining your main interest was reporting yeah reporting not desk but i had gone to bombay because  yeah because you wanted the transfer to bombay yeah that's right   that's why you accepted the desk yeah that's right and i was not very su uh knowledgeble about all this that it was difficult to shift from desk to reporting right so at that time i had written some sports copies from here from pune for indian express  yeah  they had a sports uh suppliment yeah  extra sport it was called  yeah  yeah  so rajanbala was handling that and he knew i had written and uhm he had liked couple of thesis  uhm  yeah so when i was in bombay he just came to know that i was there uhm and said why don't you join the sports desk  ?  uhm  yeah  so i put in an application uhn to the news editor saying that i want to join the sports desk  uhn  yeah but they wouldn't leave me because they were short of staff on the desk as well as they didn't want anyone moving from there yeah all petty yeah politics  yeah  politics  so i then he said no you have just come  no no was there politics between the say those who i mean the person who are in charge of sports desk and yeah yeah there is lots of politics  accha  uh uh although they had equal rank  equal rank but they never let you like you don't give your personal interest i see ah you know that sort so you hold on to the persons who are working with you yeah you hold on to the person for your ego problem   yeah as well as staff shortage also  yeah  yeah  and moreover you don't see eye to eye with the other  laughter yeah  yeah basically because of that uhm  then he said at that time ke wait for five six months you have just joined then i will consider it  so i waited for six months and again i put an application yeah  so he said no at that time the new r a had com  complained the converse haan so he directed it the application back to the news editor who said no  haan  ah so it was getting too much  yes  for one month i just didn't go to office laughter  without informing them  without informing them yeah and i made the rounds of all the newspaper offices down  there   yeah  at that time daily was revamping they had a new editor yeah  rajat sharma  ah who is this aap ki adalat  yeah now he yeah  so he  aap ki adalat  he had just taken over uhm and they were revamping and looking for more people  uhm  yes  so i just said take me as a reporter uhm  chief reporter there was one mr rangan uhn  so he interviewed me and he said he found me okay yes  then he uh took me uhm and i went without a pay hike also i just wanted to get out yes  so one after when the month was getting over i just went in submitted my resignation in the off day yes from  indian express laughter   yes  luckily i got the job yes that is what matter  yes  yes so i went there and i started doing beat nearly all the beats were handled by all the people who were already there yes
