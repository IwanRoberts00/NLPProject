in the recent elections we have seen that  sociologists are those people who forecast election results  have become even more important than astrologers  this is a welcome sign because it speaks of rationalization of social life and a an increasing recognisation of the need to ascertain public opinion before certain decisions are made regarding the life and future prospects of a number of persons living in a country  this is very important in a country like india where the size of the population is uh going to exceed a hundred  crores soon  and it is not enough that we have elections every five years  but we must ascertain public opinion at regular intervals on a number of issues  now decision makers require a lot of information  for making decisions regarding planning of social change  regarding implementation of accepted policies and moreover  due to increasing democratisation of social life  we need from time to time more and more data as to what  people think on a number of issues concerning their interests  of course elections are held every five years but then  the decision makers must know what exactly is to be done under  situations certain situations by doing social service or   resorting resorting to what they say is one word or the measurement of public opinion  in other words social surveys are becoming more and more important these days uh in order to make decisions before certain policies are made  and students of social sciences especially those of sociology  political science economics etcetera must know what social surveys are and how they are done  today we are going to discuss the broad outlines of what social surveys are and how they are done  in our social surveys a representative sample of the population or the universe uh about which we want to make  general statement is taken  they are interviewed in a proper manner  the data thus collected from the representative sample of the population is tabulated  these tables are uhm interpreted and then a report is given showing the results of the social survey  when we want to do research on a topic this uh topic is divided into aspects or dimensions or sectors  these sectors are further analysed into variables and when we want to do research in a subject we have first of all to identify the relevant variables  after identifying these variables we have to do social surveys that is social surveys are started only if the  releve relevant dimensions and variables  in a problem have already been identified  social surveys are done in order to ascertain how big  or how small the effect of these variables is  that is what is the magnitude of these variables  then social surveys also enable us to ascertain the relationship between these variables and also to uhm formulate or to and to test uh hypothesis  about the relationship between these uh uhm uhm variables as also which of these hypothesis is to be accepted uh and which of these is to be rejected and which of these can be modified in order to come to certain conclusions with a known degree of confidence  now the question arises what a variable is ? let me explain it with uh an example  suppose we are doing research on social tension  prevalent in uh many parts of india  this is our problem for analysis that is social tensions in india  now there can be several uh sectors dimensions or aspects of social tensions in india  and these may be due to the due to factionalism  one factor of social tensions another factor uh factor of social tensions may be uh religious inter-religious and inter-caste rivalries  still another factor of social tensions may be for example  uh widespread unemployment  now factionalism inter-religious and uh  inter-caste tensions and thirdly unemployment these can be said to be the three factors of the problem under study that is social tensions in india  each of these factors is further composed of or can be analysed into a number of variables  and these variables may be for example age may be for example gender may be for example rural urban background or may be for example uhm exposure to mass media and so on and so forth therefore a problem can be analysed into factors and factors can be further analysed into variables  the task of social surveys is after we have identified these variables to find out their magnitude their mutual relations and if possible whether they are closely connected or not the social anthropologists often use participant observation for this purpose  and some others may use the case study method for this purpose then social surveys are done but be sure that the survey method is not suitable for ascertaining the cause and effect relationship between variables  for that we have to go beyond the survey method to  perform experiments in order to ascertain the uhm relations  cause and effect relationship between variables and to say uh certainly that certain variables precede certain other variables invariably  and some vari uh and the relationship between  the these variables is asymetrical  that is when we want to say that x is the cause of y  then uh we must be able to produce evidence with the experimental method that x invariably precedes y and x and y cannot occur unless x occurs in other words social surveys like between uh the experimental method which is used to ascertain the cause and effect  relationship between variables and on the other hand the case study method or the method of participant observation which is used to  identify the relevant variables involved in a problem  a social survey cannot do all these things uhm but then  the survey method is the grant trunk road or the most important method or the raajpath of social research  and it can uhm this is one of the several methods used in social sciences  be sure this is the not the only method but the most important method of social surveys  as i said earlier social surveys are done with the help of a representative sample of the population or the universe under study what do we do ? we formulate or we prepare a an interview schedule or a questionnaire or an interview guide and either we sent the questionnaire by post to a representative sample of the population properly selected by using statistical criteria or we go ourselves or send our interviewers to interview these people on the spot in a face to face situation with the help of an interview schedule or an interview guide  in the western countries telephone surveys are being used  more and more frequently more and more often  but in india since many people do not own telephones  surveys can hardly be done with the help of uh telephones except  on a few problems where the upper middle class is being studied  and the problem is such that interviews with those uh who possess telephones are enough  in practice most surveys are done with the help of interview schedules  a researcher uh sends his interviewers to say two thousand uhm persons around the country these are known as respondents and the interviewers ask them a number of questions  now an interview schedule has to be prepared in a proper manner  since we have to make generalisations make general statements about a large number of uh people what we have to do is to ask them the same questions in the same situa   in the same sequence ensuing that not only the wording of the question is standardized not only the sequence in which the questions are asked is standardized but also the situation in which these uh questions are asked is standardized so that we can be sure that all the respondents all the persons being studied have been asked the same question and not a slightly different question  after the interviewers or the research assistants have filled in the interview schedules these are sent back to the institution  or the university department where the researcher is situated  the data from the interview schedules are coded on uh code sheets then these are punched on code cards or otherwise transferred to a computer readable medium like a uhm magnetic tape or like a floppy disk  these are fed into the computer  the computer enables us to process these data and prints out uhm a number of tables  these tables are then uh interpreted by inspection or by applying certain statistical measures like the chi-square or several other types of statistical methods  and then these interpretions pretations are put together in the form of a research report  the research report provides us answers to the questions  we started with that is uh the questions which are to to which answers are needed by the researcher as well as the sponsor that is the person who or the institution who have uh or has financed the conducting of this uh survey and has uh made it possible for the researcher to perform all the operations and take all the trouble of going through from the process of preparing the research design collecting the required data with the help of an interview schedule processing the data analysing the data and uh  uh writing the research report  the research report may provide us answers as to for example what is going to be the outcome of the coming elections ? in other words social surveys are becoming more and more important these days uh in order to make decisions before certain policies are made and in order to implement these decisions make the implementation of these decisions easier and and  so on and so forth  the survey method is as i said the most important method of social research
