familiar incidents  do not usually excite our  curiosity 
""
we look at them  and we take them for granted 
""
we do not ask  what makes them  happen  ?
""
how they are connected with the rest  of the universe  ?
""
it was  one of these mundane incidents  which excited the
curiosity  of  issac newton 
""
he saw  an apple fall from a tree 
""
it made him wonder  whether the law of nature that made the
apple fall  would also make the moon  fall towards the earth 
""
he was taking a great intellectual leap from the apple  to the
moon 
""
he was not content  with having seen this event with his physical
eyes alone 
""
he was trying  to see a hidden connection behind the phenomenon
 with his  intellect  the third eye 
""
what is the connection  that newton saw  betweeen the apple
and the moon  ?
""
let us look at the moon 
""
if the earth  did not attract the moon  the moon would have
travelled in a straight line and escaped to infinity 
""
the  earth's  attraction provides the centripidal force 
that bends the  moon's  projectory  continuously  from its
linear projectory 
""
one can therefore say  that the moon is continuously falling
towards the  earth's  centre 
""
it is exactly analogous to the case of the spacecraft  that we
talked about in an earlier episode
""
now  if the  earth's  gravity extends  upto the orbit
of the moon  and this force decreases  as the square of the distance
from the  earth's  centre 
""
it is easy to calculate the acceleration of the moon as it falls
 from a knowledge of the acceleration of the apple 
""
since the moon is sixty times  as far from the centre of the
earth as the apple  its acceleration should be sixty multiplied by sixty
that is  three thousand six hundred times smaller  than the  apple's
 acceleration 
""
the remarkable thing is  that this gives the right answer for
the moon to go  once round the earth in twenty-eight days  exactly as
observed 
""
this was  newton's   famous  moon test 
""
in fact in the beginning  he used a slightly wrong value for the
distance of the moon from the centre of the earth  and therefore got  a
slightly wrong value for the lunar month  that made him wonder for a
while as to whether  there was something other than gravity  which
affected the  moon's  motion 
""
he therefore didn't publish his results until much later 
""
the primitive concept of forces  arises from our experience of
 pushes and pulls 
""
newton made a tremendous intellectual leap  from such a concept
of contact forces  to the concept of forces  such as gravitation 
which act over a distance through empty space 
""
this is how he made  the leap 
""
consider the uniform inertial motion of a body  in a straight
line  covering equal distances ab  bc  cd  de and so on  in
equal times 
""
let the points  a b c d e  etcetera  be
joined by a straight line  to the point p  not on the line of motion
""
""
then  the successive triangles  all have equal bases  ab
 bc  cd  de  etcetera  and the same height  h  from the
base 
""
therefore  they all have the same area 
""
since these equal areas are swept out in equal times  this is
clear that inertial motion  traces out equal areas in equal times 
""
now newton supposed  that the body received a succession of
blows  at regular intervals 
""
all directed towards a common point  p 
""
then the direction of motion would change at every blow  and the
body would coast along inertially in a straight line  between these blows
""
""
the linear path would thus be converted into a polygon  whose
sides would still determine consecutive triangles of equal areas  with
respect to the point p 
""
now says newton  let the time between successive blows become
smaller and smaller  then the number of blows and triangles would increase
 and the width  would decrease 
""
in the limit of arbitrarily small intervals of time  the
projectory would be a continuous curve 
""
this is the crucial point 
""
it lies at the very heart of calculus 
""
this limiting procedure enabled newton to make a transition 
from a succession of discrete blows  to the concept of a continually
acting force  directed towards a common point  a central or centripidal
force causing curvilinear motion 
""
and he discovered  that bodies moving under the action of such a
force would trace out equal areas in equal times 
""
this is  keplar's  second law of planetary motion 
""
notice that newton arrived at the concept of an attractive force
acting over a distance  as a mathematical limit of a succession of direct
impact 
""
he wrote   what i call attraction  may be performed
by impulse  or by some other means unknown to me 
""
i use these words here to signify in general  any force  by
which bodies  tend towards one another  whatsoever be the cause
 
""
he didn't pretend to know the cause of gravity 
""
could it be due to  a shower of ethereal particles  or was
it is as descartes had imagined  ?
""
newton was curious  but he couldn't decide 
""
he left the question  open 
""
but what is important is that he didn't stop there 
""
he simply assumed the existance of gravity  and proceeded to
work out its consequences 
""
this pragmatic approach  was  essential for the progress of
science in his time  but it was completely misunderstood  by many of
his eminent contemporaries 
""
it led to  a lot of unnecessary and bitter controversy 
""
having shown that a centripidal force acting continually would make
a body move in a curve  that traced out equal areas in equal times  he
also proved the converse  namely that this area law employed a motion in a
central force speed 
""
since the area law held for planets  it became clear to newton
that the force acting between the sun and the planets must be a central force
""
""
he had earlier deduced from  keplar's  third law of
planetary motion  that a circular orbit employed a force  that
decreased as the square of the distance from the centre 
""
armed with the discovery of calculus he was now able to show 
that under a central force that decreased at the square of the distance  a
planet would describe  an elliptic orbit 
""
in other words  he derived  keplar's  first law of
planetary motion  from causal principles 
""
now  this derivation of  keplar's  empirical laws 
held only for an imagined system  a hypothetical point particle  moving
around a centre of force  in a perfect vacuum 
""
the real world is of course much more complex 
""
newton therefore didn't publish his results 
""
in the mean time  robert hook quite independently hit upon the
idea  that the attraction between the sun and the planets  fell off at
the square of their distances 
""
however  he couldn't work out  what the orbits would be under
such an attractive force 
""
he tried to get newton interested in the problem  and wrote to
him in january sixteen hundred and eighty 
""
but newton didn't reply  as an earlier controversy with hook
about the nature of light  had offended him 
""
in london  there were two other men  who were  also
working on  hook's  problem 
""
christopher wren  the famous architect of saint  paul's 
cathedral  and edmund halley 
""
in august sixteen eighty-four  halley  who was younger than
hook and more tactful  went to cambridge on horseback  to find out if
newton could help 
""
a contemporary account  states  without mentioning either his
own speculations  or those of hook or wren  he at once indicated the
object of his visit by asking newton  what would be the curve described by
the planets on the supposition  that gravity  diminished at the square
of the distance 
""
newton immediately answered  an ellips 
""
struck with joy and amazement  halley asked him how he knew it
 ?
""
why replied he  i have calculated it  and being asked for
the calculation  he could not find it  but  promised to send it to
him 
""
this was the beginning  of the writing of  newton's 
principia 
""
perhaps the greatest book on physical science  ever written 
""
it took him nearly  three years of incredible labour 
""
he submitted it to the royal society on twenty-eighth april
sixteen eighty-six 
""
one of the greatest days in the history of science 
""
it was finally accepted by samuel peeps  the president of the
royal society  and published in sixteen eithty-seven 
""
it would not have seen the light of day  had it not been for the
constant coaxing and persuasion by halley  who even paid for its
publication 
""
it consisted of three books  written in latin  in which 
newton developed a full dynamical theory  encapsulated in his three laws
of motion 
""
the third law is the most original  of his three laws  and
appears for the first time in the principia 
""
newton  generalised the experience of  direct collisions of
bodies like  billiard balls acting mutually on one another  to the case
 of four types of forces  including attraction 
""
the third law  is not however applicable to every case 
""
nowadays we believe  that all signals or forces have a finite
velocity of propagation 
""
it is therefore not applicable to them  because  it talks
about  forces of action and reaction being equal  as measured at the
same time 
""
we therefore don't expect it to be very good  say in the case of
atomic category 
""
it is however perfectly applicable  to the collisions of
billiard balls  cars and so on 
""
as i have said earlier   newton's  derivation of 
kepler's  empirical laws  held only for an imagined system  a
hypothetical point particle moving around the centre of force  in a
perfect vacuum 
""
a physically impressed force  must be directed towards a real
physical body 
""
so newton next introduced a second body in place of the
mathematical centre of force  to simulate the sun  and a single planet
""
""
and he assumed  that they were both spherical in shape  and
attracted each other with equal and opposite forces 
""
after much effort lasting over a number of years  newton
obtained the remarkable mathematical result  that a gravitational
attraction  of a homogeneous spherical body or shell  on a mass point
outside it  was the same as though its whole mass  was concentrated at
its centre  provided  gravity fell off at the square of the distance
""
""
this justified his earlier treatment of the sun and the planets as
 point like objects 
""
he next showed that in such a system  each body would move in an
orbit around the common centre of mass 
""
if one of the bodies were much more massive than the other  as
is the case with the sun and most of the planets  the centre of mass would
practically coincide  with the more massive body 
""
since nearly the entire mass of the solar system was concentrated
in the sun  the planet would really move around the sun  which would
remain practically stationary 
""
a dynamical justification of the copernican system  that galileo
was unable to provide 
""
the final feature was the introduction of other mutually
interacting bodies to produce a system like the sun  and all its planets
""
""
here  his third law about the equality of action and reaction
played a crucial role 
""
the discovery of this new important principle  almost
inevitably led to universal gravitation 
""
newton systematically showed  that the same force of gravity
that acted between the earth and the moon  also acted between  jupiter
and its satellites  between the sun  and all the planets  and
between every pair of planets  and that every action was mutual  by the
third law of motion 
""
he was thus led to the concept of  universal gravitation  a
force  that acts mutually between any two samples of matter  anywhere
in the universe 
""
newton applied his powerful theory to show  that the tides on
the high seas were caused by the gravitational pull  of the moon and the
sun 
""
he argued  that the gravitational force exerted by the moon 
on the ocean waters on the moonlit side of the earth  was stronger 
than the pull on the moonless side  because gravity decreases the distance
""
""
as a result of this  the ocean waters assume an elixoidal shape
 with two bulges  one on the moonlit side and the other on the opposite
side 
""
the sun has a similar effect on the oceans  but being much
farther away its effect is weaker than the  moon's  
""
also the solar and lunar tides  do not always coincide 
""
the sun and the moon  act in the same direction whenever the
moon is either new or full  and then we have exceptionally high tides 
""
at other times  the total effect is much diminished 
""
with the powerful tool of calculus at his command to give shape to
his daring imagination  newton  demonstrated convincingly that 
gravity held sway  over the entire solar system 
""
in one sweeping stroke  he unified celestial and terrestrial
motion under a single concept 
""
the great irish philosopher  george bernard shaw once made 
the following  mischievous remark  about newton   copernicus
proved  that ptolemy was wrong  kepler proved  that copernicus was
wrong  galileo proved  that aristotle was wrong  but at that point
 the sequence broke down  because  science then came up for the
first time against that incalculable natural phenomenon  and englishman
""
""
to explain why all the lines in his rectilinear universe were bent
 he invented a force called gravitation  and thus erected a complete
 british universe and established it as a religion  which was devoutly
believed in for three hundred years  
""
that was  george bernard shaw 
""
but the famous english poet  alexander pope  wrote 
 nature  and  nature's  laws lay hidden in night  god
said  let newton be  and all was light
