no sir no business no no business my sole profession is teaching   teaching   no nothing sir   yourself sir ? i do not have any business now sir  once i had but after becoming a teacher you know i wanted to dedicate my life ah yes yes to the teaching profession i see  formally i was a businessman  uh then i didn't have peace of mind  of course i could earn a lot lot but after becoming a teacher you know i have the  happiness rather i have the pleasure   you have moreover  if we have some other business means we cannot do  full justice to this profession   to profession yes certainly  the every teacher should be like that uh but uh most probably nowadays all the teachers i can say sir are engaged in some or the other in any business even college uh professors you know college professors most of the college professors  are engaged in business and uh especially in government colleges  yeah yeah one or two words  yes in government colleges earn a lot uhm and i know one professor uh in selam who was our professor also  he is the owner of a mosaic factory oh mosaic factory and he is uh earning a lot   one or two words  yes certainly and uh frequently he goes to rajasthan  to buy the marbles ahn  and then he comes back to selam ahn but actually i doubt uh whether he will be rather  concentrating on his profession profession true certainly he can't  laughter   true  because  as a businessman ten days or fifteen days he takes to go and come back  and uh where will be the time for him to prepare for the students students very difficult   students  and uh do you have any of your staff like that sir ? yes sir in your college yes uh they are uh looking after that business uhn but uh in our college they can't uh have their involvement in business only business uh we are having a strict vigilance oh whether they are uh teaching properly oh  when they are completing the syllabus ah  are they going according to the syllabus uhn  and uh really the we are testing the feedback of the students  oh   oh   ah   uhn  oh  if the students give uh gives any complaint   uhm or if they place a letter in the suggestion box about the  performance of the professors in the one or two words   uhn   oh you are having a separate suggestion box  we are taking severe action   action against the we are having separate suggestion box which is operated by the correspondent of our college ah ha  not even principal ha  and he will take action on this letters   that means all these letters uh dropped in the box goes to the corresponding yes correspondence secretary ha ha she will look into the matter  he  ah he uhm he will be looking into the matter i see  and uh he will take uh stern and uh sturdious action   action uh for the  action  so job security may not be expected there no uh no it's not like that they were they will be having proper enquiry  enquiry ha both the side  i see ha ha  initially they will give warning uhm such and such comments are coming uhm you have to be careful  right  warning is there  uhm   uhm   right  there  thank god for us uh i think sir laughter in uh  higher secondary school we do not have such uh such a problem  such uh  problem  because it's a private college  and it's a developing institution they want to earn a status in that district  so they are trying for that  and in tamil nadu sir why should not we introduce uh junior college system sir   what's your opinion about that ? yes well but uh what higher secondary it means it itself means junior college yes of course but uh our uh education minister is not for that it seems uh not means that he wants to call pg teachers as pg teachers only teachers only uhm uh he doesn't like to give the designation designation atleast lecturer  uhm   designation  lecturer or uh like that laughter  do you find any difference between pg one word and lecturer ? no no we don't find them uh  supposing if it is a junior college you know uh we can have that designation  but uh  working in  if it is a school  working in a school we can't get that uh   a few words  we can't get that uh yeah attractive you mean status  abstract designation  that's all what can we say but our work is the same yea
