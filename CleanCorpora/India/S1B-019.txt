""
""
okay please be seated 
""
kindly sit down 
""
 haan  i know
""
i know 
""
dipti  will you be sitting here ?
""
""
not i
""
""
okay  now you take this seat 
""
that is not better
""
that is not good
""
better you have your seat here 
""
no i will not sit 
""
close the door   one or two words 
""
shakil don't play with handkerchief 
""
okay what i intend to do today yesterday whatever i have taught you
regarding magnet  that we will begin today once again 
""
instead of giving class work to you today i will repeat the same
 thing 
""
okay let us start with  magnetism
""
what is magnetism  ?
""
ravi  ?
""
what is magnetism  ?
""
""
magnetism is uh  magnets attract
""
""
magnet attracts  attracting pieces of iron is called
magnetism
""
ajay  ?
""
""
so the magnet is called as  a substance which attracts uh
which has the quality of attracting other substances to it 
""
""
other substances  do you mean non-magnetic also  ?
""
""
iron is  one or two words 
""
""
who attracts iron  nickel cobalt  ?
""
""
magnet 
""
""
magnet
""
so this  force of attraction of magnet towards  magnetic
substances is called  magnetism or magnetic  force 
""
so we begin with magnetism 
""
what are the properties of  a magnet  ?
""
avinash  ?
""
properties of a magnet 
""
yes avinash i am talking to you 
""
uhm  don't raise your hands  uhm ?
""
""
magnet attracts iron
""
""
magnet always attracts iron and also magnetic substance is
called  load-stone  nickel  cobalt and some varieties of steel 
""
what is the second property vikas ?
""
""
a freely suspended magnet always comes to rest pointing north
direction
""
""
what is a freely suspended magnet ?
""
subhash  subhash  ?
""
  what   what   do you mean by freely
suspended  ?
""
mahesh  ?
""
""
the magnet is tied to a  string and is left to suspend
""
""
we will have to take a stand  tie it with a thread and 
hang it  and just move it 
""
it will go on moving go on rotating for some time and after that
 it will come to rest that is  always the same direction called north
and south 
""
now this north pole of the magnet is actually the south pole of the
 earth
""
the south pole of the magnet is actually the north pole of the
earth
""
can you tell me why ?
""
ranjana  ?
""
  why   why   are they different ?
""
""
because  unbalanced pole of the suspended and right pole of
the 
""
""
but we have only one magnet here 
""
we are talking about one magnet 
""
uhm  harish  ?
""
 i'm  telling south pole of the earth is attracting 
north pole of the magnet that is the geographical south is attracting 
magnetic north pole 
""
and am i talking about two magnets or one magnet ?
""
""
one magnet 
""
""
yes divya ?
""
""
you are talking about one magnet
""
""
only one magnet jayanti ?
""
""
you are talking about two magnets
""
""
which is the other magnet  ?
""
""
earth is the other magnet
""
""
yes our earth is the  collection of magnetic substance 
""
our earth also behaves like a  magnet
""
therefore  what is actually real north pole is the  earth's
  south pole and what is actually 
""
i am sorry
""
what is actually the north pole of the earth that is the magnetic
south pole  and what is in reality the north pole of the earth that is the
south pole of the magnet 
""
okay let us go to the third property of magnet
""
kavya  ?
""
third property of a magnet 
""
any property that you know 
""
roopa  ?
""
""
like poles repel each other
""
""
like poles repel each other  and unlike poles attract each
other
""
naveen what do you mean by like poles  ?
""
please be seated 
""
what do you mean by like poles  ?
""
what is a pole  ?
""
sachin  ?
""
what is a pole ?
""
""
end of a magnet  which attracts  more  more power
than 
""
""
miss miss the end of the magnet is uh  attracts the maximum
 it has maximum uh
""
""
power of attraction  that is called    a pole 
""
""
""
 a pole  
""
""
rather you can say that pole is a place of maximum attraction
""
don't say end 
""
the place in a magnet which has maximum power of attraction that is
called a pole 
""
how many poles are there shruti  ?
""
""
there are two poles
""
""
two poles are there
""
mohit what are they  ?
""
""
north pole and south pole
""
""
north pole and south pole 
""
so there are two poles in a magnet
""
but when we bring two magnets together  how do they behave ?
""
tripti  ?
""
when we bring two magnets together  how do they behave  ?
""
they attract each other 
""
how  ?
""
how do they attract each other  shilpa  ?
""
""
they  a few words 
""
""
okay  anybody else  ?
""
yes  ?
""
girish  ?
""
girish you try 
""
how do two magnets behave when we bring them together  ?
""
divya  ?
""
uhm
""
""
likely poles repel and
""
""
yes when we bring them together we will always find that
north and north will repel  and south of one magnet will attract the north
pole of the other 
""
so this is how they behave on coming together 
""
then next property of a magnet 
""
yes ajay ?
""
""
the magnet is having maximum attraction at its poles
""
""
the magnetic attraction is greatest at its two poles  and
is lesser in the middle 
""
have you ever heard about magnetic field  ?
""
""
yes  ma'am 
""
""
 what's  just like  ordinary playground or a field
""
have you heard of magnetic field  ?
""
mahesh what is that ?
""
""
earth is a magnet
""
""
earth is a magnet 
""
so whole earth is a field  ?
""
""
no 
""
""
field of magnet  ?
""
anybody else  ?
""
why don't you try  ?
""
uhm 
""
please sit down 
""
""
because the earth behaves like a magnet
""
""
because the earth behaves like a magnet
""
ranjana  ?
""
""
the two ends of a magnet when uh rest against and when the
object enters the magnetic field it gets attracted to  that
""
""
it gets attracted to that 
""
so we can define magnetic field is that region upto which a magnet
can affect  or can exert its power of attraction on the object 
""
and that field is again limited one
""
it can't  extend to  a very long distance
""
that area upto which a magnet can exert its attraction  towards
the magnetic substance  that is called magnetic field 
""
a smaller magnet has a small magnetic field  a huge magnet will
have a bigger magnetic field 
""
similarly earth also has a magnetic field 
""
next property of magnet which we have not discussed so far  ?
""
yes sanjeevani  ?
""
any other property  ?
""
deepti  ?
""
""
magnet is called a loadstone
""
""
loadstone is  magnetic substance 
""
and magnets are basically made up of  loadstone only 
""
that is not the property 
""
yes asha  ?
""
""
in the  one or two words  in a magnet
""
""
yes why a bar of iron and a bar magnet they behave in a
different manner  ?
""
why an iron bar is unable to attract another piece of iron  ?
""
if we just see the internal structure of a magnet  that is a
bar magnet and a bar of iron we do find  there is a difference
""
why there is a difference  ?
""
because of molecules 
""
the arrangement of molecules in a bar magnet and a bar of iron
they are totally different 
""
in case of    ir  bar  ir    bar of
iron   what do you find  ?
""
what change do you find in bar of iron and bar magnet  ?
""
""
 a few words 
""
""
arrange in what  ?
""
arrange in what fashion  ?
""
""
 a few words 
""
""
uh  that boy  pratap  ?
""
pratap is not there  ?
""
yes avinash you try 
""
please sit down 
""
what about the pattern of arrangement of molecules in both the
things ?
""
""
in iron the molecules are not arranged uh  in proper
manner  uh in magnet  it's   it is   arranged  
arranged   in proper manner
""
""
what do you mean by that proper manner ?
""
""
 that's  north uh  north uh  north  north of
""
""
""
santosh don't play with it 
""
okay let us try to analyse 
""
in case of bar of iron  the molecules are arranged in a 
any manner they like  that is hap-hazard arrangement  or zig-zag
arrangement 
""
but in case of bar magnet  the same molecules are arranged in a
line  in a line or in a row and that too with all their north poles
facing one side  and south poles facing  the other side
""
therefore we find maximum attraction  on one side of the
magnet due to all north facing domains are on one side  all south facing
domains are on the other side 
""
now what are these domains ?
""
these domains are nothing but  the other name for the molecules
""
""
why a magnet gains the property of attraction ?
""
this is because of a specific arrangement of  its domains or
molecules  in a particular fashion
""
they are all arranged in a row that attributes or that gives the
property  of attraction to a magnet whereas a bar of iron lacks it 
""
now if by some force or some artificial means if we can arrange
those molecules  can a bar of iron be changed into a magnet  ?
""
mohit  ?
""
can we change a bar of iron into a magnet by  making the
molecular arrangement  ?
""
""
by making it same
""
""
same  how  ?
""
how can we do so  ?
""
""
by rubbing  by rubbing 
""
""
by rubbing 
""
how this rubbing should be done  ?
""
santosh you can try  ?
""
santosh  how can we rub a magnet  ?
""
a bar of iron with a magnet and get  get an another magnet  ?
""
""
rub straight
""
""
what do you mean by  straight   ?
""
triveni  ?
""
""
we should rub in the same direction
""
""
no we should begin with one pole and start rubbing the magnet
 and then again lift it  and again bring the same pole  again start
rubbing it and lifting  so by repeated  rubbing and lifting the magnet
 we can also convert a piece of blade  or a bar of iron into a 
magnet 
""
what do you call this kind of magnet ?
""
a permanent magnet or a temporary magnet  ?
""
please be seated 
""
what do you call this kind of magnet you have made by rubbing  ?
""
prabhakar  ?
""
yes hemant you try ?
""
""
temporary
""
""
we call it a temporary magnet 
""
abhay what do you mean by temporary magnet  ?
""
""
a temporary magnet is a magnet  which  uh loses its
property after sometime  but the moment uh
""
""
gradually lose their arrangement power or they  are 
get again the same  zig-zag they get arranged in the zig-zag manner and
they lose it 
""
what are permanent magnets  ?
""
what are permanent magnets  sachin  ?
""
""
they do not lose 
""
""
they do not lose
""
they also lose their   property but after  a very very
long period of time
""
yes harish ?
""
""
  a few words   
""
""
permanent magnets are magnets which  lose the  the
power after many years and uh like they 
""
""
okay  permanent magnets  are those which lose their
power after a long period of time 
""
have you heard about electro-magnets ?
""
""
yes
""
""
yes
""
""
what are electro-magnets  ?
""
how can we make electro-magnets  ?
""
jayanthi  ?
""
""
electro-magnet is passed through electricity 
""
""
yes if we take any metallic wire and  some how pass
electricity through it  by coiling around an electric wire  all over
it  we find that same  ordinary piece of metal  gains the property
of  attraction  and it starts attracting pieces of iron
""
that is  when we pass electric current through a piece of the
metal  it becomes a magnet and such magnets are referred to as 
electro-magnets
""
yes harish ?
""
""
generally  we make electro-magnets with the instrument of
iron
""
""
generally we make electro-magnets with the help of iron 
by coiling copper wire on iron
""
""
formulate the electro or uh the 
""
""
that is if we wrap  alumin  wire on aluminium yes that
can also be converted into electro-magnet 
""
can you just yes ranjana  ?
""
""
electro magnet is one which  a few words 
""
""
yes you are  you are right but this  this kind of
electro-magnet we can convert big big pieces into magnet  for our 
quick purpose 
""
but in case of rubbing you have to have  very big magnet and
again  rubbing will take a very very long time  and it  it is
possible only with the help of small piece of blade or a safety pin or a 
small object 
""
but when we want to make big magnet  electro-magnets are used
 in many other places
""
so that is the best method  though it is again a temporary
""
the moment we switch off electric current  again the same
piece of iron  becomes an ordinary thing 
""
no more a magnet
""
""
miss can we make uh  other metal from the  one or two
words 
""
""
no no we can't 
""
only iron we can rub and convert it into temporary magnet 
""
now what are the uses of magnet  ?
""
what are the uses of magnet in our daily or day-to-day life  ?
""
vikas  ?
""
""
magnets are used in the boxes and uh  electric current
""
""
in pencil boxes for what purpose ?
""
""
for 
""
""
yes for closing the box 
""
we need not put much of effort just leave it  because of the
attraction it get tightly  closed
""
yes divya  ?
""
""
in door
""
""
in 
""
""
door
""
""
door
""
they are also used as door closers automatic door closers
""
you leave the door  because of attraction  yes  because
of attraction  the door gets closed
""
in  refrigerator also you leave it  it gets  stuck to it
because of the magnetic force 
""
ravi  ?
""
""
in the dia diaphragm
""
""
diaphragm of a speaker and in  motors 
""
next santosh  ?
""
""
 a few words 
""
""
speak loudly 
""
it is used by navigators in order to know  the direction and
for that matter they use  a special type of magnet  magnetic needle or
magnetised needle  that is fitted in a  watch like thing we call it a
compass 
""
with the help of this compass needle they can come to know the
direction in which they are  moving
""
so they help the navigators to know  the direction in which
they are sailing or moving 
""
ranjana  ?
""
""
in iron factories
""
""
yes in iron factories where lot of scrape iron is produced
due to  cutting or due to  sawing of the bars 
""
that scrape iron can again be melt  melted and re-used
therefore  to pick up that scrape iron from the land or from the soil or
from the broken pieces  we make use of  cranes fitted with the magnet
which can  go on collecting this scrape iron 
""
mahesh  ?
""
girish ?
""
""
magnet is used in referigerator
""
""
they are used in refrigerators i have told
""
kavya  ?
""
""
in generators
""
""
in generators for what  ?
""
""
miss miss 
""
""
let her answer
""
yes  for generating what  ?
""
electricity 
""
have you read it somewhere  that magnets are used  in
generating electricity 
""
yes kavya  ?
""
have you read it somewhere  ?
""
i don't think anywhere we are using magnets to generate
electricity 
""
ravi ?
""
what do you say  ?
""
""
 a few words 
""
""
where  ?
""
""
in generator 
""
""
that is where  ?
""
""
in the middle of copper wire 
""
""
that day also he has told us  that in the middle of the
copper wire we put a  magnet
""
then  ?
""
""
 a few words 
""
""
by the copper wire and thats how it is transmitted 
""
so we are generating electricity but we are unable to  tell
where and how  ?
""
you must know  where and how it is being generated
