i think some of you who have seen the last programme would be ready with your sticks  so let's get started  as you remember last time you saw how the stick was held  and also saw a few basic steps and a few basic strokes with the stick  now those of you who are familiar with the word  kaata or familiar with judo or karate would know what the word kaata means  but for those of you who do not know the word kaata  kaata is a fixed prearranged form of excercise done in  many marshal arts  it is either done solo or performed with a partner  these exercises are repeated till all the movements become smooth easy and spontaneous now in stick fighting also we have got these fixed  or prearranged type of exercises  but because of the different styles involved and the different names at the moment for the sake of convenience  let's call them kaatas  last time you saw kanduraburakailugaru doing some basic steps now let's take a look at him doing a few  kaatas  here in this kaata only two strokes or hit  or i should say hit are being practised the right and the left but in different directions  note that only these two basic strokes are used but in all the four directions of the one word  incidently guruburakailu is one of those few masters  who travel from village to village rarely staying more than a few months at one place  a few students pay him a small sum for his services but  mostly rice or wheat is the only payment he gets for teaching them  there he is finishing off the kaata  that is the traditional salami or salutation now in this kaata he start   starts the same way as before but uh this time with the stroke on the head  two more strokes start from down two more parallel to the ground and a stroke towards the back then he turns  he does the same thing over again towards this side also now he is finishing the fourth side and here he comes forward for the fifth time there he turns and goes back and finishes the exercise with uh traditional salutation or  salami  but before the salami he is doing the  basic strokes again  the salami usually is done before and after  each exercise in all the traditional art  now this time he add a double stroke to the head and then does the same strokes which you saw in the last exercise  but he adds one more stroke from down which was a powerful stroke then he turns  here this is the powerful stroke which starts from down and ends up  note how graceful and smooth the movements are  the synchronization of the movements the hormony between the hands and the feet  for this reason new movements are gradually introduced in each new exercise till all the movements become effortless and spontaneous  well though there are more than twenty such exercises in the udaygiri style we'll take a look at only one more  well in this final kaata all the movements will be done in a circular way but before the movement starts a poke or a thrust repeats the movement  watch he finished the circular strokes and now the thrust or the poke starts with the throat as the target  there it is the thrust and the circular movements  note that the stick never seems to stop  it keeps on moving  this is in defence as well as in offence  the stick always covers the body  and that's it that's the salami  or the salutation  these are some basic exercises  after learning these the students learns how to hit  that means he learns the blows and the hits  now here the need or the necessity of a partner is important  this is also done in a fixed prearranged form  the reason is that if it is not fixed and prearranged the  chances of injury are more  but gradually as the skill of the person increases  then he could indulge in free fightings  loosening up or warming up guruburakailu moves forward  to take the salami  this is his student ramalingaraju  there they have done the salami and now they move back  now he comes forward for the basic hits which are usually done before the start of each kaata  and now the exercise starts which has got nine hits  this time they do fifteen hits in this kaata   first the basic blows that's the deceptic  blow to the ankle  one two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven  twelve thirteen fourteen and fifteen  now in this exercise other than the nine basic hits  there are twelve more hits which are added to this making a total of twenty-one strokes or blows sound of sticks  and they finish it off  now comparatively this set is more difficult than the previous one though there are only four blows involved  the basic hit and the exercise starts one two  three four  timing is very important in this  ah that was the reverse stroke  again  this exercise is also the same practically the same as before but uh instead of the first hit the first blow or the stroke is the thrust at the throat  and the same basic fourth blow  rhythm and timing is very important here  there the rhythm has been changed to a double blow  from down  now this kaata is similar to the last  two you saw but here there are ten hits rather than four blows which you saw  they have named it the jhapak  timing and a keen eye is very important here  well we can go on and on for there are many such exercises but let's not do that  uh we've to take a look at only one more  that's from the udaygiricheda school  here they are finishing this and now we'll move on to the last exercise  here nothing is prearranged or planned or fixed  this is something like free fighting sparring and the hits are spontaneous  now this type of practise or fighting is done when the student has already learnt the stick forms  this is helpful in the actual use of a stick that is  when a competitor fights  though competitions are very rare now- a-days and they are only held in some villages and not in the cities  uh in competition the stick is sometimes coloured so that if the stick touches it could show where it was touched  ah that was the close one  but the master is directing the students movement  though there is a lot more to stick fighting than what you just saw these are a few kaatas from the udaygiricheda school or the udaygiri style of stick fighting  now to some it may seem paradoxical but in many fighting arts of the east medicine and healing play a very important role  many masters are vaidya hakims or bone setters one such master was the late shafi ustad  the tradition is being carried out by his student khalifa gulam rasool  mending broken bones is his profession  he has learnt the secrets of herbs oil and healing lotions from his late master  and now he makes his own medicines  gulam rasool is a very busy man with a very tight schedule right from dawn to late in the night he is at his clinic where he looks after his patients  though sometimes when he is not very busy he teaches  stick fighting also  no matter what ones faith is devotion and prayer play an important part in ones training  here khalifa gulam rasool gets ready for an exercise   that's the salami and he starts with both the sticks rotating  this exercise is known as chaadar or a bedsheet  it is appropriately named because uh sticks are covering the body like a bedsheet would  both the sticks are moving at the same time  this is used to keep people away from you  and the that's the finish of the exercise with the  traditional salami  gulam rasool's son gulam moiuddin is on the left  and karim is on the right  they are doing salami  and now the work starts  this is the simple exercise with just four hits  there they finish off  now here is something interesting  other than blows and thrust which you saw in the udaygiri style here the lathi or the stick is also used  to lock the joints and immobolize the opponent without actually hitting him  these are known as bandish or  let's call them locks  here the elbow has been locked  abdul samadh his student and the elbow and the shoulder is locked here  the wrist also seems to be locked  that is a good one the elbow has been locked   that's sure it's painful the neck has been locked  now there are two sticks being used  well one arm the other arm has also been locked  both the arms are captured  well that's the strangle or a choke on the throat with the elbow also locked  you have seen two different styles or types of stick fightings  now i would like to show you a few basics which could be learnt easily by you and put to good use if the situation demands but let me tell you something  do not misuse the sticks give it the respect it deserves but uh before we start let's take a look at what we did last time  in various styles there are various hits and blows but basically there are just seven hits with the stick  i'll do them slowly  from your basic stance lift your hands up and get your hands down again  this is the first basic hit on the head  it comes straight down  the second hit is sloping from up to down  the third again from up to down slanting  fourth is parallel to the ground fifth is also parallel to the ground sixth comes from down to up and seventh is also  from down to up  and of course there are point of the stick is also used to thrust or poke  what you saw were the seven basic strokes  now i'll show you a simple basic exercise  now usually in stick fighting when the stick is brought over head or from the side the leg also moves with the stick that is what i am trying to say is that if the stick comes from your right side the leg also moves forward or if it comes from the left side then the left leg moves forward  now this is not a very hard and fast rule  it is flexible  sometimes even when the stroke is coming from the other side the step may not be taken that is the right leg is in front but the left stroke comes  let us not think of this at the moment  at the moment when we get the stick out we will  step forward  so from here from your basic start or your basic stance  lift your hands up over your head  now in this movement you have blocked the opponents stick  or you have blocked a blow to your head and protected yourself  from here take a step forward hit  take one more step forward hit  now what happens you can rotate to the left side or the right side or the back  now i'll move to the left watch  again i'll go towards my back  what i have done is that i have taken a complete circle  now this circle could be towards your left side or towards your right side depending on the situation   i'll do it again slowly watch  well that speed also is possible but to start with  we'll do it slowly  now what you have just seen is just a fraction of what  stick fighting is all about  if you are really interested then it's better that you find someone who knows stick fighting and who can teach you  here i remember the saying of the late swami shivananda who says an ounce of practice is worth  several tons of theory goodbye
