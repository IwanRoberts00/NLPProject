 prof sarin  then now the discussion that we are having really become  ritually a few words  in the other house already the budget has got through  that is the ruling party has won  won means inspite of their minority with their contrast majority only because the total of the opposition was unable to found hard on that contrast majority to break it through  i just have known that one or two words be long to come but let us take the fact as they are kept at the moment  it is because they are still there  we have discussed their budget  it is their budget  it is not the budget of the country  it is the budget of the congress party  but the very truly i feel with that party is this  party's culture spins us around personality cult  only one speaker whether i i can agree with him or not  talks on the one or two words but all others have  finished their speech with one or two words and through the prime minister and finance minister in the bracket  in that one or two words with that of one or two words  during the entire speech and i think what is more revealing in this house such self-analysis that introspectable vioable that in this country for the last forty years we have been groping in the dark through a known path  and now a doctor has appeared with a magic lantern  with the blessings of the prime minister who hails from the region of tirupathy or one or two words at least in that stage today he is a one or two words self one or two words  this is certain thing that party is supposed to stand before  for which that they one or two words and from which they draw sustenance  from the name of gandhiji from the name of nehru from the name of sardar patel and all other freedom fighters  the rajiv gandhi of of whom they will now talk so much  so within these forty years forty or as in free  this ninety-one period  so all at one or two words i don't know what will happen at amethi  that is their internal affair  but is such bretheren is the idealogical foundation of the ruling party of the great country   that's a woe unto the total population of the country it is nice to break one or two words almost by the dual one or two words it has no right  and now by inheriting that if demolishing it even on which  on the foundation on which they stand  then the question is mr vice chairman what for we should be thankful to the new mens era  either dr manmohan singh or p v narasimha rao if the budget that has been presented what is that what that ensure  that ensures that our foriegn exchange which we didn't afford i m f loan or world bank loan or a g b loan or net loan through other syndicates  in the history of the world perhaps such shameless  acknowledgement of the building up of foriegn reserves and things like that and showing it to be a strength of the economy what do we found  ? that these and of late our finance minister went  in the one pack jumborie in order to ensure three hundred   crores of dollor one or two words for what  one or two words our all one or two words  and what else could he do ? he went a few words policy only involved that you know  under the pressure of u s a one or two words  under the threat of this super three hundred one regarding which some  a few words takes place now and then  in order to one or two words the duncan proposal  in order to steal ourselves for that one or two words  where duncan proposals will be finalised  what you mean then ? our import duties had been reduced one or two words  and services have been reduced or totally done away with in order to make import from advanced countries to developed countries  to capture our market to victimise of our indigenous industry  therefore from whatever point of view it may be looked into  it enlarge unqualified proposition and unequivocal condemnation i shall oppose oppose this budget tooth and nail  v narayanswamy  yes madam please  one or two words honourable finance minister  a few words but he was not using while referring to the present day birth situation on the economic scenario made very clear and categorical assertion in his majesty which i like to put only two or three sentences to  enlight your enlighten the honourable members who are on the other side  a few words  madam he says the a few words very rapidly  becoming more integrated at northern place and also more complicated other developing countries are successfully transforming themselves  to meet these challenges  we cannot afford afford to stay out of this problem which appear to be awkward  this a few words  therefore madam the finance minister was very clear in his mind that with the with the birth the economic situation is changing  changing changing rapidly  liberation is taking place even in the communist country  and not only that they one or two words should become competitive in the field of production of various items including the infrastructure industry consumer industry and india should be in a position to export to other countries various items in the international field india also should become competent and also competitive to get not the foriegn exchange to balance our economic situation  therefore madam several liberal liberal measures for  to sort out on one or two words and which has been taken by the present government for the last two years  but that is the the the new schemes and steps that has been taken by the government for the purpose of recouping the economy  that was established in the year nineteen ninety-one beginning  started yielding good results   ma madam the balance of payments position which was left at two thousand crores   by the previous government now it has come up to the level of  eighty-eight thousand eight hundred to eight hundred twenty-eight  crores  on borrowed money  no it is not borrowed money the borrowed money goes to investment which which one has to accept  madam it is also a fact that the the our our limit of five point nine million as our foriegn exchange reserve  we have not achieve one has i have to admit on that point and that aspect  therefore madam the government has taken various measures  for the purpose of improving the economy  and the finance minister who has taken a bold decision to bring reform in in the in the agriculture side  madam the thrust has been given for agriculture in the in the present budget by the finance minister  and the outlay for the one or two words agriculture  si side has been increased  considerably  the reason is that madam the agriculture is the poor sector  which is the vital for the purpose of development of any country especially our country india  madam then the government brought liberalisation as far as the  the bringing the industries in the rural areas the agro-based industries  the agriculture to be given all the emphasis and also support by the by the budget  therefore madam that the name new agriculture policy that has been proposed by the government is going to give a thrust to it  and the it will pay therefore lot of agro-based industries to come into this country in the rural areas for the purpose of creating  employment to the rural persons who are living in this country  madam the industrial recession was there in the last year  in this country  and not only the industrial recession in this country it has been throughout the world  the both the consumer items and also the infrastructure industries the production was less  even in the other country but the there is recession total recession and therefore the goods could not be marketed  anywhere in our country and also abroad  therefore madam some changes have been brought by this government for the purpose of investment and also especially in the infrastructure side so that to give boost to the infrastructure industry  madam in the banking sector which i would like to say only  a few lines  uh the it is a one word the nation  now several lakhs of rupees have been in the security scam  several banks have been involved  several the executives of the banks have been  one or two words and also some of the officers have been arrested and c b i is one or two words investigating into the matter and not only that our parliamentary committee is also  going into the security scam  madam though it was initially felt it is about five thousand  two hundred crores  madam this this security scam has only shaken the the banking system in this country  and that the banks have indiscriminately invested in the in that say scam one word without the approval of the government and also bring the one or two words and thereby the finance minister has to undertake ten thousand crores  for the purpose of the giving the manufacturing bank  madam the honourable the minister for banking is also sitting here  then who is affected today ? it is the farmer who is affected  it is the farm industrial products who are affected not the  one or two words not the stock brokers it is only the people who are genuinely working for the development of this country they are affected  and the loan are loans are not being given to them  even madam see when the previously when congress government there there was a scheme for the purpose of giving loan to the people loans one word scheme was there  and it was giving benefit to the small people agriculturist  and also schedule caste and schedule tribe people  and and also from labourers  today what is happening they are not in a position to go to the bank they are not able to enter into the bank today  the reason is that that the b j p government came here  they have completely closed the door  thereafter one or two words security scam after security scam the banking officials they are not allowing the agriculturists to enter into the bank  this is a very serious matter mr minister  the indira gandhi our honourable former prime minister has taken up  nationalisation of the bank is only for the purpose of giving benefit to the poor people downtrodden schedule caste and schedule tribe agriculture a few words agriculturists  and madam i feel there is a one or two words method in the banking division we don't one or two words  people there honestly repay the amount  it is the big industrialist who have siphoned out ten thousand  crores of rupees who have not paid that money  but it is only the agriculturists who are paying the money and those people a few words  and not only that for only capital small-scale industrialists who are who are suffering today the reason is that the banks banks have completely closed down they have not allowed the small scale industries also to come for the working capital  they say one or two words the security scam is being investigated they have not received any direction from the government  therefore they will not give you the loan  therefore madam the production in the small-scale sec  sector is going down  madam small scale sector is contributing twenty-two percent of the export in this conutry  it is not the big industry it is not the middle middle industry it is only small scale industry that is contributing for large export in this country that is going to be killed by the banking sector  because they are not providing loans to them  therefore the honourable minister venkatrajan minister who is sitting here i request him to deal with seriously call all the  bank banking officers give a direction to them  normal banking activity should start otherwise our production in this country will go down  and also the people who are in the agriculture sector they will be suffering  the another area there honourable finance minister has to concentrate is black money  more than eighty thousand crores of  rupees is in the form of black money interruption  madam that black money has to be brought down  which should be brought out which is now hidden  that is to be done various schemes have been brought then they bringing fund from madras the government will not ask the account now where was scheme that we brought ? what is the total amount if you have recovered if you have brought out of it ? it is not even more than seven percent out of eighty thousand crores not even seven percent of the money has come out  what is the scheme you have to bring the black money out ? so that the inflation will not be there and there will be a balance economy and and and the people and the budget which you have been presenting in the country is imperfect  madam the only madam the novel provision is for the small scale industry especially the people who are who'll  be having small industry have been given the benefit and it is a laudable measure that has been taken  and madam in our state though it is small state having more than only ten lakh population  in in our town limit alone we have more than four hundred small units which are manufacturing one word which are to be sold one rupee and even a common man goes and gets it and he is using it  and there are madam it's a big lobby is working in this country to curtail that industry for the simple reason that these giants and multinationals they are trying to see that these industries are closed  madam the the one word government has taken a decision low duty duty will be imposed on this item and the turnover has been increased to thirty lakhs  it is a right decision has been taken by the government on the representation given by those people  but madam the lobby that is working the multinational who who are in this country they are trying to kill those industry  and madam that is giving in a small place it is giving employment to more than ten thousand people  the the people who are involved in the production people who are involved in the marketing ten thousand people are getting the benefit not only that the people who are using it are a few words therefore madam this budget i feel that it is a growth oriented budget it is a common man's budget
