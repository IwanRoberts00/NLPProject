hello  hello lokesh how do you do well i'm fine how do you do  fine okay thank you  hello hello  hello you   i'm from tamil nad  i see and i am a post graduate teacher  trained teacher though i'm still uh unemployed  uh uhm what is the actual situation pg situation pg unemployed graduates are are really a lot of person pg graduates in the karnataka unemployed you mean uh unemployed yeah  ah yes of course that's a uh national problem in india you know growing unemployment  there are uh so many unemployed graduates  that is true of uh karnataka also  what do you say mr mohan yes i agree with him  uh but with a some difference you know  uh those who have done their ma in english uhm in india find jobs easily  haan  though the government uhm there is trying to uhm  sneeze they give less importance to teaching of english in  schools and colleges  yes  yes  so another major problem had you had we studied uh in my case i opted for science subjects  you'd have got easily the job  but uh any major self-employment project is uh launched here in your state  oh yes there are many self-employments schemes right like uh district industries corporation industries  there is uh one corporation called uh karnataka state financial corporation  industries  in the district industrial corporation which we call d i c  uh you can get a loan to a tune of thirty-five thousand and start any small scale industries home industries also yes that's right we too have the same organisation  we also have that thing but when we approach since uh it seems they they uh put lot of conditions yes that you fed up with those people and uh  yes   haan haan that is one of the  puts a lot of strain that's one of the reasons why these uh you know schemes have failed  puts a lot of strain  uh they there are so many legalities uh to perform and all kinds of official disturbances well that's true yes i i should say that the government should take steps to liberalise those things   there're so many things which you cannot say bring  all at a time  uhm uhm advancing loan uhm but you keep a track of how it is utilizing it you know  but lot of uh in fact on the government part also  sometimes it seems right because in our state more than thirty uh three hundred crore rupees have been uh given as loan and not a single money has been recovered from the uh  people who got it as loan loanees uhm they're not willing to when  when they get the money as loans they have the feeling   it's it's donation for them right with the result they do not allowance any further  uh programmes  you you mean to say that they do not utilize uh uh the funds yes the funds properly  properly uhm because it does not reach the man there're lot of brokers ha right there in interim period it uh the half of the amount goes supposing if they give loans for cattles doctors will get some amount or the man who recommends and above all there is a fixed limit for uh every village so two or three members will be getting right  those who have the influence uh and they'll have to  approach back-door way to the local uh ruling party uh members  uhm   ha right   right  right  hey even in our state people say it is same  but what i feel is as you said the funds are misused  yeah you know yeah you cannot put all the blame on one party  no i that is the receiver yeah yeah you know of course but uh i don't blame one party then the banks the institutions which have advanced loan  have to keep a proper track  right of for instance and see whether the loan is being utilised properly  for instance  properly uhm and there are considerations also uhm suppose as you said in the case of the cattle most of the indian cattle this they die uhm uhm as soon as they are bought laughter  you know uhm something should be done means the  the basic thing is that we should educate our people   uhm uhm  we should tell them why the government  we yes  not only that awareness is created among the people yes that's right awareness is an   as important and as you can see uh unemployed graduates have become or becoming rather are becoming terrorists anti-social elements etcetra etcetra why because of frustrations you know  they are frustrated disappointed  and proper awareness is not created among them naturally they go astray  right yeah my feeling is but to some extent the unemployed unemployment problem could be solved by this kind of uh projects though if uh it has proved to be a failure  right  a few words  what we have got to do is a kind of introspections  we should see uhm how how many people uhm have really been benefitted uhm why uhm the scheme has been a failure so after that say you can revamp your programmes  and there is every scope you know uh for say improvement in the  yeah scope  right   yeah  but the government does not but as far as i think the government should take  some hard steps towards those who misuse the funds  but you know there are too many uh people interfering in it yeah uhm and uh even our few politicians they simply  they announce uhn and they never keep up their words subsidies uh right yes you don't have to pay ten thousand rupees  loan you don't have to pay five thousand rupees  loan   and uh   just for the political game yeah yeah we become allured ha right that is the unemployed's plight yeah yeah and  and the government does not and once given that should become a tri  tradition that's what we think yes yes  and that has been happening yeah uh alright uh now what's your plan since you are an unemployed  every city two words but the thing is for the past years i i did not uh uh concentrate on uh making the best use of the modern techniques of agriculture uhm uhm the same traditional methods followed  and it proved proved to be futile attempt  every year some natural calamities and this and that it happens and uh you just you are surviving and we don't seem to  have gained any  well uh fortunately for you here is mr mohan he is an agriculturist a bsc agriculturist graduate you can take suggestions from him yes you are welcome i no no you can adopt i see the modern ways of agriculture uhm uhm  and if you want say financial help without any say  uh mediators and all uhn mr lokesh is here to guide you how you could get loan uhm he only will tell you uh the proper way to approach the bank  uhm  i i think we have uh degressed from our uh uh subject infact our subject was unemployment and i think this could be one of the solutions you know  if uh these graduate people who own lands can go back to their lands and right uh adopt new techniques  right  right and try to contribute uh to our country in terms of you know food food grains  well i think it'll help a lot and uh in fact it is a social service also right and uh so far people are under impression that white collar jobs are the only aims and ambitions in life   that's true  so shall we have a cup of tea  i think it's better  oh yes yes fine  one or two words  no not yet it's very hot that i see in fact when i was uh from my native i could notice the difference in climate when we are on the way  haan  more than uh two hundred miles across the salem  uhm i know i i was able to notice salem the difference  salem  is salem an industrial city i think i'm told yeah it's an industrial city  yeah  yeah  it's an industrial city  salem salem   industrial city  today i received a letter from my wife  she has written it's cloudy there in my place dharwar  but no rains at all  no rains in dharwar  yeah   dharwar   it's in karnataka you know karnataka yes is it on the border of uh tamil nad no no no oh exactly it is in the north of karnataka north of karnataka north karnataka uhm what is the adjacent it is known for its university its karnataka university dharwar ah perhaps you might have heard the name right  yeah i had   it's a place where there are two universities as lokesh mentioned karnataka university there is another university called  uh agricultural university agricultural university so if you uh want uh any information well you can just uhm come to dharwad and uh go with mohan to agricultural university and see oh yeah you are welcome since you are an agriculturist and since you are uh willing to or wishing to implement new techniques and all those things all right  okay okay okay  ha by the by we were talking of sight-seeing in mysore okay ha yes yes  well i have seen uh from all important places in mysore  because i'm not a stranger to this place you ask this uh gentleman from tamil nadu perhaps him  he has not seen any of the important places have you not seen yeah i visited this palace  i see that is in chamundi hills uhm but uh that uh ksr dam and uh  krs dam you should visit it you should visit it it was built by sir m vishveshariah vishveshariah  i see he got india's highest civilian award bharatratna   brindavana   bharatratna  i see  great engineer great son of india  but he

here from here three hundred and fifty kilometres fifty kilometres dharmasthala dharmasthala yes  and if you go to dharmasthala don't forget to visit lokesh  yes exactly  oh  that is your native place  one or two words  by the by i wanted to know about uh this politics in your state because uh your chief minister is very much in news  uhm she was a film actress formerly yeah yeah  isn't she so what do you feel about her administration in your state   yeah yeah  her administration one or two words she still enjoys the public uh support support but as as an administra administrator  i don't find she is really  she's losing her popularities no not yet still she enjoys it  haan  but in the course of time once uh i i i that could be  told only i see  during the course of time  uh as we read because there is no uh yeah equal an opponent to  oppose her  right there is no good opposition she has almost become a dictator  right no opponents  in fact she enjoys the popularity just because there is no opposition leader right who merits attention of the public exactly  oh exactly and what about karunanidhi the former chief minister  that is  yes yes he is not is he completely silenced now yeah at present but ah now he has gained slightly upper hand even though one word  and totally uh among the number of the voters concerned  he's still enjoying the sizeable uh support  support  ah   support
