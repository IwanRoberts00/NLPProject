in nineteen ninety-two  it's   four thirty-seven and

""

""
""
under fera itself since nineteen  in august nineteen

""
""
 no no don't want   that is enough
""
""
and also sir  the market exchange rate  sir  in 
in february  ninety-two  upto  february ninety-three  the
market exchange rate upto the date was  in february ninety-three it was
twenty-six point two zero sir 
""
in february ninety-two the  march ninety-two it was twenty-five
point eight nine sir actually  and also  the bombay  hawala
 market rate sir as we could  uh collect the information it was
 only thirty-four  thirty-four  rupees  in the 
february ninety-three sir 
""
just  it's   premium in percentage  it's  only
twelve percent sir
""
and  in march nineteen  ninety-three sir  the percentage
of premium in  hawala  rate it has come down to  ten point
seven 
""
in april  it has come down to ten point four  and against 
it's  a big rise slight rise in  eighth of april it is eleven point
four 
""
now on sixteenth april it is eleven point six sir
""
""
relevance
""
""
yes 
""
""
sir  if within  that the  actual market rate is now
eleven point some  eleven point six
""
""
no it is the percentage of premium market
""
""
it is the percentage  that's  the gap  that's 
there and  that's  the gap that attracts the    no no  the
the  black marketists to go to the  hawala  market instead
of going  coming to the open market 
""
""
 no no  
""
""
that is the speculative 
""
so  that's  why all these schemes of liberalisation whatever
you have  announced  that has no impact the impact is yes in the gold
field  that has that is some impact 
""
but actually the  hawala  market  as is being
reported  everyday in the newspaper that  hawala  market is
going on and going on in a full speed 
""
and the  the objectives  whatever you have announced during
this kind of liberalisation  and all this things has no meaning at all 
""
and number two sir  the fera act  of section eight and
section  section nine the custom officers have said  it contradicts
against the specifications  contradict the fera act itself
""
and that also gives the  handle  for  hawala 
market to operate 
""
may i know from the honourable minister that whether it has 
brought to his notice by the custom officials that this fera act section
eight and section nine  of the fera act  is being contradicted by the
notification of r b i for which the  hawala  market is a
negotiator
""
""
sir  i don't agree with the honourable member  the
 hawala  rate  is on the increase sir 
""
it has certainly come down  and with the government measures
even the  these administrative measures  it has kept smuggling  and
it has made smuggling under  one word  
""
and the second objective of these measures  to  prevent the
all transactions 
""
i don't say it is totally wiped out 
""
it is there 
""
but the government is making sincere efforts  to put an end to
such clandestine operation  interruption 
""
""
mr moghe
""
""
but about this sir fera act  sir  as we are aware sir
 the fera act  or the amendment we have recently  uh been introduced
very recently sir  and it would be very prematured to assess the impact on
 hawala  trade sir 
""
""
 a few words in hindi 
""
""
sir and the present  act under the fera  the persons
who are  involved in such transactions  they are detained under fera
 and a  two words  and even then
""
""
there  a few words 
""
""
yes there is a provision sir  yes yes
""
""
mr moghe please 
""
""
 a few words in hindi 
""
""
sir  as i have already pointed out   hawala
 case being a clandestine operation   it's  very difficult
to   amo  estimate the amount quantum of  hawala 
trade  and  it's  very difficult to  decide on the revenue
collections and other  uh monitory  item 
""
""
 shree  nirmal kanthji
""
""
 a few words in hindi 
""
""
he is entirely right  that it is a clandestine operation
from which uh  uh for the people will reap all the benefit 
""
uh the question is  that uh  you had  you had you had a
committee to estimate black income  which was entirely  clandestine
  interruption 
""
why don't you have another body to enquire legal estimate  of
how much transactions take place  in the  hawala market 
 number one 
""
number two  you have you say  that the    ra 
  rate   of return is ten per cent or eleven per cent on
these transactions 
""
imagine the rate  that is being given here  it is an
astronomical rate 
""
does it means  that the real value of the  rupee 
 is that  that much weak so that we can derive such a high rate of
returns 
""
and  a few words   there  we  will be no 
hawala  market 
""
if there is full convertibility which  the i m f is desiring of
dr manmohan singh 
""
just now it is convertability  on the trade account only 
""
you say it is a full flaw  and there we have no  hawala
 market at all 
""
is there any proposal in the mind of  dr manmohan singh  to
go into that so that at one stroke  the  hawala  case 
is completely eliminated 
""
and a whole structure in it  that these illegalities in the
foreign exchange trade  are taking place  not only to the unorganised
sector of  hawala  trade 
""
and you have indulge you have not  made any cbi enquiry  to
find out who were the people  who are connected  who are connected with
those who are arrested directly 
""
many important people in bombay and others  are involved 
""
but apart from that  your foreign exchange bank  foreign bank
 we are their hope so  and not to account 
""
through which as we have discovered it    mr nirmal
kanthji  it is not violating it is going out
""
""
 mr nirmal kanthji  
""
""
its becoming a long speech 
""
""
i am not giving a speech sir
""
""
yes it is becoming
""
""
hope to account then not to account also  to that also how
much money is going out
""
""
yes     cons    constitution  
of the country  to access the  uh  hawala  trade 
 it's  a suggestion  and at present  the government has no set
proposal sir 
""
and  regarding the  as i already said  the government
is making very sincere efforts  putting down such  transaction  by
making some  administrative by taking some administrative measures 
""
and  strictly enforcing  all existing clause  fera
forty-four a  tada and other  uh like uh under the    
 co conva     covered   under the  uh
transaction sir 
""
and  as i have already pointed out sir 
""
""
but it is a little too much 
""
""
he has pointed out  interruption  how many percent
 we have  taken action in bombay 
""
we have taken in action on several persons in bombay  madras
bangalore  and even in delhi  who have violated this  and hyderabad
 and  and even  who have violated  operated most of accounts
also sir 
""
and this  hawala  transaction as i pointed out
earlier sir  was mainly operated through earlier  and gold smuggling
number two is silver smuggling  and third is underinviting and
overinviting sir 
""
as the government has taken very serious view of situation
""
we are making very sincere  efforts to put down this
""
""
 ama  how many cases you have    one
or two words  
""
""
 you will get   the find out this
""
i have already said
