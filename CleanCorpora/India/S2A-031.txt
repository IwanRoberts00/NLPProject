professor kamath  professor dixit  professor joshi 
other members of the  vidyaprasarak  mandali   members
of the staff  of both the kannada and the english high school  my
dear students  ladies and gentlemen 
""
i feel it an honour  to have been invited  to deliver the
first  dr maker endowment lecture 
""
i should like to take this opportunity  to compliment 
professor kamat and his colleagues  on the management of this institution
 to have thought of an activity  in which the community around this
school  can participate 
""
one of the weaknesses  of educational institutions in our
society  has been their failure  to forge active links  with the
community outside  we have talked about  many ideas  linking the
school  with the society 
""
we have talked of school school complex  we have talked of
school college complex  we have also talked of school community complex
 but very little has been done 
""
although a great deal can be done  even within the limited
resources  of the schools and colleges 
""
we have not been able to accomplish much  in this very important
 task  of forging creative link  with the community outside 
""
the activities in the school  and in colleges  are meant for
the children and the teachers of those institutions 
""
but there are very few if any  activities  in which the
public can participate  and feel one  with the school  or with the
college 
""
this failure  has  affected the ability of the educational
institutions  to draw vital sustainance  financial and otherwise 
from the community  which is in a position to help the institution  in
diverse ways 
""
i am happy therefore to note  that the society approached 
and received positive response from dr maker  in whose name  this
lecture series  is instituted 
""
it is an honour for me  to be the first  speaker  and i
hope that for many many years to come  the experts on various subjects
 connected with education and society  because that professor kamat
told me  is the general topic  education and society  and under
the rubbering of this general topic  more selected more specific topics
 will be taken up  by experts for exposition in future lectures 
""
i have been  i have chosen rather  not that i have been
asked to  the general topic was suggested to me  and i was given the
option of selecting any particular topic under the  general theme of
education and society 
""
and i have chosen to speak on education and development 
""
at the very outset  one understands that education and
development  is part of a larger question  namely  what is the
relationship of education to society  ?
""
historically  the inter relationship between the two  has
never been universally accepted 
""
the traditional view of education has been  that it is geared
 to the specific  interest  aptitude  and needs of the
individual 
""
and education is defined as  an activity  whose purpose 
is to promote  and develop  various aptitudes in the child 
cultivate active habits in him  and develop such skills and values and
attitudes  as would finally result  in a well-rounded personality
development 
""
in other words  education has most often been looked upon 
as the principal  means  of individualist purpose of developmemnt of
ones own personality 
""
it is his aptitude  it is his interest  it is his need 
to develop his own personality  that have constituted the main focus 
of education as an activity 
""
the question  and in my view the more important question 
what should such a  educated individual do  or  what ought such
an individual  educated  individual  what ought such an individual
to do for his society  or for his country is seldom raised  in the
field of educational discussion 
""
that is supposed to be  for each individual to decide 
""
we give him a package  over a period of ten fifteen or twenty
years of education  cultivate certain attitudes in him  cultivate
certain values in him  cultivate an outlook on life in him  and then we
send him out in the wide world 
""
let him decide what he wants to do  whether he wants to lead a
life  entirely devoted to personal development  or whether he wants to
be of some use to the community around him and to his own country is a
decision which the individual is supposed to take 
""
therefore  before going into the specific question  of the
role of education in development  it may be useful to raise the general
question  whether education is an end in itself  or whether there are
larger societal purposes which education must serve  ?
""
the question has acquired urgency in modern times  because
education has become  one of the key activities in the very process of
modernisation 
""
relationship between education  and society has become the most
fundamental problem  of our age  because education has become at once
 the principal means of preservation  as well as of change 
""
traditionally  society has looked upon education as a process by
which  to conserve  to enrich  and to transmit to succeeding
generation  the accumulated knowledge  skills  beliefs and values
 on which  the  society's  cohesion  and permanence depends
""
""
but in more recent times  and especially in the developing world
 and india belongs to the developing world  education has increasingly
come to be looked upon  as one of the most potent instruments of
development  and also of change 
""
as professor james coleman  said  and i quote  
once regarded as essentially conservative  culture preserving  and
culture transmiting institutions  education now tends to be viewed  as
the master determinent  of all aspects of growth and change  
unquote 
""
society has probably changed more  in the last thirty years 
than it did in the preceding three hundred years  and this is equally
true  of both the developed world and of the developing world 
""
it is this continuous  and often profound societal change 
and the salient role of the education in it  that have brought to the fore
the question concerning the nature of relationship  between education and
society 
""
two major post second world war developments  account for this
new awareness 
""
one is the emergent from colonial rule  of the countries of asia
and africa  whose leaders at once turned to education  as an effective
instrument of modernisation and national development 
""
the other  is the growing awareness among the industrially
advanced nations  that in the continued emphasis on education lies the
assurance  of their scientific  technological and industrial leadership
 and even hegemony 
""
the earlier attitude  of treating education as though  it
were a self sufficient  and autonomous system  functioning in isolation
of prevailing socio-economic realities  was largely abandoned in favour of
the more positive concept of education  as a social sub-system 
interrelated with  and interacting with other sub-systems like the
economic sub- system or and the political sub-system 
""
there are at least three ways  in which education has direct
relevance to society 
""
first is the way  education produces  suitably trained
persons in required number  to man the million institutions through which
 society lives and grows 
""
this i call  the leadership function of education 
""
second  is the contribution education makes  to economic
development  both in terms of skills and attitude 
""
everywhere  and particularly in the developing countries  the
belief in some kind of a cause-effect relationship  between education and
long term economic development  has become almost an article of faith 
""
the rulers of these countries  have been relying increasingly
 on considerations of economic development to justify  greater state
support  as well as greater state control of education 
""
underlying this emphasis on economic development  is another
article of faith  namely  that rapid economic development  is the
minimum indispensable requisite  of democratic political development 
""
i call this the development function of education 
""
the third and equally important role of education  relates to
its socialization  including political socialization function 
""
what do i mean by socialization function  ?
""
socialization refers to that process  by which individuals
acquire values  attitudes and feelings  towards the social system 
and towards their distinctive role  in the social system 
""
every social system is based upon  its own unique value system
 and seeks to perpetuate itself  by creating an    app 
  appropriate   ideological support structure  through
shared values and beliefs  among members of that society 
""
education is the principal agency for this purpose  which begins
at birth  and continues through both formal and non-formal ways  all
through life 
""
for example  a democratic society seeks to inculcate among its
members  values of freedom  tolerance  dignity  and autonomy of
the human personality  justice and fair play  respect for truth  and
belief in human reason  and its capacity to solve human problems 
""
a democratic society  also seeks to encourage  a healthy
scepticism  towards authority and power  and especially towards all
forms of dogma  and seeks the help of education to achieve these goals
""
""
i just now spoke  of the increasing expectations from education
 in social development in political development as well as economic
development  and i used the word development  not merely   in
the   in the   rather narrow sense of economic development 
i used the term development in a more comprehensive sense  of economic 
social as well as political 
""
as against the nineteenth century liberal view of education 
there is the other view of education  as an agent of change and
development  and it is that view which prevails in india among official
and non-official circles dealing with educational policy 
""
it is argued  that india is not yet a free society   
in a  fun    in a fundamental   sense  if by freedom
we mean something more than political independence 
""
the indian  society's  hierarchical structure  its caste
system  inequitus economic system  and its anti-labour intellectual
culture  are formidable barriers  to its development as free society
""
""
and education will have to make a major effort  to create a more
egaliterian social order  as a means to real freedom 
""
unlike western societies where freedom usually meant freedom from
the state  in india  and in other developing countries freedom means
freedom from want  hunger  ignorance and disease  in the eradication
of which  the state is expected to play  a pivotal role 
""
in such a situation  education for freedom  would have  a
far more positive content  than is visualised in liberal education concept
""
""
it would need to have  two components in its curricular content
 to enable students to relate their educational experience  to their
immediate social environment  by participating creatively in the
transformation of that environment  to desired end 
""
the first component would consist  of the conserving aspect of
education  and would be dealing with knowledge  information  beliefs
 values and attitudes 
""
the second would be  the participatory component  which would
have both a theoritical and an applied aspect  such as work experience 
or socially useful productive work 
""
i do not have to  tell an audience of school teacher  what a
mess we have already made  of both these useful concept of work experience
 and socially useful productive work 
""
in india  education is critically relevant  in as much as it
is a vital element in the process not only of comprehending  but also
managing development  and change which are two crucial input  in our
pursuit  of a modern nation making 
""
education being a catalystic having a catalystic role  it is
wrong to look upon it  as a self-contained  neutral  and autonomous
system 
""
rather it needs to be consciously oriented  towards the building
up of india  as a nation and towards the realization of our national goals
 of a rapid economic development  in which the standards of living 
for all people will continually be rising 
""
education is thus  a very important element in the process of
development 
""
but let me pause here for a moment  and ask the question 
what sort of development  ?
""
we all want to develop ourselves 
""
there are no two  opinions about that 
""
and we want to develop as fast as we can 
""
no two opinions about that either 
""
but what sort of development do we want  ?
""
because much will depend upon  our  clarity  in the
conceptualization of  quote unquote development  that our curriculum in
education  that our teaching learning and everything else that goes in
schools and colleges  the character of the activities in schools and
colleges  will depend upon the clarity we have and the national consensus
we are able to build on this central concept of development 
""
until twenty or thirty years ago  developing countries like
india  answered the questions  what sort of development do you want
 by saying  we want much the same sort of development  that
industrialised countries of the west have achieved 
""
in other words  we want to imitate england  we want to
imitate the united states  we want to imitate germany japan  soviet
union or france  we want  to become  like the western
industrialised society  whose high standards of living  have been made
possible by a rapid process of industrialization  with central emphasis on
basic industries 
""
we want large scale industrialized  civilization 
""
it is only when we have  that kind of process of development
 based on rapid industrialization of the economy  that we shall be
able to call ourselves  modern india  a developed india 
""
an india in which the citizens are assured of an ever increasing
standard of life 
""
that was  the general acceptance of the western model  and
there was a near unanimity  on the need to adopt and imitate the western
models of development 
""
but now  things are changing 
""
things are changing both in india  in other developing
countries  but more importantly  things are changing in the industrial
world  the western world itself  as they have begun to see  that
the model that was adopted and developed in their own countries is not
necessarily applicable all over the world
