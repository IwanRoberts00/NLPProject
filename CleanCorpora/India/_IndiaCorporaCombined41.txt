she also what is it i think both of you laughter  pankaj in the north uh what kind of a system of study do you have  do you have state level of studies  yeah  like in maharashtra we've got uh yeah yeah  more important we all have three levels  yeah yeah  yes state cbse and ipsc level  ipsc  yes and which you find the best  i think uh easy board is state level one word  why  why  yeah uh because the board uhn  you you've been a cbse and ipsc ah uh which is much competency you gain i think you mean it's very tough students can't follow it  it's very tough  no no students can follow   it's very tough  yeah it's tough very tough for their age   it's tough one or two words   but don't you think that uh the students are uh trained in a better way by these two cbse and ipsc systems  you have studied through speak one by one you have studied through  state level  state level state yes level studies   yes  but uh i mean prefer the state level of studies yeah  but now that have you taught in any ipsc school or a cbse school  you said you were teaching right somewhere yeah  which school was that  no no it's not computer  no but you have taught na   taught in some school right oh yeah  it is uh mariam convent school   mariam convent school  yeah where is it  uh it's near by my house  no i mean with lucknow yeah in lucknow   it's an english medium school  yeah  english medium yeah and you taught   yeah  yeah i taught uh what did you teach there  what subject  mostly if uh that science physical and mathematics  physical  uh that means you taught one subject yeah in which level   yeah  uh right start from uh eighth standard eighth to the tenth yeah did you taught these two subjects yes and what uh state or ipsc or cbse what level was it  school  no that school belonged to cbse ipsc or state level school  i did cbse  cbse  yeah and what subject were you teaching out of the science subjects  not nothing  ah you said this out of science uh out of science and mathematics i teach nothing  but you said just now cbse level under which which level did you like cbse level or uh the state level  state level you like the state level yeah why not the cbse  yeah  uh  why not the cbse level see whatever i want i can get in state level but in cbse level there is limited course  limited course limited yeah only a limit is there  no but in the cbse or the ipsc uh the  curriculam of studies is higher than the state level always  no   and the course also is uh wide enough  not limited just think about it whole thing  okay now uh daisy what level have you studied in  state level state level that is the maharashtra board then now you are teaching in a ipsc level but which do you prefer i prefer ipsc  ipsc level yeah why  yeah  because like whichever subject you study you get enough  study about that subject  suppose after your you leave your tenth standard and you go outside somebody  you select some uh different side like science history uh  arts commerce  but in uh when you are in ipsc school you get enough knowledge about history enough knowledge about geography  so even though you don't study after you leave the tenth standard leave these subject you know something about this yeah you can when you study in ssc you get a very limited knowledge about that while in the ipsc history you can get more about the monuments  or more about whatever the caves or see you see  whatever history is about  you see  uh i don't uh i don't agree with it we do you not know about your state level book our state level books are like see  no because because  yeah i saw that uh every state level every state has their own sort of uh   yeah i saw that uh that uh in maharashtra uhn  whatever be the admission level i don't know uhm  but i find that education level is low   uhm  where  here   in maharashtra   in maharashtra  in maharashtra then that is what we are saying   that's what we both are saying trying to say so we prefer the ipsc more than the see  state level  see  you must one word  here you can say that ipsc is uh better ipsc is better  yeah you can say  but uh there u p for state level in u p   uhm compe   yeah   u p   uhm  state level is higher yeah state level is higher yeah and we see these competitive examinations also that like the they have the students from the up level are most shine out shine out one word  may be it is because that uh syllabus is much better oriented as but uh when we maharashtra students when we go outside we have a great difficulty in uh i mean scoring through these competitive exams  we always have to study little extra whereas you all you can get through straigh uh straight away  but uh what we have both of us i and priya but still i found out that after studying the state level i can teach much better in the ipsc level because i find it is a much better system  it's a very uh well explained system for the students level yeah now in the maharashtra system maharashtra state board  so what is happened is most of the maharashtrians are rural background  uh students and the education board has tried to uh bring it down to the level of rural level   a few words yeah and that way to put it in extremely simple language but i find that there is a total confusion in the way the subjects are explained out  there is no indepth knowledge given about any particular subject and like if the person is from a higher background like  we find that that knowledge is not too less to less for him for him to proceed for higher higher studies  so both of us daisy and me have found out that this system is a much better systen as compared to our maharashtra board level yeah maharashtra but pankaj you yeah maharashtra board pankaj you have uh some different views  can you tell like any taking  okay daisy uh like uh about your subject chemistry   uhm  can you compare it with your uh i mean the state level what  you've studied and now you are teaching in the ipsc level  what way you found it different   uhm  now let's see if it is chemistry and ssc level see like the state level you will have now say if you want to study some industrial procedure you'll not have the detail study  uhm see it'll just be an outline study uhm  uh while in chemis uh in the ipsc type of you'll have the whole process  how much time it causes you  what are the reactions you what are the precautions to be taken you have more point ipsc in the ipsc type than in the ssc type   uhm   uhm   ipsc   yeah  isn't than whatever you study say uh you're in the ninth standard yeah say you know more you have more knowledge in ipsc school than in the  yeah  ssc school ssc school like they are one more uh behind the state level one step behind uh one step behind than the ipsc school yes  do you find that uh i mean uh they say the maharashtra government says that the books have purposely been brought down to this level because the student then understand english  now if you make the system so much easy for the students that they will in in a way that they are hampering their own uh knowledge as well as not getting down to the english knowledge  don't you think it is so yeah it is  that we don't even get enough knowledge yeah of course that's what i've said no see if it is a student who is more brilliant he will find the study more boring and the   how do you find the level of students  who come to the ipsc school ipsc schools are not that good you see  i mean uh they are also like all the other normal schools  but when they study that course they will prove more brilliant than those state level that is how  that is because they get more knowledge  yeah right  though they don't understand they'll make an effort because they have to study they have to study while those at uh state level students they are satisfied with whatever they get  and what they do is they only do the work of mostly by hearting  right uhn they don't uh like they don't want  to understand the topic   understand  like if they are now the exams if you consider they have only the questions which are from behind the book yeah right well our ipsc schools have all through out the topic yes they cover up the whole topic   cover up the whole topic  and understanding is expected in the school   yeah understanding is expected also the practical is very nicely like we start right from the eighth yes standard for the practical knowledge and all so that helps the students  yeah yeah   yes  yeah  and also it is seen that uh our students of the ipsc level when you go out to state board junior college level yeah they always shine out better  shine out  yeah and they get better percentage and uh they have uh a better application   whatever i saw that uh whatever i saw the education level here in english medilum no yeah  the same education level is in uh up board in hindi medium in hindi so you're talking about yeah in the state level  and there ipsc and cbse is there for there  no you see this ipsc is equivalent to  your state level in study  you see   your state level  not more state level but it is less it is less  but i find that children here that uh students  ha   ha  these are like them like state level   accha are you saying your state level students are as equivalent to the ipsc ip  students here  your state level students   ip  no that uh yeah  do you say that uh because you all are studying in the hindi medium it is the better way the student can understand   can understand because if it is in your home language no they can grasp it more better  the eng after all english is some  and even grasp  no why not in uh maharashtra maharashtra why not in the state level maharashtra   some foreign language  no we don't study in marathi in marathi marathi medium we don't study we won't be able to give you a better idea no no no  why not some person have uh studied in uh marathi also  yes  uhn yes they also can teach in marathi also  yes   yes   yes  uhm yes  no what i'm saying is  see the matter that is given out to the students uhm  whether you are studying it in marathi whether you are studying it in english is extremely less as compared to the ipsc level students  you know the course is more wider it's not limited in ipsc and cbse and it is also observed that ipsc students or cbse student shine much better in competitive exams  i and it is also observed that up board students  do shine in that exams  do shine
