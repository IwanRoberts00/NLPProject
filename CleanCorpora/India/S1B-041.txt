""
""
 there're  over fifteen thousand primary health centres
and sub-centres in the country 
""
 there're  over one hundred thousand  sub-centres 
located scattered throughout the country 
""
life expectancy has gone up from thirty-six  to around fifty-six
""
today  health care is available in urban and  rural areas 
""
plague and small-pox have been eradicated 
""
malaria tuberculosis and cholera controlled 
""
the general death rate has come down from twenty-seven per thousand
 to eleven per thousand 
""
infant mortality  has declined sharply 
""
much has been done 
""
much more  remains to be done 
""
how far are we from our national goal of  health for all
 by the year two thousand a d 
""
what new programmes are being evolved  ?
""
what is the present state  of public health care in india  ?
""
these are some of the questions that we would like to put to our
distinguished guest the union health secretary  sri  r
srinivasan who is with us in the studio right now
""
 we've  also said to you a little while ago that we were
expecting the presence of dr g k vishvakarma  director general of health
services
""
unfortunately dr vishvakarma has not been able to join us
""
he has possibly  been held up somewhere 
""
mr srinivasan thank you very much for joining us    yeah
 on the morning show
""
 we're  honoured and delighted to have you with us 
""
so first of all may i on behalf of the  family of the morning
show congratulate you on your election as chairman  of the executive board
of the world health organisation 
""
this is a tribute to you personally and to the country that  
you represent 
""
""
 yeah  
""
""
 first the   country especially
""
""
thank you very much sir 
""
mr secretary  are you satisfied with the present state of health
care in india  ?
""
""
 that's  a very large question and uh 
""
you know  let's  get this in perspective 
""
i think you know every  sixth human being is an indian 
""
""
uhm uhm 
""
""
so if  you're  going to get our  health of india
alright  we're  going to do an enormous of might of work for the
health of the world 
""
and uh in forty years something fantastic has been done as far as
health care  facilities are concerned 
""
 that's  been an area of development 
""
as you said earlier you know  we certainly made a tremendous
impact in death rates 
""
infant mortality has certainly reduced much more today 
""
death rates have also  tended to decline but not  to  the
extent we wanted 
""
but of the sight of disease 
""
our diseases are broadly  diseases due to infection 
""
diseases due to malnutrition  and life-style 
""
 we've  made a good bit of dent into that two diseases have
been touched 
""
diseases relatable to malnutrition is part of general economic
development 
""
as far as life-style is concerned like cancer  sex diseases and
so on 
""
but this is an urban phenomenon largely 
""
if you ask me what are the brighter parts  so far 
""
i mean certainly  we've  done well in leprosy 
""
every  fourth leprosy patient in the world is an indian 
""
and every fifth leprosy patient in india is a child 
""
 it's  very enormous burden 
""
and by the year two thousand  it may not   may  
be   possible to eradicate it 
""
 it's  certainly it would be possible to have  a
tremendous dent  because of the multi drug therapy 
""
which gurantees you  complete freedom from leprosy in about two
and half years 
""
""
mr secretary  you've  talked about the brighter spots
on the health being   kamiyan kaun kaun si hai   ?
""
""
 kamiyan to saheb  thi hai  ek to hai 
malaria  ke bare mein  
""
malaria  ko hamne hataya 
""
ab kafi door tak chalagaya  sirf ek wapas agayi  do teen
karan 
""
ek karan hai  jo daviyaan   pesticides  thi
unki  resistance  ho gayi     uhm  
doosra hai ke  water bodies development  se chalti bahut 
one word  hote jarahe 
""
aur  infected  log to itne  migration
 hota hai  labour population  ka  
infection  ek jagah se doosri jagah  parasite  chala
jata hai  
""
as you probably know  malaria is different from mosquito
available
""
""
 uhm  
""
""
yeah 
""
""
there may be mosquitoes with no malaria 
""
but when the mosquito carries the parasite  and injects it into
the blood system  then the man becomes infected 
""
and there is another aspect  i think people who understand and
want to discuss about public health issues in india must remember this 
that for the poor people  health is not a priority 
""
priority is illness 
""
and how to get out of sickness as soon as possible 
""
so if you don't have  the full regimen of medicine  you get
back incompletely cured 
""
malaria comes back then
""
""
you raised this  question of about  the poorer sections
of society
""
now in  every developing country i presume there is a certain
dicotomy  between the level of health care available in the rural areas
 gramin kshetra mein jis prakar ke haspatal hain ye  health
care  hai aur jo  urban areas  milte hai 
""
why  does one have the impression that it is particularly acute
in india  ?
""
""
 nahi saheb 
""
dekhye   we're  confusing two issues 
""
 there's  the issue of rural health infrastructure  and
rural health needs  versus urban health need 
""
though the poor in both areas  deserves the same 
""
this question has been tackled in our planning 
""
 we've  done well  not enough 
""
 we're  going to do more 
""
 yeh nai  government  ki niti hai ke jyada se
jyada  rural areas  mein  resources  banao
 
""
health  to  state subject  hai aur 
state  ki  planning  mein   minimum needs
programme  mein   public health programmes  mein 
jyada se jyada  rural infrastructure  badate jayen 
""
""
but you see  you should not refuse the creation of rural health
infrastructure 
""
but what   is   has   come to be known all
over the world as the primary health care approach 
""
""
what is the difference  ?
""
""
in one case we create infrastructure  to reach people
dispensaries  haspatals  sub-centre nurse  midwife
doctor 
""
but in the case of primary health care approach   woh
kaheta hai ke jyada se jyada jage de  
""
let people get  access  to  medical aid  from the
simplest sources 
""
 kahene ka matlab hai  you must be able to get
eighty-five percent of the normal illnesses treated  at the nearest health
centre
""
you don't have to go to a hospital
""
""
uhm 
""
""
you also don't require a specialist 
""
you must understand  that there are three issues here 
""
one is the issue everybody must take care of his health
""
government can't take care of his health 
""
second is a community by itself can do a lot of self-help 
""
it has been done 
""
the third is  everybody do not be taken care of by a specialist
""
""
ordinary doctors ordinary para-medicals  the health system 
can render a tremendous amount of care  as near as possible 
""
now primary health care approach involves rural    in 
  infrastructure   
""
but it is not only rural infrastructure    uhm  it is a
philosophy  that you can take care of your health 
""
community can have a lot of self-help in health  and government
can supplement  by making available health facilities 
""
now one important facility there is health education 
""
so people can't take care of the health unless they know  what
to do about it
""
""
 uhm  
""
""
right
""
 ek iske saath sambandhit sawal yeh hai ke hum ne aksar
dekha hai jo hamare  doctor  hai chikitsak jo hain woh gramin
shetra mein jakar kam nahi karte  infact i think  jee saheb
 was complaning about this  jee saheb 
""
""
 deepakji aap bilkul sahi kar rahe hain
""
balke main to yahan tak kahoonga ke dilli mein bade haspatalon
mein jo  doctor  hain agar unme se kisi ki kisi ka tabadla
dilli ke kisi gaon mein hojaye to uski ek hi koshish hoti hai ke kis tarah
mil milakar apna apni  transfer  jo hai woh shaher mein 
 karwa le  
""
""
 how how   would you tackle this problem ?
""
""
no of course not let me say  it is not true 
""
first of all   i've  been on behalf of the doctors well
i think  mind you there can't be any public health programme in this
country without the leadership  and complete involvement of doctors 
""
how   can that absolutely 
""
""
 absolutely absolutely  
""
""
the doctor has to be the leader of public health 
""
and he must provide the linkages in public health 
""
after having said that i would say  a very large number of
rural areas are serviced by doctors 
""
circumstances differ from state to state 
""
if you went to a state like madras or maharashtra  or even
bengal  a large number of people work in rural areas
""
""
uhm 
""
""
 magar sawal yeh hai ye  doctor  jo hai
kafi bade acche kisam ki  education  ke prapt karnewale hain
""
""
""
no  we've  the best doctors in the world
""
i mean everbody   accept that 
""
""
 and  they've    been trained i think in
conditions  which require certain amount of infrastructure for them to
function 
""
 they've  a family to live 
""
 they've  some kind of education of children and so on 
""
since  they're  exceptionally gifted uh professionals 
been given a good course of education  there is some reluctance  in a
part of them to go to rural areas 
""
a large number of things have been done by government
""
we have  allowances  we've  incentives   we've
 created houses  quarters and so on as part of the    pri
   primary   health infrastructure scheme 
""
i think gradually  as development increases excess increase of
his own system increased  doctors are in fact available 
""
mind you  may i also say this  that as against about four
lakhs of doctors  three and a half lakhs doctors of the allopathic system
  there're  about four lakhs of wise render   hakims
 and so on 
""
they are already available in the rural areas 
""
so  it's  not as if the rural areas is totally without any
medical help 
""
but allopathic modern system of medicine  with a backup of
dispensaries and drug etcetera  is spreading  perhaps  somewhat
slowly
""
""
mr srinivasan one other question
""
this is regarding the availability of medicines 
""
 hum ne dekha hai ke nakli dawayiaan  bazaar mein bahut
bikti hai 
""
now what is the position  what  you're  doing to control
this  ?
""
""
 saheb  you see  you know  it's 
very difficult question to answer 
""
first of all prescription vary 
""
there are cases where  nakli dawayiaan asal mein 
definite  asal mei hai  if i may say so 
""
but   bahut si jagah pe  what you say is 
nakli dawayee   is in fact  dawayee  which tested
by efficacy test  does not measure up 
""
tested by bio availability test is not measured up 
""
it is not uh totally  uh a kind of  uh  it's it's 
misleading in  it's  effect
""
it claims more than it does 
""
the reason for that is  the quality of good manufacturing 
that have to go into this is improving slowly 
""
but again please don't lose the perspective 
""
we produce about three thousand  crores  worth of
medicine 
""
 two words  i think  a good part of it comes from large
industries 
""
good part of it comes from well run small industry 
""
i would say that there that medicine is as good as anybody else
""
""
but  yeah there are  black sheep  and the only way to do
it is to have drug regulatory action 
""
now drug regulatory action has to be within the law 
""
so we must have drug inspectors more laboratory facilities 
""
what is more important or more acute  consumer consciousness
""
""
""
you mentioned a little while ago that the present emphasis
 the present priorities on health care in rural areas 
""
 what're  the new concepts and technologies and this will
be my last question  ?
""
""
yeah
""
but you see  technology wise  certainly the  early
detection  has an approach
""
""
uhm 
""
""
take cancer for instance 
""
cancer of the breast  cancer of the cervic for women  oral
cancer for men 
""
i think  it's  possible to have lot more of education given
 to people  to school teachers 
""
so that they can detect either by the help of a friend or by
themselves 
""
what is it that requires treatment  ?
""
and  it's  now clear for instance in cancer if you detect
early  you can get it completely cured 
""
take for instance oral health and dental health 
""
as a country we wash a lot 
""
inspite of that our oral health is declining   it's 
possible for us  uh to get  so technology is going to be  not
tremendously different from what is known  but health education 
involvement of people  getting people to look after the health  is part
of the primary health approach  would be the main issue
""
""
mr secretary  will we have health for all by two thousand
 ?
""
""
 it's  very broad question and what do we mean 
certainly  we'll  have much creative control over disease  some
diseases definitely 
""
 we'll  have much creative effective immunization of
children against preventable diseases 
""
we would have i hope much greater positive awareness of health 
""
and my own personal feeling is  i hope that people would be
encouraged  to take care of their own health  and medicine would stand
 somewhat demystified
""
""
thank you very much sir for joining us on the morning show
and sharing with us your views and perspectives about health care in india
past present and future
""
we appreciate your presence
""
thank you very much indeed
