 india's too graphic population growth is like a subterranian under current  too many of the tensions that are surfacing in indian society today but not a chronic ailment that one learns to live with  the issue has ceased to be upfront in the national debate  and in fact because unless this is addressed uh much else that we do for our developmental efforts does not justify  uh welcome break therefore in today's  focus in the wake of the world population day  that brings together three veterans of the population game  into the studio for a discussion with us  uh we have here today dr karan singh who lead the indian delegation at the first world population conference in nineteen seventy-four  and gave the world the major of those one word development is the best contraceptive  although now i believe he is on record saying that contraception is a best form of develpoment but i'm sure you will hear more about that from him later  then there is dr bose a jawaharlal nehru fellow and an evergreen of commentator of the population in many other issues  and finally dr mathur who is the bureaucrat in the hot seat as a secretary with the department of family welfare  but first before we turn the floor over for a free  participation of everybody for a discussion on this issue for the last one year now a population policy has been on the anvil  the eighth plan which has been approved in may has given  priority to the population issue  but at the same time while giving priority it has  down-scaled birth rate target even though one positive scene in all this dismal scenario has been that of late birth rates are dropping  but the eighth plan has scaled down to birth rate of only twenty-six for the year nineteen ninety seven  why is this happening ? or perhaps i should stop at this point and ask dr karan singh who has spearheaded this programme with very critical  point in the programme  to give his comment on uh where we are ? and where do you think we are going where you see we can go ? well the uh theme we are about discussion  to discuss is uh population: whithered india  and i have uh two word response to that two word question  and the response is towards disaster  because uh what has happened in the last forty year   years uh the increase of five hundred million people  the population of india from the nineteen fifty-one to the nineteen ninety-one census is something which is absolutely staggering it has diluted to a very large extent the considerable uh economic development that took place  as a result of which we are going into the twenty-first century  with more people below the poverty line then when we became free in nineteen forty-seven  more people not a larger proportion of the population but in absolute term more people  our cities are exploding into slums they are like cancer growth eating into the countryside  uh the whole social structure and fabric is beginning to collapse  under the sheer pressure of number  there is urbanization there is deforestation there is uh  defoliation the environment is being destroyed  and i would say that we are in a disastrous situation  now what can be done about it ? i was very surprise to hear you say that uh a  the population policy is on the anvil  we must have a very hot anvil you know because in nineteen hundred and seventy-six i presented a national population policy to parliament which was accepted now that is sixteen years ago  if the anvil is still growing i think we should let the representatives of the government of india enlighten us that what exactly has happen happened  mr mathur right would you tell us why is it that it is necessary to tell the working on the population policy ? but also i would like you to comment on what is would you think feasible to be done in the near future within this decade ? and what are the strategies that you are forging and are you getting the support if you think you need ? well while i entirely agree with dr karan singh that it's  a disastrous uh situation  but whither india well whether we can save the disaster or not would depend what we do in the next ten years  and therefore we have very uh manfully taken the challenge  uh should say atleast in the de our department  to see how what we can do about it and in the last one year first of all we've made  uh concerted efforts  now again focus attention on the population problem through very close interaction between india's one word we have been i think uh instrumental in uh increasing the awareness about the whole problem we are finding a lot of interest now in ordinary people also to participate in the whole thing  then we have projected at least don't create  family welfare programme with the population control programme  when population control is a much larger concept  family welfare of course is a key aspect of it  for population control is dependent on female literacy  education rural devepolment uh age of marriage of girls  so for that you must have a micro-level coordinated policy  now i'm very glad that there was a policy as dr karan singh has had mentioned earlier a national population policy  but that all had to be uh made into implementation plan and there had to be a uh micro-level mechanism also to have a co-ordinated implementation action  now because of that now the n d c has appointed a committee of  n n d c on population which is going into the whole question on micro-level co-ordination  and as far as the a family welfare factor is concerned we have prepared a very result oriented and purpose one word plan  giving emphasis or improving of the quality or the self  family welfare services the health services constant one word  attention of the urban slums dr karan singh has spoke spoken about  improving the quality of contraceptive introducing new contraceptive  social marketing better information communication education  na uh ta strategies ivolvement of people n g o what specific measure that improve endeavoury of services which is your one or two words   that maternal  uh well you see on that a lot of it is going to be the advent state of input  and training will play a key role  now we have through very close interaction with the state government particularly the state government from these four mega states of north u p bihar madhya pradesh rajasthan and to an extent orissa and uh assam where the problem is uh aggrieving  we have brought home the need for improving the delivering system so we are having certain special projects one word  infrastructure great emphasis being made lead on the uh training programme filling up of portio these are the nitty gritty details of good administration which makes all the difference  and then of course we're having very close monitoring what they do ? yes greater enthusiasm  and then we have got this what you called uh ninety district strategy that is focussing on the ninety worst state of which eighty-three are in the four state  so i have a  one word taken up already  well the beginning have been made we are awaiting uh the micro-plan from the individual district  because we do not want to impose anything from above  so we have told the state government please involve your local people your collector your uh chief medical officer   and they from the local condition send us micro-plan which would indicate their special support is required from the center  so that uh the democracy profile improves in those states  and then of course i i was mentioning a very great emphasis  on maternal and child health area you see  we are just about to launch a very important  child survival and safe motherhood project which uh through an integrated have been to mention for child survival and for promotion of safe motherhood practices  it reduce infant mortality child mortality and maternal mortality  and people will then appreciate that uh if you   your their children are going to survive they need not have launched up  ashish i'm wondering what you have to say on all this i can al al almost see you it looks coining a new acronym no no right now  no no  i will make two brief comments at the outset  first what dr karan singh's relation to the national population policy  i think it is too late in the day now as nineteen ninety-two to  think of again formulating a national population policy  i've just done a preliminary analysis of the nineteen ninety-one census data  and one thing which emerges gre is a great diversity of india  and you can't put all these states and districts in one package  and therefore the national population policy tends to be a set of platitudes  and it has very little operational value  in any case we've miss the bus we should have done it right in the first five year plan  now dr karan singh the only snag uh you would forgive me for saying that only snag about the national population policy formulated by him  well this was emergency and it became highly unpopular  because there was one permissive clause  i don't remember the particular section or the dialogue  which saying that some state government wants to introduce compulsory sterilization then we do so  if they have the way they've resolve and that landed  the government in very serious trouble  and as you know the very next year the janata government withdrew that policy  the only thing common in their next year's policy was  this fielding of the electorate the parliamentary assembly seat in nineteen seventy-one upto two thousand one that is a very good step i suppose that in fact there was very serious severe setbacks to the a few words   a few words  so let's not get back into history the thing is as we are now if we are still waiting even after formulating the eighth five year plan for a national population policy  then i think we are lost  and we're heading towards disaster as he say  and it is time that we forget this sort of a generalizing  and comes out to grasp that another plan of action  now which brings me my second point  now there if i mentioned so my differenc to the ministry's  plan of action is those ninety districts which you have identified  they are truely backward  in fact in my analysis on nineteen ninety-one census i get one hundred and fifteen districts  any other noble mind you told me that you can also change uh  dedicated the act to that resolve  that's not my point my point is if you put more money on familiy palanning in those districts you will not succeed because there the birth rates are high precisely because infra-structure is not there  the roads are not there  these hospitals are not functioning sub-centre's are not fuctioning staff is not there  yeah  and there are number of other social indicators are in here backward whether it being marriage whether it is child labour whether it is  all the other one or two words  yeah therefore i would say high maternal mortality that you should not spread the butterfield  you should not waste your resources family planning's  limited resources on giving a backup in those districts where the infra-structure has to be laid first  so in my scheme of things in my my  strategy which i'm going to formulate shortly i would support the thickly populated densely populated advanced districts  we should give the lead to the country  for example the urban birth rate must be drastically cut down   i i it's a shame that  in the urban areas the birth rate is so very high  one of the reason of course is the large slum population to which dr karan singh referred  so but uh the strategy of putting your money in a backward districts for family planning back-up i really have reserves  but uh  but why you have a valid point about doing something about the urban slums definitely need the full pace  but seventy-five percent of india is in still in the rural areas and within that seventy-five percent of those really needing the services now are identified to be those that are religious with relation to two thousand population yes more settlement there is uh settlement yes yes that makes the task more difficult   so  so therefore the ninety district strategy either a few words we can have little discussion on this actually what you feel is that the two things are not mutually extreme yeah  we are focussing on urban slums  we realize that these are also neglected area and when you if you strengthen the infrastructure you put a little bit push you can have the results  so city by city we are making a plan to how to strengthen the infrastructure we have taken four cities including delhi calcutta  hyderabad and bangalore in the first phase  other uh municipal commissioners and the state  government's have been asked to have their own plans because you see unless the local authorities are involve in the planning process then they don't own the fact  and then we get a totally inattitude uh idea of what is to be done so we are awaiting that and i and yes will  definitely we will cover all the ninety cities in the first phase but ninety district uh strategies we have to go along otherwise those districts will be far behind  i'll come back on the ninety districts  one or two words can i say something one or two things i would like to say of this firstly uh if you are going to wait for micro-plans to be need and come up to you before you formulate your new policy  that reminds me of the famous verse by galib hum ne mana ke tagaful na karoge lekin khak ho jayenge hum tum ko khabar hone tak  by the time you uh you develop your laughter one or two words you will see these micro- plan you know the country is already uh uh virtually drowning in an ocean of of   of people so my submission would be that there must be a sense of urgency about it  and i do agree that having been in exile for fourteen years like shri ram from nineteen seventy-seven till nineteen ninety-one fourteen years family planning was in exile laughter  it became a dirty word they even change the name of the ministry  and mind you the alibis i've been two words i don't want to get into controversy  but just because in one of the eighteen paragraph there was a mention an enabling mention of the possibility of some state passing  laws which were never pass that is not an alibi for having dished the entire population policy which included uh contraceptive technology is included female literacy it included a lot of worthwhile including you increase the age of marriage
