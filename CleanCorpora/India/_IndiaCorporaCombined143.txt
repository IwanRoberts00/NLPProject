newly elected a i a d m k member of parliament from dharmapuri in tamil nadu mr shekhar is an advocate by profession and  he's a party's district secretary  mr shekhar welcome to our studio  thank you  tell us mr shekhar ah how do you  attribute the right of regional po parties   in india's body politics   ah  you see in india there is uh plenty of languages  and uh plenty of uh re regional   i just like that  even though in this uh type of uh our nation because we  are having many differences and many communal individual parties we refuse to save integration and to our india  then this is you see many peoples are there peoples living or having many languages and uh many cultures like that  this way the only regional parties which are reflecting the  regional peoples culture and their uh uh cultures and their  views through that regional parties only gain  and so the regional party is having just a close relationship which is basically with that uh people the regional peoples  you know now-a-days you see that only the congress have  such much of approach to the uh uh throughout national vein  no other party is rather having that much of approach  anyhow our a i a d m k anna d m k which is led by our  puratchithalaivi ms jayalalitha or madam  uh is having the party in uh yes and many states in andhra  karnataka in pondicherry as well as now in uh our capital new delhi itself  so that not only the regional parties are developing in other states our other regions  uh they're also having the confidence of the regional   pe peoples that uh they're  reflecting that uh views and angles  so only the regional parties can built the uh views and the imagines or anything you've to take of the peoples opinion  uh so uh the regional parties are in our country just like our country democratical country we're giving the freedoms to regional parties in one way  in from another angle the regional parties are uh uhm uh united itself and give a democratical set-up to our nation but do you think that regional parties have the same vision  as the national party ? certainly because they're having the same interest of uh uh national uh national parties interest  you know that our m g r our beloved leader in the time of war war time of china he donated he's the first it was the  man who donated such a huge amount just like a thing it was more than a  lakh uh to our late prime minister pandit  jawaharlal nehru  he donated a huge amount nobody under at that time nobody  donated such amount   whereas he was in the regional party under this he donated uh too much of high amount to our prime minister for integration but do you think that the regional party is they you know integrate the federal structure certainly because regional party is having the same view on one word there reflecting there mo their culture their mother tongue such like that but they want integration of the india   they've definitely work for it they've definitely  uh stood in front for their integration of the country our nation  but do you think that the rise of regional parties is a temporary phenomenon or it is a permanent feature of our politics  it's permanent uh feature because nobody can uh uh divert our divert the  regional culture or regional languages you see  so uh this is because this is biggest uh our nation  have many languages and many regions  so this is the permanent one nobody can uh uh that's why nobody can uh close this angle  this is the only thing only angle the permanent unity  because whenever the regional parties have developed  then uh the national development no doubt at all  mr shekhar you were i believe totally associated with the late m g r who was a very charismatic leader yeah tell us something more about him m g r is uh uncomparable leader  he has fight fought for the poor people and down downtrodden peoples  uh in not only his cine his film not only come through cine  cine or such one word yes because he was a big donor  uh uh even though he was asked this he donated uh uh a huge amount by his hard work  whatever he earned he donated all the money to the people and after his death he donated the uh his wealth to his people now-a-days it is said he donated his house and uh our properties to the poor peoples  just when you see and that uh our madam our puratchi  jayalalitha uhm is true follower or the true leader after m g r how is she carrying on the legacy of m g r  yes uh even those in the life life of m g r m g r chose  that only ms jayalalitha she'll give the she'll  be the future uh in your leader  he uh put to our madam in our propoganda secretary at a propoganda secretary  after m g r she's the true heir to m g r uh uh to the party and had a beloved leader  she placed uh now she's the only biggest leader  from tamil nadu  uh  but how is she ?

yes actually after my uh turn there as ambassador  panama also sent a woman ambassador to india   also during my time there was some uh uh there were two ladies they were sent to india in this uh to be trained in the institute of tute of mass communication  one word  i see i see  also i was enjoying my time  uh is it uh uh correct presumption that you were the first uh person from naga to have served in the indian foreign service ? and to have been an ambassador representing our country ? yes in uh in nagaland uh as far as naga  nagaland is concerned i was the first one uh still i am the first one from the nagaland to join the indian foreign service and how many years did you serve there ? i think about twenty years oh then do you believe now that your years in the foreign service have been rewarding for you ? well it was very interesting wherever i went i made friends and specially for india  and only that uh when i had gone to brussels ah ha  eh uh rome and washington d c and shri lanka   ah ha  i believe miss haralu that uh your board has a varied activities  uh we would like to hear from you about some of your activities projects initiatives in different areas  you see we have a welfare extension projects  and this projects have this projects have five centres and you know in nagaland we've seven districts  and in six districts we have got these projects centres and these are in border areas of nagaland state and for these areas you know because it has rural and remote areas  so in in those centres we have a maternity and child welfare centres we have put up  and in these centres we have a dai and a  gramsevika and one word instructor  what are the activities you are engaged on these days  ? uh we are mainly implementing the schemes of the centre  central social welfare board and these are uh social uh social social economic programme  there are for uh in that programme we extend uh financial assistance to the some registered societies for piggery which is very popular and weaving and knitting and dairy  and uh we've other programmes like holiday home camps for children for the tribal from the age of nine to fourteen years and this is very also very popular  usually these are conducted in winter and uh the children are encouraged in this uh in this those are mainly for four children or four people you know and then uh the purpose is to give them a chance to uh see places and also conducting the camps for that to uh to develop  leadership training like that  and then uh we've one word course for those women  this mainly for the women who are the dropped  drop outs uh from schools then we give them stipend for years year course or two years course then we have vocational training for women for uh one or two word of women and this is for to train them in tailoring uh knitting or even typing and other vocational training so that they will be able to get a self self-employment or a get some employment also now tell me uh something about uh uhm the status of women in uh nagaland uh particularly uh vis a vis men and your interface with society  and do do you think that uh the naga women have progressed a lot ? and what are your hopes for the future ? i think the when you uh think of in term of the literacy rate the female literacy rate is very high  uh i think one of the highest one of the highest in think in india also and in nagaland the women are given the girls are given equal opportunity uh equal appoi appointment  employment and also few of girls have almost reached it if i consider top uh we have a couple of ias officers  and also in addition uh uh all the departments we have directors like that but still our rural women are in majority and i must say that i am glad to say that this panchayat teer rajasthani  and i think that they were </-. give a a real opportunity to women because a women has two things we have not still achieved that is inheritance and then women have no place in the   municipality or in the assembly  so i think that the panchayati raj will give them a opportunity to come up in that because the deci decision  making is they are not they are not involved in that and i think that  to have a society uh uh a progressive society or developed society we need a participation of cipation of the women also  uh what is your day like ? would you like to tell us  well first of all to tell you honestly i do begin with a two cups of tea  and then i start going to the garden because i love gardening  then gardening uh most of one word is done in the morning after tea and then uh i come in and may be i watch tv uh the the news  and after that may be sometime i cook  then i rush to get ready to go to the office  and i go to the central welfare board  i mean our our office uh in the town  then the whole day i'm there  but most of the time i also travel uh to all the districts  then in the evening of course no one in the evening i come back and i read or sometime may be i watch uh tv and sometime i read holmes and then in evening i watch one word after the news i go to bed uh miss haralu do you mind if i ask a personal question uh i was wondering how come an attractive like  lady like you is still single  uh thank you  but you know i'm always uh very interested in career and i wanted to do so many things and i still want to do so many things so i had no time to laugh
