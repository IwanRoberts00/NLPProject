so uhm i am mr shinde  i am mrs heema patil patil uhm  so we uhm in fact we are concerned about so many things now a days that we have to be talk about environment and  uh the onset of western civilisation uh western gadgets  what do you think about uh what will happen in this india   what do what do you feel about that  about environment yes  uh sir the position of today environment is not so good uhm so i feel that the future is very dark according to me it is dark  so you think that uh unless people become aware   haan of the future problem uhn  it will be very dark  haan   uhn   haan  so what has made you think uh like this  uhn sir whenever i see uhn some paper and other information uhm  then i feel that uh the air pollution is going on increasing uhm  uhm it's due to our bomb blast uhn  blast uhn and other things uhn these are going uh to add uhn the crisis   uhn   uhn   uhn   uhn  yeah   that's i feel that the future is dark it is there is noise pollution because of these uh refregerator heating uhm like industrial development uhm  perhaps even the management of natural resources  uhm   uhm  uhm  uh these are uhn making adverse effect on the environment on the environment so i feel that the future is very dark future is very dark  so i think you mean uh to put in very few words you mean that you are we are depriving our children from yes  pure nature uhm  yes  yes uh we are not uh  so in fact  we are criminals ah handing over uh  we are not handing over as it has come to us  no the  uhn as it has come to us   as it has come to us  so you you think of the past  yes  and your childhood uhn  uhn comparing with the childhood uh uh we were enjoying the fresh and pure air uh uhn  but uh at present uh the children are deprived of those happy days uhn uhn those fresh and pure air and many other things uhn  because of this changing culture uhm because of this noise pollution  uhm  yes  uh they are deprived of the pleasures which are derived from the nature yes  so it has to do with culture also culture also  so uhm what do you say about uh this strange thing that our religion our culture our past if we go to our past we have gods and goddesses haan  whom we worshipped haan you know  they are uh they represent nature  haan   haan  nature uhn then why this uh why people worship on the one on the one hand but they behave very  in a contradictory manner then take   according to me sir they have not the exact idea of religion uhn  uh if i suppose that religion is uh just like uh  buddhism jainism uhm hinduism uhm but actually the religion according to me it is based on uh it should be based on science  uhm   uhm  uhn  uhm according to me religion means uh the property   uhm of the thing uhm which it possesses it  uhm   uhm  yes  for example this wood possesses the molecules uh  that it will burn uhn it will burn it is soft it can be uhn it can moulded  yes  it is bended uhn it is soft  moulded  it is the religion of this uh wood yeah this wood uhn  if there is a metal then it is malleable it is ductile so what is the religion of man now then   this is the property of  then  at present uhn the religion of soul is uh the knowledge   uhn highest knowledge uhn and inspiration  uhn   uhn  uhn  and uh means soul possesses this qualities yes  the body if the body is separated from it  uhm then body possess the uh colour uhm then  fame uhm uh what are these in marathi as you say the  uhm   uhm   uhm   gandha   rakta gandha varha these are the rakta uh dharma  or the qualities of this soul   that's why people must know uhm that uh  what is the real religion of the man  uh   rakta   uh uh uh   uhm  uhn and they should not collect this shouldn't run after this  uh material progress uh hoarding haan they should not hoard  haan   haan hoard uhn uh that is the basic cause of even adding into pollution  this is uhn  pollution  haan  if they do not start uh possessing all these things then hoarding all this things uhn uh perhaps they will  understand the real nature of this religion  and they will try to gain that pure uh enjoyment  uh ha from the religion  uhn uh   uh ha   uhn uh  that is true uh that is true  if we can feel you see so that means if more and more people uhn understand understand the real nature of religion based on science science and not on superstitious superstitious uhn and that does not also mean that they should carried away by some crazy western ideas  uh   uhn   understand   science   superstitious  yes  they should go to our past our past  and uh to think on these things and try to change change  so what a real sir uh according to me uh this religion uh  do not tell us uhm does not tell us uhm  that uh we should uh kill anybody  uhm   uhm  uhm so ahimsa is the most important principle  uh  means uh of uh in case of this plant if we hurt it uhm means if we destroy it uhm  then the important uh uh element of the nature is destroyed  uhm   uhm  destroyed and the this uh what are they called advantage of uh that plant as uh are also destroyed  are  they are extinct uh like animals are  extinct plants are also getting yeah that is true  that's the haan   you should not hurt it  all this life uh like that   the other day we were we were discussing about haan somebody told us that   haan the hybridisation of rice is not possible now  haan   haan  yeah some thirty thousand uh species were there and now there are only only  eight hundred uhn eight hundred  about eight hundred natural species   ah ha ha  that means we are really depriving our own future  every individual has uh important role   yes to play in this environment  yes  and we are killing that ahn we are killing that  that is uh that is the reality   not knowing the real reason  yes that way also yes sir means uh we should remain uh free from all passion uhn  means hatred killing uhm e  extreme jealous yeah all these things  uhm   yeah  going going to the extreme of any passion any passion  we should try to uhn uh have equiliberium  uhn  equiliberium  and only to have as much as is uhn necessary  essential  uhn  essential essential that if we try to reduce our uh needs uhm then  we'll have to get this supreme satisfaction joy  uhm   joy  joy so  if people understand this religion then there will be no pollution there will be no noise pollution or sound pollution uhm  uh because of this uh more and more needs uhm uhm  and people are becoming becoming more and more greedy yes  they are facing all these material pleasure and uh  that's that's why they these are the factories  coming up and that's why these prices are also zooming up  yes yes  yes  so if we try to understand our needs uh reduce our  cough minimise our needs uhm  then we will not uh produce all these things yes that is true so then there will be no problem of pollution and all these  yes people will happily yes  so this type of an education should be given then  from the primary stage   should be given right from the primary stage yeah primary stage ah so i think maharashtra government has uhm  they have started this uh this subject   uhm   ahn they have added one topic uh one topic uh  on envi  in pollution in science book i saw ah ha ha  in science book so they had they are taking it seriously now ah seriously atleast on the subjects  in uh you see that they are  uh mean they they are when they uh came to know  uhm about it's uh adverse effect  uhm  yes  so  impending danger  uhn impending now they are uh  that's why now they are becoming aware of that  but it is all in the hands of uh our representatives  who do not know much about  ahn  much about the the dangers if the teachers and  intellectuals if they organise ahn  and uh go to the society uhn like that trying to impart  uhn  yes ahn  they went to the masses  uhm  do you think that the intellectuals go to the masses at present  uhm i do not think so  no they are worried about their own   think so ah they ahn uhn  own quest or own uh they are running after their job  running for  identity  ah they don't have their own identity  id ahn  but on the other hand i think it is they have the wrong notion of their intellect   haan i feel  haan  yes so they are not real intellectual you mean intellectual intellectuals do not feel any proud of their knowledge yes  because knowledge is so vast yes that uh uh  yes  you cannot grasp we possess only ahn  we we only possess the tip of the iceberg tip ahn yes like that like that  so don't you think it is very uh significant thing to  uh notice uhn that if we when we think of religion ahn or the ideas about religion that you talked about ahn which takes us back to uh looking at our own body ahn and nature and balance in that  ahn and then we can have a peaceful and uh pleasurable life  uhn   ahn   ahn   ahn   ahn  ahn uhm so these are the ideas which have come from indian side uhn religions from this side  but uh at present what we see is people who geographically are here ahn are not aware of these ideas  ahn  no but those who live in other countries ahn  like western countries  ahn  ahn uh who are very affluent countries affluent but they are borrowing ideas from indian religions and yes i have heard that uh some people they are also  uhn accepting this uh non violence uhm they are building up these uhm uh temples there  uhm  yes yes  and some of them have started following this path also uhm uhm so in that case they are means uh  they are  ah uhn now in fact they are following it following it  and very sincerly  i have read in the paper uhm uhm so that is the happy thing many peo many people have come to some times and they were asking about uh this religion uhn and what is the philosophy of this uh indian culture and all this  uhn  uhn i know they do ask about these things  that time we uh felt ashamed of our people uhm  and i remember here once we met uh miss martin  so many here uh  uhm from england and sheril hiper from america uhm  came to this uh backsinger memorial library uhm uhm  and like means uh means at that time i used to go  for conversational classes uhm uhm that means you you were going  you used to go for to teach  i met  no  learn  ahn learn learn english ah ha  english  ah before uh com means uh  before you join your m a  ah m a
