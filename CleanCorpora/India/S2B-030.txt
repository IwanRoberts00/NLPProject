reproduction is essential for continuation of species in nature
""
""
for this to occur sperm  a male gamete  and the ovum  the
female gamete are necessary 
""
a proper understanding of a male reproductive system  is
essential to understand the intricate mechanisms of nature 
""
the male reproductive system  provides for the production and
subsequent delivery  of a highly specialised  male gamete called sperm
 which is produced in the testies 
""
 the   ca    the cell   consists of
paternal genes  and this genetic complement  is transferred to the
female gamete  during the act of fertilisation 
""
to facilitate  the essential function  a male reproductive
system forms a    complet    complete   structure
""
""
the organisation of the male reproductive system  comprises a
pair of testes  epididemus  vasaeference  a complex array of
accessory male genetic glands  penis 
""
in many animals  the testes is a scrotal imposition  just as
in the case of man 
""
but in some species  testes occupy abdominal positions 
""
there are wide spectrum of variation in the location of the testes
""
""
the position of the testes  in different groups of mamal shows
enormous variation  in terms of its location 
""
for example in the case of elephant  higher access  the
testes lies just behind the kidney 
""
in the case of hedgehog  and some other insectivores  the
testes is located against the ventral abdominal wall 
""
in the case of  pigs  rats  horses  rabbits  dogs
and cats  the position of the testes  is in non pendulum scrotum  is
underneath the anus 
""
in dolphins  armedillos  cavity  slogs  the testes is
located at posterior end of  abdomen 
""
in the case of moults shoos and some species of birds  the
testes is located at the base of the tail 
""
in sheep  cattle  and other ruminants also in some primates
 the scrotum is pendulous 
""
the typical male reproductive system consists of  pair testes
 which may be located in the scrotum  or may be present in the abdomen
""
""
the testes  are uh provided  with a thick fibres cover 
called tunica alveginia 
""
the testes is divided into many compartments  and consists of
many coil  tibules which are called as semeniferous tibules 
""
in between seminiferous tibules  lie special type of cells 
which are called as interstitial cells or the cells of leddes 
""
the semeniferous tibules  in a section  consists of large
number of  cell types 
""
basically these cell types  are two  the germs cells  and
the cells of sattory 
""
the germs cells are concerned with the production of spermatozoa
 while the cells of sattory basically have the nutritive function 
""
if the cross section of the  semeniferous tibule is examined 
one would find  the upper pair  of cells to be spermatogonia 
""
these themselves are of several types 
""
they have been classified into spermatogonia of the a  b and
intermediate type 
""
even the a and b type of spermatogonia  are of several subtypes
 which are classified on the basis of  their cytological
characteristics 
""
the first generation of primary spermatocites cells  these
undergo  myosis 
""
the myosis itself is of two types  reduction division  where
a number of chromosomes is reduced to half  and myosis two which is an
equational division  where there is an increase in the number of cells 
unaccompanied by further reduction in the number of chromosomes 
""
a primary spermatocites give rise to secondary spermatocites 
which i have n number of chromosomes and are therefore called as haploid
cells 
""
the secondary spermatocites  grow into round spermatics 
""
these spermatics  undergo a process of differentiation  which
is called as spermeogenesis 
""
there are essentially four basic steps in this process  one is
called as gorgie  followed by a cap phase  and agrosome phase and a
maturation phase 
""
the  spermatozoa which are derive from spermatics  are
highly organised  cells 
""
from a genetic point of view  these sperms are half cells
because they contain  haploid or half the number of chromosomes 
""
if you take the example of human  the deployed number  for
dual number chromosomes is forty-six 
""
at the end of spermatogenesis therefore  the sperm contains 
twenty-three chromosomes 
""
these sperms may contain  either x chromosome or y  and
genetically  therefore they are dimorphic 
""
this text just enumerated above  describe a typical structure of
the seminiferous epithilium 
""
however this should be understood  that the  cells present
in the seminiferous epithilium  are in a stage of progressive development
""
""
all seminiferous epithilium cells  do not show the same 
associations 
""
that is  that the arrangement of cells in each seminiferous
tibules is different 
""
sometimes  a large variety of  cells can be seen in
successive stages of development 
""
the cell association  is the term used to describe  the
arrangement of cells  that is spermatogonia the primary spermatocites 
despermatates and the differentiation  process that is seen  in the
process of sperm formation 
""
in the case of man there are six cell associations  and fourteen
different cell types have been identified 
""
the  cycle of development in the seminiferous epithilium 
which leads to the formation of a completely differentiated sperm  is
called as  sex cycle of the seminiferous epithilium 
""
it takes about seventy-four days  for a sperm to be derived from
 the spermatogonia 
""
the sperm formed in the testes  are incapable of 
fertilization  and therefore  they have to  be  uh  they
have to transit through     o    other  
parts of the reproductive system  particularly  the epididamus 
""
the root of spermatozoa is quite definite 
""
from the testes they go into the retitestes  and from where they
go through  a small ducts which are called as vasaefeverence 
""
the vasaeference lead these  sperms into  the epididamus 
""
the epididamus itself consists of three main parts 
""
the top part which sits  as a cap on the testes  is called as
cafort epididamus 
""
the second part which forms the main body of epididamus is called
as corpus  and the terminal or tail part of  the epididamus is called
as corder 
""
during their transit  from cafort to corpus and finally to
corder  this sperm undergo  vast and complex maturational changes 
""
it can rightly be said  that the epididamus is the main point
 where the sperm undergo morphological  biochemical and physiological
changes  which endorsed and  the property of  fertilizing the egg
""
""
the  sperm  principally  uh undergo  changes in their
membrane property  in the maturation of uh  the acrosome  in the
 uh ability to  be more motile as they  come into the corder 
""
it has also been seen  that the sperms on the cafort are
incapable of fertilizing the egg  and at best  the rate of
fertilization is about five percent 
""
corpus sperm usually  are better about twenty percent but by the
time they reach the corder epididamus  they their fertilizing potential is
about ninety-five percent 
""
from the corder  they are  transported to vasaeference 
and from there they are mixed with  secretions of the essentially male
genetic glands  the prostate  the seminal cycles  the valbo electral
glands also called as scoupers  and some other minor glands which are
found  in some species but not in others 
""
the mamalian spermatozoa is a highly differentiated cell 
""
the typical mamalian spermatozoa  consists of three main parts
""
""
the head  the mid piece  and the tail 
""
the head is not  itself a simple structure 
""
it contains on its interior aspect  a structure which is called
as acrosome 
""
 the   under the acrosome  lies the nucleus which
takes on the same shape  as the head itself 
""
the second part  of the sperm is called as  the mid piece 
which contains  the powerhouse of the cell  called mitochondria 
""
these mitochondria helically arranged  and contains the
necessary enzymes  which can use the nutrients of the seminal fluid 
for maintaining the integrity and functional abilities of the sperm 
""
the acrosome itself  contains three different types of enzymes
 which are used in the process of fertilization 
""
the tail consists of three main parts 
""
the  principal piece the end piece  and a  place where
the mid piece joins the  tail 
""
the tail structure consists of two central filaments and nine
peripheral filaments 
""
the shape of this spermatozoa  is very variable in the animals
""
""
the number of sperms produced  is also highly variable 
""
for instance in the case of humans  the number of sperms
produced in one ejaculate  is of the order of two hundred to four hundred
million 
""
the  physiological function of the testes  depend on a
complex interplay  of not only environmental factors but also on endocrine
secretions 
""
in principle  extrinsic as well as intrinsic factors are
involved  with the stimulation of the nervous system 
""
a part of the nervous system called hypothalamus  contains
special type of nerve cells  which are called as neurosecretary cells 
""
these cells  secrete hormone  which is called as 
gonadotropin  releasing hormone 
""
these hormones  can be transported to the pituitry  by a
vascular root or thorugh nural connections  and it stimulate cells of the
pituitry  which in turn produces two types of hormones  f s h  and
l h 
""
the f s h act from the seminiferous epithilium  and brings about
 the development and differentiation of various egg cell types namely 
from spermatogonia  to spermatocites  of primary and secondary type to
spermatits  and the formation of a differentiated sperm by spermatogenesis
""
""
the f s h also acts on the certoli cells which are the nongerminal
elements  and these in turn secrete certain proteins  which bind with
the androgene produced in the ladic cells 
""
such   bound androgene proteins   androgene bound
proteins    hormones are again carried to  the testicular
germinal epithelium  where they bring about  sustenance of
spermatogenesis 
""
the second hormone which is produced from the pituitry is called as
l h 
""
but in the case of male it is called as  interstitial  cell
stimulating hormone 
""
this hormone acts on ladic cells  of the testes  and  
  cau    causes   the release of androgene 
""
androgene are important for large number of functions 
""
for instance androgene  which are bound to androgene binding
protein produce certoli cells  are important for spermatogenesis 
""
androgene are also important for accessory male genetic gland
functions 
""
androgenes are also involved  with the development and
differentiation of secondary sex characteristics  and they are also
concerned with libido  and sexual behaviour in the case of animals 
""
in many animals  the these events of endocrine  secretions
occur cyclically 
""
for instance there are many animals in which  these phenomena
occurs only once a year 
""
in others where this  events may occur twice a year  or in
still others  this  event may occur several times in a year 
""
in the case of man  the process of spermatogenesis once it has
started continues  for a very long period of time  to the age of
seventy or even eighty years 
""
however  the limiting factors in the start of reproductive
activities in the  endocrine elements as well as in the  testicular and
ladic cells  depends on the attainment of puberty  which are complex
sexual maturational changes  that are  time dependent 
""
in the case of human male they begin  to  occur at the age
of  fifteen years 
""
the testicular spermatozoa thus produced  find a way into 
the epididamus where  sperms   undergo maturational changes 
described above  as well as  they transit into  the vasaeference
 
""
the flow of sperms from epididamus to  the vaseeference is
partly by hydrostatic pressure as well as by peristaltic motion 
""
from vaseeference  the  sperms are mixed with the seminal
secretions contributed by the accessory male genetic glands 
""
they come into the urethra  and uh  the terminal part of
the urethra  is the penis 
""
this penis is of  two main types 
""
in the case of humans  the penis is described as  a vascular
type 
""
because the erection of the penis depends on  congestion of
blood 
""
there are two main mechanisms for this erection 
""
one is reflexogenic  by spinal stimulation  and the other is
 by vasocongestion 
""
the  vasocongestion in this case  may be psychogenic in 
in the case of man 
""
the second type of penis which is found in dogs and many other
carnivores  is called as  the vibroelastic type 
""
for copulation  the sperms are deposited in female genital
tract 
""
the  sperm  uh with the seminal fluid constitute the semen
""
""
this has an alcaline ph 
""
the place where the sperms are deposited also shows variation 
""
in the case of humans  the sperms are deposited in the vagina
 but in the animals like horses and others the sperms are deposited in the
uterus 
""
irrespective of the site of deposition  the millions of sperms
 face very hostile environment  in the vagina and in the cervix 
""
the  ninety-nine percent of the sperms  or even more are
destroyed 
""
in the case of human female  the sperms are able to reach the
felopian tube where the egg awaits them  and nearly one thousands to three
thousands such sperms may surround the egg 
""
of these only one will  one  fuse with the egg  and this
ensures  the beginning of a new life
