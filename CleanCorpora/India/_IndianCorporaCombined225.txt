so in this my last talk in in this uh refresher course  uh uh i can't do uh in fact i want to give two talks on commonwealth literature as such but uh cough you'll  have to be satisfied with only one  and again in the in the department here there are people i mean who are specialists in common wealth literature and probably  uh they will say something more uh concrete about uh  australian literature uh african literature  now cough uh now uh commonwealth literature  when it was conceived i think sometime in the nineteen sixties  now i have one date here seventeen september nineteen sixty-five uh on which an association of commonwealth  literature and language studies was formed  and so that's a a good date nineteenth sixty-five  but the very term commonwealth itself the term commonwealth  is uh quite an old one  in the seventeenth century the seventeenth century uh  uh the act of uh british parliament established a commonwealth company  uh a a comprising english england and all the other  uh i don't can't read in this or the other territories  you see they called it a commonwealth comprising england and all the other uh dominions and territories  it it it's a seventeenth uh century uh idea  and uh the ac by the act of parliament this commonwealth was established  and uh then in the eighteenth century berk the great orator political orator now he speaks of the commonwealth of  nations commonwealth of self governing nations  then in the uh nineteenth century i mean the some of the colonies like canada and uh new zealand and australia  and so south africa i mean they  uh became in a sense self governing nations of course under the  uh uh rule or reign of uh the the british king or the queen  now it's in uh twentieth century that uh uh now en england of course was a great imperial power with a power over quite a number of colonies  and uh to begin with uh it is a very comfortable imperial power  enjoying its uh rule over so many uh colonies  and uh the and the english people were very proud uh about the fact that uh the sun never set on the british empire  but uh uh in in twentieth century in the first two decades or so i mean in all the colonies there was an awakening  and uh and the struggle for freedom uh started  and then it is as a result of the second world war  and also as a result of uh the the uh strong freedom movements  in the colonies most of the colonies became free  so actually india and pakistan were the first to become free in nineteen forty-seven  then in uh fifty-seven ghana and malaysia in nineteen sixty nigeria uh sixty-two yuganda sixty-seven uh   da dangarika and cyprus and sixty-six malta zambia sixty-five congo and like that  you see so it's in the forty late forties and fifties and sixties i mean the most of the colonies became free  and uh so for some reason because i think the the british government was uh uh quite ap apparently  showed a kind of a generosity towards the colonies in giving them freedom  uh though the the then freedom struggle were were become had become really ripe  so it was a kind of both both give and take you see  and that's why the the england had very cordial relationships with the colonies  and because of uh this cordiality the the commonwealth was born and uh jawaharlal nehru as i told you is one of the great uh  advocates of the commonwealth of uh the british colonies  and uh now it is at that time again the concept of commonwealth literature came into existence  so i gave you the date as about early early sixties now uh what are the factors that uh brought  all these literatures together  now one of course is the english language and the other is the the common cultural relationship between the between the colonies and england  and uh one might say the colonial consciousness and the english language have were the two binding factors  now to begin with i mean uh those who sort of the commonwealth literature uh were uh people from leads university as i told you yesterday  now professor walsh was the first person to write a small book on commonwealth literature and in the introduction to this particular book uh walsh says speaks of uh the the central cannon of british literature and uh these other literatures are uh  satellites of this  you see they are smaller groups which are attached to this central  area of uh british literature  so you you find in that concept of uh the commonwealth literature a a kind of imperial attitude  it still carries imperial attitude and makes the british  uh literature as the central cannon and the others its satellite  but uh the the ca the writers in the colonies of course they reacted very strongly against this imperial concept  of uh commonwealth literature  now uh what are the literatures that came together uh  the australian literature uh  canadian and then uh new zealand then african then carribean now in canada a uh there are about two languages one is uh french and the other english  so half of uh canada and uh africa one word  muslims uh newly educated people wrote in english so the entire african literature a and also for some uh pople from uh what country is it ? lagose you see they wrote in uh french but they  whatever they wrote was in immediate translate the english  and then uh as far as india is concerned as i mentioned this morning only one tenth of our literature was represented only that literature which was written in english  so if you look at these commonwealth countries we find there are white commonwealth countries and coloured commonwealth countries there is australia canada new zealand in fact they  they they still follow the european tradition  after all uh the australians and the canadians and the the new zealand people they are englishmen who went and settle there  and the relationship between the cultural relationship between england and the other these uh white commonwealth countries that of one might say father and son father and son  and uhm now the problem was they wanted to seek their own identity  they wanted to become australians or canadians and new zealanders so that problem was there with them  even though the the son as he grows up he would like to be separate he would like to have a separate identity from the parents  you see it it is that kind of uh development that you find in uh the literatures of the white uh commonwealth countries  but if you take the coloured countries what are the coloured countries ? india uh and africa and west indies  now uh india for one reason or an   another i mean it didn't develop a a kind of protest that africans africas developed towards english  uh eng uh england  now uh even though my even looking at the indian let's  take i mean uh each uh each literature i mean uh australian literature canadian literature or indian writing in english  or african literature  now even before they came together under one umbrella of uh commonwealth literature  now each literature had developed to a certain extent  now uh one can say that each literature have  has passed through nea  nearly four phases  and actually it is in the third phase of its development  that uh these literatures came together under one uh umbrella  now this is the first stage i mean that is during your the  the period of imperialism  you see the the there there was this writing writing in  in that writing you find that uh the british culture was the dominant culture and uh the the the culture of the colonies was the subordinate culture  and uh the the colonies in a sense for one reason or another yielded to the british dominant culture  uh but this yielding is not uh i mean a very simple kind of an yielding  in the case of australian literature or canadian you find this there is a very simple kind of yielding because they were uh more or less the british who had just gone away from uh england and they were staying there  so before they started talking in terms of their own identity in the beginning they did enjoy this yielding or continuing the old tradition of the british  uh but later on the second phase the second phase is a very important phase the second phase is a love-hate relationship  now in india this love-hate relationship begins uh in the  uh early twentieth century with uh uh the gandhian period during the gandhian era one might say this uh tension  uh was at the highest  and the that's the reason why we have great writers during this period  any period of tension or any period in which there is this love-hate relationship  so uh that period is very fertile  we have very great writers uh not only they did write in english but also in the other uh indian literature  i mean uh who expressed themselves during this period  and that's why from one point of view that was a period of renaissance for us in india  even though we accepted uh a good deal from the british influence from from england uh we took them forms the the european forms the novel the short story the one act play and  uh three act play and all those things  but uh still uh they tried to express the indian experience in a very intense way  and uh during the third phase the third phase is the phase that comes immediately after getting political liberation uh that is political decolonisation  immediately af that is followed by a third phase  and when i mean there is an attempt to i uh seek ones own identity uh and uh to seek ones own national spirit  and that's how a very interesting stage of development  now it is a during this stage the third stage of the development of uh colonial consciousness that uh we find this coming together of uh uh the literatures of all these colonies under the umbrella of uh commonwealth literature  now the fourth phase comes after that say is is now  that uh the most of these literature are in the fourth phase  and the fourth phase is the phase of confidence  you see now most of these literatures they have attained in a sense their own identify and they have produced their own uh  great writers and uh now actually each literature i mean can stand on its own legs  uh so i have a feeling that the commonwealth literature  i mean in third phase they came together and there were there were number of similar problems that uh uh they were facing probably the  pha the problem of uh seeking ones own identity  and uh almost all these literatures went back to their past  their folklores in order to derive inspiration uh uh and uh  uh in one way or other in fact there are various ways not one way in which they found their own identity  but uh they found there there there they went in for various strategies uh in order to uh seek their own identity  and once having found their own identity now they they  they are very confident now  they are confident and the each has developed its own literature that is they now a a big body of canadian literature a very large body of australian literature and very large body of uh carribean literature and also african literature  and uh now the africans have become so conscious that they don't want to write in english any longer and uh they've  have started writing in their own languages their own tribal languages  now uh uh i've a feel i i have a hunch that uh gradually this uh commonwealth the concept of commonwealth literature will uh disintegrate  because the need will go away  there was a need for sometime you see united we stand that kind of attitude was there and uh no then we did a lot of uh  i mean uh comparative work and uh number of conferences meeting together but now we find that uh each literature has come of age and it doesn't require the help of the others  and uh they they there are more differences than common points now in the fourth phase  so i have a feeling that uh now there will be disintegration of uh commonwealth literature and uh each literature will start just as american literature became totally independent  of uh uh british literature in the nineteenth century and established its own identity and now they talk only of american literature similarly australians have brought forth i mean big uh uh histories of australian literature and now they don't need the help of the the umbrella you see commonwealth literature they have achieved their identity they have their great writers like uh uh patrick white who won the nobel prize the great novelist and then they have very important poets like cannis leaser or a d hope or judith wright and again they have uh  they're quite happy with uh their australianess in uh  they've achieved it  and the they have well defined they have defined their australianess and uh they're happy with their development  and similar is the case with the africans  now africans during this third phase they did produce some great writers like uh chinua achibee then ole soynka then ngugi  now ole soynka well he got nobel prize and chinua achibee is all he also became a world figure by his first novel itself the things fall apart  and so they have achieved their own identity  and now again their breaking up in the sense now ngugi say i will no longer write in english  he will write in his uh kenyan it's not swahili but some other uh uh language it is a different name and he wants to write in that language first  and then translate from that into english  uh now uh so they are all very now very self conscious about their africanness or australianess or canadianess and uh now  they're very few points which are common amongst all these  commonwealth literatures  and that's why i've a feeling that uh they will separate and indian writing in english will become part of indian literature  you see instead of uh uh aligning itself with commonwealth literatures uh it will seek its identity with uh other indian literatures in other in native languages  and uh this is in general uh what would happen and probably what's going to happen with uh commonwealth  literature  now uh the the main problem with uh this commonwealth literature was the was the attempt to seek ones identity and this is a very interesting phase  and africans have went gone back to their ancient uh gods and rituals  and uh uh the way they went back in fact uh is a is a is a lesson to us  and i would like to read for example some of the things  the way for example they went back to their gods
