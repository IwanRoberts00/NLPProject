there are ten days to go and then we will witness the elections in punjab which perhaps are going to be the most difficult  ever held in this country   it's not known how many people will or will feel free to come and participate in them  uh what kind of uh state of disturbance there might or might not be  and therefore what kind of value should one attach to this exercise ? what does it hold in in the in terms of the future of punjab ? these are some of the questions which uh i'm going to explore this evening with a group of very experienced observers of the scene  on my immediate left is mr prem bhatia chief editor of the  tribune at on time  khuswant singh probably the best known non-political punjabi i would say laughter  and mr girilal jain formerly chief editor of the   times of india  i know it's a difficult question to answer  we can only guess  but let me invite your best guess estimate  on first of all the very crucial question do you think that uh  it will be an election which will hold meaning in the sense that a substantial proportion of people will come forward to participate in them  ? and i mean i think thereafter it would be necessary for us to look into the question what is it that can be done between now and the day of polling which would possibly improves the chances of a higher voter turn-out ? prem would you like to have the first shot at it ? well the reaction public reaction at the moment  and that is fairly good criterion of uh making an assessment the public reaction is a mixture of despair cynicism  and some hope  i i i'll suggest let's go into the reasons later but give your short answers first put your uh what shall you say your guess on the table  when we'll explore it the guess about the future  about the participation level punjab has been known for a very high percentage of voting in the past  never less than sixty percent  yeah sixty-seven  never less than sixty at the worst of times  ah  well i would be a great optimistic if i would say sixty percent are going to turn-out  my own guess would be closer to thirty  and i think we'll be lucky if we get thirty percent  ah ha  well my ques answer won't be as brief because i've just been looking at the   i'll i give you a second by to the  one word later  to record  yeah  what's your pretty guess i you know it's not as easy as that i i as prem said that uh punjab has a uh a very good record of large turn-out yes  uh the lowest has been sixty seventy percent when a boycott has been called in the past  uh this time i'm not sure the boycott is being called again  but i i the general impression as i've seen is that if  the polling is above sixty percent it will be regarded as a success if it is between forty to fifty percent it's a draw  and if it is under forty percent then the boycotters will have that uh  would you would you have a little range in mind  do you do you think how far   how far up and how far down it should be ? i i think you be don't wish to make one or two words   would not like to make a guess  giri would you speak what you make out if it is one-third uhm if it is around thirty-five percent yes i would regard it as a success   even   uhm   yes   would you would you expect thirty-five percent  ? do you think it will be ? i don't think it will be  it would be closer to thirty than to thirty-five in my opinion perhaps very precise guess somewhere between thirty and thirty-five is really making it very precise  i want to address uh one question to you in this very question our level of participation you know the assam election where the percentage of voter turn-out much lower four percent yeah to be exact  much lower   yeah  people have been saying uh what is the use of an election like that  whatever the voter turn-out actually may happen to be  i think it would be a mistake to overlook the fact that this voter turn-out would have occured inspite of the extensive fear of violence  in assam there was no such fear at all  a j p had not held out any threat  but people were not inclined to vote  they were not with the election and therefore the four percent voter turn- out was a clear indication of what their political opinion was  in the present case i would say that the low turn-out or not in my view be regarded as a rejection of the political process because there would be an element in it of fear of voting rather than a  an aversion to vote  would you agree on that assessment of the political weight of whatever the figure might turn-out to be i think it's suppose fear of voting  they don't want to be killed maimed for life  and the other things is i think there is i said earlier a touch of cynicism  what will happen people say now supposing an elec  an election takes place  uh attempts were made to form a government  where is it going to lead us ? what would the government pe people  think in those terms  and therefore as i said this element of despair the voter  potential voter is not sure whether this election is going to lead anywhere  that is the dominant mood today yeah but uh votes have not on the other hand become  if people were to free to vote  vote for that itself become a reason  while they would go out to vote to make sure that it does lead somewhere that it doesn't lead the electoral process and therefore the future of punjab hanging  if on the other hand it were cynicism without the enforcement of a boycott by fear then it would be a different picture kushwant ? well i think there is one thing which complicates the situation the punjab in which i think you must bear in mind because the problem of the punjab in very roughly put is the problem of the sikhs  and i think it's more important to bear in mind what proportion of sikh electorate go to the poll   what voters go  and the the may simple way of looking at it is the urban and the rural voting for the sikh is largely rural the hindu is largely urban uh and the there is no doubt that in cities ludhiana  jalandhar amritsar there is likely to be larger turn- out  because the hindu presence is there much larger  than probably we uh smaller turn-out in the rural   ar areas   rural areas  and uh we should watch and analyse that mood  to find out whether there is any substance whether the so called grievances of the sikhs which the akali's have been talking about the terrorist have been talking about  whether they've really gone down to the people themselves   one or two word uh since you are willing to speculate  i am glad you do  would you say that the greater disincentive to voter participation among the sikhs would you say that the greater disincentive is going to be cynicism disinterest or fear  well i expect it would be a combination of the three and i think the the situation will vary from area to area  uh you take the three old traditional divisions of the punjab  maza malwa and doab the largest group is in malwa where i think the turn-out will be there all because one or two words it's a prosperous area as a green belt uh area and we already had people like uh amandar singh being elected  one or two words  yeah yeah  and of course where the terrorist are more active the maza gu gurdaspur amritsar  kapurthala in the doab area uh there the turn-out will inevitably be less because the fear of the terrorist is much more there  giri uh since you came down to a very precise prediction  let's assume for the sake of argument that something like thirty percent plus voter turn-out takes place  taking into account that the voter turn-out is only thirty percent  taking into account if khuswant's fear turn-out fears turn out to be true that the voter turn out among the sikhs may be lower and only the total may be thirty percent  what you think should be the attitude of uh the rest of the country or government of india you might say ? to a government that would be formed as a result of that election would you regard it as a legitimate government ? you see this is this election   is an act of desperation uhm  the government of india has decided to go in for elections  because nothing else has worked  yes  the government of india knows that the law under situation is far from what it should be for elections to be held properly  we all know it  it is also obvious that the threat is much more acute in  dispersed rural areas than in large cities  yeah   it's much easier to protect people in cities than in rural areas  so the fear element will be much stronger in the countryside  than in the larger urban centres  the hindu-sikh problem is a fact which can not be disregarded  and if the sikh turn out i mean sikhs are concentrated in the rural areas and if their turn-out is smaller than in the cities  than to that election to that extent the election result will be  not so helpful  but there is no option now there is no option and  and the government that result from it should be regarded as legitimate  alright only i would add one thing that if the  that that government must be very sensitive to the reality of the situation in punjab  sure  i i want to suggest one yardstick for guessing  how much of the voter abstention is on account of fear ? and how much on account of aversion ? the very fact that there are threats being held out that  if you vote we'll kill you indicates that in the minds of those who are holding out the threats there is a recognition that in the absence of the threat people will vote  that it is not so if if they were convinced that people are so cynical that they will not go to vote any how it would not be necessary to prevent them with threats and i go back to the example of the a j p in assam  a j p held out no such threat of the kind   it's position was known that we do not like these elections they are not fair elections and we will boycott them  there after they left it to the judgement of the people because they knew that the people were with them  is it not the case than prem that the element of fear is the predominant deterrent and not either cynisism or uncertainity about what the elections will produce  uh i don't know whether if one can measure it in precise terms  but uh i would i would like to say that another element which comes from uh the present attitude that belong to the present attitude is one of sulk  uhm now i don't think that the population at large the sikhs  i mean you have put your finger on the pulse of the uh the temper of the state  among the sikhs even among the sikhs this sulking element  is not as large among the masses as among the leaders  the sikh population is not sulking  they are unhappy they are cynical to the extent that they don't think much is going to come out of it  but i think down in their hearts they think it's  worth trying  they are fed up with the negative state of things  and uh they don't go into the technicalities of uh  elections like you i do  but there is uh heaven's sake get us out of this mess yeah  and if this is the only way alright we would like to vote there is the element of fear  but then i think some of them turn back and say well what than is going to come out of it  so there are these two conflicts uh i as pran told at the last election we had the same threats   yeah and yet the turn out was over fifty-seven few words   yeah   yeah i think first of all  which last election ? both the parliamentary and the assembly yeah there was a large turn-out   one or two words   eighty-five eighty-nine both of them  eighty-five eighty-nine  they defied the threats just went to vote  no no i have eighty-nine parliamentary elections uhm and the uh eighty-five uh uh assembly election  uhm  at eighty-five the voters turn-out  at eighty-five it isn't but eighty-nine parliamentary elections  uhm the voter turn-out was sixty to present plus  uhm  i never do sixty-two point seven in nineteen eighty-nine you had the parliamentary in the assembly sixty-seven point five that was in eighty-five   that's right and it's never been   really al   are you are you   would you would you say that the same kind of eagerness to vote would surface if there was not the fear of the gun ? i somehow think that we are exaggerating the fear of the gun if they have done voted in the past uhm despite a fear of the gun   uhm  a bigger element is a kind of indifference it makes you know whether if this fellow gets or that fellow gets and we'll  get nothing out of them  uh and i think you have to also if there is a sort of disillusionment with the government there is probably a bigger disillusionment with the akali factions  yeah  and whether the akali's called for a boycott or not it doesn't matter  uh people are would i have got thoroughly fed up of there  in infighting and factionalism and therefore i have been different whether akali  this wins or akali that wins
