hello sir please sit down here  here   haan  i am m g hegde from kunta karnataka   it's in north canara district  kunta is in north canara district  you might have heard of gokarna  gokarna  yeah my place is very near to gokarna   accha  and you  i am from malkhed karnataka  it is in the gulbarga district and uh you might have heard about the rastrakutas and all  oh ah ha malkhed happens to be ah yeah  happen to be the kingdom  ah yeah  capital uhm capital city of this rastrakutas  uhm  uhm  and uh it is at one time uhm it is said that it is uh it was bigger than uhm it is a big city  uhm of india what we see now uhm uhm uhm  so bigger than that one   uhm   uhm   uhm   uhm uhm uhm  uhm  it was said like that and uh some more historical places are also there  uhm  and uh another thing is that there is uh  math anandi math  of which community  of brahmin's community  and uh you might have heard that there are two sects in  uh among the brahmins only  uhm  uhm uh usually there are many but primarily vaishnavites   shaivas and vaishnavites uhm so acharya whose samadhi  is there so he belonged to the vaishnava sect uhm  and just like how we see in one word  sanjeevan samadhi uhm our raghvendra  swamiji had taken  uhm   uhm  uhm like that the one word say it is   uhm and uh he is called as the tikacharya also  uhm because he had written commentaries uhm on uh  the works of madhavacharya you might have heard about  madhavacharya   uhm   uhm   uhm   uhm uhm  so in this way that malkhed has got its own importance uhm as being historic historical uh see spot as well as uh religious sort of so  uhm   one word uhm  well malkhed is mentioned in in many of the history texts yeah  but uh my place is not so the history of north canara   haan is not known at all  though uh probably uh from the religious point of view gokarna is rather known but for the bu but for that history of the place is not really uhm uhm yet yet to be explored you know  haan  uhn there is lot of scope for uh research  for research  researchers because there were many kingdoms small chieftains  chieftains  uh belonging to the vijayanagara empire uhn  uhm chintanani you must know that one time it was chedas stronghold two words was chedas stronghold   stronghold yeah  and later uhm when swadhi kings acquired the area uhm mm they they were brahmins mainly  they convereted all these jaina temples into uh  into jaina uh viharas structures  vihars into temples  temples   vihars  in fact it is said even gokarna mahableshwar temple is one such jaina architecture   one word   o one is one is not very sure of it but   lot of research is uhn uhm is going on now-a-days   ah ha but uh and also pre-historical monuments are found in the area  that way it has acquired lot of significance ah  from that point of view histo point of view of historical research   uhn   uhn   ah ha   ah  by the way where do you work  i am working at malkhed only  malkhed there is uh one factory rajashree cement you might have heard of it oh rajashree cement at at rajashree cement uhn  and bharti vidya bhavan has two words   one school there uhm and i'm i'm  working in that school   hey arun please sit down   uhm  uhm  and uh that malkhed is very nearby uhm  it's seven kilometers away from malkhed   uhm  ah ha  so even at malkhed also one basti is there jain basti uhm at malkhed  and uh in that jain basti there are some models of uh ancient bastis   uhm  uhm  it is uh totally neglected by the department of archeology uhm  once uh i had gone to archeological department and uh  i requested them to take care of all these valuable things  uhm what all have remained there  and the key the key of that basati is given to  one of the persons who is not belonging to that sect   uhm i mean jain  uhm   uhm  uhm  so there is possibility of happening anything at any time uhm  but they assured me that they will they would take care of that one and then many times i took children also uhm  to that basti to show them   uhm  now one uh ruined fort is there fort is there uhm  and it's uh illegally occupied by some of the people uhm there and they have made homes  there they have constructed homes there and one person is living as if he is the king ah and his car you know it goes upto the top of the fort  uhm   ah   laughs  ahn and he has used the the place where the palace once palace might be there and that portion and the remaining part he built uhm an antenna he has fixed it there at the top   uhm laughs  so his car goes upto that top of that uh  mound  mound  what all what all mound is there inside the fort uhm  and uhm apart from this uhm recently one historian visited that uh place uhm  and uh he is conducting lot of research in this regard  he told that that fort it was actually not build by the rastrakutas the fort existing fort  it was build by these kutubshahis  ah ha   kutubshahis so the remains what all are there uhn the partial portion uhm of the fort outside and that is the ancient one you know what i mean by that  it's such one word   uhn   uhm  uhn  the remaining what all we find now that is all that was all uhn constructed by the kutubshahis  but uh inside there is there are some gates within that fort  but there we find that the image of mahavira at the entrance  and all  so it means that some of the remains are there which  are belongs to the rastrakutas  well how many teachers are there in the staff in your school uh we are uhm forty  oh quite a big school it is yes   it's affiliated to c b s e uhm c b s e  its plus two uhm pattern school it is   uhm   uhm  but you have the classes upto tenth  upto twelfth standard  eleventh and twelfth that's called higher secondary school  ha ha it it includes uh plus two plus two classes   plus two classes yeah  junior colleges  not it is yeah it is   junior college and and high shcool   combine   high school combined uh uh composite composite junior college composite junior college  uh uhm something like this yeah something like this  we have very few of them that composite schools uhm  uh partly uhm in one word nearby well here villages are all so near to the uh taluka place you know  they are not that far off  maybe because of that we don't have many junior colleges but colleges rather over populated  we have more than more two thousand five hundred students  more than two thousand  five hundred students   five hundred students  and all sorts of courses are also available   very considerable strength ahn  arts science commerce polytechnic and uh so many vocational courses so these are offered  and staff consists of sixty-five plus fifteen plus fifteen plus eight uhm  such a big staff and english department in the english department we have seven plus two plus one plus one  we don't have any separate departments but the thing is that our school it is uh run by rajashree cement  it's financed by rajarshree cement uhm  and administered by bharati vidya bhavan  you might have heard about bharati vidya bhavan  now this cement factory people have no business over your administration no   that's sort of but local committee is there  uh ha  they have formed our local committee but the thing is that they they are financing  but in the day to day administration administration it is all done by bharati vidya bhavan  so they don't interfere they don't interfere but they have right to interfere uhm laugh  that is there because they are financing uh that's what i am uh asking about  uh  another thing is that it is uh only uh it is far away from uh our locality because it's our kendra  our school belongs to our kurkunda kurkunda also one more school is there  uhm and so one word the transferrable things then you can be transferred no no it is not our jobs are not transferable uh  once we get appointments means over uh  we have to serve there only whenever we get the appointment order if you want to transfer again you have to appear  the interview uhm that would be a fresh appointment fresh appointment  and your service will be not counted uhm  if you seek any  in the private colleges well this transfer business   uhn is possible but one one has to forgo uhm seniority  uhn  seniority  you will be the junior most on the on the college that you joins  and uh but in salary he is protected and but for that  both the management should agree agree  uh this management should be ready to relieve you and that management should be uhm ready to uh take you in then only such transfers are possible  uhm normally uhm well people are not transferred  they don't want transfer now because they can live a settled life   now   only only when the management has more than one college probably transfers are possible uhn or private colleges  uhn  in fact we requested our management to transfer us to  to some of the shcools of hyderabad and let the people of hyderabad come here and serve  what what  what advantage do you have  no because at least there will be a change  there will be a change because uh one way you get uh fed up of the environment  hey uhn because it is uh factory area especially uh factory area and uh mostly polluted area it is uhm so one does not like the area   due to the storm of dust and all so one doesn't like to stay in the area one doesn't one doesn't like to stay there and hyderabadi people are very happy they are very happy or just because kurkund in kurkunda also there is one cement factory c c i has opened uh means set up one uh factory there cement factory there  and our school okay it is also near to rajashree cement uhm  so in this way the totally the environment is  polluted uhm uhm by these uh by these cement factories  how many schools were there in hydera one school in hyderabad i know in karnataka i think all over karnataka only  two schools are there and in andhra pradesh   whereas in andhra pradesh many schools are there  so there there also this factories must be in andhra pradesh  no no what i tell you i am talking about bharati vidya bhavan  uh  bhavan's schools  uh uh  in uh karnataka it is financed by these uhn and else where may be some other  uhn  else where some other factories industries uh ha uh ah  so they finance i understand i understand  so bharati vidya bhavan people have such type of persons only  uhn  who can run the school laughs who can finance finance the school and uh ah yeah run the school so that is the thing  in this way because and what about the salary and other things  salary and all as per the grade  government government central government as the teachers get   kendriya  uh yeah in kendriya vidyalaya  grades are fixed as soon as you get appointment uh uh when the document will be given to you and in that clearly it is mentioned in which grade you are  ah you you are placed you are placed that's there  uhm uhm  and our canara bank is there  uhm  in that canara bank we draw all our salaray so  that system is good uhm well furnished quarters are allotted   uhm  uhm uhm  to all the teachers  you have cinema halls and all  uhn  cinema theaters  no cinema theatres  uh the thing is that they have given this star plus uh cable  it is urban area  or a rural area  it is urbanisation is taking place ah yeah  the thing is that it is rural area only but uh the people are from all over india uhm they are staying here  uhm  uh getting cosmopolitan cosmopolitan it is it is bit like that  so in this way our colony uh aditya nagar is  aditya nagar is just like a mini-india laughs i can say  uh  uhm okay fine
