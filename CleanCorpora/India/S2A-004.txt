""
good afternoon 
""
we have once again a very hot day here but  much more still than
it was yesterday 
""
and let me start once again by  welcoming my colleagues atul
premnarayan  rakesh sharma and our expert  sumant mishra 
""
atul  are you going to sweat  as you did yesterday watching
the match or in the heat ?
""
""
well we did all enjoy the kind of tennis ravi that we are going
to watch  as all the four players are going to battle out very very
exciting doubles match after one all last evening 
""
in fact the scoops of ice cream will be most popular and the scoops
of  delicious uh soft drinks round
""
""
soft drinks
""
""
let me first uh inform all the viewers who are with us today
""
that there is some good news as far as india is concerned leander
paes is fit  and is back on the court
""
he is going to partner ramesh krishnan  in the crucial doubles
tie 
""
and uh  with that uh  good news with us  i think 
it's  a good idea if we start with suman than  lets see what he thinks
this match is going to be like 
""
""
well to  begin with i noticed leander paes has got those
 ankle  fringe  he is wearing  when he went to australia so
 lets come to the match of  one word  
""
i think  it's  this is a crucial match  although i feel
that they have played as with the same players 
""
we have a better than  fifty fifty chance winning both singles
""
""
but  they will both be tough matches
""
so the doubles in any case is very crucial 
""
this  the koreans have seem they were good reputation 
""
but  they hadn't played i mean ramesh there makes a bit
different because  he he is one of those steady players which create the
opening and leander has taken to finish them 
""
in a good doubles team  there is always one person who is very
steady  keeps getting everything opening the other finishing 
""
you had the examples of john macandro and  kan   and
peter flemming 
""
flemming was a  mm and  so anyway so  i think the
players are topping up  now at the side 
""
""
rakesh  you tell  our viewers would like to hear in
hindi  what  this doubles is going to be like  ?
""
well   it's  always  a bit of psychological
advantages uh  you had a good victory behind you isn't it  ?
""
but on the other hand  ramesh is  an extremely experience
player with a vast number of uh  victories  of all kind behind him 
""
i think the most important point that we might like to watch today
is how he combines with leander paes 
""
uh  i rather imagine that paes is going to take the forehand 
court suman
""
""
well i just got to mention this the way they standing  the
first round they played in jaipur   about  five weeks ago 
ramesh took the right court 
""
uh today i think they have decided so  let us how this works
out 
""
i would have preferred ramesh taking the left court  because in
 the steady player always takes the left court
""
""
 ramesh  
""
""
also i think that uh  we  watched yesterday that this
tendency of paes to block the backhand return  uh can prove to be a bit
of disadvantage in in doubles
""
because it gives  a lot of time for the opponent to   
re     recoup   his uh  stamina or run quickly or
get back to position quickly 
""
so i would imagine that uh  uh more attacking left hand court
player is more vital aspect  in this particular game 
""
so we will have to see how the strategy works 
""
uh ramesh and leander paes  uh have played only once before
rakesh
""
""
but they couldn't uh 
""
""
atul uh  may be you would like to comment a little bit but
i will ask you a question  one possible reason for this uh  strategy
of taking the left court by ramesh krishnan could be that the  koreans are
putting in a left hander 
""
and therefore really they will have two right  court players
""
""
""
exactly i was just going to say this ravi 
""
in fact an hour before this programme began they were practising on
the outside courts 
""
and both the korean stars were practising only serves from the left
court  and not from the right court 
""
now ramesh particularly from the left court has a beautiful
backhand which he can  tip  chipping it very well bringing the 
opponent close to the net
""
because the server will be at the base line  and he will have to
come up for the server volley tandum 
""
just one more thing for the viewers particularly the fact that
leander paes is wearinng  ankle pads today 
""
he put them on almost about an hour and half back and he was
warming up with his father on the outside courts 
""
trying it for the first time as i asked him 
""
and ramanathan krishnan told me that the minor trouble that he had
in the right ankle  would not be a hindrance at all at this stage 
""
""
uhm  well that  we'll  have to see 
""
""
the other thing very important is the 
""
""
india is represented by  ramesh krishnan and leander paes
  applause 
""
korea is represented by  chang jong and lee chong wo  
applause 
""
india has won the toss  and elected to serve 
""
time  till the pairs play 
""
""
the umpire is  coming right 
""
and one of the  uh interesting thing that  that happen in
this davis cup ties i think that  india has won the toss in every match
""
haven't we so far  ?
""
""
so far
""
""
ramesh krishnan won his toss  leander paes won his 
and now the doubles team has gone across the court 
""
so  ramesh  and leander will play from the  southern
end  near commentators box end  and probably ramesh will serve we
will have to see in a minute 
""
in the meanwhile  once again to the uhm  to the koreans atul
 uh this is going to be very tough for the indian because  both the
players will play on their forehand 
""
and  that's  going to be uh a very much more attacking
combination than uh  the normal right handed players
""
""
well i think it will be very difficult for the indian players
to pass them particularly ramesh 
""
and uh the result that i could see yesterday in the  two sets
that they played you know really serving very very powerfully 
""
and both of them with strong shoulders 
""
both the korean stars were reintroduce but they were  one word
""
""
""
and leander now is ready to serve 
""
the first service of the match  crucial match  important
match
""
i hope this can excite us 
""
and leander  ready to serve 
""
""
love fifteen 
""
""
very good volley there but  rather unlucky
""
""
yes 
""
""
bit too long 
""
he played the shot and leander he saw the ball  all the way to
 saw  chang move 
""
and he was really good to chase that volley quite easily  to an
empty court  fifteen o 
""
""
oh 
""
""
fifteen o 
""
""
another service  take  chang goes there flack backhand
 down the line  no mistakes at all 
""
fifteen  o 
""
very confidently played by leander
""
""
thirty o 
""
""
he was back quick  waiting for the volley 
""
very good display at the match 
""
ankle doesn't seem to be bothering him
""
""
yes 
""
""
seems to be running alright 
""
thirty o 
""
""
forty thirty 
""
""
the first time in the game leander has gotten on to a lead 
forty thirty a good service
""
serving wide on forehand 
""
very easy  smash for ramesh krishnan  forty thirty first
game 
""
""
leander  forty 
""
""
a very good beginning for india no suman 
""
""
but i like the way uh  leander change over to the forehand
got them on the forehand  because  one word  been consisted in
being serving on the backhand 
""
but now when he won four and forty more 
""
the other point i think is  important korean going to do a lot
of interceptions 
""
you know self systems particularly
""
so  let it will depend on the  indian service return also
how
""
""
what do you think of that very brave shot by chang  ?
""
""
oh  he's  good
""
""
i thought that was a good shot
""
he he he came took the ball on the rise and hit a flak down the
line edge 
""
""
he got a good tactic  good shot i mean he not the 
these are the player  sort of  ramesh is trying to cut off he wanted
to keep it down 
""
in the beginning you try all those  all such things
""
""
i don't think he will try
""
""
but that try that as this thirty all or  so towards the
end of the 
""
""
may i  we'll  have to see whether it can be  bad
attacking that bold as the games along but 
""
""
fine 
""
""
the position at the moment is that india  started serving
the match 
""
the doubles match  first game 
""
leander paes and krishnan  are representing india 
""
and chang and lee  are representing korea in this very vital
doubles match this afternoon  at the d l t a court 
""
india has won the first game
""
leander paes held the service  after winning the toss 
""
and now chang  serves to  paes 
""
""
chang of korea to serve 
""
fifteen love 
""
""
oh that was  that was a necessarily pass  somewhat in
touch was there  have a look there 
""
a nice return by krishnan 
""
paes could have done anything with that in  in the event he
 steady infatuates put it wide outside the baseline 
""
a bit sure zoom for the  rather  unnecessary lapse 
""
they really dropped that return  a good return
""
chang couldn't do anything there 
""
so  it's  thirty fifteen to korea 
""
chang serving to ramesh 
""
""
forty fifteen
""
""
uh ravi did you notice this time  when chang was to serve
 lee the right hander non-playing hand  put it behind  and held up
a couple of singles which shows that they are going to run across for singles
""
""
yes  it's   it's  a sort of 
""
""
you know signal
""
""
a signal 
""
a private signal system 
""
a very pretty shot by lee 
""
in fact that return very beautifully 
""
make tennis look so easy like that doesn't it ?
""
in fact these are very difficult shots 
""
so  it's  one game all
""
first two games had been held by the server  leander paes won
his first game 
""
chang  gave in the same performance 
""
one o first set  in doubles tie 
""
fifteen down 
""
now there it seems to be some kind of misunderstanding
""
i thought lee want to get couldn't get it  slipped chang ran
 almost got it but the net intercept  intercepted that 
""
so  ramesh won the point 
""
already  tension is showing 
""
and there goes another gushing out 
""
suman this is the fourth time  in  laughs  since
yesterday
""
""
as you have mentioned little while line called for  might
   wo wo wo     uh would   you see why chang
miss that shot 
""
""
why ?
""
""
the ball was low near the net
""
""
yes 
""
""
and  both the indians had covered up the  cross court
""
""
right 
""
""
so he thought of going down the line
""
""
going down the line
""
""
but  but he can't run raise it  so near the net 
""
""
you can't you can't have these  totally inexplicable
errors while  you  getting too tense  uh tense i think 
""
his serve stop by the net 
""
he anticipated that 
""
""
rather good drive  rather good sense
""
have a look there 
""
""
leander intercepts  chang hits another nice shot 
""
krishnan stretches and makes it into a win 
""
oh another lovely shot by krishnan there 
""
a beautiful shot 
""
""
good return and better volley 
""
""
an excellent return by lee  and even better volley by
krishnan
""
look at that  good flak return by lee 
""
and  krishnan stretches out meets a nice big volley 
""
and he puts it into the net 
""
krishnan there  serving  over game 
""
""
game is over  india leads two games to one 
""
""
perfect 
""
""
but although india has led  has won this game and leading
two games to one 
""
i think we got to come back to those  two point which uh 
leander paes  seems to have missed up very early in the  match
""
he  he hit one volley up which was quite unnecessary and that
 very interesting smash
""
""
 it's  improvising 
""
""
 i'm   is it is it already the nerves catching up
with him 
""
""
no i think he is trying to prove himself that he  he just
trying to overdo it which is  sometimes nerves 
""
it won't be nerves he has played in this tournament 
particularly doubles before 
""
but here i think he is trying to  prove a point and  trying
to finish off too soon 
""
now both both the shots were    inex   in  
inexplicable   those errors particularly second one when he got so
near the net 
""
""
what  and the point is that he has to cool down a little
bit because this is going to be a long game probably 
""
and uh  if you stretch on to  three or four hours of tennis
 on a hot day like this you have to keep your cool  more than anything
else i think
""
""
 haan  definitely i mean he  he can't
afford to make those those errors  because uh     af 
  after   a great an open you got a shot like this  it is
a gift
""
""
yeah  and uh  as ramesh keeps the young lad in check
 comment  by suman and then to rakesh sharma 
""
""
well i won't call  that's  a lead they are just
holding around because holding services 
""
""
quite please  quite please 
""
 two words   leander paes 
""
""
a very warm and enthusiastic crowd 
""
greeting the  performance of the two indian players  ramesh
krishnan and leander paes 
""
and facing the camera on the far side  the korean number one
star  chang jong ta 
""
""
fifteen love 
""
""
ah you notice atul 
""
""
yes 
""
""
that the  korean supporters are in greater numbers today
""
""
and with their flags waving there sitting out on the west end 
""
""
very true
""
""
west end yeah
