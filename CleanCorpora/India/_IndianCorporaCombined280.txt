if you want me to talk on uh yakshagana   i can only talk on things that i have concerned myself with   yakshagana is an art form  i have been very much interested in popular folk art as well as the theatrical art of karnataka  that means the commercial theatre with their  music-cum-prose scenery and spectacular elements on the stage  as a student as a youth we had so many of the theatrical companies  i was exposed to them  i had a fancy for these things  later on i had impressions of the maharashtra theatre  its music its social place and all that  here one particular element interested me is this  you speak prose you get angry and then you sing a song  the same substance is carried the same object is carried through two different mediums  in dance you do foot work you sing you gesturise  and so many things  this put me into the problem  what can each do ? what can prose do ? what can music do ? what can dance do ? and what can they not do ? therefore for a quite a number of years i experimented in pure prose plays pure mime plays pure musicals pure folk musicals and so on  with this element i began to tackle the yakshagana theatre as such  for i felt it was very very rich in music  in the sense the words that they speak out in music is so rich and totally relevated relevant  to the subject matter  what does not appeal to me is the cleverness of the display of a  raga or a tala or any technical element  just as grammar is not literature so technique is not art technique is meant for a purpose  you use it for giving it a shape to your emotions  here what are the emotions in yakshgana ? what are the topics ? when it comes to the question of tapic topic   you know we are taking mahabharata plays we are not concerned with karna or kaurava or or any  rakshasa any saint  we are common people our experience for  so naturally you have to imagine these characters from how do they think  so how do you dress them ? do you bring them in your modern day suit or something else ? in that way yakshagana had one of the very richest element from nineteen thirty onwards  and many european scholars come and see the costume and make up  of yakshagana  it was so interesting  even in those days there were old people who could give  show any rakshasa chara   character in a different type and valourous character in a different type and common people in common dress  this was the element that attracted them that attracted me too  on the stage  but at the same time i felt so many things jarring  there are the female characters  say in a play satyabhama and rukmini come or  panchvati play the seeta comes  seeta comes in an ordinary dress along with rama coming in a different old time costume  this disharmony again disturbed me  it is not only that there were so many other questions raised we have got musical instruments  there is the drum there is the bhagwat and there is the dance  bhagwat is there narrating the story in so many ragas  and beautifully written songs  but sitting down on the stage can you make sense out  of even one word that he sings  he shouts he screeches and to outwit him there is the himmela  the himmela in most of our dancers are mummela they dictate terms to a dancer they do not follow him  so naturally what happens is you don't even hear a single word of the bhagwat  you hea hear him screeching  and you hear the drum play and all these things  this irrelevence with enough material of our own enough  ragas enough instruments enough judgement what is wrong with us ? we have begun to admire technique cleverness for its sake  shrieking for its sake the drum beating for its sake not for application of these things to give one word i want you want me to talk why ? to show that i am clever in talking that i can use bombastic words  or to show that i have something to say about the proposed subject yakshagana  that means reference of the content the form is every thing in art  by itself things may be beautiful but you are using certain things to project to communicate a story of the mahabharata  and all these things  naturally when we take these things when you come on the stage with uh a monstrous character a ravana and other characters and if you bring in seeta in ordinary dress i should feel that he has stolen the  girl from the audience there and she doesn't form ? similarly in costume  in old costume they strict some great man created the rakshasa costumes and these so many beautiful things in terms of colour in terms of painting some clever fellow did it  there is a harmony between what colours they have chosen  it doesn't the belong to the type of uh thinking as in kerala the satvik rajsik and tamsik forms colour harmony is a different element combination of light elements pigment elements and  on that basis they have done super work so far as many characters are concerned  but no costume no ornament for the lady character  the lady character brings the is brought   to be coquettish and woo the audience  she may be the seeta in talk and these things you are the men audiences to be wooed by shiny or very cinema like fans on the screen so they begin to come with the most beautiful gaudy  with make-up powder lipsticks and any silk now today you have got glaring dresses of any sort you begin to wear it  in kathakali we've got a fine breast plate you have got a heap of beads on it  why do you want the breast plate ? that means you have lost the eye for judging ornaments and colour harmony in costume itself in dress one word  our yakshagana dresses i have got certain things like this over  a grey or red jacket one is complementary to the other in terms of colour harmony  then you put garlands you put beads and glass tubes and then if somebody presents a a jasmine you put that also more the merrier  absolutely there is no sense of the stage colour harmony a stage is a painting where characters have to stand in respective places  each man has to balance somebody else forward backward in terms of colour in terms of form in terms of emotion  suppose you have got the pandavas sculptured out by a a great chola artist how would he make them stand one another not figures like this not presenting the characters in a form that all the forms blend together  an artist like rodan in building the hell gates of paradise  brings in a hundred forms one is harmonious to the other so the stage has to be conceived in terms of people who is there i drive away the musician there  i don't want the musicians behind to distort the shape of the beautiful characters  they may be very important but their music could be heard  so these are the elements form and content in terms of music and these things  one big thing came to me is you take the raga  and the tala elements your beat you are very perfect you are great artist in training you never go wrong  but do you sing the same thing ? i remember one day a play like a a gypsy comes and asks seeta did you see ravana ? no i have not seen him i might have seen his leg  alright draw a picture of the leg  then she completes and makes it a ravana and rama comes he says you are still unfaithful you are still dreaming of ravana  then the punishment  summary is laxman take her and chop her head off  she is taken most pathetic situation the drum beating chandi is as if you are taking a number of sheep to the kali temple  this is what happens in every thing  in every classical form you see thai thak thai thai thak thai thai thak thai and the song is shringara  is it shringara ? it is terrific shringara then  this is what made me think how to sing ? how to dance ? this is the step work maybe same tala  she is in a sorrow position wailing all through how does she present herself  we confine tala rhythm to the leg  emotion is a body element there is the child that can get angry joyful every element of the body is seen  leg and tala is not confined to the legs alone  to every moment of the rhythm  the whole body has to respond to an emotion  so in a greater sense you mean to say what is more effective on the stage in terms of voice in terms of so many things  is there no individuality ? have you to repeat it ? then there are so many things on the stage which we think of  where emotions are strife  all yakshagana plays are epical plays mahabharata  plays or conflicts of emotion  they can give you a full range of things on the stage if you want to do it if you want to feel it  but how would you do it ? our guru taught us like this to hold the hands and go like that  the guru seems to be a ghost for chasing people and artists to the length of her entire transformation of souls  you are there to feel as an actor evoke what best is there what best do you give ? now i take it a question that is posed to yakshagana  and our music also  our music is in yakshagana  may be classical music  why do you sing ? does it contain words ? for what was it created ? what are the words ? the words say something your tala says something your raga says that you are very clever you can sing for half an hour or even one hour a raga  but what is the word that you say ? this is everything i can uh there is a hindustani song  who is as great as rama  the word is aiso koudara jagamai in the whole world  there is none to beat rama  why ? because whatever greatness blessing they wanted to know these people for years together prayed rama  without praising anything doing anything he blessed the  vaccha jatayu he blessed the kubja  so there is none like rama  if i say the word aiso koudar jagamaai in the whole world koudar it's acclamation in sound  jagamaai  why ?  vinuseva jodravaidinapara vinuseva jodravaidinapara ramasarisakonahi koudar  every good composition was a reflection of a thought from a saint or somebody else  similarly yakshagana songs or every song is a reflection of an emotion  how do you mouth it ? yakshagana is very heroic  i thump the beat and i show that i am very rigorous  are you heroic even in death even in pathos ? means even if before your child dies there  it should make sense  in which case yakshagana is an element  i think to me it is greater than classical element  for this one thing classical music was written by savants  who were mostly saints mostly saints  they were reclusers  they were sorry for the birth of man they were sorry for any anything everything   so they used to either sing the praise of the lord or say o lord why did you bring me to earth  but a drama contains ever so many other emotions joy valour jealousy and all these things it must lend them  it is there  i can i end end end my short talk by giving one note of the yakshagana song  in the battle after the third battle third day duryodhana begins to weep  we have lost all rounds o dronacharya where is the hope for us  there is no hope  because the great demon killer krishana is  arjuna's charioteer  the man whom i had trusted vidura has given away and gone away the great commander my grandfather bheeshma is lying on a bed of arrows  what shall i do ? now i will give you the kannada word yena madali nanu  ? what shall i do ? for what purpose ? to defeat the pandavas pandavara solipade  why ?  danava takanavanu avage sarathiya agianu  the great demon killer krishna is a charioteer for arjuna then my friend vidura broke his bow went away then bheeshma is lying there almost dead  what shall i do ? this mood for an actor can come in ten different ways  it depends upon his liking of somebody else his hatred or jealous his despondency his sorrow for this sake yena madali nanu pandavara solipade yena madali nanu pandavara solipade yena madali nanu pandavara solipade danavantak-navage sarathiya agianu  ten different moods can be depicted do you beat your drum to suit the mood or anything  so we can build up a great art even today we have got enough material from the past why our tradition to be preserved is though we have not used it sensibly we have enough materials  in music we have a thousand ragas  how many emotions have i given expression to  sometimes we are perverse we are praying vinayak in what manner ?  vatapi ganapatim bhajihum va  you are clapping ganapati it is a praise  this perversion why does it happen ? you are a votary of grammar thinking grammar is art  grammar is that art  it is this way we can do a lot and a lot can be done to preserve or show the greatness of our own art  showing by our skill about art is totally different  you can admire me you can admire anybody  but show the potentiality of the indian art how it relates to the expression of the human urge in ways of art i think i have bored you enough
