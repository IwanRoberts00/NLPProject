kashyap and the governor  who are now in the process of being introduced to the players of chandigarh  i think chandigarh has it's rare honour today of having the national once again after almost fifteen years  last national not fifteen years it's about eleven years  the last national played was here in nineteen eighty-three in which we had vasudevan winning the mens' title and i won the womens' title here in nineteen eighty-three  so it's a great day for me to be here after winning the last national being played in chandigarh to come here and commentate today on this mens' and the womens' singles the court these are the ball boys the ball girls  having a talk with the governor  they are the trainees of c l t a as i've been corrected by my fellow commentator  i have to introduce mr mayan kapoor who's also an asian former tennis champion junior champion whom i have with me doing the hindi commentary  and that's the governor going back after meeting  all the players the students the ball boys and there we have the applause by everyone  green grass awaits the match though nationals is now  come of an age where we don't have very huge crowds watching the nationals probably because we don't have the a t t points and we do not  the boys here are the students who are the who've  come to watch the match  the huge stadium in sector ten in chandigarh  the students seem to be very keen on this sunny morning  i think probably the school has given them the day off to come and watch the match  there the hills behind i think chandigarh by and large is a beautiful city  beautiful city with lovely weather  and soon they have started and they've taken lawn tennis in a very big way as they made several grasscourts at the chandigarh club  and now we have the players stepping on to the court  mahesh bhupathy yesterday defeated nitin kar  kirtane  he was extended and he had won the match in three sets  and asif ismail beat k g ramesh in straight sets  asif ismail seems to be in a fitter condition because he just played in the davis cup match and showed great promise in jaipur  but he gave away under pressure  at the last minute he showed a lot of talent but he could not carry it on till the end  let us see how he fares in the match today  the players are now warming up and uh that asif ismail   that's mahesh bhupaty now  mahesh bhupathy on your screen now interruption much thinner than interruption  players are now getting ready for the match  we have uh from the commentators box we have asif ismail uh  asif ismail serving to mahesh bhupathy  first serve  uhm just missed the line  oh that was an easy shot but missed by bhupathy  serving down the middle and the backhand uh of uh bhupathy and bhupathy i think got the ball right in his stomach  fifteen love  again score now is thirty love  first game first serve applaud  a lovely shot  asif ne abhi drop volley try ki lekin  drop volley was a little too far back and it was very easy for bhupathy to reach the ball  there we have the action replay  you can see the crosscourt it just touched the net cord  beautiful shot there by bhupathy  thirty fifteen  oh there was foul there  let them i think both are uh at the moment in the beginning not very well warmed up and from thirty love up  asif is thirty o  first first service  not a double four there by asif i think he should so early in the game he has had first game only two double fours  that was a great point for bhupathy however  service was a little too good for him  asif is not serving that well yet   he's capable of much better service  much much slower he's serving today that's  deuce  that was a well played point  after sent it went right upto th net that's what he should be doing after his service   haan service  and that's advantage point foul for service  i think abhi tak koi accha point one has not seen except one crosscourt forehand that's the replay  in hindi he's not showing  advantage again to asif  there he's taken the first game asif by a good  service down the line from the backhand court  and that's one love asif ismail's first game  inspite of three double faults asif has been able to foiled this game that shows that uh bhupathy has not really fought into this game  and uh we are finding asif looking back because what's  not on the screen is that the governor is leaving  and we have the replay of the point  service which is down the line and asif is still watching  the governor and everyone leaving  now we have the second game of the match   we're going to watch bhupathy serving to asif ismail i was just having a talk with the administrator of chandigarh  the advisor to the administrator and i was given to be   given to understand that c l t a the tennis complex is located in about three hundred acre green park  and there we have uh bhupathy serving his first serve  foul that's right  oh asif is trying for that four hand down the line but i guess he was standing up too straight for that shot  he needed to bend down because the net is usually a little bit higher on the sides  one needs to get down lower on ones' knees   that's fifteen love to bhupathy  fourth first service   that's a good variation in service from bhupathy a kind of a spin but however well vanished by asif ismail  we have that lovely passing shot  makes it fifteen all two three  we don't find much of excitement nobody is out there to try to break service  thirty fifteen fourth first service  that was a service return a bit too higher by asif ismail making it very easy for bhupathy to put that volley away   it's very important in these points in return of service to keep the ball low  and that game point came to bhupathy an easy service game there at forty fifteen  which makes it three games all first set  we find the usual crowd is also very quite  players are also lacking the enthusiasm  i think this game has uh still to heat up  oh  what ? fifteen love   there's that replay of the shot   there's a just a little bit out i thought and  there's a disagreement on that point  the linesman is just sitting quietly and that's  bhupathy arguing that that ball was right but i think there's not true really  simply it's a long argument there  fifteen love  oh ho that was a nice return there  i think uh asif ismail a little too early there that he play  is that put away very decisively but too close was bhupathy and he got that return  fifteen o  got first service cough  oh that was a lovely put away there  besides his forehand crosscourt volley by asif ismail   there's that top spin service an easy volley  because the ball was so high  i think the boys have to look forward to making their return of service much better  thirty fifteen asif  first first service   it's a very good shot return  wonderful passing shot there by asif ismail that was i think the longest rally in the match today   there's that action replay he had to run back to get  that log and there he's extended to the other end of the court and here we see the final passing shot the beautiful backhand down drive by asif ismail  so asif serving forty fifteen on his service first first service  oh ho there quick return there by bhupathy taking asif  into an unforge terrain   there's the replay again   he's rushing into the court and he's just caught on unaware this hits in the middle of the body line shot  still in its point to go for the game for asif ismail  all first service  beautiful shot return there by bhupathy a wonderful forehand down the line passing shot on asif service which makes it deuce now for the players  a chance there that wonderful shot once again you can see how well he converted his back hand and he went quickly before  asif could reach the leg   it's deuce  oh ho that was lucky that was really lucky high backhand volley there's that service and that's the high  backhand volley just touch the tip of the net and dropped off there   let's call a lucky shot at the right time  advantage asif ismail  oh he didn't really concentrate on that one it was not that difficult a shot  that was a lovely service a very good backhand volley crosscourt returned by mahesh bhupathy  and watch that service on the corner and he's right up at the net that's the game  oh beautiful shot there by asif ismail a wonderful backhand crosscourt return   he's right up at the ball  there is look at that stretching backhand volley and that  at the one word  fifteen fifteen thirty   bhupathy's service  uh just missed that was a lovely try by asif ismail going out for one of his big backhand crosscourt return to service but he just missed the line and that gives a chance to bhupathy to equalise the points at thirty all  first first service  oh lovely offensive lot there a beautiful shot touch of mastery there by asif ismail  that was a there's the replay and you could see the stretched backhand volley return and that's  the defensive lot   that's the break point for asif asif ismail the first break point in the match  oh a double fall there gives asif ismail the much needed break at the right time coming also which gives him a five three lead   that's asif ismail forty love the second game of second set  oops that was a unforge terror there  lucky shot  but he's got a good lead there that's the shot we're showing you again on screen and he's trying to drop volley but unsuccessful  the boys are running there on the court so asif chooses not to start his service  these students have to be asked to sit down  the screen is not showing it but the players are being disturbed because the children are moving at stadium  to come back on court childern have now by and large settled down   that's how asif regaining forty fifteen up  and love one for his second set  oops try to block that volley asif ismail but i think he did not put his racket down just let flat straight out  still in the lead asif ismail serving forty thirty  all first service  beautiful crosscourt backhand by mahesh bhupathy at the right time also   there's that wonderful crosscourt backhand  return of service which makes a deuce  all first service i think us break  ke baad he's lost his concentration  second service double faults so forty love there's  an advantage now  i think this uh taking this game too easy is could provide to be very risky for asif ismail   there's a break point now for the second time   that's it there is the break  there is the break which needed which bhupathy was looking for  mahesh up two love  forty love he was leading and there there he lost his concentration  first first service   it's a very weak return of service there  fifteen love second service  just a minute just about asif ismail is hardly showing any the serve in the game  in hindi  at the wrong time in hindi if continues to do this any further he's already one game down his service is lost  he can't afford to take it uh easy  beautiful service there  oh lovely passing shot there down the line by asif ismail that shows he's a man capable of class  thirty fifteen  a good service there in backhand pass corner of asif ismail  and bhupathy is with the safe lead over in third game  the move is set it's going to be difficult for asif ismail now  next second service  oop facing the sun bhupathy trying to give a smash  there was a miss hit there  bhupathy still in the lead with forty thirty on his service a decisive volley there gives him three love leads  i think this uh set is going to be little difficult might   there's the return of service you can see this defensive backhand crosscourt volley bhupathy showed a lot of consistency in this game which which a player even tries to bring up his game  at a certain depth  but now he should so that's love five asif ismail serving  a beautiful service down the forehand corner by asif ismail  down the line winner there making it fifteen all  his service lacked depth which is very easy to go for the down line  thirty all no fifteen all there and i think the students are moving again and disturbing asif ismail  good service but i don't find bhupathy at all stretching  himself  this was an easy ball he could have stretched himself and tried for a winner   he's standing there not even trying to move his left leg to move movements are so slow that's an out  thirty all
