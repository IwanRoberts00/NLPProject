the teaching of english in the schools  is extremely faulty
""
""
""
true 
""
""
so can you identify the areas  where basically the problem
lies with students of english in the schools  ?
""
""
in  in the area of pronunciation sir  i have 
""
""
uh  is okay
""
""
laid down on many problems  that uh  one is that 
they don't maintain the length of the vowels  and they  shift 
there is a phonemic alternation 
""
in place of one vowel  they use  uh the other vowel 
""
like uh  in uh  while saying the word zero  some of my
students say jero 
""
some will say zero  but the others will say  jero 
""
so there is phonemic alternation 
""
some will say  amit  but some will say omit  some will
say oomit 
""
some will say  for example  obedience  obedience  some
will say abedience  obedience 
""
so  faulty pronunciation i feel  it  it travels into
their uh  uhm their whole career 
""
and uh  from the very beginning we have got a faulty
pronunciation 
""
""
ah now look at one thing  my problem  basically with
teacher of english is  not so much phonemic 
""
i have  a  very serious  doubt about  the grammar
 the lack of    really  grammar which the students have
""
for instance  even at the m phil level   i've  come
across cases of students mixing up the tenses  in the same sentence
""
i mean  the present   tense past tense and in one case
 i discovered all the three tenses used in a long sentence 
""
and i said you have left out nothing  absolutely 
""
so    that's   one problem 
""
and i think  much greater attention needs to be paid towards
 grounding 
""
i am not talking of   i mean the traditional grammar but
atleast   the modern approaches to grammar should atleast be given to
the students 
""
and what i find is  probably this is a deficiency  which
later on becomes incurable 
""
because what you are trying   doing   to do  
is  what you do at the the school level  and what is going to be
confirmed at the undergraduate level  is what will survive eventually at
the postgraduate level  you see 
""
""
 really  
""
""
 they use present and past and  
""
""
 even  
""
""
 basics of basics of english language is  
""
""
sir   don't you think they 
""
""
 so that is the   structure 
""
""
don't you think this deficiency lies some  to some extent
 uh with the teachers 
""
""
exactly
""
""
they cannot   impart uh the good in a  pro  
""
""
 exactly exactly that of course   is one part of it
""
""
that i mean  it's  like the blind leading the blind in many
cases i mean 
""
the students  themse  the teachers themselves are not aware
 of the rules of grammar  they are themselves violating   and
 naturally that is the violation they are passing on to the students
""
for instance  i came across some books  i mean  written
for students i mean  grammar i mean  general english for students of b
a one and b a two  by a  group of professors of various colleges three
four of them joining hands writing 
""
and i discovered  the essays which were written one is
ungrammatical english 
""
and i marked out certain portions  in which there were howlers i
mean and i said if this is the essay the student is going to read  and in
many cases commit to memory  what sort of english is the student
eventually going to learn from there   cough 
""
 i'll  give just one example 
""
i forget which one are they but because some teachers gave  and
gave me  those copies i mean complimentary copies
""
and i said  one word  let me glance through it  said
 aap ki bacchi bhi padthi hai  so but my daughter was in  b
a two or three at that time  so she will be of in need of some of them 
""
so we are leaving these copies
""
alright but let me go through them and let me see are they in the
right sort of english
""
and i discovered and i infact told one of them   sir you
are an m phil  and is this the sort of english you   your 
yourself writing 
""
what better english will the students write if this is the sort of
 ungrammatical english you are writing  
""
so this is the basic fault
""
i find  two basic problems with students  who come to my
department for instance one is  the grammar  lack of grammar
""
the second is  lack of  i mean what i would say vocabulary
""
""
vocabulary is sometime so deficient  that if i try to convey
something  i have to look through these basic english virtually at time
  cough 
""
is that your michael west i made use of    yes  at two
different stages 
""
one when i was editing a play of shakespeare  for students 
""
secondly when i was teaching at a place  which is in a very 
backward area of punjab  bhatinda 
""
so there people told me that here  in english people are very
very deficient and they use a hindi terms for it   angrezi mei
haath bada tang hai 
""
""
 yeah  
""
""
 yes  
""
""
 haan haan 
""
""
so  i mean i said
""
""
typical   punjabi 
""
""
 ah yes   yes 
""
and they said saxena  saab   you'll  have to
teach english for a change in hindi and punjabi 
""
i said at the  master's  level  you expect uh  there
is no help for it you will find it impossible  to convey anything to them
""
""
i said  don't worry  i will not come down to hindi or
punjabi 
""
 i'll  teach them in english  of course  i'll 
have to be very careful in the choice of words  that i am going to use
 
""
and that was the second time i made use of the service list of
michael west 
""
and what i did is  gradually  i would introduce everyday 
of course   it   it   involved lot of labour  seven
or eight new words 
""
and that was also  graded  i mean  these are the words
 i'm  introducing today these are words i am introducing tomorrow 
""
and my effort was  an  every month  it should be around
two hundred words i should be able to increase in their vocabulary 
""
and i discovered  their vocabulary was almost doubled by the
time  they completed the first session i did it  you see 
""
and naturally they would understand english better 
""
so what i find is that these are the two basic deficiencies 
""
phonetics  is  yes it is deficiency 
""
but phonetics does not pose such a major problem
""
you know why  ?  cough 
""
because perhaps you have read also that there is now  a
consensus i mean atleast  that english can be pronounced  slightly
differently in different parts of the world i mean 
""
i mean australians   pronounced it differently  
canadian   pronounce  it differently  america pronounce it
differently 
""
english that is to say the  queen's  or the  king's 
english  is differently pronounced 
""
but then even in england  there is variation in pronunciation
""
""
 it is being  
""
""
 america  
""
""
regional variation 
""
""
regional variations that fairly wide regional variations i
mean  even in england 
""
so  that's  what i find
""
phonetics is important in  it's  own way  but  that's
 not the be all and end all of teaching of english mind you 
""
what is more significant for the students is teaching of elementary
rules of grammar 
""
and what i find is  there is a very small book i came across
published by  times london   at  two words 
""
""
the name of that book is in fact  that's  a series of books
maybe pushpinder i  sho sho  showed you those books i mean 
 a grammar in sixty minutes    that's  the
title of that book i mean  grammar in sixty minutes 
""
we have one or two such titles in our department i think they got
them from there 
""
now  maybe not in sixty minutes  but that book of grammar
which gives the essential rules of grammar  can be  inculcated in the
students in about a  month's  time 
""
and even that would be in a series 
""
so  that's  what i found out
""
""
yes
""
""
i don't know whether you came across that book 
""
but i keep on hunting for it  not at my  i am basically not
concerned with teaching of language 
""
but i am concerned  of course with correctness of language 
""
so  it's  in that context i  hunted out those books in
delhi 
""
maybe it could be some information for you also 
""
""
 laughs 
""
""
so  it's  something about the  vocabulary why don't
you elaborate  ?
""
means as far as   your student  is concerned or your
teachers are concerned  ?
""
""
 sir  two words   
""
""
vocabulary true  it's   it lacks  people lack
vocabulary 
""
and uh  sometimes even students they know  the answer
sometimes  but they don't find words  to express themselves 
""
and uh  of course teachers help them and    we are
   even   even   if
""
""
  word in hindi   
""
""
he he talks about dictionary 
""
""
yeah 
""
""
 that's  uh 
""
""
the dictionary habit
""
""
 one word 
""
""
and that is what students seriously lack  i tell you
""
""
for vocabulary
""
""
they have to be made to look up the dictionary  and that
should be the habit  with i mean i  one word  that   my
student 
""
""
 every child   should have
""
""
if you are ten percent   doubt consult  the
dictionary 
""
don't presume this is the meaning  because what you presume is
 it's  normally wrong
""
""
  one word  dictionary with him  
""
""
normally wrong 
""
""
go to a dictionary  and what i normally tell the students
is  have a big dictionary  on your desk
""
a desk dictionary whether it is c o d  or whether  you've
 chambers  depends on  whether you know phonetics or you don't know
phonetics one of these two 
""
but keep a small dictionary always in your pocket  in the case
of girls they can in their 
""
""
yeah   purse 
""
""
 i mean   purses i mean  a small one whether it
is little oxford dictionary    yeah  or   collin's  gem
dictionary because  the problem with students many times is  they are
lazy
""
they would not like to  go from one place to the other to lift
the dictionary 
""
that is the hassel they won't like   to  do 
""
if it is   right in their pocket then perhaps they will
bring it out 
""
""
 yeah  
""
""
 yeah  
""
""
 but   if they have   if they have  
it in their bags they will   just take it   out and find 
""
""
 yes it will become   easier for them to consult
at time 
""
 that's  what i have been telling my students   again
and again 
""
""
 i always encourage   them to  bring
dictionaries  cough  everyday 
""
""
another book
""
""
and uh 
""
""
which i would mention and i  may be  it's  of some
use to you  that is   elements of style   by
strung and white 
""
have you seen it  ?
""
we have six copies in our   departmental   department
  in the main library
""
and i find  it has hardly been issued  for so many years
""
""
you see   that's  of course an older edition
""
i have a new edition revised edition  because the original was
written by professor strung  it has been revised by e d white 
""
you see  that's  not in paper back also 
""
but paper back is also quite costly 
""
but what i suggest is  atleast the teachers  who are
interested  can consult them     elements of style
 
""
""
  elements of style   
""
""
you know why  because  fowler  is  formidable in
 it's  length 
""
not everybody likes to consult or read it 
""
but that  element of style  is just
ninety-eight pages 
""
i mean  not very difficult to simplify it 
""
and i find  i gave it some of my m phil students  who had
problems with usage and all that  and they said it has been useful 
""
and interestingly i discovered pushpinder  i was reading a
column in  this uh   times of india sunday   and
it there was an article by nissim ezekiel who said he was using this  very
book  for his m a students   elements of style  i
mean   that's  what happened   before  this nissim
retired last year from  uh that bombay university  so it is very good
for his students 
""
""
 yeah  
""
""
  a   by   just a matter of chance i
discovered in that article that i mean the same thing i have been using also
 for my students 
""
""
i think you tell the professor about your  plans for
further work or 
""
""
yeah 
""
""
about your teaching 
""
teaching is more or less over you can talk of  what are your
plans for further  work  research if you are doing  or publishing or
anything else 
""
""
sir  i'll  think of publishing it  and revise it
 and uh put in  all your suggestions  that quantitative analysis of
the data  i'll  take up  and  i'll   get it published
""
""
""
you know the problem is  many students in fact i would
say majority of students  once they have got their ph d  i mean and
they think well
""
""
they go and sleep   laughs 
""
""
we have reached the destination   laughs  nothing
more is i mean we have got our degree
""
we can write doctor with our name and  that's  the end of
it
""
it happened with one of my scholar though 
""
it was my first research  one word  he was a school teacher
also 
""
when he came  i said  what exactly is your provocation
for registering for the ph d   i said  do you think you
stand to get anything by getting a ph d in english  
""
he gave a very curious reply to me 
""
he said  sir  when my daughter gets married  i want
to issue the card which carries my name as doctor    laughter
 the reason for it  haan
