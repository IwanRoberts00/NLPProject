hello chandrakala how are you  fine  and how are you you seem to be quite lethargic  oh it is because uh one of our friends here invited me for this uh lunch you know  uh i had a puran poli and perhaps it has its effect laughs  and that's why  yeah  and i think uh that's a favourite dish or  if they invite any guests or anyone the these are few things that they serve   it's puran poli or jilabi  or gulab jamun that oh for eating they are a very tasty but uh sometimes no they will affects affert our health  yeah that's true  no don't you think that uh uh about this food and food habits and all that's these differs differ    now but we are saying you are not used to puran poli  maybe that's why you are feeling that is very heavy and lethargic  but these food habits they differ from country to country yeah generation to generation state to state family even the individual each individual   it depends it depends of on  one's likings and dislikings that is also there and it may be due to climate also yeah and you are not used to all this food yeah maybe that's why you are feeling lethargic  and what else do you think about the food habits over here  here usually what happens no in your area most of the people they will have that jowar uhm  for their food  and uh in bangalore or mysore they will have rice  as a plain food  uhm   yeah  yeah that's true  haan  in north and west all these northerners westerners  they prefer wheat  then from the north or people who will belong to east for example calcutta and all they prefer they like to have  rice yes   that's the staple diet there uhm  but now don't you feel that uh previously it so happened  that those who belong to east or south east they used to prefer rice  those who belong to north and west all mostly they prefer wheat but now people are coming from all walks of life from all states of life due to studies maybe or you can say for their business  or service  and now all are familiar with all types of food yeah they are  and gradually they will be accustomed to that kind of food  when one will begin to live in that particular area   automatically they will be accustomed to that   yeah  but one difference what i find is that in this generation maybe it is the influence of the t v as the mass media  this young generation the young persons they are so used to this or may be they don't have so much time at their disposal now  they want readymade food so they go for junk food  haan  oh readymade the fast food  haan  the canned food all that don't you think so  yes it is there but uh directly they will be affected by  haan that's there the other one as we indians feel that they are three types isn't it  haan   satvik rajsik and tamsik  uhm but uh and what we feel that satvik food that is the best ah see here no in uh karmungra there is one word  yeah  and uh that uh the one word has given the opinions about uh the persons uh above eighty years old uhm uhm  and uh really if we read it no uh i feel that vegetarian food and uh that satvik what you called  satvik food no that will be very good to health  that's  and this is the secret of their health uh in the  opinion of many persons like that  ah ha  yeah actually as a matter of fact we should say that  some people eat to live some live to eat laughs no even we go for that  then as a matter of fact uh what i feel is that sprouted  or fibrous nutrious salad and fresh food is a must for good health  what i feel is that food and food habit do affect our mind  thought yeah  actions  uh our physique everything  because just see when we eat uh this person have said  who eat very hot or spicy food uhn they will be short tempered very one word  uhn they depend one word in sense yeah  there is an assumption  and what i feel the food that we eat that affects our physique also  because uh one can get if you eat very hot this all this fried things and all one is you put on weight  haan  another thing the cholestrol level also goes up  so there is possibility of heart attack one word  then those who have blood pressures and gasterol uhm  eat less of uh sugar uh sorry salt those who are diabetes they are told to eat less sugar  so all these people they are so habituated it's very difficult but uh  but what i feel no uh we people will begin to think up all these effects only when uh we will be suffering from  some disease and all but uh  suffering yeah  but prevention is better than cure yeah that is there but uh most of the people no they will eat what they like even it is not good for health uhm uhm they will not care about the least bothered about but when doctor suggested something then will go on  taking some precaution precautions  actually as a matter of fact the best thing is to have a balanced diet laughs  and what i feel is again about food habit like this  talking food food habits enough yeah laughs still though  what you feel i'm used to all types of food  but still there is a difference one word food of diferent states  for example if you go to calcutta  now in calcutta what you find the accent the intonation the articulation the food the food habits it's something quite differnt from south  there what you find is instead of saying amar they'll  say amor  instead of saying wa they say ba for example for shivani they will shibani  ravindranath they will say rabindranath like that  about the eating habit also they prefer the cheese uhn cheese fish all that flavour  then for rajasthan again i would like to tell that  as i belong to bikaner i would like to say that there we don't have fresh vegetables and one word  so mostly we used to have that samari churmur daal batti gatta papad all these things ghee bhat  a few words  which food   one word i think i presume you are coming from karnatak yeah  let us know something  uh you know in karnataka no usually people will prefer that roti what we'll call roti  it's prepared of jowar and  chapati rarely once in a week they will do it  then rice curry uhm uhm and they prefer more buttermilk milk ghee  not so much butter but they like ghee  uhm in hot rice they like it  uh  in uh mysore no they will prefer idli dosa  then rice uhm  perhaps they can live months together without bread  but we people here no uhm in belgaum district one of two words we can't live without bread   uhm  i must confess though i don't belong to south but still i too am fond of idli dosa laughs  i must say it's very uh it is easy easy to digest these things  then what we have in one word and eat something else for food  but i feel that uh ro roti  prepared out of jowar no and rice it is better than  idli and dosa a day  it will be it will be affecting our health i feel irrespective of all these things some one word  is there  whatever we eat whatever the food or food habits are we should try to develop such habits uh for example what they are  the fresh  uhn ones a balanced diet and extra good one salad one word  it should be nutrious whatever it is  but don't you think that uh our ances our own people no our elders uh they used to use turmeric or spices uhn but uh even for using spices there must be some reason it it had na that it has did have two words besides having some taste it did add to the taste and colour of the food  but it had medicinal medicinal powers also  for example turmeric uhm a very good anticeptic or asofoetida that also helps to have stomach one word  then garlic   haan garlic is there these things too but the colours that we uh we use in uh preparations no it is very injurious to health but inspite of all that we use it  uhn permitted colours laughs  yeah one word so they are  and i think whatever the food that we eat it depends on the like the place where we're staying  the state also where it all these things grow  wherever paddy grows obviously people will have yeah  no   yeah  then about the timings also i would like to say  about these habits like in every family what you find is they have a different schedule   uhn  obviously  so it's better you know in evening one word  if you eat early  in the morning also you should try to eat earlier in the night also if you eat and whatever you eat at night that should be quite light uhn  not very heavy  now many people they are used to accustomed to eat very heavy food at night  that also affects the digestion   it's better to have light food at night and uh  everyday in the morning that's very important yes sound health is essential to have sound mind no uhm  then after all what are your food habits firstly by the way doing a lecture in a two words the college timing laughs  in the morning i go just with glass of milk  uhn or even a bit of bournvita and snacks or so  and what we have is tikla prepared of  wheat  as a matter of fact a sort of biscuit but it's  shallow fried  then i i come at eleven o'clock that depends on the classes laughs  when i return i have my lunch  now lunch comprises of what our habit is or you know say a personal one word in our family  we have rice daal chapati curry  little bit of one word one word all this a few words and all   uhn  oh god  pickles sometimes that one word laughs  though especially i shouldn't eat  uhm then again in the evening we have tea or coffee one word  then at night also we have a light uh dinner same as lunch  and another thing that people avoid is it's very  it's said that an apple a day keeps the doctor away laughter   but what we do many times instead of taking an apple we if we tell our children uhn they are ready to have cadbury  which spoils their teeth also uhn and not for food but  fruit should be one of the most important uh the important uh food instead of one word that is what i feel everyone everyday in any form may be juice or  cutted cut pieces or best thing is to take apple  as it is without cutting it that is what and fruits also you have in different place  different fruits that you have  but instead of that many people they try instead of milk they would like to have ice-cream laughter  but you see they don't feel what the effects after effects or adverse effects they they have  so what do you think what are the fruits that are grown two words   uhn   uhn  we have banana uhm and i i like it very much daily i use the   uhm  another thing what i found find is there are few things which are common whether you go to east west north south  and one word for you all use dal  of course pulses cereals everybody uses curry everybody uses  vegetable salad everybody uses  then in some form or the other milk is used and this food  curd either they put curd or buttermilk at the end  so i think that also helps in digestion   that's a good habit  what do you think  yes that is true  i too use milk in our area also people prefer buttermilk  more than milk uhm i mean the curd and as i told you ghee  but it should not be used too much but inspite of that uh it is one's  liking they will use it laughs  and as far as myself i will have cup of tea in the morning uhm then at nine thirty i will have some light tiffin at one  o'clock uhm i'll have my lunch  and usually i prefer green vegetables bread then buttermilk  then in the evening rice only   uhm   one word  uhn in the in the evening that is at uh in the evening so after eight thirty or nine  everyday i will have rice then curry then uh   one word when i go to sleep i will have a glass of milk  laughs  what i what i think is that these food habits should be developed from the time when the children are very young then one word all the people in the house should be  one word it  instead of getting them biscuits or chocolates or juice  we should try to give them fruits one word or uh  vegetable salad  so if we develop that taste from the very beginning obviously  they will continue through out their life and they can have good health physical health but but now a days what is happening no children  even children are found of parag two words and all these things one word really it will spoil their health  and inspite of that the child as soon as it gets up from the bed no it uh demands for tea only yeah and we can leave without food but uh first we must have a tea so i really feel it will kill our hunger  ahn that's true  and in the morning also one thing is that that's uh  children they have that habit of taking something  but before that without brushing and all then they go laughter  and if uh they eat anything that is sweet  ah as i told a few words anything  so after that atleast once they get up and before going to sleep one should brush the teeth atleast yeah
