""
i will take  exactly ten minutes of yours  to brief you
 about our institution 
""
many people may not know  the background  under which this
institution was born 
""
i don't want  to boast about myself  but some of my friends
for example now  my good friend mr leherchand shah  he has been
associated with me indirectly for this school  right from the first day
 we decided to start this institution  and still  he has a soft
corner for the institution 
""
whenever  i request him to do something  he  goes out of
the way  and does it 
""
now he knows the background  and some of the  elder people
 of  the so called founder members of the institution  they are
knowing the background  of course 
""
in this particular instance we must remember  our late 
revered   parampujya   gopalacharya mouli  who was
the first person  to inaugurate this institution  and also blessed us
""
""
and  till his last  he had his blessings with us  and
even in his absence  our present   parampujya 
vidyasimhacharya  is at the back of the institution  invisibly  and
he has been blessing us all along 
""
now we  believe   god's  grace   elder's 
blessings  always lead  to success of  anything 
""
building an institution  starting your activities  social
work  commercial activities  anything  to do good  to humanity
 whether it is a medical aspect  or any kind of thing  or
religious aspect 
""
now this institution  when i migrated to mulund in nineteen
fifty-seven  beginning  or fifty-six end  there were some
enterprising  kannada speaking people  in dombivali thana  mulund
 and uh  neighbouring  suburbs 
""
they came to me  they just requested me  why not we start
some  karnataka sangha and continue some activities 
""
i said okay 
""
any cultural activity  and  naturally in those years 
before  nineteen fifty-six  dharwar belgaum bijapur karwar districts
were  the part of bombay state  and  many kannada speaking people
 in those  from  these  districts they  came and 
migrated to bombay  for education  for  their  building up
their career commercial activities  came and settled down 
""
they became one  with the masses  of the locality  and
they started  their own activities 
""
naturally  culture  and civilisation  and the tradition
 in india differs right from himalaya up to    ka   
 kanyakumari    slightly
""
though  we are all one  so far as the thinking is concerned
""
""
but  the traditions in areawise  languagewise  some
difference take place 
""
so some people said we should maintain our  tradition also 
though we have migrated from our  districts and   come  
came   and settled down here
""
now  we've  become a part of this place 
""
of course  i should say   i'm  here from nineteen
forty-five 
""
 i've  seen  the generation passing 
""
today  some of the grandchildren or great grandchildren of the
people who came fifty hundred years ago from karnataka  their children do
not know even kannada language 
""
but that doesn't mean  we are not here on a linguist aspect or
the communal aspect other thing
""
it is only to maintain  the culture and tradition 
""
each culture and tradition  has its own  history  has
its own good points  and therefore  we are only seeing  the good
points  of the culture and civilization  and not the bad points 
""
now for example  he is uh  speaking this language he is
speaking this language i must hate him
""
no not that way 
""
bombay is a cosmopolitan 
""
every language every caste every creed  it is a mini india 
""
and we are also a part of mini india  though originally we come
from some place  but we have to maintain our culture and tradition
""
we are trying to maintain 
""
for that purpose only i agreed we started 
""
but i used to see  in those days  there was only one
kannada school somewhere in  a corner of  sion  and matunga 
that too in  a  hutments  military barracks running 
""
and ultimately  this was shifted to wadala  and i used to
see  young boys  seven years eight years  going in the  
railway   train    all the way from ambarnath dombivali
kalyan and other thing etcetera or wadala   cough 
""
so i said look  if at all there is anything  it is
education 
""
with the education  we can bring up  our  people 
or  the society  which has come and settle down here  become a
part of bombay  they will definitely  be benefitted
""
so  why not we start uh  an education institution 
""
everybody appreciated 
""
then  we more or less  decreased  the cultural 
activities  of the karnataka sangha  and started  the 
vidya prasaraka mandala   and in those days we used to call it
mulund-thana  because  there were many people from mulund many people
from thana even dombivali everybody was coming 
""
so  it was  mulund-thana that was the name given and we
started 
""
in the initial stages  some devoted  few  workers 
they associated with the institution  and some of them were not still
born in the institution 
""
they were born a few years later 
""
now i can say kamath or joshi or uh  shastri 
""
they came and joined a little later 
""
then this institution  started  increasing the activities
""
""
we didn't have  any place 
""
so the first  one year  the institution started working 
at my premises where i was staying  in the balcony 
""
and there was one teacher  who sacrificed for couple of years
 one by name mrs setlur  she was a qualified teacher  and 
you'll  be surprised  i used to pay from my pocket fifteen 
rupees   per month to her  to conduct the kannada k g 
kannada first standard kannada second standard 
""
one teacher conducting all the schools 
""
and we had devoted workers  like one mr bharbare he was working
in the  a g's  office  now i do not know where he is 
""
and there was another mr malagi  these two people  had
sufficient time at their disposal being a government servants  not i want
to belittle  a  government servants 
""
but  when  you've  got your own shop  you have to go
right eight  o'clock  and open it and   keep   be 
 there whether the customers come or not 
""
but the government officer he can go at ten  o'clock  and
come back at five  o'clock   so long he completes the work 
""
but they were devoted workers 
""
they used to go door to door where kannada people are staying 
and request them  please  send your child to our school 
""
that some of the parents were uneducated they were not able to send
""
""
somehow convincing forcibly they used to bring  they were 
they were these two were  the boys who were  todays  aaya
 who bring the school children to the school and take them back home
 that kind of activity they have done 
""
i mean that was the kind of  attachment devotions  for the
work they had 
""
and this way the school went on 
""
then  in mulund  in those days the population was about 
thirty thousand 
""
fortunately or unfortunately  i had many kacchi friends  who
developed  and we started one small social club  of mulund 
""
of which  our dr lalan the first  the oldest m b b s doctor
general practitioner  leherchand shah  and some of the people we
started the activities 
""
and then  slowly  i rather  converted them you know now
conversion takes place  converted them  to devote something for the
school 
""
during this contact i came across  the managing committee
members chairman president everything etcetera of the gujrathi schools 
""
so manilal chaturbhuj gandhi  became a very good friend of mine
""
""
because of my association with these people  and my activities
 so became a friend 
""
i requested him one day  we are small people we don't have
money we don't have funds we don't have workers  can we use can we use
 your school  when you are not using without disturbing you 
""
he said most welcome 
""
then i asked him we don't have big money to pay the rents also 
""
he said   who asks you to pay the rent  ? 
""
they didn't ask a single  nayapaisa   and then
  manibhai's  all the children became our good friends  and
they also  from that managing committee they looked after us very well
 and sometime you know  when our school grew  upto s s c standard
  cough  the grown up children sometime become mischievous 
""
they used to break the glass  they used to make it dirty 
they don't uh  take care of the toilet 
""
then tear the paper and throw it somewhere 
""
now we were running in the morning shift  and  hardly there
was half an hour    dist     difference  
between their school and our school  and lot of complaint  from the
headmaster  of the gujrathi school started coming this this this this this
""
""
but let me tell you  my good friend  manilal and his team
of committee members  they were so cooperative
""
one day they called me  arey kulkarni  tum ek kam karo
 
""
tell me what is it   dekho tum ek jhadu wale ko laga do
 
""
children make mischief and other thing etcetera 
""
so therefore  before this school come  they will just clean
it and make it good so that i don't have to listen to my own principal to
coming  uh i mean uh making complaint against you people 
""
so  this is a good idea 
""
it should have struck  struck the headmaster there at that time
 but he didn't 
""
our gudi was there 
""
i forced gudi to come and join this institution
""
he was not willing to come  because  two reasons  today
we all of us look to  security 
""
now  our children grow 
""
okay what are you going to do  ?
""
so in good old days  are you getting a government job  ?
""
close the eye and join  because it is secured 
""
so private company  is it a long standing  then join 
""
if it is a private company  just started  oh nobody knows
whether after five years this will remain or not 
""
so those were the days  when everybody was looking for  a
secured job 
""
mr gudi had already a secured permanent job  in one of the
leading schools  of n k e s  but somehow i succeeded in brainwashing
him  and i told him  we may not have money  we may not pay you
what you are getting  but we have a soft corner for you if you come and
sacrifice  and ultimately i had to cut a joke at him 
""
who is at the back of you  ?
""
he even today a bachelor  still there associated with the
school indirectly 
""
who is at the back of you  ?
""
for whom you want to have a  a secure job  ?
""
come join 
""
do some social work at least  you'll  get a good name 
""
he came  joined 
""
then  all the youngsters  team came and joined 
""
then we were on the look out for a place 
""
and this kamath came across the landlord of this place  and uh
we had nobody to pay 
""
this man mahalay had a very big land 
""
so he was selling piece by piece 
""
we selected 
""
do you know it took us  five years to make the payment to him
piece by piece piece by piece  hundred  rupees  two hundred
 rupees  thousand  rupees  two thousand 
rupees   because we were to collect  and give it 
""
in those days what was the mode of collection  ?
""
sorry  to say  some of our kannada people  at that time
 were  in trade in business in industry 
""
i was a very small man in those years 
""
i used to go to them 
""
look  you are from karnataka  we have started a kannada
school  we want to do this we don't have funds  government is not
giving us any grant  shall we  will you help us  ?
""
so  some people  who had love for education  okay here
is our fifty  rupees  
""
in those days fifty  rupees  was a big amount 
nineteen fifty-seven fifty-eight 
""
hundred  rupees  was a big amount 
""
some people used to ask me  are you sending your  ch 
they asked me point blank question 
""
are you sending your children to this school  ?
""
i said no my children are going to english medium school
""
there was a simpson school or something like that 
""
then why do you want this headache  ?
""
better go away 
""
even people insulted me like this 
""
so  ultimately i came to the conclusion  any help or
donation will come from  people who have  if i go and ask them who do
not have what can they give  ?
""
at the most  people who have got a love for education  they
may give the sympathy 
""
if they are elders they may bless 
""
if they are youngsters  okay you ask me run about  i will go
run about beg borrow  won't steal  but  i'll  get something 
""
if they are youngsters  who has a devotion for education 
""
so i tried  fortunately for me associated with a chemical
trade in uh bombay 
""
i started only one aspect 
""
this  most of the gujrati people were in the chemical trade in
those years  and i was associated with the chemical trade 
""
i used to give them  advice  guidance  whenever they
came 
""
they had a sympathy for me 
""
so i said let me try to tap the source 
""
so once a year  i used to go to them  with a small request
""
""
and in those days  for a souvenir  we used to keep hundred
 rupees   is the highest  for advertisement fees 
""
and hundred  rupees  very few people will pay 
""
half page quarter page one eighth page  based on hundred 
and go door to door 
""
some people say  arey jao tum pachas rupye leke jao
 
""
even they would not ask for a receipts 
""
i said no you must take the receipt 
""
this money collected in those years  was utilised only for
 paying the  salary of the teachers  plus whatever we were able
to contribute from our pockets 
""
then i said this way we cannot do it 
""
bhimsen joshi being a very good friend of mine  invariably
whenever he was in bombay he was  camping in my house 
""
those days also  like today his fees are  fifty thousand
 rupees 
""
in those days  he would go and sing  if you give a good
cup of tea at your house 
""
so  i used to request him  and he said  okay for
your school   i'll  give you a free performance  
""
and what i was in return giving  he would come  for some
other programme at their expense  and one day give it for our school 
and we didn't have a big money to purchase the  i mean to hire a big hall
""
""
so we used to request the poddar college  principal take that
poddar college hall  and  run this small show
""
and to bhimsen joshi  one and a half  rupee ghuch
   that's  all  was given to him 
""
he was very happy and convinced  and he gave us couple of
programmes 
""
then not only that  he brought that ustad uh  uhm  what
is his name from benaras   shehenaiwallah  
""
yeah  bismillah khan 
""
he told bismillah  because bismillah and he  were studying
together somewhere in north india  sleeping on the footpath  of the
  guru's   house  both of them  and uh serving
the  guru   in northern india  and  therefore they
were good friends 
""
he said  dekho ye hamara shaala hai uske liye tum 
phokat mei karneka  
""
of course we paid in those days hundred  rupees  or
something like that to  meet his expenses  coming from benaras and all
that  and that is how  begging borrowing we started
