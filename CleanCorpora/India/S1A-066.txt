""
""
good morning sir 
""
i am mukta mahajan  i have come from jalgaon 
""
and uh  my city is developing city  and  we are the
natives of that city 
""
my  father is retired lecturer 
""
i have three sisters  and one brother 
""
ours is the family of teachers 
""
and  i have got the inspiration particularly from my father 
""
my father  always  tells me that the  position of a
teacher  is of  a person  who guides the society  who guides the
complete generation 
""
and  that's  why i have selected  this particular
profession 
""
""
 it's  nice to meet a person who belongs to an academic
 family i should say 
""
""
 it's  really true sir 
""
""
and what brings you here all the way from jalgaon to kolhapur
""
""
""
i have come to attend the refresher course in english 
""
""
have you 
""
""
yes sir 
""
""
is it your first  or  second
""
""
it is the first refresher course  i am attending 
""
and i am feeling very nice  that i am in the company of so
brilliant brains  and particulary the people i find here they are really
 sunshine brain and moonshine heart 
""
""
 wah  very nice 
""
and  how do you find the courses 
""
do you think that they have colleges wherever  to what you teach
in the classes 
""
""
i think
""
""
one difficulty is or one  uhm shall i suggest these
courses is that  they are only  of an academic nature  very
little to do with  grammarian work in the classes    ahn  do
you agree with this charge 
""
""
 ahn  
""
""
yes i do agree with this charge because  the classroom
situation is completely different  and we are  uh told here  about
 ideal conditions
""
""
yes
""
""
if we cannot really apply reality  and while teaching a
particular text or a particular portion we have to face lot of problems apart
from the  teaching itself 
""
""
yet you agree that ideals are good enough 
""
""
of course we need them    to follow  of course we
need them 
""
""
 to follow  
""
""
we may say that ideals  will cease to be ideals if they
are attainable  won't they 
""
""
yes it is really sir  it is really true
""
but unless we have ideals then we will go astray 
""
""
they do show us a direction 
""
""
sir 
""
""
and give us  where we have to go and where we stand 
don't they 
""
""
we may go wrong but we we have that particular say a kind of
lighthouse    yeah  and we have to travel in that direction
""
""
 yeah  
""
""
so it  it's  a  one word  light you may say
""
""
sir  yes sir
""
""
that guides you on your career
""
""
yes sir 
""
""
and how about this kolhapur 
""
""
 it's  very fantastic city 
""
for the first time i am enjoying the rain and cold and really
thrilling one 
""
and the beauty of nature and the greenery   it's  really
fantastic 
""
""
you don't have this in jalgaon
""
""
no no no   it's  completely hot and so  so hot
 that it becomes impossible for outsiders  to stay in jalgaon during
the month of  uh april and may particularly
""
""
and perhaps you find it difficult to be here   from your
  a few words  i believe
""
""
 yes sir  
""
""
i i am feeling completely migrated bird  you know 
""
""
do you 
""
""
yes sir
""
""
but how is the migration  from bad to worse  or good to
bad
""
""
well  from bad to good 
""
""
bad to good
""
""
because man needs water   to his   to his 
 roots  so that  uh as bud will come out and  man will flourish
 and here i am really feeling that sense of  flowering 
""
""
nice  you are paying a very rich tribute to kolhapur 
""
""
it   it  deserves sir 
""
""
 and  
""
""
and what about the historicity of this place 
""
have you visited any historical place
""
""
uhn ufortunately i could not sir 
""
unfortunately i could not because uh rain is so heavy that i dare
not to go outside 
""
""
lack of opportunity not interest 
""
""
no i i really interest  i have really interest in seeing
the sight which are you  know well known for  historical importance 
but due to lack of   opportunity 
""
""
 because of   the vacation 
""
""
yes sir  but i am i am deciding  to visit the places 
on sunday    some place 
""
""
 there are   different forts here you kown 
 panhalgad  
""
""
yes sir i know it 
""
""
you must be knowing this all history don't you
""
""
no sir 
""
""
you don't know the importance of  panhalgad
""
""
you don't mean that you don't know it 
""
""
pardon sir 
""
""
you don't mean that you don't know  panhalgad
 and  it's  importance   in maratha history 
""
""
 i i i have read   
""
yes i have read a lot about  and i have also asked my friends
that we will  we will go there but they said that due to rain it will be
impossible to go there 
""
and none of them is ready 
""
""
that is one of the forts you know  that immortalise that
great partriot    of course    baji prabhu  deshpande
 who helped shivaji to escape from there  from the seige  of siddhi
johar at  one word 
""
""
 of course  
""
""
 of course  
""
""
i have gone through the history
""
""
i had been there 
""
we had a taxi 
""
it was a nice experience going there
""
and unlike other forts   it's  not tiring business for
    haan   of environment
""
""
  haan   
""
""
yeah 
""
""
you can take your taxi on the top 
""
we can visit the places in the  conveyer    uhn  and
 it's  very less tiring job 
""
and there is another place also nearby 
""
""
 uhn  
""
""
which one 
""
""
it is one  uh  two words 
""
""
i like that main building particularly  that statue of
shivaji maharaj     one word  still  it seems going to
sky  from the earth going from  uhm to mean place to some where highest
place and  i really like that statue
""
""
  one word  that  
""
""
great men do have an elevating effect you know 
""
""
sir
""
""
when you look them from the bottom to the top you feel going
higher and higher
""
""
higher and higher 
""
i really like that statue and i  whenever i get a chance i go
there and have a round and enjoy that greenery and structure  and the 
 atmosphere 
""
""
 that means    that means it must be quite an
effort for a frail person like you   laughter  to do all these
things
""
""
it means both things i try to achieve  just  it's 
a kind of exercise for me 
""
and because i need it and i never get a chance in my city to go
out  and uh  because  it's  so crowded and particulary there are
no places  in our city 
""
when i come here in this  uh area of university   it's
 really lovely place
""
""
you are coming for the first time 
""
""
yes sir 
""
""
you have never been this side 
""
""
no 
""
""
how did you come 
""
""
by train 
""
""
by train
""
""
by train 
""
""
you must be finding the journey very  tiresome
""
""
very tiresome  it's  a long journey
""
""
especially after poona 
""
""
yes sir 
""
if the train becomes passenger  and uh unbearable journey it
becomes  but i have no other way 
""
uhn  which is convenient way  to come to kolhapur
""
""
when are you leaving 
""
""
on twenty first 
""
""
on twenty first 
""
""
the course is  i think   one word  we finished
on the nineteenth
""
""
but i have got the reservation of twenty first 
""
""
so you are overstaying a little
""
""
yes sir  for one day
""
""
thanks to  one word  reservations   laughter
""
""
""
so that i will be able to visit the places i couldn't
""
""
ah you will have go shopping
""
""
  right  a day gap
""
""
 uhm  
""
""
shopping 
""
""
no i am not interested in shopping whenever i go to market i
buy books only that is all 
""
""
so you are a bibliophile  laughter  aren't you 
""
so i would better ask you to go to the  mahalaxmi temple 
have you been there
""
""
yes  i've  been there
""
""
how you find the temple 
""
""
 it's  very lovely  here one gets the  you say
  per  perfect religious atmosphere and uh  the faith in man
grows when we go in the company of  that structure only  i i didn't i
couldn't go inside the temple  because i was in hurry but i have decided
to go there  on sunday
""
""
do go inside 
""
""
of course sir 
""
""
because the  one word  and  two words  is very
beautiful in name of the goddess
""
""
outside    observation won't do always  it
becomes necessary to go inside and  experience it
""
""
 and there are lights also there  
""
""
unless you enter a temple   laughter  it is no
visit to a temple you know
""
""
yes sir 
""
""
 it's  not a place of tourists interest
""
""
but i have heard that fold your hands and your  uh prayers
reach to god 
""
""
they do  if you have faith
""
""
 laughs 
""
there is no need of going to temple  just fold your hands 
and close your eyes and your prayer will go to god
""
""
they do 
""
""
and it will come true 
""
and many times i had experienced it that i couldn't get a chance
to go to temple  and uh i just pray in heart and my wishes come true 
""
one of my wish has come true that is uh  acheiving this
doctorate 
""
""
yes you have achieved a doctorate 
""
""
yes sir 
""
""
what did you  make research 
""
""
american literature 
""
i am interested in american literature and uh  i have taken
the subject uh  in that uh uh  a study of prose style of ernest
hemingway with special reference to his novels 
""
""
hemingway 
""
""
yes sir 
""
""
but who was your guide by the way 
""
""
uh presently he is the vice-chancellor of indore university
 dr s h chandel 
""
""
we have heard  one word 
""
""
of course 
""
""
yes you were fortunate enough to get hold of him
""
""
of course of course 
""
it was a nice experience for me  to live in his company and to
share his  uh knowledge  and to enlighten myself 
""
""
did you publish your  research 
""
""
not yet sir 
""
i have lost a lot of money and it has become a white elephant for
me now a days  and it will take a lot of time 
""
""
but do publish it 
""
""
of course sir i will 
""
""
because  it is very necessary for people to know
""
""
uhm  everybodys research is uh  his or her  baby
because it is    yes  it is one creation  and everybody likes
to see growing up and spreading 
""
""
 yes  
""
""
and as the proverb go   laughter   like
the mother like the baby 
""
""
ah ha  laughs 
""
""
so it must be  two words  excuse
""
""
ah ha ha 
""
""
i am really glad to know  that you have done this  at a
young age 
""
""
it did with all the blessings of my parents
""
they really  made me uh  they really  allowed me to do
otherwise girls are not allowed in our caste  to study  at such extent
and  but they allowed me 
""
they created such a atmosphere in home that i  i was not
allowed to do any household work  i was treated like a boy  male person
""
""
""
 that's  very progressive you know
""
""
yes 
""
""
in those days especially  when  cough  daughters
are looked down upon    ah ha  as the unwanted   burden
""
""
""
 ah ha  
""
""
 no no   our parents gave equal treatment  
 and 
""
""
  you're     you're  fortunate
enough in the sense   i mean i mean 
""
""
 of course i am i am   i am living in the blessed
company of my parents i really love my parents and i am proud of them 
""
""

""
""
but couldn't make it
""
""

me 
""
so that i will remind them again and i will try to cry 
""
""
so you just wanted to forget everything else and merge 
 with all this things 
""
""
 yes i i   wanted to cut all the  friends 
and wanted to be alone here  so that i will be able to mix up with these
people
""
but i
""
""
how come you are so home sick 
""
""
rather i am  a bit emotional  more emotional
