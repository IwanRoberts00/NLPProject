so now uh we start uh departmental committee meeting this committee is held before the commencement of the new academic year  the second meeting which we are going to have   we'll talk certain things which we have not decided in the uh last meeting was the thing is that uh now the students election you see i don't know how we are going to conduct it  but nevertheless as far as uh the decision of having a class representative of part one and part two no that has to be  taken  this how we are going to select part one representative and part two representative for the timing is less  uh for the time being atleast because uh we have much as we are celebrating this twenty fifth year of departmental day  uh we'll need some student participation in it also so how are we going to uh have to decide upon all this these things and involvement of the student in the whole programme which we are likely to have uh in the  academic year  this academic year especially  now i would like to like the teachers to say a few words in this context as how we are going to be a whether we are going to have a depart a committee or you are going to decide upon class representatives  what about the guidelines ? uh we have not received any guidelines  there will be a student council that much is said in the new act but until elections are conducted and all  but the elections are there nominations are there the first candidate who has studies number marks  lead on the basis of merit uh students should be nominated that is the on the on the basis of merit  if that is in the guidelines all okay uhn  i think two words  so we'll talk of that now in that case there will be one one student you see from part one and one student from part two  but uh should we have a committee for this uh our uhm uhm we can have  uh for this uh silver jubilee function and uh  the one word students participating in concern we can have have like this  around we are having we will be having hundred students na  from part one say and part second let us say hundred students  silver jubilee function  oh yeah more or less we can divide this hundred student into team and each team should be held by a student leader team leader  he will be having in each team some responsibility  and atleast two team should be one word by a teacher  for example if they are not going in a proper direction or if they are not in having some problem that a teacher can  guide them  two team should be given to one teacher  that of a ten ten student and each ten ten have should have within ten one leader one word leader  so two group having two leaders and that will be under the control of one teacher  and these these students could do other certain duties as volunteers for uh for the function  from that way we can use the students in that case we will be involving the whole hundred lot in it there is nothing wrong in it for example if the function is for example three days or four days   no no there is some confusion you see what exactly do you think you are going to do ? no what you expect from the students ?  students yes so are they don't be so sir to help the after this for example you know we may ask them to uh uh distribute paper for example if you have seminar you can use that or we can ask them to you know uh uh some arrangements to be made they can do that for example all the certificates have to be given by the university so for purchase varchase they should be shifted up so many thing should be done  the for each one word we can first check out the activities check out the activities then on the basis of activities we can calculate how many students will uh actually require there will be uh some sort of arrangement be should be  there for example a a student may fall sick and uh do you mean that uh whatever we have decided yes  for the uh   yes  silver jubilee silver jubilee one one year haan  that would be separate from what the students will be doing they they should be involved in that uh that programme in that programme yes uh so a every for example it will be done throughout the year okay but one group for this month also   so you cannot involve all hundred students  you you should make a committee and the committee will be responsible of  organising  see okay but at the same time the committee without the help of manpower it cannot do anything at the same time for example burden are there burden of the students will also be less for example if you give to one uh student for one committee or one month one batch for one month arrange that for since they fallen into uh settle for one full year  so we can use ten by the turn or each each one each month one we'll get a new batch  so that they will get relaxation also like that  they will manage committee will manage  no but we have already made committee no that would be involved in the sense  no  okay these committee should be with the students we can say  see look here there are ten batches let the each committee handle it there will be no responsibility involved in what the committee is doing as the students are doing   but then  let the committee men for for example if there is uh let us say we have got five committees let uh one person in in the committee hand one batch or two batch like that  for example we are having uh this chemistry seminars we are having uhm  then we are having quiz and uh uh like uh  uhm so we are going to organise it organise it  we just one assistant that is what i'm telling for the assistants only what what type of assistant   no lakshminarayan how are you going to involve all students in it   all students cannot  not  it's same you see uh  not not at a time let us say for example this batch work work for only for ten  ten but how how they will come and report now dr chausalkar is going to have uh he's going to assist out for him uhn uhn  his work now what will they do   they won't uh no whether  no  what we'll do is we'll do is one word we are having different committees yes  each committee will have a student student group that is what i say ten student yes that is what i'm telling  my idea is that could be done each group for example it won't uh burden the students for example if you don't involve all the students what happens  only a few students will be always over burden no on the same line we are having one uh souvenir committee attached to the souvenir committee we'll have  souvenir committee   yeah   you can have one group in one yes they can do whatever suggested   we are thinking that one word  souvenir committee i i don't think it's  no i'm giving you example na  example na like any other committee actually actually debate committee for that  debate committee who has got quiz also whatever it is they will help you  so each one this month this is the group it will be there  you see another committee is what  three to five students may be involved in it  uhn it depends upon the workload  it may be have three or five or ten or it might be more now okay we've already involved them   we've started it i i feel you have five students and the one who goes as  as per the new act you see number one who is going to the students council on the basis of merit he'll be the chairman uhn  one part one committee and part two committee some five students uh four students and one one word  one would be chairman so four from part one four from part two  this is how decide you make two committees as far as part one part two is concerned  now my my basic idea is my important issue is that we can give them some books  we are going to collect funds you see  uhn   haan to collect money like that uhn uhn see i want to use them in that context  so if you all put into a very business like uh uh contract  cough that's how uh  uh we can do like that also no actually for that purpose all hundred coming laugh should be involved yes what is wrong in it let it be four involve five  do i work lot of work  see those  those teachers responsibility of involving all the students yeah  otherwise you'll not get the money if you if you involve all the hundred  uhn you'll make it compulsory in the part you will be there you need to get atleast five each student should get five  uhn  five what ? whatever other students are uh donation so you you'll form two committees part one and part two yes  and uh the man who is going as a the student who is going as a representative of the students council he'll  let him chairman okay  chairman of the committee  first year committee second year committee  for collection of money it's enough   two words some students laugh but what about other activity ? other activities means one word   we should require uh students for quiz programme  haan this arranging will be there  so many things  essay competition  and for seminar i don't think  uhn even for quiz competition you require some arrangement should be there na  seminar also we can have a committee   one word everyday you have to uh look see that you can involve all the students in that business you see why have committees and create problems to the well they have a another kind of feelings  already  already there are groups and fights yeah why i'm not included in that committee i'm  not getting two division yeah so why should i go there  laughs   yeah  instead of doing that let all get involved whenever there are seminars or quiz competitions  okay next any other thing that has as nanivadekar says he wanted to speak something no before that uhn we are going to organise  shivaji university political science forum from next month almost  uhn  yeah  what uh arrangement we are going to make because atleast seventy to seventy-five uh delegates are going to attend  yeah there is lot of so we have to think about that  well as a day we will have to organise   a few words   we'll have to one word afterwards  afterwards  so there are catering arrangements are there  accommodation arrangements are there vehicles and many other things are there i think we'll have to uhn first discuss  that first two words   uhn  uhm  you have send the letters  accomodation can we ask uh university to provide for   no have one word  have you mentioned about the  two days for three days uhn  papers  they a few words   we'll need i think we'll need i think  there's one only which i'm trying to say that i don't think that the halls are occupied the one word  hostel one word one you must contact the warden  means the halls are vacant seventy-five beds and all we should hey don't one word people may one word  ah twenty to twenty-five two words i think  either  inside inside kolhapur out of these twenty-five also some good people may be  kept in the guest houses guest house that is like some we can arrange in the hostel also  hostel and one word uhn ladies hostel is another  uhn  no ladies hostel we may not need at all  quarter one word  quarter one is vacant i think one is vacant autade autade autade's  quarter so we immediately write to book that patil first  two words  patil then guest house here  guest house  if this one word is well and good they are not going to a few words  quarters how many people can we accomodate in a quarter  yeah  fifteen  also yeah  fifteen to twenty not less than ten  more than twenty not less than ten  quarter sir no no it's very big yeah ten minutes are there  two words atleast there are parents who   two words  and even three one word  eleven to fourteen  haan  fifteen to twenty twenty-five twenty-one it becomes one word congested minimum fifteen to twenty nevertheless people coming from solapur district may require accomodation yeah definitely they they require our full one word karad may not be there satara district satara they will go back satara one word haan they have  haan  no barsi  anyhow either we decide for the catering and accomodation uh either we get the guest house or not this is we book the quarters first no it is not correct   we'll use it either for accomodation or for catering purposes the teachers quarter is no not bad  no of course for accomoding accomodating  no i know
