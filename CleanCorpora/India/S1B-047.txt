""
 recording broken 
""
a legend in his lifetime  known as the greatest gentleman tennis
player of the world
""
certainly  india's  greatest tennis player ever
""
and right now he is with us in our studios mr ramanathan krishnan
""
""
mr krishnan  welcome to our studios and thank you very much for
 being with us
""
""
thank you deepak 
""
""
uh we would like to take you down memory lanes    yeah
 we would like to travel into the past
""
""
 yeah  
""
""
tell us about how you  got involved in tennis ?
""
""
yes  uhm see i come from a tennis playing family 
""
it all  my father started the whole thing 
""
and he used to be a good player  in his playing days that was
before the war time 
""
and he used them 
""
he was the best player in the south and  he was one of the top
ranking indian player 
""
so he  he put me into tennis 
""
and then  infact he put ramesh also   to   into
  tennis 
""
""
who coached you in your earliest days  ?
""
""
my father has been my main  my main coach 
""
uh he started coaching me when i was about  ten years old 
""
that  was  used to be  you know that you  people used
to consider quite younger that time
""
but today  they start as early as  five or six  know 
""
i started when i was about ten years old 
""
and uh  my father went   to   for   some
rigorous programmes for me
""
lot of training and lot of practice sessions and uh  it was hard
work 
""
""
uhm now the emphasis appears to be on physical fitness as much
as on  proficiency in the game 
""
and at the time when you were being coached  ?
""
""
well deepak it has been the same 
""
i mean if you take tennis for last forty fifty years 
""
and in fact people ask me   how do you compare a champion
of a  nineteen twenties or thirties   ?
""
you know   i've  not seen them but  you know i talked
to people and uh  champions  of todays
""
i think that one common factor  that is physical fitness 
""
they all had to be    phy    physically 
 very fit  and uh  it is only athletes  who can play this game
well 
""
""
what kind of equipment and facilities did you have when you
started playing tennis  ?
""
""
well uh  you can't compare it with todays 
""
facilities are much more today 
""
but in my playing days for instance we used to play with wooden
rackets 
""
now you see  no rackets of graphite and aluminium and uh  
there're  so many varieties of rackets now 
""
 it's  an improvement because with uh  less effort 
you're  able to get more pace 
""
the pace is an advantage for the modern players
""
we didn't had that 
""
but then   we're  good players of the time like  take
rod laver
""
uh i mean he played with the wooden rackets
""
and  lu hoad or jack kramer they hit the ball as hard because
 they had a very good timing 
""
so   it's  a question of i mean i do agree that the
equipment is better 
""
but you know once you  you know as an athlete who is very
talented  i mean you  you give   my   him  
broomstick he can play tennis well 
""
""
was it possible to  make a living out of tennis  i'm
 sorry to put such a material    no no  question to you
""
was it possible to do that ?
""
""
 no no  
""
""
very interesting question
""
very good question 
""
and it used to be amateur sports those days 
""
like i was an amateur player
""
and  rod laver in his earlier days and lu hoad  they're 
all amateurs 
""
then they turn professional later on 
""
and uh  it was  a  mainly an amateur sports 
""
in fact those days unfortunately they used to look down  on the
professionals you know
""
so they were very few in number 
""
they used to be under group under jack kramer 
""
and uh  in nineteen sixty things have changed
""
and the status of the game has changed now 
""
now  it's  a professional sport 
""
a full time job and uh     luc    lucrative
  career for the top players 
""
""
mr krishnan there is one question that is lot of people have
always wanted to ask you 
""
forgive me for this question but  having reached the peak 
  yeah  all of a sudden ramanathan krishnan just sort of went away
""
hang out his racket and he went away 
""
uh  you you didn't  get interested in coaching you didn't
want to take an active part in  the management of tennis in this country
""
""
 yeah  
""
""
well uh  i didn't hang up my racket quickly
""
i mean i had a pretty long innings 
""
i mean i played for quiet a long time you know i had a long innings
you know
""
""
 laughs 
""
""
i played nearly    yeah  twenty-five to thirty
years 
""
""
 yeah  
""
""
in fact i had three  life's  in tennis 
""
first i was playing you know  my best playing days is in the
fifties and the sixties 
""
then i quit for sometime 
""
and uh when ramesh started improving his tennis  i thought 
it's  a good idea to  you know compete with him and uh  you know
practice with him which would help him which it did 
""
so i came back in the  seventies  seventy-four or
seventy-five around that time
""
and ramesh was coming up 
""
then ramesh was on his own feet  improved and went you know went
the circuit
""
i quit again 
""
and finally in the early eighties  around eighty-two  they
introduced a new event called the grand masters  meant for  ex-tennis
players 
""
you know  who've   done well in the earlier years 
""
but  they're  too old to  compete in regular competition
""
they call it a grand masters events 
""
it was the assembly of  ex-champions ex-tennis players 
""
so i was invited to take part in that  in the main in united
states and a few tournaments in europe 
""
so i competed again  again against people like  rod laver
kanross wall all big legendary names you know 
""
i enjoyed it  and uh it was lot of fun and  that's  also
finished now because  you know the reason 
""
new forty-fives are now coming in  laughter 
""
you know when i was forty-five
""
 i'm  fifty-four now  played for nearly nine ten years
""
""
and i  we had lot of fun and we had good competition 
""
and now the new forty-fives you know  for event like that you
always need some new blood    ah 
""
so the new forty-fives are now coming you know the reason 
""
""
 ah  
""
""
they are already professionals in the rally
""
 we're  not professional    yes  but the new
persons are coming in
""
so that event is going on now
""
""
 yes  
""
""
well this this  senior collegue of mine here is nine
hundred and ninety-five years old and he is going to   learn tennis
 in a little while
""
""
 ah ha  
""
""
ah ha
""
""
but there is the question that  that i i want to repeat it
again mr krishnan    yeah 
""
why has uh  mr krishnan never been available for coaching ?
""
""
 yeah  
""
""
yeah you asked me that question 
""
you see  as i said that i kept playing uh  the lesson
important like i played the grand masters for eight nine years 
""
then in between i was  travelling with ramesh trying to help
him for a few years
""
when he need  when he needed it 
""
and i firmly believe  that  in this game  you know 
it's  uh   it's  a long process 
""
this coaching everything is not a quick process you know it takes
years 
""
if i take up  two or three boys or four boys and   i've
 to live with them be with them right through
""
and i couldn't do anything else 
""
and  it's  a long process 
""
i couldn't afford the time
""
and i didn't want to you know  takes stuck  take up
something half-heartedly and leave it in the middle 
""
so this is one of the main reason 
""
and uh  in this country  we've  good coaches who teach
the fundamentals of the game alright 
""
where  we're  lagging behind is  when they improve the
tennis  they're  a bit directionless 
""
""
we here  a little dicky bird a little rumour  that's
  ramanathan krishnan is now going to go in for coaching 
""
is there any truth in this ?
""
""
well uh  yes  i'm  in the capital for two reasons
""
""
one is to watch the davis cup match  that's  going on
between  india and korea
""
which is at a very interesting stage
""
""
in which  in which your son played   brilliantly
""
""
""
 my son played   very well 
""
 he's  been good yesterday 
""
and uh   i'm  here also for another important reason 
""
i met again dynamic man called bobby singh 
""
who is uh in organising a tennis academy 
""
uh tennis for tennis academy
""
i believe  he's  going to have it  in the capital  in
this area 
""
and uh object is to  unearth talents  tennis talents 
""
and then give them all the opportunities and uh  you know give
them the coaching and training facilities 
""
so that  you know  take a group of some thirty forty boys
and girls 
""
so that out of the  quantity  a few good quality player may
be three or four will come out in three years time
""
 it's  a very good idea 
""
so he asked me when i was here last month passing through delhi
""
""
he asked me whether i could help them or give them a little 
few few tips and all 
""
so i thought  it's  a good idea and uh  you know 
i've  did  away  lot pressure out of game  lot of things out of
this game 
""
so i said why not give that to game  in some small way 
""
so  i said  i agreed and uh  right after the davis cup
match  i think around the nineth or tenth  or a week   i'm 
going to be working with this uh  young children
""
""
oh wonderful 
""
 jee saheb ab krishnan saheb  training  de
rahen hain naujawan bacchon ko
""
ek hafta das din ke liye desh ki rajdhani mei rahenge aur yahan
par ek  tennis coaching camp  lag raha hai 
""
agar aap chahen to  aap ke liye  recommendation 
mai de sakta hoon 
""
""
 deepakji pehli baat to yeh hai ke  mere pas itni
fursat nahin    ah  mai dekhye mai  match  dekhta
hoon  aur mujhe maza ajata hai  aur mai gum hojata hoon 
""
""
 ah  
""
""
 usi liye itna wakht lag jata hai aur ab khelne ke
liye  after all  agar panch hazar saal purani haddiyan hain to
 kahin satak hi na jayen 
""
""
 laughs 
""
""
 i'm  sorry i said he was nine hundred and something
he says  he's  five thousand years old
""
""
 you'll  have to be very young to   one word
 this game and play this game  you know
""
""
which is very young   laughs   he's  five
thousand very young 
""
""
 laughs 
""
""
mr krishnan what do you consider  which match do you
consider your greatest match ever  ?
""
""
well as stated earlier i had a long inning
""
""
yeah
""
""
so  i had to mention two or three of them   you know
""
""
""
 alright  
""
""
i think uh  i would always i mean  all the listeners
would expect me to say this   laughter 
""
the match against thomas coss which i played  inter-zonal
final against  brazilian davis cup competition nineteen sixty-six 
""
that is very important  because i was playing the fifth match
""
it was two match for i was playing the fifth match  and of
course  out on grass court  which tend out to be a  a marathon match
a deciding match which i happen to win 
""
 that's  very important because that took the country to
the  final position they used to call it a challenge you know 
""
the challenge for the davis cup was there for the first time 
""
you know first time is always very important 
""
and i always take pride in that that i broke that ice 
""
and you know  we've  got to the finals
""
it was a thrilling moments for other players thomas coss 
""
and uh  well  uh  that's  about thirty years ago 
nearly  laughter  twenty-five years ago
""
""
 laughs 
""
yeah  then  you're  going to mention one or two other
matches that
""
""
this is the main one because you know  it's  a davis
cup match 
""
another one is uh  i always remembered  my matches against
roy emerson the quarter final at wimbledon
""
we played on the central court 
""
i was seeded number seven
""
he was number four 
""
he was a favourite 
""
i played exceptionally well on that day and  i managed to be
in great state  uh which took me to the semi-final of wimbledon for the
second time 
""
that was a very important match uh  quality wise
""
i played good tennis 
""
and another one which i always remember is  as against rod
laver in the opening round the opening match of the  davis cup competition
inter-zone finals between india and australia 
""
we played the match in the united states 
""
you know those days the rules of the games
""
the rules of the davis cup competition were such that  you know
the nation that was holding the cup
""
you know today  it's  not like that
""
today everybody plays no ?
""
""
yeah
""
""
but those days  the nation which was holding the cup the
holders  they played only one match
""
they played winners of the  rest of the world 
""
so on that that year  i mean united states was holding the cup
""
""
which meant we had to play the earlier matches like the inter-zone
finals    yeah  in the united states 
""
""
 yeah  
""
""
i played that match in boston and beat laver
""
i mean i must confess that rod laver was that great
""
he played afterwards with everybody 
""
but even then  he was the wimbledon  finalist and uh 
that gave me lot of pressure breathing in because i realise how talented he
was and uh  i won in four serve 
""
i always remember that match 
""
""
when you reached  the semi-finals of the wimbledon for the
first time    yeah  before went to play that match  
 yeah  what did you do  ?
""
and after you played it what did you do ?
""
  you knew that  you've  beaten 
""
""
 yeah  
""
""
 yeah  
""
""
 ah yeah  i'll    tell you something
""
looking back  well i know certain things which i shouldn't have
done
""
 it's  too late 
""
thats what   happened in   happens   you know
 in  all walks of life  you make some mistakes
""
i did make a mistake 
""
somewhere on i was over awed at that occasion 
""
but i got in the semi-finals at wimbledon
""
i was over awed 
""
you know  it's  only two matches to win to win the title i
was very close to it 
""
and the people who  i'm  playing  i had beaten them here
and there 
""
you know  it's  not that they had always beaten me  but
uh   i've  one occasion i lost to neil fraser neat serve uh another
occasion  rod laver
""
second level rod laver in sixty-one 
""
and you know   it's  interesting to know that  i've
 not lost to lord laver until then 
""
but on that occasion i was over awed  and they were two  two
of the best out pass two of the left that left handed again its known 
""
it so happened i had to play them on fast grass court
""
this i wouldn't play well and uh  they were the better players
""
but i think if uh  i should have been little more you know it
is  one word   a little more ambitious  and you know  i
played normally
""
i should have done something extra bit you know
""
on an occasion like that  you can't afford to play just normal
tennis and get away
""
 you've  to do something extra
""
which i didn't do 
""
""
 deepekji hamesha ki tarah aap meri baat mehmen tak

ambition 
""
""
uh mr krishnan coming back to your reputation as a gentleman
tennis player
""
now you don't have to answer this question if you don't want to
but  i've  heard again from your comtemporaries    yeah 
that if there was ever a line called  which the empire awarded in your
favour  but you thought that it belong to the  to your opponent 
then the next point you would deliberately return the ball into the net 
""
is that true ?
""
that you would  you would you know equalise
""
""
 yeah  
""
""
well i will tell you the truth now
""
i can afford to tell you the truth now  laughter  that 
i've  close my tennis year
