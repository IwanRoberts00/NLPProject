 laughter  really  just imagine we have to wait here for half an hour  and just doing this  they must be wondering what we are doing no ? yes laughs  and nobody is going to find us here  because we are locked here laughs  locked from outside laughs  feeling nice  but next week by this time uhm finished most of the papers which ? how many days ? two days more uhn today is the final day so naturally we have uh  nine more days to go say  nine  isn't it ? nine ten uh ten because sun sunday is also counted you know  and whatever it is i am waiting for the thirtieth  ah  because i was actually waiting for these classes and not for the exams because i know what i am going to do there because i am not at all prepared  even i am not prepared actually we hardly get any time to study no when we work uhm  you know it's very difficult for us you being in college it was something different and for school we have to be there right from ten to four ten  and then our headmistress is very particular about our correction and all that  to add with it our system is very exam oriented  every second day we have some examination and some correction  even we have exams  in that way actually every four months or three months we have  because we have pre- test and test and annual and half yearly and all this things naturally it uh just has to be done  and our college is more like a school you know  that uh  this principal she is very particular about it  all that discipline has to be maintained you know  but in orissa you know lecturers have a very nice time there  uhm like there is nobody to actually check on them  they may or may not take classes  and children bank on the tuitions rather than on the lectures  so if you are very wealthy you do very well   that's how it goes  see over here we are bothered about linguistics and grammar and all we don't know what's happening in india no the whole   this way it's in such a turmoil stage and we are not we are more or less  not bothered about  we are more or less more we are more or less in a linguistic island you say   lingui laughter  cut off from the world   cut off from the world and daily now we le read linguistic talk linguistic walk linguistic and we have to be conscious of our actions and all these things no all the time can't we live free  actually when we return we'll have to get into our old habit for sometime and then comeback to linguistics again laughs  that's all  nothing to  but i don't know what i am going to do for the exams no ?  it's such a i have never been so unprepared for the exams as i am now  because uh i just couldn't study and now all the things are coming in at once yeah  you can get you are getting to understand the whole thing at once you know  so naturally it's very difficult for us to take uh  things inside and capture it and then produce it   and repeat in the examination paper actually it's very tough   but then   but  it is one way it's good that atleast we are getting to know something atleast better than because all of us can't take leave all of can't be accomodated in hyderabad in c i f l  so it's one way we are getting a touch of it not the whole thing but a touch of it  whatever it is you know i am not the results  i was interested to get some of my concept clear  and i feel i was able to clear some of it i was bothered about my pronunciation i was bothered about some of my grammatical mistakes and all that and there was nobody there whom i could approached to you see so i thought this course would be a great help to me i am not bothered about the result part of it   even i  actually because we teach in a our circumstances and surroundings are so no that we get we are separated from the english speaking people as it is because in my place no one speaks english only i speak  and whom i to speak in that way   that's why we are confined in our area especially i living in this rural area these people they don't even know english nothing so it becomes very difficult for me  and i was getting to forget my pronunciations also now you see you see dr jairaman you want in my group today no  dr jairaman check me so many time  but i i don't know how it come to because i i in pronunciations i was never checked  that was one thing spelling and pronunciation i was always right you know  but just because i am not habituated with i am not  getting   practice  one thing right from school days i should say uhm some of the pronunciation that we were taught was wrong  and whatever i had picked up it is from the media whatever it is because i had interest in it i tried to rectify myself  but whatever we were taught during our school days was something  completely different  and almost i should say it was something wrong that was taught to us so i feel these things should be taught to the primary teachers  they should go through these  all the english medium school the so called english medium schools  the teacher should go through this sort of training where they can rectify the pronunciation before they give it to little one  definitely   it should be  yeah because it is there where the base is formed  and once things get destructed there means whole life is  they can't change you can't change  if you rec it's mean very it's  uh difficult to rectify the wrong and then come in to correction you know we learnt in our method haan this thing  haan  but actually i was taught in a very i told you last night no that i had a very surrounding and very good uh people  who taught me so it came in to me as my first language  i even forgot my mother tongue when i first went into  there learning not learning it was a language acquisition rather than language learning for me  because i was placed in that position so i am very lucky in that way you know which i got now how but  now how   but  just because i am placed my setting now the atmosphere i live in is totally bengali  so naturally i am getting to forget it i i said i'll another few days if i stay over there i'll  also forget the name of sha the spelling of shakespeare   yeah  actually you have to give  haan that's very natural  sneeze  one thing in our place that is in that is in bhubaneshwar  first and foremost if you speak english means they will alienate you  haan  they will say that means we are of  showing off and all these things they'll say  relationship there becomes very formal you have to speak in oriya in order to be like them otherwise they will just throw you out of their group no but here they think that they'll you are showing off  haan  if you speak english you are showing off  haan  that is another part of it  and one more thing another thing how i rectified myself because all almost all all of us all my brother and sisters we have read in english medium school  and naturally we used to fight and quarrel a lot a lot yeah and we used to do that in english   so that is how we use to rectify each other and  somehow we could that is how i could i can speak little bit of correct yes english   yes it was   yes  but you are actually the means thing that they should  uh i think uh they should e extend the say you know of this course  it should be one and half months or two months you no uhm or they can organised the contact programme and then take the examination that are later date because we have to we can't just read the books  and we can't form the ideas see you see the ways  dr this mr v he was totally changed actually because he was uh the concepts are clear not clear to us   of course  we have got the book language the language of the book and we just learn it like that and we put it out  but we have to clear the concept we have to get the actual technical lang languages the term we have to get  like i answered the right thing today i had that concept but i didn't know the actual technicality i have to express it  because in the book they are just given no one explained it to us no  that's why  yeah how to express it  for that we need one more month one more month yes this is too short actually  that's what i'm suggesting  they should have the programme programme programme and then afterwards   and then  the exams afterwards they should they should they should do that it should have that way yeah the organisation and now uh uhm what is that heads are so crammed crammed isn't it any way it is difficult and i think in lingistic paper i am going to write my literature in my literature paper i'll do my politics  laughter  i don't know what i am going to do  oh yours your head is not reeling any more no ? no in the morning i had a tough time i thought i was going to fall down even i thought i was fal you wouldn't feel to go also i was getting quite scared you know  but i was definite it was because of the food yesterday not should have i think it was my pressure  pressure went up  may be the pressure has gone up high again  and i was scared  but you  you got medicine for it  no i didn't bring my medicine why ? because i am very bad at taking medicine  no but should you know these are life saving drugs you know you should keep them so that is the that was the problem and today if i wouldn't have taken little rest i don't know what i would have done throughout the day  yeah you should have no but uh i think you must be because your stomach was upset that's why the pressure up it must be upset no upset in the sense that you didn't take food it was empty all the gas formation and all that it can i know suddenly this reeling sensation  it was something from that as soon as i got up from the bed i needed support  i thought i was going to fall down somewhere  so i hurriedly had everything i had my bath and everything and finally i came down to thejust  you can feast for the night today no  haan laughter  i missed it i really missed it awful  i didn't know actually and i this lady this rekha she came and told me then she had sent it i should say we have got uh  so i  she said she had sent it so i said she had sent i thought they had arranged the boys and all and i haven't given my name  so i said i won't take it i said take it back please i won't take it  she should have told me miss ranjana sent it then i could have because it was also not good to sent the refuse the thing back no it was but i told her i explained that i didn't know it actually  and now what class do we have ?  it's another class of grammar and linguistics again
