hello and welcome to the highlights of the fourth one day
international between india  and the west indies 
""
india  were leading two one  before the match  at the
barabati stadium cuttuck 
""
the west indies desperately needing to  win here  to level
off the series at two all  and to make it  a real live affair  for
the fifth  one day international  at jaipur which follows
on friday 
""
the west indies made one change  beside that it lost at vizag 
they dropped barrington browne and preferred to strengthen their batting 
bringing in  shivnarine chanderpaul 
""
india  had to drop navjot siddhu who was injured and brought in
atul bedade  but surprisingly  they brought back chetan sharma  in
place of  venkatesh prasad 
""
it was a cloudy morning  when courtney walsh the west indian
captain won the toss and elected to bat 
""
we pick up the play  of the very first ball of the morning 
""
 it's  manoj prabhakar  bowling to phil simmons 
""
""
 in hindi 
""
""
west   it's  fascinating structure there 
""
people standing on the balconies 
""
looking end of the side screen  like the centre piece of
pavilion 
""
 that's  gone away  for four runs 
""
simmons aiming it well 
""
striking it at off the space just behind square 
""
that was  favourite cut of simmons 
""
a cut short  centre wide  there is two ways of cutting one
with the  horizontal bat and one with perpendicular  that was the 
perpendicular  way of playing the square cut 
""
 it's  straight away to azharuddin there in the gully
""
that was an exotic catch  phil went into the trap and it went
straight away  to azhar
""
""
quite difficult to tell really 
""
simmons got back really and  hit it  very hard 
""
here  i had seen that was a catch
""
indeed  azharuddin  a very  agile  normally was
amongst 
""
""
that end up  very very powerful over
""
azharuddin had  had to go to his  right 
""
""
this is a good start by the west indies because uh  there
was a quite a bit of moment  early on  uh in this wicket and uh 
the two of them have counted that very well 
""
""
great shot there by simmons  like he go for  runs 
four runs  square cut 
""
""
that really is a trademark shot of uh  simmons uh  shot
 a little bit of width  being a tall man  standing up here 
""
""
that balls are by chetan giving williams all those to play his
shot back foot  cover drive
""
four runs 
""
williams particularly is very good at shot 
""
""
well he gave that a fair old whack uh  that steuart
williams  a ball to be head short  and on a wicket  of this nature
now with the  uh ball not coming on to the bat   that's  a free
hand for the batsman specially the west indian batsman with such good
backfoot there 
""
there  he's  given it a fair old thump 
""
""
could be out 
""
yes he is 
""
good catch by manoj 
""
 that's  a generous  really happy and very good well
judged that  catch by manoj there
""
running back a little bit 
""
and there  william's  gone 
""
first wicket for india  and to chetan sharma 
""
""
williams not getting on top of that short ball i think he was
beaten a little bit by pace here and  uh hurried on to him and uh 
ball coming a lot quicker then he expected and getting the top edge and manoj
prabhakar here running around taking a good catch 
""
that will do chetan sharma as a morale world of good 
""
caught prabhakar  bowled sharma for fifteen 
""
 that's  more of a desperate shot stepping out 
""
uh but well played  outside a square drive stepping out
""
 that's  a very good shot to play 
""
four runs there 
""
""
 in hindi 
""
""
in the air but  it's  safe 
""
lara not trying to bow  but  he've  still soon then
""
but  he's  gone off fast on it  for that to go away 
for four runs 
""
""
sharma now to hooper 
""
jadeja was giving his side he is out 
""
what a brilliant throw and uh  a very well field 
""
hooper does is out
""
what a marvellous piece of cricket from jadeja  but careless by
hooper who was very  one word  to walk about like that 
""
""
certainly very very careless and another wicket of west indies
could not afford to lose  particular hooper being run out
""
hooper has been playing so well 
""
and that is uh  uh uh  for a big support for the west indies
team  uhm  hooper there playing the ball  uh to a shot mid-wicket
 just taken off  and  jadeja coming in and pick the ball up and a
lovely throw hit the wicket on time 
""
seventy-seven for three 
""
""
 it's  straight 
""
 it's  another good short there by  lara 
""
shrinath is the fielder
""
coming back  for the second  and it was fast throw  but
 not out says the umpire 
""
but this indian team so certainly  hit in the stumps from all
over the field 
""
uh again that could have been pretty close  if lara played it to
mid-wicket  and  and  shrinath run  run they have taken up and a
lovely throw in 
""
see there lara  is in there just in time 
""
once again he has to chase the run he won't get that 
""
it was played very fine by lara 
""
late and fine  and nicely controlled 
""
in the air and a big appeal 
""
no says the umpire mr jose kurushinkal that came off the pad 
so 
""
have a look at that one again 
""
another particularly good shot  and  up  and uh  very
good decision 
""
well  that's  the edge  it's  four runs 
""
all is fair in love and war as they say 
""
the end of the over 
""
twenty-four overs and  it's  ninety-nine  for three 
 applaud and whistles 
""
so lara well he is beginning to  make a significant score even
though he work on the score is  many of his runs made  one word 
like that 
""
""
""
and another fielder at the other end 
""
 it's   one word  to time  again the counter term
with the mis field by anil kumble 
""
""
well he did that well for four
""
it was a lovely shot  moving freely into the half volly 
""
kumble now to lara 
""
well that was delicately played 
""
and that is gone away  for four runs 
""
just about as fine as you could get it 
""
kumble now to arthurton 
""
and that runs for arthurton to fine leg it could well go for four
there 
""
it does 
""
so a productive over for  the west indies
""
twenty-five overs have gone   it's  a hundred and
thirteen  for three 
""
and  that's  beautifully played by lara  wide across at
short fine leg 
""
""
four more 
""
""
runs certainly coming in 
""
""
very good running between the wicket 
""
excellent 
""
""
 in hindi 
""
""
 that's  a lovely shot there 
""
and over the top 
""
six runs 
""
brian have been trying to play the shot for quite sometime 
from the last over  he has been successful now 
""
""
 it's  arthurton facing raju 
""
""
uh that should be a close one 
""
uh i thought he played right across the line ravi 
""
""
here the ball is spinning so   it's it's  not easy
for raju to  get a leg before decision unless  it's    it's
 a straight throw as you can see its pitched outside the line and uh 
the batsman also has its foot outside the off stump 
""
""
umpire has given him out 
""
it was a magnificient catch 
""
 arthur  arthurton  stepping out  stepping down 
from the  one word  end  was a big  one word  and bat back
 caught brilliantly by mongia  at just silly mid on 
""
""
straight drive beautiful shot all the way  almost going to
the boundary
""
yes it is  long on boundary wide off long on  fielder had
no chance 
""
""
very good shot there by brian  lara 
""
""
square cut there 
""
lara  lara has been playing the shot very well all the way for
four runs 
""
""
there again brilliant paceman   that's  a  bad
ball from raju giving lara room and in this kind of form he is not going to
waste uh  deliveries of that kind there 
""
playing it late and beating the fielder at  deep point giving
him absolutely no chance 
""
like i said this is a much better brian lara you are seeing 
""
""
stepping down before the ball is delivered  straight down
and well fielded
""
no 
""
yes it is 
""
just inside the boundary line well done by raju  once again
just two runs 
""
""
raju in the end doing well 
""
to stop the ball just inside the fence 
""
""
oh  there and he is out 
""
umpire has given him out 
""
wicket keeper umpire  that's  a good skill  good piece
of keeping by mongia  who picked up all the loss done by and uh  and
this lara being stumped 
""
stumped mongia  bowled  kumble 
""
""
ah there is excellent piece of glove work here by nain mongia
because brian lara  slipped a bit when he played that shot and just
dragged his leg  outside as uh  you would be able to see here
""
there you see  just dragging and mongia in a flash  and his
leg is  just an inch outside the crease maybe even on the line but 
that's  out 
""
  a good  decision by the umpire there 
""
""
 but that is  
""
""
end of the thirty ninth over
""
west indies are one ninety one for five 
""
and  the new batsman coming in 
""
should be chanderpaul 
""
""
batsman  one word  chanderpaul hasn't played a match
after the bombay  one day 
""
and he should be replacing lara 
""
left hander replacing another left hander 
""
""
very important wicket for india that because  lara was
looking extremely dangerous 
""
he is a type of player who likes to play long innings and he had
uh  still another fourteen overs to go 
""
""
 that's  way he was out 
""
""
high play and he is given out
""
yes  going right across the line of delivery 
""
and again umpire jayprakash  giving chanderpaul out 
""
l b w bowled jadeja 
""
""
funny all this game can change uh  you lose the wicket
 when side is cruising
""
and now here again chanderpaul playing across the line  to
delivery from jadeja that was coming in and  paying the penalty 
""
wide of the crease jadeja angling at it  and as you can see
 chanderpaul  one word  is not playing across 
""
""
score one ninety-two for six now west indies 
""
 that's  well played there 
""
and manoj  shot that by just like stepping for the going near
the ball and four runs all the way 
""
""
with two fielders they are pretty close to each other  the
man at short third and backward point  there is a very little gap there
 but uh  holder placing the ball to perfection 
""
he was waiting on it 
""
and at the very last minute tabbing it down  and placing it
beautifully past manoj prabhakar 
""
once it beaten  the other fielders had absolutely no chance
""
""
""
 that's  wide over there  and  manoj prabhakar
alternate
""
yes he has gone in there 
""
a simple catch manoj prabhakar at long on  and junior murray
is out 
""
caught prabhakar  bowled jadeja 
""
""
trying to hit the ball out of the ground he has just come in
to bat uh  and  it's   gather shot by uh murray  because he
needed to give his senior partner  holder as much of the strike as
possible
""
there was no need for a short of this kind 
""
there is still over fifty balls to play and west indies should be
trying and picking up uh  the single ones and twos and allowing uh 
holder to do  face on the the bowling because uh  losing wickets at
this stage regularly can put tremendous pressure on the new man who comes in
""
""
""
the score is two hundred and two for seven  west indies
""
""
""
jadeja to holder 
""
 that's  in the air   it's  going over the top
for six 
""
uh  kambli also has gone over the top  uh he was unable as
well 
""
""
he has some of the gut shot uh  before he picks it up
early 
""
""
gone into position 
""
so  it's  going to be  kumble now to bowl to andy
cummins 
""
cummins is gone  he is given out  he was  sweeping 
there and uh  the umpire uh  mr kurushinkal has turned out there so
cummins is on his way 
""
""
uh that fell well  whether we take that probably just at
the outside of the off stump 
""
no one is certain as to what happen 
""
uh except obviously the wicket keeper mongia 
""
the bail is off  and walsh is gone 
""
he has asked the indian perhaps they said well  one word 
and very  unspendidly he has taken that word for it and he is out 
""
well it was very difficult to say because he seem to be right
cover in the wicket  and just pushing at the ball  as you can see
there 
""
and it seems that it his pad in the way
""
but  it's   probably just  took the  outside
edge of the stumps 
""
yes yes there you can see the wicket keeper gloves is  away
back and you see the man in there  and  two twenty-eight for nine
""
""
 one word  uhm  shrinath again to holder 
""
""
oh is it that may be a mild  but he didn't picked this
well
""
 it's  well fielded by kumble 
""
shrinath now to   one word  cuffy 
""
""
another full toss he played it before 
""
well that was perfectly played and it takes cuffy to nine 
""
""
he couldn't have played that very safe
""
""
well i think that cuffy can raise and walk in  and hooper
 because hooper played that  similiar kind of shot when he  played
in the last game
""
when he went inside to the full toss
""
and that was a lovely shot 
""
as you can see cuffy gets an inside there 
""
""
he played that didn't he  ?
""
uhm skidding it wide of the leg stump 
""
""
cuffy there was coming down looking for the big hit 
""
umpire examining  two words  i think so 
""
""
cuffy  but  it's  a get down on target out 
""
i got some uh  upon the hot shot like uh  i got some
sensational news his highest score in this cricket is one 
""
he never scored more than singles so he  reaching his  top
score as fifteen runs 
""
last ball being bowled now 
""
oh he is obviously over there going for single oh   laughs
""
""
""
and i tell you what prabhakar he hadn't put his hand to the
when that ball hit the wicket
