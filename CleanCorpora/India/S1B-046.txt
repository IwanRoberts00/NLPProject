""
today  we've   prof h k das  in the studios 
""
and  we will uh enter into discussion with prof h k das  on
various aspects of uh  modern research which is going on in the biology
""
""
prof das  is director  of genetic engineering unit  in
jawaharlal nehru university 
""
and currently  he is the chairman  of  uh centre for
biotechnology  in the same university that is jawaharlal nehru university
""
""
prof das  i would like to ask you  what is uh  the
background or the history  of genetic engineering research  in india
 ?
""
""
yes uh bb i think it will be  interesting to trace back the
history 
""
uhm  you see somewhere around nineteen  eighty-two  uh prof
m g k menon  had called  some of the biologists  of the country 
uh  for a meeting at baroda 
""
trying to discuss  as to  what are the areas that  should
receive thrust  for research in india 
""
and  that's  where uh people like us  uh had emphasised
 that uh  we are  running out of time and we should initiate genetic
engineering research in india
""
you see prior to that  uh the science administrators  had
always felt that genetic engineering  is too sophisticated and uh  it
cannot be done in india 
""
it can be done only in the highly developed countries 
""
but  we we could convince prof menon that there is nothing 
nothing so sophisticated in genetic engineering or recombinant in technology
 and it can very well be done  uh in our country
""
uh and  he didn't take long  to understand the point 
""
and uh  it was decided that the department of  science and
technology uh  should start some core research units  uh to  to
initiate genetic engineering research in india
""
uh  applications were invited and uh   that's  how 
 a  three  units were established
""
one  in the indian institute of science bangalore  uhm
another in bose institute calcutta  and the third one in jawaharlal nehru
university  in delhi 
""
later another unit was added and uh  that was uh  in madurai
 kamraj university
""
uh  the purpose was that  they should serve as a focal point
""
""
so that  people from the nearby area could come and learn the
techniques  and genetic engineering research  can spread in the country
""
""
uh you know this has worked very well
""
now  almost  in all  good biological laboratories in the
country  genetic engineering is being used 
""
but  that's  how the whole thing was started 
""
""
uh coming to the next one 
""
in fact i wanted to ask you after this  brief background which
is not a very  long history for genetic engineering to start in india 
""
eighty-two is not far off 
""
what is the current status of genetic engineering research  uh
in india or in   it's  labs of india  ?
""
""
uh uh  the current status uh  is is a very encouraging i
must say
""
and uh  uhm if i may go back again uhm  to what i was saying
""
uh  each of these centres three units of genetic engineering uh
 was uh  entrusted with the job of doing a particular kind of genetic
engineering research  in the country
""
uhm  uhm the unit in  jawaharlal nehru university was
supposed to work on  uh the molecular genetic of nitrogen fixation 
""
""
you have mentioned that your unit  of which you are the
director  is endowed with the  responsibility of uh carrying out
research  on nitrogen fixation
""
""
 that's  right 
""
""
so uh  will you elaborate a little bit what is nitrogen
fixation ?
""
because we keep hearing about  nitrogen fixing    yes
 microbe    yes  and perhaps they have some other
""
""
 yes  
""
""
 yes  
""
""
yes
""
the the  meaning of nitrogen fixation chemically  uh is
reduction of a molecular nitrogen 
""
and uh when i was a student or you were a student   we've
 heard about the hoberbosh process    yeah  of uh 
industrially reducing nitrogen
""
uh  but uh  you know there are micro-organisms  who can
also reduce nitrogen on that
""
reduce nitrogen at ordinary temperature and pressure
""
you don't have to  go very high  uh in the temperature or
pressure 
""
and this micro-organisms  uh reduce nitrogen  and form amonia
and its derivatives 
""
and  that's  what  is biological nitrogen fixation 
""
and i don't have to  uh overemphasis the importance of this
because  uh uh this is the only source of all nitrogenous compounds  in
the living world 
""
like the meat or fish we consume today  though  uh the the
animals or the fish cannot fix nitrogen  they live on plants   
right  and and the plants cannot fix nitrogen  so they get the nitrogen
fixed from the microbes 
""
so  so bb  this fixed nitrogen  is is the only biological
source in addition to of course the industrially  fixed nitrogen
""
""
 yeah  
""
""
 right  
""
""
fixed nitrogen
""
""
yes 
""
""
so these nitrogen fixtures  as you say are microbes and
your work  is also related to them
""
""
yes 
""
""
so uh there may be many  types of uh    nitrogen
fixing or of many types 
""
""
 sure there are many there are many types   uh uhm
 if i may classify them 
""
uh generally speaking    wa    you  
could  uh uh group them  in  a   classes like  symbiotic
nitrogen fixation 
""
uh which means that  the micro-organisms by themselves 
cannot fix nitrogen but they must  uh enter into a symbiotic arrangement
 with a particular plant 
""
uh uhm  and the genous risobium    yeah  and uh 
i'm  sure this is a very familiar name  uh is is the one which does it
""
""
""
 yeah  
""
""
so uh  the genous the various species of risobium  would
enter into symbiotic relationship  with various  leguminous plants 
except   for one or two plants 
""
""
 for one or two plants  
""
""
by  legu  excuse me by leguminous plants you mean 
the pulses
""
""
 that's  right
""
""
uh uh
""
""
leguminous plants  uh uh are  are the pulses   
one word  yeah and uh since  india is uh a a big  vegetarian uh 
diet consuming  uh country  the pulses are very important source of 
uh nitrogen
""
""
  one word   
""
""
nitrogen or protein 
""
""
even if one is a non-vegetarian  because the cost of
non-vegetarian food is very high
""
so  the general mass of the country would live on vegetarian
dishes 
""
and the pulses are very important suppliers of nitrogen 
""
""
so these risobia  they uh  enter into an association
 with these leguminous plants
""
""
 that's  right 
""
""
and then  the  what have  what is the benefit of
that association
""
""
i will tell you
""
the form what you call  nodules  which can be very small or
slightly big  in the roots  of these plants
""
and some stray instances of shoot  or stem nodules also
""
but generally speaking root nodules 
""
and as a result  uh a lot of  fix nitrogen would be given to
the plant 
""
so that the legumes  uh would    fo    form
  the crop 
""
uh fixing atmospheric nitrogen uh by using  these bacterial
species 
""
uh this is one kind uh
""
there is another kind which we call  associative nitrogen
fixation  where the plant  uh would associate themselves with 
micros  micro-organisms
""
but there is no  uh uh rigid symbiotic arrangement 
""
and that uh  kind of  syn  uh uh fixation of nitrogen
 is very important for nonlegumes 
""
the cereal plants for   example  like  uh we rice 
rice etcetera
""
""
 right  
""
""
uhm uhm
""
""
and as a spirillum  this is one important genus  uh
which enters into association with cereal plants 
""
there could be a third class where there is no association 
""
the micro organisms can fix nitrogen  in a free living state
""
doesn't need any plant nothing  and as agrobactor  is an
example of the third class
""
and  today in india  both as a spirillum species and as
agrobactor species are used in the fields  for cereal plants to augument
the crop production
""
and there is absolutely no doubt  that both these uh  impart
beneficial affect to cereal crop production 
""
""
prof das you are working on uh   a agrobactor  
uh on ndie    uhm uhm  uh which is a free  living nitrogen
fixture 
""
so why have you uh  selected this field  to work out its
genetics or bio fixing ?
""
""
 uhm uhm  
""
""
you see uh uh i  i'm i'm  basically a bio-chemist
""
and uh  i i had been uh quite attracted by a agrobactor  uh
because of  uh mainly two reasons 
""
one is that  though in general  this nitrogen fixation  a
machinery inside a cell  is very sensitive to oxygen 
""
in agrobactor the fixatiion goes on in air  in the  
presence of oxygen 
""
""
 yeah yeah  
""
""
so it has its own mechanism  by which it protects the
nitrogen fixation machinery  which is not there in other organisms
""
uh uh  some organisms can protect but only when some
specialised structures are formed
""
but in agrobactor  the the cell by itself  does it
""
this was  one very interesting point for us to get interest in
agrobactor 
""
the other point was of course  that uh  we wanted to work
with something  that would be useful for cereal crops 
""
uh because  that's  by far  uh the  uh the more
important crop in india
""
uhm  and of course slowly we have learnt that there are many
other interesting points in agrobactor as we have  worked with agrobactor
""
""
like it has  some alternative pathways of nitrogen fixation 
""
which uh  possibly is not there in the other conventional 
uh bacterial species
""
""
so besides uh  this alternative  pathway for nitrogen
fixation 
""
uh what are the other uh unique findings  that have uh  uh
been done in your  lab ?
""
""
uhm
""
""
or in under  in  your directorship ?
""
""
sure  uh uhm 
""
""
or you can elaborate that this   is the only thing
which contains everything itself 
""
""
 yes if i can tell everything itself  
""
yes 
""
agrobactor we have learnt  the   has another unique
character 
""
uh and that is it has a huge amount of dna in it 
""
dna as you know is the  is the genetic material  and uh 
uh for a bacteria  uh it is really huge
""
uh  the standard in bacteria is considered to be  the micro
organism  one word  which  all of us have in the  in organs
""
 it's  friendly bacteria which synthesises vitamins in us
""
""
and agrobactor has as much as forty times more dna  in in its
single cell 
""
and  that's    what has attracted  our attention
""
""
""
 might have  one word   
""
""
and we have recently uh uh  established that agrobactor
 one word  has  as many as eighty chromosomes in it 
""
which are almost the size  uh of an  one word 
chromosome 
""
but uh  altogether eighty chromosomes  uh looks like all of
them are similar 
""
and nobody knows why they are there  and what they are doing
""
""
and this is what  is of interest to us  at this present
moment
""
so in addition to the nitrogen  fixation uh  interest that
we have first agrobactor this is also another  interesting point uh 
that needs attention in agrobactor 
""
""
uh these  microbes that  you have talked about  are
also doing another job that is they are economising on the  fertilizer
requirement   of the crop  that means it has some  application
in agriculture
""
""
  that's  right  
""
""
very much  so very much 
""
""
so uh can you please elaborate on  on those aspects 
   that's  
""
""
 you see   uh uh  you see the most effective
 the  biological fertilizer is of course risobium 
""
the effect that you get is is a  much more striking  in case
of risobium 
""
uh but the problem with risobium is that  uh you can use it
only  for legumes
""
or the or the pulses
""
""
uhm uhm 
""
""
uh  dals  that we take  uh
""
and  there's  absolutely no doubt that  it it brings up
yield  several wholes high 
""
but  in the case of  one word  agrobactor  it's 
not as good as  as risobium
""
but again  uh risobium cannot do anything for your cereal crops
""
""
yeah
""
""
and for cereal crops  uh it has been established that 
uh again  it's  in the field 
""
not not just in the lab  that uh  uh it it  it gives an
yield somewhere  could be anywhere between ten to forty percent more
""
""
 haan 
""
""
and for some  fodder crops  the yield could be even
double 
""
and specifically only for fodder crops
""
  using uhm agrobactor 
""
so you simply  uh inoculate the seed  with these bacteria
 and then sow the seed 
""
""
 uhm uhm  
""
""
and there the  micro organisms multiply  and then
supply the nitrogen 
""
and the other point is that it not only  uhm has the good
effect on that crop  the crop that comes next  also gets the benefit
because  some of the fix nitrogen stay on in the soil 
""
and the next crop also   getting gets  the benefit 
of this inoculation 
""
""
 gets the benefit  
""
""
uh since you are  uh heading such a  good  and
dedicated  scientists team  of genetic engineering unit  uh there
previously there was a euphoria of genetic engineering 
""
now we hear quite often of biotechnology 
""
uh since you are an expert in this area  can you uh tell us 
uh is there any distinction between the two or do they overlap  or they
are  one and the same thing
""
""
no uh  let me put it this way uh  genetic engineering
is included in biotechnology 
""
uh the the so much that you hear about biotechnology today  i
dare say  is because of genetic engineering
""
because  biotechnology was there  like like the wine that
was there from the time immemorial
""
""
yeah
""
""
you you you could consider it  as a biotechnological 
uh uh phenomenon    yeah  preparing a wine 
""
""
 yeah  
""
""
or even  the  gober  gas that you hear so
much about    is biotechnology  uh but   it's  the
genetic engineering  uh development of genetic engineering that has given
a real boost to biotechnology 
""
""
  a few words   
""
""
uh genetic engineering is included in biotechnology but
biotechnology  uh could deal with other things also like tissue culture
""
""
which is also very important today 
""
like certain certain plants have been propogated by tissue culture
""
""
and those are disease free plants 
""
and there there is no genetic engineering  but thats included
in biotechnology 
""
or or even this conventional  vaccine making  is is
biotechnology
""
but i am sure you heard that  now  you you have better
vaccines  which have been uh constructed using genetic engineering tools
or  one word  tools 
""
""
that means biotechnology was already there    very
much  but genetic engineering provided  uh tools which  has hasten
the process of
""
""
 very much  
""
""
 that's that's  the way i i i would look at
biotechnology today 
""
""
prof das do you think that whatever you are doing  or your
group or  genetic engineers are doing in india or all over  do they
have  any relevance to the people or masses  ?
""
like your organism for example has  uh the direct benefit 
in agriculture 
""
what are the other areas where we can uhm make best use of this
 uh genetic engineering unit  or genetic engineering researches  or
researches in modern biology
""
""
there can be many examples  and some of these have been
tried abroad 
""
i i i will start with an example which i always give  and 
that's  the example of human insulin 
""
you know the uh all diabetics  must take insulin 
""
now insulin  is naturally made in the pancreas of animals
including us 
""
so  when we fail to make our own insulin we have to take
insulin from outside 
""
and that insulin used to come  only from animal pancreas 
""
so animals would have to be slaughtered  and the insulin would
have to be isolated  and then processed and we take injection 
""
uh so  that's  what they have done is they had projected
the need of insulin 
""
and they have found that they would soon come  when you just
would not able to kill as many animals  to supply the  uh insulin
""
this is point number one
