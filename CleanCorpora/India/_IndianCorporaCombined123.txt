this man was lucky  mr doraswamy who has been in captivity now for weeks of agonizing weeks  agonizing both for his family and for the nation  we still don't know when he is and if he is going to be released now terrorism itself is a form of blackmail  but holding hostages is even worse  we have here now on my immediate left mr george verghese  the distinguished journalist and mr jamanadas akhtar the distinguished writer  both happened to be members of the press council  but we have resisted the temptation of discussing george's  famous report  because george has better face his critics not his supporters  now george would you give us some of the national and international dimensions of this holding hostages  well taking of hostages has been with us for sometimes  uh throughout history hostages have been used as a means of building up pressure on authority of whatever kind  in more recent times we have seen high-jacking as taking up hostages in the air  whole groups of perfectly innocent people who are flying from one place to some other destination  and using that to ask for whatever it is left the captors wanted  around the ground as we've seen in many part of the world and in our own country uh the taking of hostages is again being used as a means to pressurise authority  to use to specific demands that are made by various  groups that take them in captivity   we've just seen the clip about the swedes who were taken hostages in kashmir and u f f to mr doraswamy  but we have the same problem in other parts of india in assam in andhra pradesh may be in punjab  and in other parts of the world in iran in lebanon and uh  elsewhere  so that this is becoming a universal phenomenon and one which  civilize nations and government and communities have to fight   it's not an easy task because it is traumatic both for the individuals and their families as well as to the governments who have to decide and for the community at large  miss akhtar with a special background of kashmir connection would you like to through some light  yes  i would like to confine myself to the problem in kashmir  i remember that in nineteen seventy-seven when i was in birmingham the kashmir liberation front leaders were there they had their headquarters  they had abducted a senior diplomat from the india  indian high commission  they wanted to get release mr makbul butt  but when the government didn't release they killed that indian diplomat  and after that makbul gutt butt  was hanged in tihar jail  the same jammu and kashmir liberation front british  news alleged major amanulla had their head quarters in muzaffarabad and also in karachi   he went he run away to america  when the government wanted to arrest him  he came back to kashmir and came back to kashmir  and pakistan  he organized a gang and he started terrorism  uh at the first uh his uh party didn't uh indulged in kidnapping  but there're other groups in kashmir  the main group is hizbul mujahideen  it is controlled by the jamait-e-islami of pakistan  and its head in pakistan is kazi hussain ahmed   this this jamait as you remember i think that in the last phase of the bangladesh government these jamait islami workers they picked up several uhm professors  doctors and others and killed them in dacca  and this jamait islami it was accused of uh hiring the services of uhm of sayed akbar who had assassinated mr liyakat ali khan  another worker of the jamait islami had assassinated dr khan sahib  and now they have uh so many workers there're so many terrorist a a armed terrorist they had uh fighting they were fighting in afghanistan  then they shifted to muzaffarabad  they are infiltrating into kashmir valley of kashmir  and mainly this this gang is responsible for kidnapping the uh intellectuals professors engineers and others you imply that our friend and neighbour is actively involved yes it is actively involved   he will not it will he will not say that he is actively or any way involved in it for instance in ninety-seven forty-seven when pakistan attacked kashmir the pakistan government said no we're  not involved in it  these are some tribals who are who has gone there to help their brothers  in sixty-five when pakistan again attacked kashmir general ayub khan said no we are not concerned with it  the people of kashmir has risen in rebellion in nineteen seventy-one they attacked again kashmir  and when general zia at uh induced or   organized a rebellion in in afghanistan he said no we're not concerned with the rebellion   we're just helping these uh uh sharnarthis  from afghanisthan   we're not giving anything uh uh arms or weapons or other anything to these uh persons  now this same group headed by that gulbadan hikmat yar  is organizing these raids   pakistan government is supplying weapons and  we know that what is going going on in karachi now jamait islami says that its workers are being kidnapped and and tortured and assassinated in karachi by their political elements   one word  are there training schools for kidnapping too do they yes they have   they they have kidnapping and training schools for kidnapping and terrorism around muzaffarabad and then in tribal area  george do you agree with this uh analysis or view  well i i'm not sure about the background and the  uh details because question of kidnapping and hostages is not confined  to kashimr as i said it's a phenomenon one finds uh in   many many places in our own country and abroad  the question is why is it done ?  it's a form of psychological warfare to build pressure  whether for political aims or for other aims  now in kashmir there are several groups  you mentioned the swedes  i think uh they were detained by particular group i am not sure whether jungbaz jungbaz the the jungbaz force   i'm not sure whether it is the same group that has uh kidnapped  jungbaz jungbaz  is it true that the groups run into hundreds now  more than one hundred  what the  more the official count is about one hundred and forty-three uhm  but here again the the problem that the authorities face  is in dealing with uh a multitude of different groups which have perhaps different sub-motivations within a larger purpose  and the question that the country has to face is whether in the kashmir or elsewhere  how does one deal with this ? does one submit ? does one give in ? or does one hold out and with what consequences ?  but it  i think this is the central issue that needs to be faced   but it  it it suits our friendly neighbour to have as many groups as possible so that you know you can't deal with anyone particular   so that no political solution is possible isn't it  ?  well  well that well that may be so uhm  but as i would say if one looks at the problem in assam  alpha or peoples war group in andhra it's a different set of circumstances there  but kidnappings yeah have been used as a prime instrument of pressure therefore it's not just kashmir and i think we need to look at this not as isolated problems kashmir or andhra or assam or anywhere else  but to try and fasten a national approach to dealing with the problem that could adopt anywhere for the variety of political  and other reasons  yeah  but you see even the former home minister's   daughter was kidnapped and there was prompt action  one criticism was that they acted propmtly because he was the home minister of the country  yes  now in the case of others it drags on as in case of dorayswamy for weeks  would you view this as a moral problem as a legal problem  as a national problem  how would you categorise this problem george ? well it's not a legal problem   it's really illegal   it's beyond the bounds of the law and and and the constitution yeah  it is a moral problem uhm and a political problem  uhm  uhm the kidnapping of the home minister the former home minister mufti uh sayeed's daughter uh rubia sayeed was perhaps the first of this latest series  and may be thinking a new government had come into being and a new chapter was opening there was some pressure on the government to release  uh to negotiate with the uh captors of this young lady and secure her release and the other view was the government should have held out  because there was strong criticism of the kidnapping of a woman  which was considered to be unislamic against any of the traditions that were being upheld uh as the course which the struggle was being waged  but for what ever reason the government gave in  i must confess that i myself for that time went along with the feeling that all right if the release is granted uh and this young hostage is released miss sayeed uh may be that's a good thing  but i think perhaps we need to think afresh because once that  is has happened it has made it more difficult for the government in successive cases to take a stand because the question immediately uh raised is well why aren't you negotiating for the release of this hostage ? is it because he or she does not have a home minister  as a father or some other very important person as a brother  and does not the life of an ordinary average person count as much ? that is the dilemma that we now face  perhaps the time has come when i think across the board we have to take a view whether it is kashmir or andhra or assam or  one word or anywhere else  whether it is a government of one complexion or another call an all party meeting to take a national view of how the nation should deal with hostages  otherwise one is going to be blackmailed all along the line everywhere by anybody  what do you think miss akhtar mansoor  two word i feel that there is no difference  between kidnapping for ransom or kidnapping for putting pressures  to get the criminals released  what happens a man murders six seven eight twenty   per persons  when he is arrested his party kidnaps any person  maybe two three four persons a professor may be a doctor may be engineer or or a high official  and they say that you release our criminal friend  otherwise we will assassinate your persons yes now this is i think this is a crime  and no government should give in  what happens when you start releasing these the  persons the kidnappers they feel that their position has become strong  george if i may express my own view life is more complex than particular formulation  yes  uh there can not be a white and black case of either you release or not release  situations will differ  circumstances will differ personalities will differ  how and in a democracy public opinion will met  well personalities will differ yes  but will principles differ ? that is the question  and i think as jamnadasji has said you are really bargaining  with criminals  take the case of mr doraswamy some people have been released  as part of the bargain uhm which was not kept by the other side according to the government   uhm  uh the kidnappers want one of their leaders i think it is uh mr shalla to be released  now according to the official version mr shalla was responsible uh for the killing earlier of uh some hostages  including prof na nashirul huque  the very distinguished vice chancellor of kashmir university  and subsiquently mr khera the general manager of the h m t plant in shrinagar  now if because of the pressure of mr doraswamy's  kidnapping a killer of two other hosteges earlier is to be released  then what is the principle involved and where is  will it end  because this will be go on from one hostage to another and the government will be made to yield all along the line and that would be unacceptable  i think you are quite right in saying there is no absolute norm  there is no black and white yeah that is true  but some governments the israeli government for instance has taken the line that they are not going to submit to any kidnapping  and let the kidnappers face the consequences of killing  their hostages  let public opinion and their own people turned against them because they too are under psychological pressure   yeah  so i think we need to take a national view otherwise i can't see this problem being uh whisked away   it's going to sail us week after week in one situation or another  what i think we need to do is that to get together all political parties to discuss this  what should be the national policy that is taken ? whether it is a congress government in andhra uh congress government in uh assam and opposition government in some other place president's rule george  assam  frankly i i one or two words any unanimity on any problem in this country  name me one problem on which the country is whole heartedly  unanimously agreed  well if it is not easy but i think if one tries to be still what are the principles ? yes are all hostages of the same ? yeah is the motivation the same ? is it political ? is it criminal ? what is the background ? can one then distill some principles on the basis which public opinion will assert itself  certainly it is one thing to negotiate  but i think negotiation is part of the process of high-jacking  of wearing down the opponent yes  get them confused  get them to contridict themselves  develop rival force and pressures in the other camp weaken their resolve  give more time to investigative forces to find out where these hostages are ? see if if they can be rescued i think that barring a two or three political parties extremist may be in punjab all other political parties will join hands and support the government if the government  wants to take some strong step   yes  george would you favour that there should not be compromise at any cost  what is your personal view ? well as i say i started out in this round ah  personally taking a view that is alright if rubia sayeed was was released   ah  i now feel perhaps that was a mistake   a mistake  because once we did that we were on the slippery slope  and it has been said by others are we not as good as  that young lady ? is it not the same blood ? does the more recent hostages not have parents relatives  friends miss akhtar what is your solution ? my solution is that the government should take strong uh uh position and should get co-operation from the opposition parties  mr sahay the difficulty is that in punjab mr verghese knows though the news have not been appeared they are not so flashed but actually there are so many cases in which the government  have has released criminals  but gentleman would it be a fair summing up  if we say that we agree that holding hostages is one of the most criminal acts   and  absolutely yes  we are agreed that there is uh a need for a national consensus on this  yes  national and international and international and also we are agreed that the political parties should meet  perhaps to that we may add that it's not enough for political parties to meet intellectuals social workers others the inter-state council so that state government brought in   uhm uhm uhm  yes brought in  but that it is not merely a government problem   it's an emotional and human problem absolutely yes and it has to be dealt with at that level  hope so  that's right would you like to add something in about a minute  i think that uh your solution is correct and uh we must support it  george ? yes  well it is uh not merely necessary to built that uh  that that consensus  but also try and understand the psychology at work  so that we can deal with it it is a form of psychological warfare yes so the nation has to be prepared to accept that  and public opinion ultimately must prevail in these matters   and that needs to be educated  than  we may perhaps end this discussion on the note that we  have fervently hope and pray that doraswamy or whoever else  or whoever is held captive probably is released  and the government doesn't really totally surrender on this matter naturally our hearts goes to mrs doraswamy and family  yes and to all others  but this is a problem that we really must confess  significantly the liberation front has also appealed for his release  i hope i mean he gets released soon on this note gentleman i thank you thank you thank you
