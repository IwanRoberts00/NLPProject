archaeology  is said to be concerned with the digging of the
past 
""
of its find  coins form an important source of knowledge 
""
indeed  several kings and chieftains  would have remained
unknown  but for the unearthing and study of the coins issued by them 
""
further  coins reveal the socio-cultural  economic 
religious  and political  life of those times 
""
and hence the importance of numismatics  that is the study of the
coins to the understanding of our ancient indian history  can not be over
emphasised 
""
my talk is about ancient andhra coins 
""
in the evolution of the ancient indian coinage  earliest to be
issued was punch marked coins  which was first succeeded by 
uninscribed cast coins  and the later  by the inscribed coins 
""
the punch marked coins were in circulation between eighth and second
century b c  and these coins were probably in circulation for a little
longer period in the south india 
""
these coins had no dates and no inscription denoting the name of the
king  or the dynasty to which he belonged 
""
these coins had only symbols  which were marked on them by
punching technique  and hence the name punch mark given to them on the
basis of the method of their manufacture 
""
these are  some of the punch marked coins  except one at the
top which is made of  copper  rest of the coins are made of 
silver 
""
majority of the punch marked coins  are made of silver  and
very rarely copper and lead  was used for making these coins 
""
the punch marked coins were manufactured by two methods  one is
the cut-sheet process  in which the metal was beaten into flat sheets of
appropriate thickness and width  and then the coin blanks were cut 
""
when the metal  was still soft  the symbols were marked on
them using different punches  then the coins were weighed  and if they
are found to be overweight  edges were clipped  and hence majority of
the coins ended up being irregular 
""
round and oval kinds were made by different technique 
""
weight globules of molten metal were fold into moulds  and then
were beaten flat  and then the symbols were marked on them by punches 
""
hence the shapes of these coins varied from round  oval 
squarish  rectangular to  irregular 
""
and what you are seeing  is the obverse  side of  the
coins 
""
and punchmark coins have only symbols imprinted on them  on the
obverse side  where as the reverse side is always blank 
""
what you are seeing now  is the reverse side of the three of
the punchmark coins 
""
this side is  blank  except for  few indistinct 
symbols  which came to be called as the bankers or officials marks 
""
next let us consider  when coins came to be  issued for the
first time in our country  ?
""
majority of the numismatists are of the opinion  that coins
originated somewhere around eighth century b c 
""
this assumption is based on two kinds of an evidence that we have
got 
""
one is the archaeological  other literary 
""
whenever  punchmark coins were found during the excavation 
archaeologists determined the statigraphic level  at which these coins
were found 
""
and next they find out what other material was found associated
with them  such as the northern black polished  and polished gravier
pottery and so on 
""
these can be dated by radio carbon method  all the available
archaeological evidence confirms  that coins were in circulation in our
country from fifth century b c and later 
""
but the literary evidence reveals that coins were issued in our
country  much earlier 
""
 arthashastra  of kautilya  which was
written in the fourth century b c  mentions about punchmark coins 
 pana  and its fractions 
""
it also mentions about ways of detecting counterfeit and forge
coins 
""
it is clear that coins were made in india  prior to fourth
century b c 
""
 ashtadhyayi  of panini  was said to be
written in the fifth or sixth century b c 
""
it also clearly mentions about various types of coins  like
 pana  nishka  and  satamana  
""
hence it is clear  that coins were in circulation prior to sixth
century b c 
""
the earliest literary evidence  that probably suggests about
coins  is  maitraini samhita of yajurveda  
""
this text is said to be written  somewhere around thousand b c
""
""
there is a particular reference  in this text about a lump of
precious metal  which some scholars feel that it was referring to coin
 satmana  
""
but not all scholars are agreed on this 
""
from the literary evidence  one could not be certain about the
exact period  when coins came to be first issued in our country 
""
but the consensus seems to favour  eighth century b c as the
most likely date 
""
next i will say few words about the symbols that are found  on
the coins 
""
no less than three hundred different symbols  were recorded on
punchmark coins alone 
""
the symbols on the coins  probably represent the king  his
dynasty  the kingdom  the capital city  main town and so on 
""
but at these length of time  one could never be certain 
that what each symbol represented 
""
roughly  these three hundred symbols can be grouped into six
broad catagories 
""
first  depiction of human figure either occuring singly or in
groups 
""
second group consists of animal symbols 
""
four common animals depicted are the elephant  bull  horse
and lamb 
""
other animals seen are the camel  rhinosorous dog  bear 
peacock  reptiles  fish  frog and so on 
""
third group consists of implements such as bow and arrow 
ladder  and ship 
""
fourth group consists of trees  and flowers 
""
fifth group consists of astral and religious symbols 
""
last group consists of miscellanious  symbols including ujjain
 and six arm  symbol and so on 
""
one general observation that can be made  here is that  the
animal symbols are much more common in early series of punchmark coins 
""
whereas the hill symbol occurs commonly  in later coins 
""
there are two main types of punchmark coins  local and imperial
""
""
during eighth to sixth century b c  our country consisted of
many tribal states  or  janapadas  
""
local rulers of these states have issued coins for circulation in
the respective regions 
""
magadha too started as a small tribal state with rajgir in bihar as
the capital  but later  this state has become very powerful  it
expanded its territories  then shifted its capital to patna or patilaputra
""
""
and by the time  this state  came under the rule of nanda and
mauryan dynasties  almost the entire country  was under their rule 
""
and coins issued by these dynasties  were in circulation
throughout the country 
""
and these coins came to be called as imperial coins 
""
both type of these coins  local as well as the imperial 
punchmark coins have very distinctive features 
""
local coins or the early coins  and naturally  they are very
rare to find 
""
they were of crude design and fabric 
""
the symbols marked on these coins too are crude 
""
weights of these coins too varied from one gram to over twenty
grams 
""
the number of symbols on the obverse  were usually one or two
 but never exceeded four 
""
in contrast  imperial coins  were of uniform weight of three
point four grams or fifty-four grams in fresh mint condition 
""
obverse had only five symbols  and the reverse was blank except
for bankers marks 
""
occasionally these coins had counter marks of subsequent rulers
""
""
out of the five symbols  two symbols were common  to all
these coins  that is  sun and the six armed symbols 
""
hence they are called as the first and second symbol 
""
third fourth and fifth symbols were from any  of the three
hundred and odd symbols found on the punchmark coins 
""
these are called as the class group and variety symbols 
""
what you are seeing now are the drawings of the symbols depicted on
the obverse side of the two punchmark coins  sun and six armed symbols
are common to both these coins  though the design of the six armed symbol
does vary 
""
one has four arrow marks  whereas the second one has three
arrows  and three dot symbols marked inside the triangle 
""
third symbol on one coin is the   one word   whereas
the tree and railing symbol with fish below is seen on the second coin 
""
fourth symbol on one coin consists of the four fish symbols 
around a square with a dot inside  all enclosed inside a large square 
whereas  ankusha  thareen  and straight line are seen on
the other coin 
""
elephant forms the fifth symbol on both these coins 
""
one coin belongs to one variety  whereas the second forms
another variety 
""
six hundred such varieties of punchmark coins have so far been
described 
""
i will now show you  the various designs of sun symbol 
""
sun is depicted  with varying number of rays varying from twelve
to eighteen 
""
in early coins rays are shown as oblique  whereas in subsequent
coins they are seen as radial  or straight or horizontal lines 
""
the second symbol came to be known as the six armed symbol 
""
this symbol consists of a dot or a circle  around which six
symbols are marked 
""
these could be either six arrows  three arrows  and three
other symbols  which may vary from fish  oval  rectangle  tureen
or any other kind of a design 
""
ninety different types of the six armed symbols  have been 
found on the punchmark coins 
""
one more common symbol  in later punchmark coins is the tree and
railing  various designs of which are shown in this chart 
""
another common symbol is the hill symbol 
""
this is depicted  as either showing three arches  or arches
vary from anywhere from five to ten 
""
but three arched hill  with a crescent at top  is considered
to be the ashokan or late mauryan symbol 
""
i will briefly  tell you about the characteristic features of
the local and imperial punchmark coins  that were found in andhra region
""
""
when it comes to the local punchmark coins  one interesting
observation was that  all these coins were made of lead  and the
weights of this coins too varied to from one gram to over fifteen grams 
""
the make of this coins too  was somewhat cruder 
""
but as for the symbols various symbols were found on them 
""
but three common symbols that were there on these coins was a
crudely designed sun symbol with lesser number of rays 
""
second  chakra  or a wheel symbol 
""
thirdly  a crude design of a branch  with leaves 
""
these were the features of the  early local andhra coins 
""
when it comes to the imperial punchmark coins that were found
exclusively in andhra region  i would like to mention about the amravati
hoard of the punchmark coins 
""
there were no less than seven thousand six hundred  punchmark
coins found at this site 
""
it had two hundred and eighty-four symbols on them 
""
two hundred and thirty-five varieties of punchmark imperial coins
 were found in this hoard 
""
but what was interesting was that  forty-eight varieties  of
this kind of a  punchmark coins were only found  in andhra region 
""
this means that even though  punchmark coins of the imperial
type  of uniform weight and size with common symbols  were there
throughout the country  but certain varieties were exclusively minted in
each region 
""
the second series of coins  which were issued in our country
after the punchmark coins  were the uninscribed cast coins 
""
these coins were in circulation  between sixth to the third
century b c 
""
in some parts of our country  these coins were the first to be
issued  and not the punchmark coins 
""
in the rest of the country  these coins were exclusively made
of copper  and hence the name uninscribed cast coins  was applied to
them 
""
but majority of the coins  which were issued in andhra region
 were made of lead 
""
even though these coins had various symbols  four common
symbols that were found on these coins are the  hollowcross  tarin
 swastika   and the   one or two words  
""
""
surprisingly the  hollowcross   which was 
very common in the uninscribed coins of this period  does not figure on
the coins  which was issued immediately after  that is on the inscribed
coins which was issued  in this part of the country 
""
seventy new types of previously   undescribed  
uninscribed   coins found in andhra region  were discussed in our
book 
""
one message  that comes through from this study is that though
this region  was under the nanda and mauryan empire  still there were
local rulers or authorities who issued a variety of such coins 
""
another important  fact  to be noticed is that  with the
introduction of uninscribed cast coins  symbols came to be marked on
either side of the coin  whereas  punchmark coins had only symbols on
one side and reverse  was blank 
""
after the uninscribed cast coins  came the era of the
inscribed coins  that means this coins mentioned the name of the king and
the dynasty to which he belonged 
""
but like the punchmark and uninscribed coins  these coins too
never mentioned the date of issue of the coins 
""
and for that matter  none of the andhra coins  prior to the
medieval period  ever mentioned  either the  mint's  name  or
the date of issue of the  coins 
""
first inscribed coins  that came to light  in andhra
region  belonged to king gobhadra 
""
he was a small local ruler  in the telangana region 
""
if this is a copper  coin issued by king gobhadra  obverse
side shows the script  in the centre  a bow and arrow symbol at the top
 and right  lower part shows the arched hill symbol  and tree and
railing symbol  to its left 
""
these coins were followed by  such kings as  naranna 
khambayasa  and samagopa 
""
there is no literary  or historical evidence of the existence
of these four rulers  gobhadra  naranna  khambayasa and samagopa 
""
only through coins we came to know the existence of these rulers
""
""
these are two  samagopa coins  one on the left side shows
the obverse side of the coin  whereas one on the right side shows the
reverse side of an another coin 
""
coin on the left side  shows the script in the centre  and
at the upper part  you see a bow and arrow symbol  and slightly to its
left you see a part of the  sadachakra  symbol 
""
at the lower right hand corner  you see the symbol of tree and
railing  and to its left you see the tree arch hill symbol with dots
inside 
""
on the right hand side you see  the reverse side of the coin
showing the  nandipatha  symbol 
""
similarly  coastal andhra region was ruled by meghvahana
dynasty  of kalinga 
""
there coins too have been discovered in recent times 
""
except for one  inscription  mentioning about the existence
of the meghvahana ruler  there is no other literary or any historical
evidence  that how many kings  ruled  or became part of this
meghavahana dynasty 
""
in recent times  coins of these kings who ruled northern
coastal region were found  and coins give a clue  of the names of five
kings who belong to this dynasty
