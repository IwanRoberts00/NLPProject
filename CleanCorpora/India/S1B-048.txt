""
she is also a person who has a store house of varied experiences
because she has garner them  from the different areas of life 
""
it is interesting to know for us  that she has also worked in the
telegraph and postal department of india 
""
she has been working   clears throat  with the 
adivasis  of india  working with them  and  they are in
orissa bihar and bengal 
""
presently she is concentrating more  in bengal 
""
and she draws her inspiration and authentic power  that comes
from empathy and deep sustained identification and concern for the deprived
and the  neglected 
""

  amrita puraskaar  jagataruni  medal  
nikhil bharat bang sahitya puraskaar  bhuvan mohini  medal
 and also   padmashree   in
nineteen eighty-six  for her  excellent work  with the 
adivasis   of india 
""
her works have been translated in   malyali  gujarati
 hindi  telugu  tamil   and certainly in english 
""
and  i'm  very happy to tell you  as far as i know 
her books are used  in several universities  in australia and the
united states 
""
mahasveta devi  it is great pleasure  to have this
opportunity to meet you face to face because we have always  enjoyed that
excellent creative vibrant writing of yours  and we all welcome you  in
 delhi  and to our studio 
""
""
thank you 
""
""
uhm the  question that comes to mind right away and which
 i've  read in the introduction of that excellent book of collection
uh    apni godko    is it the
transformation in society  for survival of the least and the downtrodden
 is a mm major concern of yours ?
""
but you do not believe as i understand in the change of political
 methods  or    cha    change   of the
system by political methods 
""
what would be your solution for this very pressing problem in our
country this transformation of society ?
""
would you suggest  it can be done through literary writing  ?
""
""
i think it would be more correct to say  that i don't
think  any political system  as we see in india  would bring 
any  revolutionary change  for the downtrodden and the oppressed 
""
and it i  it would be very  what shall i say wishful thinking
to say  that only literary writing  could bring some changes 
""
of course it will  have some effect  on the    
litery    literary   section of the society 
""
but  to bring any transformation  efforts   should
try    should be  tried   
""
you know  from the grass root level  not from the upper level
""
""
and the process will be slow  process will be gradual  and
there must be  concerted efforts  to better the condition of the
downtrodden the oppressed 
""
i don't mean always by government methods 
""
by voluntary organisations or other dedicated people 
""
only thus  slowly  uh better society can emerge 
""
and this work must be done along with those  who have suffered
""
""
this work not only  must be done along with those who have
suffered  but the initiative also must come from them 
""
they will work for their own betterment 
""
""
uh how much have you  been impressed by your 
shantiniketan  experience  in this uh  thought for the 
downtrodden the deprived the neglected ?
""
""
i wouldn't say that  shantiniketan 
upbringing  made me very conscious  for the downtrodden and the
oppressed 
""
i was in  shantiniketan  in my childhood when
tagore was alive 
""
 i'm  very thankful  for those childhood days 
""
 shantiniketan  taught me  a great love of
nature  love for humanity in general 
""
but the later phase  which is me now  it has come after many
changes and ups and downs in my life
""
""
and you have had a varied experience in your life 
""
please tell us  you often use in your writing  my people 
and  that's  the phrase that has really struck me
""
because i have come across it several times 
""
i would like to know what exactly do you mean when you say 
my people    you  do you use this  phrase in a very
particular way or as  queens and kings use  my people
""
""
no  the  for the queens and kings it would be my
subject 
""
but for me  the suffering bonded labourers of paramu they are
my people 
""
 the times of india  report regarding a woman
 three months ago  in madhya pradesh  who was tubercular and who
sold her daughter  for  as a child labour  for hundred 
rupees  
""
 she's  one of my people 
""
you see my india consists of such people   who  for whom
still  drinking water  or right over their land and forest  a hut
 two meals a day  remains a luxury 
""
they are my people 
""
where i say people  i mean they 
""
""
and this is your sustained  deep identification with this
particular group
""
""
yes 
""
""
uhm i was wondering  when you say that you are 
sensitive about the judgement  on the writers you have also said  that
they are answerable the writers 
""
i was going to ask you  is a writer responsible for the state of
a negative uh  situation in our country in society the immoral unethical
values  ?
""
uhm    are   do   you really think it is
the job of the writer  to reflect the society ?
""
because we have been saying for ages   literature is the
mirror of society 
""
or do you think it is the duty of these writer  to present the
 picture truthfully but also work for the solution ?
""
i mean is it one of the work of the writer and if he or she fails
there that she should be ready for judgement  ?
""
""
what i wanted to say  i put it to you  as a counter 
 it's  not question  some thing else 
""
a writer is a person who lives in the society
""
""
she does
""
""
a writer receives  so much from society  but he is also
accountable to the society 
""
he has also   give   given   that  so a 
writer's  writing  should not lead the society astray 
""
or  a  writer's   vary todays writings of the indian
writers from all over india  does it reflect the true india  ?
""
the india is passing through many phases passing through many
changes 
""
so  uh  d d  do it  lit  the indian literature
until and unless  becomes the mirror of the  indian  changing
indian society  i wouldn't say  that the writers have been very
successful 
""
also  i believe in  activism  
""
i believe in active work 
""
so i think   this   these   writers also
should be  conscious  of their    res    social
responsibilities   
""
try to  alleviate the misery of the poor and the suffering as
much as they can 
""
i think  this should give him  better identification with his
reading public
""
""
this is a very very excellent point
""
because  very few i think feel 
""
not only the writers but   let's  say citizens of india
 that we have received so much from society therefore we are bound  to
 them  to  give back in whatever way we can
""
and what you are saying as a writer it is one of your duties that
you consider is to get back as much as you can
""
""
yes
""
""
since you are a writer 
""
so that some wrong impression that we have  that because she is
an activist therefore she is always bringing in  these subjects is not
such a true picture as the  moral and ethical value have as a writer
""
that a writer as a citizen  writer as a taker of social good 
must give back not wait for any one to ask it
""
""
yes
""
""
i think uh uh  mahasveta devi this is very excellent point
and i am happy that you are sharing this with us 
""
the other thing i wanted to say in this regard  would you say
then  the readers who read your work  really owe it to you because many
of us are your admirers  that they also do something  actual work 
""
what would you suggest for them  ?
""
""
whoever is uh aware 
""
wherever one is  he must consider  it as  his or her
battlefield   jo jidher hai wohi unke liye unaka ranakshetra hai
 
""
one must  think of oneself as a soldier 
""
you see our india is a very poor mother 
""
she has so many children 
""
the advanced amongst them  should not be  totally oblivious
of the misery  of her poorer  children 
""
everyone should try to do  whatever one can
""
""
uhm  i'm  sure  we'll  remember that 
""
mahasveta devi i wanted to ask you please share with us  and i
see in not uh  far away future  those who  you are working for the
 adivasis  the neglected the  uh forgotten will come into
the mainstream of life 
""
i can't prophecy when but they will 
""
but when they come how do you visualise the quality of life
changing atleast beginning to change  ?
""
""
hitherto what has happened that uh  oppressed as a class
the tribals amongst us  have been totally bypassed by the   
mainstre    mainstream   society 
""
especially the tribals 
""
great injustice has been done to them
""
""
absolutely 
""
""
indian history  of uh   freed  indian freedom
history  does not include  the tribal anti-imperialist  uh
struggle as part of indian history 
""
thus the tribals have always been bypassed 
""
i do not want  them to come forward  because of mercy from
the main stream 
""
they must know where they are
""
they must struggle for their own good  and they must 
advance themselves 
""
only thus  whatever they are that will be his or her own
earning  that is she will be able to retain 
""
if you give someone something    yes  one may not
value it so much 
""
""
 yes  
""
""
ah this is a very excellent point
""
i wanted to say that  i have noticed that you have a 
expression of happiness when you are talking about your readers who are non-
bengali readers 
""
and i know that you   are very  well known amongst the
 non-bengali readers  through translations 
""
i wanted to ask you  to what do you owe  this 
gratification  and love from them
""
""
  one or two words   
""
""
that is one of the  turning phases of my life 
""
because  by the time i had written   hazar
chourasia ki maa   i had written  jungle 
ke jahagirdar   
""
but those books were not yet translated into hindi 
""
hindi  in hindi plenty bengali literature  was being
translated and published 
""
but not my books 
""
different kind of literature 
""
arvind kumar  now the director of l b t  then he had
 radhakrishna prakashan  
""
he not only published my books by going forward travelling to
calcutta  but introduced me to a  people unknown to me    hi
hi    hitherto   
""
hindi writers poets  patrakars   so many people
i met in delhi 
""
it was like a  mela  
""
whenever i came  i met them 
""
it was like a festive occasion 
""
on one occasion there was really a   mela  like
festival around me  in triveni 
""
arvind  one word   and  had i not known hindi 
readers  had i not known the hindi world of literature  i would not
have known greater india 
""
hindi introduced me to  greater india 
""
i agree this  i'm  no longer  i do no longer feel 
i'm  a bengali writer
""
i feel i am a indian writer  and i belong to the rest of india
""
""
amongst the indian writers i have so many friends 
""
for all these things i am very very indebted to the hindi
literature  very very indebted to arvind kumar
""
""
so we now see the great value of translation 
""
there is just probably a little time for you to share any
particular thought that is dear to your heart with your audience 
""
""
i will just tell you a very small incident  which is very
important to me 
""
in a remote tribal area of bengal  twenty years ago there was
no school 
""
and because there was no land available to build a hut for the
school  a tribal woman karmisuren  she had very little land  she
induced  interest upon her son and daughter-in-law to part with whatever
land they had 
""
this poorest woman in the village  gave her all 
""
an illiterate woman  so that a school could could be built 
for others to get education 
""
 karmisuren's  instance  till date is  a great one a
pioneering effect to me 
""
and i always say that school  i think it will be  it will
be government sanctioned very soon
""
i do not know 
""
we are trying hard 
""
my state government is also trying trying hard 
""
but karmisuren is a great woman  whose life should be written
 and should reach  other parts of india
""
""
and i would add let us also act like karmisuren  and
mahasveta devi thank you for spending this beautiful time with us 
""
thank you so much
