friends  today  i'm  going to talk to you about two
dimensional stratagrowth by identical limited aggregation  by
electrolysts deposit process 
""
the passing century  has witnessed  scientific investigation
 of order systems  such as  crystalline systems  and so on and
so forth 
""
order was even  discovered in liquids like liquid systems 
""
but during the last part of this century  scientists have
realised  that many recorded systems  behave in perfectly orderly 
manner 
""
for example  biological systems are never crystalline  and
they contain more than seventy percent water  and yet  they perform
functions  which are most orderly 
""
many physical  technological  and biological systems 
have been shown to be related to  and described by  non-integer
dimension  as called   fractional  dim    fractional
dimensions   
""
a concept which was originally  uh discovered  and
beautifully demonstrated by  b b mendel broad  in his classic book
called   fractal   
""
uh lot of information has been gathered about  these systems
 such as  technique such as experimental theoritical and computer
assimilation 
""
in this lecture today   i'm  going to introduce you 
to a  process of  generating  fractal  aggregate  that is
developed in our  laboratory 
""
the plan of my lecture  will be as follows 
""
although most of you must be  familiar with the    fla
fact    factual   concepts 
""
for the benefit of those who are uninitiated in this field  and
for the sake of completness 
""
 i'll  first give  an introduction to the concepts of 
fractal   such as definition of  fractal   the concept of
self similarity and  their invariance  the physical significance of
 fractal  dimension  and so forth 
""
before going over to the  method  of generating  fractal
 that we have developed 
""
and since  the aggregates that we obtain are  diffusion
limited aggregate   i'll  introduce the diffusion limited
aggregation of  with an nth standard the module which is developed by
with an nth standard 
""
the first experimental uh evidence of different type of aggregates
 was given by electro deposition process  by sauda atoll and gregor
atoll 
""
whereas the method which we have developed is  electroless
deposition 
""
and using this technique  we have generated aggregates of
metals  like  copper  silver and zinc  which will be compared
and contrasted 
""
 i'll  also show  a method of how to measure the 
fractal  dimension  experimentally  for the  agre  type of
aggregates that we have generated 
""
the diffusion limited aggregation is  aggregates are formed
 by  uh interspin which are very near to equilibrium 
""
i mean very far from equilibrium 
""
whereas when the crystals are very near to equilibrium  the
morphology of aggregates is entirely different 
""
 i'll  give some beautiful examples of  diffusionless
aggregates  which are generated in our laboratory  from crystals 
which are very near to the equilibrium 
""
 fractal  geometry provides  a natural framework for
describing and understanding those form  this according to euclidian
geometry are formulae  that is to investigate the morphology of amorphous
""
""
now how to describe fractions 
""
 frac  in general if you observe a particular object for
example take a  glass of water  and a bucket of water  where the
mass per unit volume  which tells you about the density of water  does
not depend upon  the volume of water gratitute  for measurements 
""
whether you take a glass  or you take a bucket  the density
of the water  will remain one 
""
so in euclidian type of object  the density remains constant
 irrespective of  type of the measuring unit 
""
but  if you consider some different object  as  i'll
 show here  then the density no longer ramains constant  as the
size of the object 
""
this  object is generated in this particular case  by well
defined determinous to prove 
""
a cross is generated by putting  four particle  around the
central particle  and this is used as a  iterative unit 
""
at the four corners  and at the centre  you replace every
particle by the cross  and  you will generate this figure 
""
and if this process  is repeated  several times  then
 a figure  such as this  is obtained 
""
now let us try to calculate the density of this object 
""
or  as  you've  seen here  since density can be
written as  density can be written as mass upon volume 
""
so we can write this equation as  mass is proportional to volume
 that is  mass is proportional to length  cube 
""
and in two dimensions  mass will be proportional to  length
square 
""
now instead of mass we can use the number of particles as unit
because  number of particles will be proportional to the mass of the 
uh  one word  
""
so number of particles  in euclidian system  is proportional
to the  linear dimension to the power of euclidian dimension 
""
for the sake of simplicity we are considering a two dimensional
system 
""
and as you can see here  in this particular system 
""
""
here value is at k 
""
""
k is any number  if this is  k is equal to one
""
""
ah
""
""
i have  okay  i'll  just put it up here 
""
so you have k is equal to zero k is equal to one  k is equal to
two  and  k is equal to some number k let us say   cough 
""
and  i'll  show you how it is obtained 
""
so you will have  here for k is equal to one  you have five
particles  in this particular figure 
""
so your n is  five 
""
for k is equal to two  you have twenty-five particles  as
you can see there 
""
so your n is  five twelve 
""
and so  your k is equal to  k  and n is five to power of
k 
""
similarly  if you take the linear dimension that is if you
measure this  distance  then for k is equal to one  simply k into
three  that is three times k  this and i have not drawn it properly 
""
if you look at that figure you will see that this plus this plus
this  will give you this  for  k is equal to one  two  and
three 
""
so for k is equal to  two  we have k into t to the power of
two 
""
you can count here 
""
it will give about nine distance  three  plus three  plus
three 
""
and for k is equal to k   cough  we have k into three to
the power of k 
""
so  in this equation if you have  log of n  divided by
log of  n  to the limit a going to infinity  then you find that
this comes out to be  log of five  divided by log of n  using one
point  four six five 
""
so you see that  the power of the  i mean if you  cough
 can rewrite this equation it will become  n into number of  one
word   s to the power of  some constant number 
""
""
but a is unit here 
""
""
right  a is uh  you can take it uniquely or you can know
even if you write a  and solve the equation we get this in the limit a
tending to infinity 
""
so we find that  this number  comes out to be a 
fractional number 
""
so  for euclidian object  you have a proportional to l to
the power of euclidian dimension  and for a fractal object  this is a
fractional number  and because it is a fractional number  it is called
 a fractal system 
""
this word fractal was coined by  b b mendel broad to represent
those system  which occurs the physical properties cannot be described
 by using euclidian dimension 
""
for example if you take a mountain  you cannot call it a
triangle  you cannot call it a  sphere  and therefore its
properties  will not be describable by euclidian geometry 
""
you need to take some other measure  to describe the properties
of such systems  which are plenty in nature 
""
uh blood circulation system or nervous system so many systems if
you look at them  you cannot put them into orderly phenomenon 
""
and then you require some science to describe such systems because
the aim of science is to bring predictibility to events 
""
if you cannot predict  than naturally you can't  have some
 uh good sign you can't predict certain things then  it's  not
science 
""
so in order to bring predictability you need a framework  which
will describe the image 
""
so fractal framework  produce  a provides   something
 which  with which you can describe these events with  certainity
""
""
now  we should understand that there is this  dimension 
which is used  and if we call as one point four six five is the dimension
of the system  but that is not the real dimension of the system
""
really it is a two dimensional system as you can see there 
""
this term  fra  dimension is borrowed because  that
particular number replaces the dimension  in the  eucli  normal
 uh equation 
""
so we call a fractal dimension 
""
it is not  a dimension  in the actual sense of the word 
""
it is but because this fractional number replaces the dimension of
the system  to make the  mea  physical measurements meaningful
 we call it a dimension 
""
so when the notion of euclid and dimension poses a conceptual
problem  in    underst    understanding  
certain system  the concept of fractal dimensionality  gives a
manageable and convenient answer  to such questions 
""
just for the sake of  completeness   i'll  give some
mathematical equation which should not put you off 
""
so in general  if  rover  is the density of the aggregate
at a point r  and n is the total number of particles in a cluster of
radius i  then the   density   density   correlation
function can be written as  here 
""
so you have several forms   of   of   this
equation  which i have written there is simple form u is equal to m upon v
 c r can be written as r to the power of minus three minus three that e
is the euclidian dimension and  this d is the fractal dimension 
""
if this number is written as alpha  then you have c r 
varying as r to the power of  minus alpha  and fractal dimension can
be measured  experimentally  by using any one of these  cough 
equations  when different techniques  are required for  such
measurements 
""
now i will describe the  concepts of self similarity and 
scale invariance  of the fractal 
""
self similarity and scale invariance are  the fundamental
properties of fractal
""
i don't say that scale invariance is fundamental because there are
fractal  in which the scale invariance is not necessary in the sense 
the power which we saw just now  this  d  distance  need not
be a constant number 
""
it can be expressed as a power t  and those fractal are called
multifractal  okay the common fractal normally i mean  to be
conceptually very  simple  the scale invariance and  scale
similarity  are considered to be  two important characteristics  of
the  fractal 
""
so in this figure which we have generated just sometime before 
""
if you take any part of this figure  and enlarge it  then
you get  a figure which is identical to the    start  
 starting   figure 
""
and then again take any part of it  so i have put it 
""
then again enlarge a part of this figure 
""
it will appear identical to the original figure 
""
and that is why  the fractal systems are called  self-similar
 because  the   a  any part of the system if it is elarged
or contracted  looks like the original system 
""
but this self similarity ends  when you start distinguishing
between the particles 
""
when you start seeing the particle from this take a small part of
it and enlarge it it is no longer going to look like the  like  
original figure 
""
and so this puts a blow to critical form  below which the
system will not behave as a fractal system
""
""
figures might be same
""
""
no  it is it is no longer a fractal system then 
""
and similarly  the size of the aggregate itself  puts a
bound  above which  the system cannot be called as a fractal system
""
""
because i may have a large system  with sub units like this
""
""
now each sub unit is a fractal  but these sub units might be
arranged in crystalline position 
""
so in that case  i have fractal behaviour only between 
the size of the particle  and the size of the aggregate which is fractal
""
""
in between these two units  the aggregate behave like fractal
 but above and below these limit  they do not behave like fractal 
""
and these are called the lower and upper critical bounds  of
the fractal system 
""
now in this particular case the figure has been generated using a
 precise deterministic mathematical rule 
""
but in general  we make a  fractal which exist  are not
created by mathematical rules 
""
so in that case  the  self similarity is not exact 
""
it is a statistical self similarity 
""
as we can see here  the object which are created for example
by some processes  like the smoke  are self similar  and here again
 if you enlarge a  small part anywhere here  it will look similar
to the starting object  it will not be exactly identical to the starting
object  and yet it will be similar to the starting object 
""
 it's  statistical properties will be  similar to what
you have from the original object  until and unless you start resolving
between the particles  when again the self similarity breaks down 
""
so you have statistical  or deterministic factors  which
are self similar 
""
so let us see what is scale invariance of statistic 
""
the equation m is proportional to l to the power of d  sixth
off the scale invariance because  the  in this equation it all remains
constant 
""
but the question  we comes at to in this equation  euclidian
 where euclidian is dimension is used also this power remain constant 
""
so what is so great about the invariance of fraction 
""
in order system also you have scale invariance 
""
this  the importance of scale invariance becomes  clear 
when we look at it from the  other side 
""
what i mean by other side is  that is if you have objects for
which  for the measurement of which  mathematical equation cannot be
written down
""
you cannot define it 
""
then  you cannot define if that means they are not still
invariant  whereas for those objects for which  you can give some
meaning to the  one word   are only objects which are scale
invariant 
""
i will give a very specific example  of a coastland 
""
we have all visited beaches  that is sea beach i mean 
""
and if  you'll  see the morphology of the sea beach 
you will find it something like  this   it's  not going to be a
straight line 
""
now  i'll  take a one kilometre strip of  the coastline
""
""
this is one kilometre 
""
and  i measure this one kilometre length  by using a metre
long scale 
""
i keep my metre long scale here  and start measuring this by
kilometre  length 
""
i find that  my coastline  length of my coastline is
thirty-two kilometres 
""
then i take a one metre  uh sorry one centimetre uh  strip
 and again measure this coast length 
""
again here there will be something 
""
so i measure the length of the coastline as three into ten to the
power of seven kilometres 
""
and if i take one millimetre it becomes  ten to the power of
nine kilometres 
""
there it appears as if it is not possible to measure the length of
the coastline because depending on what  unit i take for measurement it
keeps on varying 
""
but that is not true  because the including coastline can be
 statistically defined
""
it cannot be exactly defined  but length of the coastline can
be statistically defined  by an equation  saying  a few words 
if we put  one metre one centimetre or one millimetre  you will get
 l  exactly predictable
