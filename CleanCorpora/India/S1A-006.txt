mr yadav i think we should discuss about premchand and his 
workmanship regarding in the literature
""
how do you think like that
""
""
yes what is your opinion  about premchand say  art in
technique 
""
""
premchand the greatest of  uh hindi novelist 
""
as far as his craftmanship is concerned i think he is the front rank
 front ranker 
""
""
front ranker what do you mean by this front ranker 
""
""
uh with the development of hindi literature particularly in the
genre of  novel i think  premchand initiated  the novel form in its
presant context  and proper form 
""
so he should be considered as the front ranker 
""
""
front ranker
""
""
front ranker 
""
""
because by the word front ranker i do suppose that premchand
initiated the novel form in its true contexts 
""
it its exact form 
""
then by the word novel we suppose a such detail type of prose story
and prose composition which can contain a large theme  in its full detail
charaterisation and everything else
""
premchand utilises novel form in the in this context 
""
so he should be considered as a front ranker 
""
""
i think premchand  is a novelist of 
""
""
 you're   you're  considering about the quality
or the class of premchand as a novelist 
""
""
no i just  uh want to emphasise this about premchand  as
a novelist  particularly about his characters   characters 
""
""
 characters  
""
""
what kind of characters he put in his novel
""
""
oh yeah that is a very fine thing 
""
i think premchand is primarily dealing with the characters related
to the rural life of india
""
he is always depicting the rural picture of countryside and the
villages in india particularly in the  pre-independence era and also 
about the independence era 
""
uh by this word pre-independence i do mean  that  uh the
characters  which do occur in the novels of premchand like 
 godan    and some other novels like 
 gaban    and    say all these novels
 there are lots of characters who just represent the different aspects
 different  uh see the different colours and different  categories
of the characters which are  which  uh are represented by our  
rural society  as well class
""
""
 i feel i feel  
""
""
 i  one word   
""
""
i think   premchand's  characters are very simple
""
""
yeah no   doubt 
""
""
 they   are very innocent
""
""
no doubt
""
""
they come from low status of life  uh from villages 
they are living standard is very low    yes  and  they are
actually exploited  by the aristocrat classes 
""
""
 yes  
""
""
because you see premchand was a true  novelist in its sense
""
he just painted rural pictures in its real serial colour without
any artificial ornamentation
""
premchand has represented rural society in its essence  true
essence  for example you see lots of farmers  while toiling hard and
and reeling under odd type of  atrocities and all type of  i mean
exploitation at the hands of our feudal society and feudal bureaucratic set
up
""
he has represented them all 
""
poverty is lying there all glaring poverty under the repressive
rules of taxes
""
all type of taxes being levied by the aristocratic and ruling set
up
""
these are all glaring and all visible  clearly visible it is 
 i think so 
""
""
 i think his   characters  are tragic  such
as uh  we can take for example  in   gaban 
""
""
""
  gaban   certainly
""
""
uh ramanath    he is  a steady character 
though i think he is an escapist    yes 
""
he leaves the hard realities of life he runs away  he  and he
 doesn't  show the  he  doesn't   reveal the reality
""
""
 ramanath  
""
""
 yes  
""
""
he just   manipulates something 
""
""
 i think in   gaban   the
novel  
""
""
he does something but he says something
""
so there is no unification in his  deed and speech
""
""
i think uh the novel   gaban  
which  uh shot up the popularity of premchand as a novelist too much
""
i think there is a  psychological introspection into the
characters  one word  of ramanath the character who has been affronted
by so many  pecularities of his fate 
""
he is driven to calcutta
""
he goes there
""
he  uh joins a very low middle class family there
""
he one day goes  and wins a  a chess  uh quiz and he is
able to get some prize
""
in his cheerly he was fascinated for buying so many ornaments to
his  uh jewelleries   to his wife 
""
""
 can you tell me  
""
""
can you tell me please  how does he come to the real point
""
""
ramanath  ramanath realises ultimately
""
""
what does he realises ultimately
""
""
ramanath ultimately did realise that his fascination and his
over expense   o  on the items of  uh high valued jewelleries
costly jewelleries  was not a real thing
""
it did create  lot of problems for him he had leave his flee
away from his home town lucknow and he was forced to go to calcutta
""
and there  amidst lots of tragic situations and grim realities
 he come to this conclusion that we cannot move  or flee away from the
hard realities which  uh are the pre-dominence realities of life and
society
""
i think  something like that 
""
""
what do you think uh  about his art and technique 
""
""
 premchand's 
""
""
yes 
""
""
as  art technique premchand has used the picturised
pictures card i think
""
premchand   always 
""
""
 pictures  
""
""
uh  uh  by pictures i mean that premchand always  uh
puts before his readers  or presents before his  his readers of his
novels  a true and lively and faithful picture of the surrounding or the
locale he is going to put in his novel
""
for example  if he tries to mention a village  then he starts
about  picturising all the minute details
""
for example the roads  full of dust
""
for example the pond full of hycinth and all even  men and women
are bathing there and even  cattles and animals are also there and
somebody is washing his utensils and somebody is washing his clothes
""
""
so this type of lively picturise then gives you a very healthy
and lively informatives he used to give    yes  regarding his
location
""
""
 yes  
""
""
 you're     you're   you're  very
correct 
""
his description is really very minute  and clear when we read
""
and very live  lively
""
""
 haan  lively
""
""
yes but  what do you think about the language  which he
uses in his novels 
""
""
uhm in terms of  lang  uh language i think premchand
should be considered as a  true artist in the sense he never goes for
artificial or ornamental language 
""
he always picks up the words from our local dialects 
""
or even the word  he use  suggest a kind of our naturality
""
""
suppose for example he always uses such type of dialogues which are
actually spoken by the native people  in the remote village side
""
i   think  like that
""
""
 yes  
""
""
and that gives a kind of naturality and directness to the
expression their livility and anything else
""
""
yes  you are very correct 
""
really his languauage is very simple  direct  and very very
communicative 
""
even  his language is so simple that it is not difficult to
understand  even a very  uneducated person also can be able to
understand and can able  can be able to enjoy his novel
""
""
one thing one  one word  i i do feel that  the
language premchand uses in his novels  do present such categories and such
classes in our society
""
for example  for the people belonging to lowest strata of
society  premchand uses the exact dialogue used by them
""
""
yes   very good very correct 
""
""
 and for example    people belonging to suppose
suppose middle class or the upper middle class or the  uh or the upper
class elite class gentry  he uses that type of  uh i mean the standard
dialect  which has some real touches and everything etiquette and manner
all things that are possible
""
for example  a feudal chief a  zamindar  talking
to his  uh kinsmen and talking to his uh  i mean servants  he uses
there is a kind of  two kinds of uh language there
""
the language used by the  zamindar  or the feudal
chief is something  high something bombastic something  one word 
and something high sounding but the language used by the servant is something
quitely different and there you come across a kind of representation of the
society in terms of the variation of the language itself
""
i think it is also a peculiar aspect
""
a a distinct achievement of premchand as  a craftmanship
regarding his novels being in the terms of use of languages of   
uhm  do you think like that    yes 
""
alright is it okay
""
""
 yes  
""
""
 yes  
""
""
now i would like to  discuss about  uh uh 
premchands  pictorial  uses of language 
""
he uses pictorial languages also
""
he  is  his language is  poetic very poetic 
""
""
yes it is 
""
""
so    one word  
""
""
  i'll    show you some examples   mr
yadav 
""
""
  haan   
""
""
for premchand makes fine or rather  far fetched use of
 miseries and phrases
""
phrases to communicate  uh great ideas
""
very direct ideas for example  uh in a beautiful short story
  kafan  kafan   dealing with the 
tragic aspects of the  li  lives of  a father and his son 
""
premchand shows how the daughter-in-law of a man is dying 
""
how due to her pregnancy
""
and both son and father  father-in-law  both are so lazy
that they have just   didn't  care
""
they  didn't  care  to their daughter-in-law and she is
dying
""
and which premchand has shown in this way  that  uh while
the daughter-in-law  is just on her on her death-bed  crying up
mercilesly 
""
and at the same time son and father-in-law are sleeping in deep
slumber as if two  azgars  are sleeping 
""
so there the tongue two  azgars  do indicates such
a kind of pictorial touch  and there lies the brilliance of  use of
language in its pictorial manifestation
""
i   think  something like that
""
""
 yes  
""
""
yes correct
""
""
and you come across uh  so many i mean  numberless
examination of such things
""
and pictorial aspect has been  superbly illustrated by
premchand in his novels and particularly in his short stories
""
for example  you see in   panch parmeshwar
  also there is  brilliant example of this pictorial
""
a representation and picturisation of  uh  khala
 and  mausi  for   human's sake  
""
there is also  uh her curly and white hairs and her cheeks 
uh swollen something like that
""
""
yes  that's  true
""
""
here you also come across some picturisation aspect
""
""
yeah  that's  true
""
his  his ideas are also very thoughtful
""
  if it is  deep idea   so  simple
language  in a very simple   say 
""
""
 yes no no doubt  
""
""
 yes  
""
""
 for   example you come across uh  so many
examples premchands  original views on poverty  honesty friendship 
these are the ideas   india's  age old tradition
""
in india the age old views on friendship trust cooperation
friendship all aspects have been    yes  dealt by premchand in
different context and situations  and that  and those expressions
enable premchand  to outlet and vent his ideas in a very just stable and
very convincing manner
""
i think so
""
""
 yes  
""
""
you are very correct
""
now i would like to talk about his satirical aspect 
""
i think premchand is a great satirist   because  he
exposes some foibles shortcomings weaknesses  of the society 
""
""
 because  
""
""
so  for example you see  in   gaban
 
""
""
yes
""
""
he exposes all the short comings of the society
""
all the happening  a real happening of the society
""
""
yes  satire as uh the   great satirist 
""
""
 he is a   great satirist
""
""
yes yes
""
satire as a great satirist and classical john ryder has said
 satire as the amendment of vices by correction 
""
""
i think premchand also  in his  uh all through his
literary career followed this dictum 
""
 premchand's  satirical purpose in his novels or short
stories wants to recorrect society 
""
to recorrect it  if there are certain anomalies in society 
there are some waywardness in society there are some inherent defect 
""
so premchand used his aesthetic features of literary  literary
art to expose those irregularities which are prevelent in our society  and
by his critical comments he tried to enlighten the people and be aware 
towards all these irregularities and if possible try to remove them
""
so that our society be such a place that we would like to be
living 
""
i think so
""
premchand has always attacked  on the exact causes of our
poverty  exact causes of our illiteracy  exact causes of of unawareness
regarding all the grim realities and grim difficulties that our society face
these days 
""
particularly one must remember that premchand was writing  uh
uh uh premchand wrote all his novels and short stories in the
pre-independence era when india was not free and it was under the clutches of
british monarchy
""
all type of oppression  were being carried on  in the name
of british queen after a  pro  proclamation of eighteen fifty-eight
""
so premchand being a  one word  artist was always awake 
to see  what  our society is
""
what are its chief defects
""
and he always used the literary art  to work as a  st 
as an a stimulus to awaken the people from their deep slumber and
subconscious state  to see the gruelling aspect of society
