""
""
this is the captain of the haryana side  and  trying to
 get back into  the indian team 
""
 that's  ram saran 
""
gurdeep singh  sanjeev ram saran on the  crossing there 
and uh  empire sachin navadia  who was this side of the team at the
moment  is supervising the match with uh  t s bullard  on the
opposite side 
""
 that's  gurdeep singh  
""
no no 
""
""
kishan singh  stop there by shakira 
""
jagbir  obstruct it 
""
narendra number two gurdeep singh  he has been  playing very
well i am sure in this tournament 
""
sanjeev kumar kicks there 
""
sanjay bisht india player 
""
gurdeep singh  and there is mukesh kumar playing there 
""
still in possession still got the ball in position  now balbir
sahani hold out for off time 
""
a gentle stroke  saki  who picked up that ball for haryana
""
""
ashok kumar  stopped it  gurdeep singh  on baljit 
""
baljit in possession 
""
ball  given to him  by  baljit singh  off there  he
knew his position all over the  island   and now indian airline
trying to make headway 
""
a beaten there 
""
sanjay bhatia 
""
haryana into move now 
""
baljit  coming five men across  the struck in the process
 ball over the striker  but no chance ram saran  could not get a
strike 
""
good to be the goal  the play  he eject at last  certain
bid of the touch  to uh  a straight ball  and we have a goal out 
""
but ram saran missed  and  the first chance for haryana 
has gone a waste
""
manoj kumar  very  ferocious  outside 
""
the ball is in possession 
""
a sure goal there for mukesh kumar 
""
he will play final decision into the crossway 
""
oh he made a loss of it but he did a better job but it was 
gurdeep who could have stick out there and uh  mukesh lost possession 
""
anyway they have a corner  ball hit  and now let us see
what uh  uh this ranjit kumar can do  but then  gundeep has come
back there 
""
ram saran in good lead trying to make headway obstructed  and
kicks  watch again gundeep  men who gets a drift  put the ball at
far square  on that uh  sanjeev kumar got a catch from good run get
hold of the ball 
""
amar singh negi that was  who were outside from the ball from
there  and uh  play it for uh  indian airline
""
shakeel ahmed 
""
down to mukesh kumar 
""
mukesh moving well today 
""
he had a practice tournament here  baljit  gundeep  on
to the ram saran 
""
ram saran still in the lead ahead  couple of yards  but i am
sure he knows that he is not there in his own position  and  that's
 end of a ball flight
""
so  another cross wasted 
""
harvinder  sanjay bisht  rajpal to mukesh kumar but ball
 a little bit uh  shallow and it goes out before he had it 
""
final of this federation cup 
""
the first five minutes did not produce uh  yielding 
unexpected  but haryan definitely having as much of the game  as
indian airlines
""
gundeep trying to make headway  and uh  fully that ball out
in the  two words  
""
ball deflected out to corner 
""
so in the first corner  indian airlines the airlines have won
 and now its turn  of haryana and taking the corner hit  is uh
 gundeep kumar 
""
he goes to a former  india player 
""
gundeep  and they all charging here and deflected 
""
gundeep kumar  stop there by mohammad arif 
""
tries his scoop doesn't do it well  and touch the  penalty
corner in a good way 
""
baljit singh is going to take the  push  and is going to be
 well  gurdeep singh  for the hit  also near him ram saran
 mukesh kumar  and uh   that's  it 
""
and what a lovely shot there  is a good short there  tries
to the corner 
""
but got  to face the  one word  gundeep kumar try to
make a big hit 
""
he was to make well  but misfield but tries well 
""
second penalty corner on to a real big shot  two words 
""
the haryana boys are  putting the pressure  over indian
airlines 
""
another penalty corner  second corner now   two words
 baljit kumar  baljit kumar who played one play  ball is out there
 he always have to play around sanjay bisht   one word  teaming
up with sanjay bisht 
""
he is a bit of trying hard and driving 
""
it is secure there  by kishan singh  and given on to 
gundeep  and over to daljit   it's  over to sukumar 
""
 saran  kumar  has given up there uh moving this uh 
defence why middle of exchange of will serve
""
and thinking of strucking by  and empire sachin navadia serving
the call to penalty corner 
""
 that's  daljit  taking  collecting by kuldeep side
 in time  ball deflected out  corner 
""
here penalty corner kick 
""
he did it for  two words  but went for the straight shot
 but uh  the ball was deflected there by  goalkeeper 
subbaiah's  stick  and  in corner now sanjay bisht in possession
""
""
now that is uh  negi 
""
a misfield for haryana 
""
haryana definetly doing  most of the attacking in this first
half 
""
and uh  considering that they are  the under dogs for this
final  is certainly well good cheer up to what jagbir does now 
""
and  crossing there and uh  again got the chance lost 
""
i mean the score still one  as it here appears over to kuku
wadia
""
""
 in hindi 
""
""
for our viewers  now we have that man here  mr k p s
 gill
""
you have been watching mr gill  the  matches in this
federation cup practically everyday 
""
did you find any outstanding talent during these last few days  ?
""
""
uh  most of the players uh who were there in the camp 
uh are  again been asked  to join the camp and  we've  found
about seven  new faces here  who will be  asked to  come into
the camp 
""
but watching haryana   i've  been very impressed with
their play 
""
""
yes specially sanjeev kumar is doing  exceptionally well
""
""
""
yes  uh and i want to  have a  separate look at
haryana altogether
""
i want to see  how they impress  so with such team 
""
and they have been really been playing together 
""
""
and i believe you have  and the half the team from punjab
 and half the team from haryana 
""
""
uh there are players from punjab sindh bank there are players
from b s f  uh but basically  it's  uh   it's  not of
 team which has played together for a long team
""
""
yes  they have impressed considerably 
""
now what do you think uh  should be done as far as uh  if
you go round the whole jalandhar you see the  boards  a revival of the
indian hockey being planned 
""
now what you are going about  doing that  ?
""
""
you see uh  at the moment uh  certain planning has
gone in  as far as  asian games are concerned and  thereafter the
world cup 
""
but i will be looking after the  uh champions trophy and the
olympic games  ninety-five and ninety-six  and uh  then after that
""
""
and the objective will be to win these two  tournaments 
""
""
so far as the asian games is concerned  uh  it's 
obvious the time is very short 
""
now but do you have any  graded procedures to  raise the
standard of hockey in india  ?
""
""
uh  for these  two tournaments  which  are 
coming up  immediately  there is nothing much we can add on to what
has been happening 
""
but for the  tournaments which are in ninety-five and ninety-six
 we will have to launch a massive talent search by the end of this year
 pick up a large number of good players  and trained them at
different places 
""
and then try to see that there is an overall  uhm raising of
the standard  so that when we  go into the  champions trophy 
and subsequently the olympic  uh uh  we're  going as a combination
which is feared all over the world 
""
""
now you have about forty odd boys  in the camp at
chandigarh  juniors 
""
now what you are going to do about them  ?
""
""
those are the boys  who've  been selected uh  from
various camps which were held in country  including some boys from the
 academy  airlines academy and uh  in delhi 
""
now  we are  trying to constituent a team because we have
been invited for  juniors  double games  in australia and spain 
and in germany 
""
the idea is to try and send out fit teams to these two countries
""
""
and then watch for these players show 
""
""
may you also have a long term life  as concerning 
youngsters in the country 
""
what you want to do about them  ?
""
""
you see   i've  been talking to people uh  
who've  uh  been associated with hockey  and i find  that one
of the recommendations is that we should trust in young 
""
so by  winter of this year  november  we shall be
launching a talent search  all over the country for the age group ten to
fourteen 
""
and we will try to  get these players into  uh centre where
astro-turf is there 
""
so that they can start playing on astro-turf 
""
and uh also  they will be given  uh  all sort of uh
fitness uh  programme  over the next  few years 
""
so that uh  they build up strength they build up stamina and
build up speed  and simultaneously the hockey skills adopted 
""
in addition to that uh  thereafter from next year onwards 
we will keep on adding on  by  having a look at the boys ten years
old  and selecting them  to keep on to  uh enter this  uh
stream
""
so that we always have good players whenever you ask 
""
""
anyway   let's  hope  your leadership mr gill
 will uh  bring the revival of the indian hockey 
""
thank you very much
""
""
thank you 
""
""
okay  let's  come down here at the burlton park
stadium 
""
and the pace in the game has slowed down 
""
also then indian    air    airlines  
are having a    diffi    difficult   time 
containing this haryana force 
""
though they have nothing to fear   they'll  be making
the break through they have been searching for all through this back uptill
now 
""
so far as  airline had three good chances very well done i mean
strike 
""
in fact  that's  haryana it can goal
""
he must be having to chose between and uh   that's  the
ultimately it goes to  the penalty corner decision  and mohammed arif
has always been scoring for the indian airlines 
""
one penalty corner but he didn't do it to get
""
and haryana on to down this
""
there is this new break in haryana team
""
now after this kick  for indian airlines
""
good throw ball there  for rajinder singh but baljit singh
takes ball there  and comes out in the clear still in possession 
""
miracle there  by  sanjay bhatia and  put it through
 sanjeev and uh  kurian   indian airlines but  that's 
true there is a lot of doing 
""
sanjeev bhatia  trying to make headway down the left flank
 not successful 
""
free hit to be taken now by gurdeep singh 
""
now the the frail haryana push back  and  tandon given
service in this competition 
""
every match practically he has played very well 
""
baljit  gundeep kumar 
""
 haryana side  in possession  harinder  gets it 
""
and lose it  call after to bhutia  and back to harinder
 and on to mohammed arif 
""
arif is the india pull back  who has been on the india team
 over the last four tournaments  abroad 
""
and  let's  see what shakeel ahmed  the captain  of
india  do 
""
it was a good throw there by jagbir  but uh it was twist there
by kishan singh 
""
and a free hit for  indian airlines just outside  the
penalty corner 
""
shakeel ahmed  back to sanjay bisht 
""
getting to the centre you can see the wet ground there 
""
that is as i talk  a little shower we had   it's  the
 one word  now at the moment  but uh towards uh this uh  
one word  in this  two words   on this to put up pace 
""
pick the ball now sanjeev kumar for haryana 
""
the ball there  by  harvinder  of course he may 
recording broken  and sanjeev takes it to the end 
""
it was through the drive reflection that was  two words 
""
harvinder tried on numerous occasion one side gundeep kumar  on
the other side  jagbir singh 
""
both have been missing constantly 
""
they drop the best chance anybody could have asked for 
""
but the one that gundeep kumar  had in the first half  when
uh  sanjeev kumar put him through 
""
when he made  unstopper  to chance  and haryana are
still fighting  to get the ball  uptill now 
""
indian airlines on the attack now 
""
ajay singh in possession  say in twist breath  first rawat
""
""
gundeep kumar has gone in plan to tame now and he gets all the
back over there 
""
 bhishan  had good match today 
""
trying to make headway gets near of the goal line but it was
brought down by that water there 
""
even then he tried but the ball was stuck in slush  but here is
water  and  one word  
""
and foul there  uh by  sanjay bisht 
""
and sanjeev kumar trying to make headway  and uh  driving
first shakeel ahmed who has gone down on the ground there  and he was
trying to push him through there 
""
and uh  inadvertently sanjeev kumar stick went into his stomach
now look at it 
""
it was not an intentional foul  but uh  shakeel went down
""
""
and he is getting medical attention 
""
we are seeing the man with the t-shirt  and uh  the white
t-shirt and the red cap  he was the former captain of india 
""
have won and the final penalty corner hit as  in the game and
coming behind there  is subbaiah  being played and was  was played
by india on numerous occasion 
""
and uh  with the absence of ashish ballal  who has hurt his
knee  in camp  subbaiah has been functioning  all through  uh
i mean all matches  here  while uh if ballal was there he would not
have been here 
""
so anyway  it's  why he doesn't to the occasion  and he
has functioned  very well indeed 
""
against bombay he brought out on that lovely chase  and again
today  he is pitied against in fact  the reasons are behind gundeep
kumar not  making uh  sure shots at goal was that he was afraid that if
he doesn't keep the ball in the right place he would not be able to beat
subbaiah 
""
so subbaiah is  is slogging with  jats   that's 
frustrating the haryana forwards 
""
though one must say that uh  gundeep kumar and then baljit
would have the chance to score  but they did not make 
""
now later half begin 
""
mukesh kumar  switches to  two words  
""
it is  obstructed there by baljit singh 
""
played inside  return pass  square mukesh kumar 
""
and mukesh drive it towards  shakeel luckily shakeel gets hold
of pramod kumar  and this side is sanjay bisht trying to make hit 
""
he hit that ball and comprising out  of course hitting
dangerous play  free hit for haryana 
""
kishan singh  kishan singh on to ram saran 
""
ram saran still holding up the ball 
""
he is looking out for a hit  somebody in the clear  does
round and loses possession there but it is lucky for him  it's  
two words  
""
not  one word   sanjeev bhatia 
""
again he still loves his crossing there  and has gone to
baljit 
""
baljit  he is coming  gundeep kumar in the clear now 
 let's  see whether he can do anything uh unable to beat  harvinder
singh 
""
mukesh kumar in possession 
""
mounting the attack for  indian airlines is rajinder singh
there 
""
given on to jagbir singh
