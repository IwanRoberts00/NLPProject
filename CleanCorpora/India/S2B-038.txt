conversation with dr uma chakravarty we   have   have
  been trying to understand how history shaped  by the selective
interpretation of past events 
""
this particularly has affected the representation of women in history
""
""
in part one of the series dr chakravarty discussed the inherent biases
in historical sources  looking particularly at women in  the vedic and
buddhist periods 
""
in the second part we went on to look at women in mythology and the
epics 
""
in the third we discussed the bhakti tradition and  the medieval
period 
""
today in our concluding session we would look at the representation of
women at the turn of the century and soon after  
""
""
now uh coming to the nineteenth century  and the
socio-religious reform movements that we see at that time  uh would you
like to comment on the context in which  suddenly  we   so
called woman question acquires prominence  suddenly woman question is
foregrounded  what is the context in which this happen  ?
""
""
well actually this is uh  this is the question and this is
an area which is  com   tied up completely with our uh  the the
rewriting of history 
""
uh the enterprise of uh  writing history 
""
uh what you get in the nineteenth century is a  uh a rather
dramatic confrontation  between  two different  cultures 
""
uh with what appears to be a visible difference   in way 
in which the  colonial power  uh structured its gender relations and
the way in which the uh  the colonised power  uh had structured its
gender relations
""
and this is not a confrontation  which is on an equilitarian
basis but on clearly on an unequal basis 
""
so what you get is uh  the british  as the conquerors  uh
 with their understanding of both of their own culture as well as of the
culture that they are  now uh exposed to 
""
and the uh indians who were reacting to  uh a certain kind of
construction of their culture being  uh made by the colonial power 
""
now what is interesting is that the colonial power tends to look at
this in two ways 
""
one is to discuss what they consider to be a uhm  you know the
 the positive  values of this  the culture that they had come into
confrontation with  and a certain kind of uh uh  recognition that this
was  uh an ancient culture with various defined rules and  so on 
""
and this more or less uhm  coincided with the orientalist
enterprise
""
that is the orientalists  who  you know uhm translated the
sanskrit text who  uh who collected works  who uh uhm you know
discovered new works and so on
""
and so there was a  certain understanding about the past which
began to be constructed
""
but it was done clearly from the point of view of the  uh of the
british who  needed to know these uh  all these  in terms of being
better administrators 
""
simultaneously there was a  fairly strong and noticeable
reaction by the british  uh which ended up in   in in  a sense
condemning  the culture that they had uhm uh come into  uh contact with
""
and this is done partly because uh it also would indicate the moral
superiority of the conquerors and the  and the legitimacy of their
enterprise
""
but at the same time it also ended up in uh  making sweeping
condemnations of the entire culture
""
now what happened during this period is to begin to  identify
the status of women  with the civilisation as uh  it it became the 
uh index  of a civilisation 
""
so the status of women  uh would then decide whether the
civilisation was  ha  something that was valuable or not 
""
and this is what happened during the nineteenth century
""
now  it also tied in with the  the understanding of a how one
needed to reform the structure of relation 
""
uh  what practice is needed to be  uh stamped out  or uh
what kind of changes needed to be introduced 
""
and uh  here again there were two different ways in which you
can look at it
""
 there was   there was the british  uh view point 
there was also uh  development from within the  uh indians  which
was also similarly interested in certain degree of reform 
""
""
there was for example a woman like pandita ramabai who was
writing 
""
""
uh  a little later uhm  little later but  early on
for instance in the early uhm  nineteenth century you have some  uh
 say the whole discussion of  sati   and the need to
legislate on  sati   bringing forth the kind of literature
that rajaram mohan roy  and his adversaries generated on the  women's
 question
""
and here  here the  women's  question became central 
""
because uh you and and the use of the text also became central
because it was important to try and  establish  that several traditions
were authentic certain were  certain traditions had been interpolated
""
so the reformers used the  shastras   to indicate
that  uh certain practices were not there in the ancient hoary past
""
this is the period in which the beginnings of the vedic  the
construction of the vedic uh  period as a golden age for women actually
 began
""
""
uhm
""
""
uh because it was important to try and say that at some point
in the  hoary past uh the status of women had been high
""
that certain aberrations developed  and that these needed to be
stamped out 
""
uh at the same time the adversaries also used the  shastras
  to state that  the uh  the practices were actually
indigenous they were an inherent part of  indian tradition
""
all this resulted in a tremendous historical consciousness being uh
 generated  or about the past  in in which a lot of people were 
  into  uh   involved    uhm  and   
la    later    the nationalist came into the fray and
they needed  again to reconstruct the past along the lines that they
wanted
""
and they did this with a particular point from a particular point
of view  because they restructured gender relations  but they also 
 restructure   restructured   the images of men and women
""
""
means they created a uh uh a kind of  a  new man  who 
was vigorous  who was uh dynamic who was not at all a an effete person 
which is how the britisher cast  indians 
""
uh uh effete  emasculated kind of person  but someone who was
 uhm was strong  who've   who's  marshall who was  who
was capable of uh  the highest courage 
""
and the vedic period died after that because the aryan  uh was a
militant marshall  uh person 
""
simultaneously they did this  the same thing for women  so
women  got developed in two ways 
""
uh one was to look at women from the point of view of the uh uh 
practices that they had    be    been   familiar
with
""
so gargi for instance and the episode of gargi  becomes very
very important at this time  one to say that women  had  should
have access to learning now 
""
and there was a debate raging on whether women should study or not
 in bengal 
""
at the same time  uh it did indicate  the status in their
minds of women in the past 
""
and so one would get for instance a certain half baked half
information
""
for instance gargi  the gargi narrative  was  always used
to say  that gargi was learned she could debate yagnavalka but they didn't
complete the story
""
and they wouldn't tell you that  uh the debate had been on uhm
 unfair grounds and had been terminated on unfair grounds
""
that when  uh gargi  uhm fixed  uhm yagnavalka with two
subtle questions which  he would not be able to handle  and which he
was not able to handle he simply said  uhm  shut up woman
otherwise your head will fall off 
""
and uh he  ended the debate on that note
""
now  the nationalist obviously could not bring the later part
 because this would be a reflection on their ancient past 
""
but  in any case this kind of enterprise went on
""
simultaneously they also highlighted uh  a certain 
kshtriya  values for women 
""
and so they created new kind of men and a new kind of   
wo    womam   
""
now  ramabai  uh interestingly didn't quite fit in with this
whole reconstruction of the past 
""
uh  ramabai's  was unusual because she was one of the few
women who  knew sanskrit had been taught sanskrit by her father  uh in
fact by her mother 
""
uh who  then studied the the text  and who obviously was not
satisfied with the kind of answer that she found in her  text 
""
so that ramabai became a little bit of an embarassment  to 
the uhm  to atleast one section of the nationalist not to all of them
""
now ramabai is is extremely important from our point of view
""
because if you if we were to say   who's who's  one uh
 one of the first  uh women to be perceptive about the uh  status of
women 
""
uh one of the first  investigator as it were into the past as
well as into the present would be ramabai
""
she travelled extensively  but uh  during  one word 
she was exposed to a number of practices and uh she uh  evokes this in the
text that she wrote which is called the  high caste hindu widow
 
""
now here she talks about the low status of women 
""
and she is  really interesting because she turns the arguments
of this both the uhm  english  and the nationalist in a sense a
section of the nationalist  uh wrong 
""
now whereas people had  judged the  uh index of civilisation
 by the  low status of women and this is what the british had done 
""
uh simultaneously someone like dayananda had turned it around and
he talked about the status of women being high in the vedic period and
therefore this in  civilisation being  uh fine
""
ramabai  actually talks about psychological fear  and she
says  that  the  reason why we are a subject nation is because if
women are subject how can they produce sons  who are not psychologically
uh cowards 
""
and so she turns the argument fully around
""
now  hers is a really fascinating enterprise uh she uh  was
both reformist as well as knowledgable 
""
and uh  her handling of the  women's  question has a kind
of sharpness  and it it extraordinarily moving i mean uh for instance 
uhm  there is this marvellous passage that she had on the uh 
completely unequal uh  relations between men and women
""
so she talks about the situation which pertains to a widow  and
the situation which obtains to a widower
""
and she uses manu
""
she says  let her    emi    emaciate
  her body by living on pure flowers  roots and fruits but she
must never ever mentioned the name of another man  after her husband has
died 
""
until death let her be patient of hardships  self-control and
chaste  
""
then she goes on and she says   the rules for the widower
 a twice born man  versed in the sacred law shall burn a wife of the
equal  caste 
""
and  having at the funeral given sacred fires to his wife who
dies before him  he may marry again  and again kindle the  one word
 fires 
""
and the way she juxtoposes the two  you know indicates the
directness with which she is confronting the problem
""
here are a set of rules for men  here are the certain 
certain set of rules for women
""
and the uh  double standard of morality something that she
exposes  marvelously
""
she does this as far as uh  infanticide uh  she in a sense
she is one of the first recorders of  statistics because she talks about
female infanticide  and so on
""
so  her experience is actually uh  quite unique and is
something that  historians all historians  uh should this you know
should  open themselves upto
""
but certainly she is very important for rewriting history  to
include women 
""
""
uh  in in an early conversation with you you had mentioned
that dayanand saraswati has some very interesting things to say about women
as mothers    yeah  would you like to talk about that ?
""
""
 yeah  
""
""
yes sure
""
uh  well  you know uhm  dayanand goes back to the vedas
for uh  for uhm  a lot of the  uh kind of practices that he would
now  write  like to bring back 
""
so he  he gives to women a very central role  in uh creating
a new race of heroes 
""
now in doing this he is able to simultaneously deal with the  uh
women as wife  but also deal with the widow  who   is a  
is a   problem in nineteenth century and who is an embarassment to
many of the reformers
""
he  uh brings back and he talks about the practice of 
niyoga   which is very interesting because  niyoga
 uh  in the vedic time had been  the possibilities of uh  uh
rearing a son for the dead husband  uh by appointing somebody else in his
place 
""
now this is a practice and uh  lot has been made of 
niyoga   as a positive  right that women had
""
but uh uh  in the vedic period  let's  not make any uhm
  let's  not confuse the issue uh  it remains a prerogative uh
 which is available to the kinsmen of the household  to ensure that
reproduction  uh is uh continues
""
 it's it's  the right to remarry or to  co-habit but 
under rules which uh which previleged men and the cultural norms that they
would like to perpetuate
""
now  dayanand  uses this 
""
and he suggests that uh  that uh  widows can use 
niyoga   to have a series of son
""
so he does that on the one the hand 
""
but he also because of concern is very strongly for a a new race
""
""
for a race of people who are strong and rigorous 
""
he uses the biological  power of women  uh and regulates
 for it 
""
now for instance he suggests that women  uh must not uh 
actually feed their own  children because these should be handed to a
wetnurse  because a woman should return to uh uhm  as quickly as
possible to a situation where she can conceive at the time when she is 
best equipped for it which is between the years of sixteen and say  thirty
or whatever or whatever which will  which is the best time from the point
of view of reproduction
""
so he uhm  he uses both  traditional knowledge as well as
medical knowledge to uh  propose a  set of rules which does at one
level apparently raised the status of women  but which in in a sense
actually it is seeing women as stock breeders
