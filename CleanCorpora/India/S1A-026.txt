""
and it is reading and writing  writing and reading

""
yeah
""
""
of course most of it is  uh writing letters or letter uh
letter writing
""
""
uh ha 
""
""
uh  i have published  a book or two
""
""
is it  ?
""
""
yeah  i have written a book for  uh b a english major
students
""
""
ah ha that is something  one word 
""
""
it is entitled  literary criticism an introduction
""
""
""
ah ha 
""
""
and another book is a collection of my radio talks 
""
""
oh  you participated in radio talks also
""
""
yeah
""
""
 that's  good 
""
""
i kept  uh about twenty talks 
""
""
oh that is fine
""
""
and some fourteen or   fifteen them   fifteen of
them    are collected  uh brought together  uh in a book
form
""
""
oh 
""
""
and the book is entitled   a board block
""
""
""
ah ha 
""
""
and that was published by  an association called 
busset 
""
""
 a few words 
""
""
college english teacher  uh bijapur branch
""
""
bijapur 
""
""
and uh  it is uh  constituted mostly by my own students
""
""
for my retirement in nineteen eighty-nine  they got together
 uh a function to felicitate me
""
""
uh
""
""
and as part of that uh felicitation function  they brought
out this collection of my radio talks 
""
""
it is really great 
""
""
one more that is uh  of course i could have done some more
work  but being an administrator
""
""
uhm
""
""
i have been an administrator for more than twenty years 
""
for nearly twenty-five years i had been a principal of one college
and another    uh ha 
""
i have headed three colleges 
""
uh  in the  thirty-seven years career  as teacher and
administrator both
""
""
 uh ha  
""
""
ah ha 
""
""
but because of uh administrative work  i have not been able
to do much 
""
much of reading
""
""
uhm 
""
""
and uh  writing of course  uh follows as a consequence
  and uh 
""
""
 but you   didn't get enough time 
""
""
ah  i much of my time is wasted in uh  attending to the
t v r i should say 
""
""
 accha  
""
""
though i  though i have worked as both teacher and an
administrator  i had more satisfaction as a administrator than as  a
teacher  because i  did enjoy my teaching at the  at the graduate
level  uh especially teaching  made in english 
""
uh i taught   one word  for a number of years 
""
and uh  i was the only so to say specialised  in that branch
of uh english studies  around there
""
""
in your place
""
""
uh yeah 
""
and uh my  specialities   one or two words  again
were middle english  and uh literary teaching 
""
so after teaching uh literary criticism for a year or two  uh i
thought my notes  which i  got up as a preparation for my class
teaching  could be published in book form
""
""
ah ha 
""
""
so  uh after resigning  one word  here and there
""
""
i could uh  bring them all in book form
""
""
you are thinking of a second edition 
""
""
no it has uh  gone through a second edition also  one
or two words  now it is due for  uh reprint again 
""
of course this uh  while it was printing the second time  i
made some addition  uh i had a chapter on uh this  practical
criticism  and i called it tentative notes for  practical
""
""
a new observation anyway  one word  
""
""
and one chapter i added on the new critics 
""
at the insistance of a friend  who is now head of the 
english department at karnataka university
""
yeah she happens to be an old student of mine 
""
and then again i had a post script to do one of the chapter 
""
so this way it was uh  the second edition of the book 
""
so rather than reprinting as it is  i use to add something more
to the book
""
""
sure 
""
""
uh when it goes for third printing 
""
and what about you ?
""
have you   done  anywhere since   you are  
you are   experienced in printing and outsetting
""
""
 ha yeah  
""
""
it reminds me one thing 
""
once only in my life as i am not a teacher  i tried to publish
a small book on  grammar
""
""
grammar
""
""
actually  that's  functional grammar  for uh in
general for the students at the s s l c level and  this for final level
""
""
but it is  one word  because of so many problems
""
""
that kind of progress  uh  has been in my mind too
""
""
oh yes  i thought uh     one or two word 
 specially in our state   it's  in kerala  we brought uh 
of course so many books  borrowed from andhra  they  one-word 
like it
""
""
  one-or-two-words   
""
""
but uh we don't have a book  which is really meant for 
or useful to children  one or two word 
""
so i i  uh like to publish  a small book  especially
with regard to the uh examples 
""
examples  one-word  but then it didn't work
""
anyway i brought out a small  one-word  a book  and 
it's  uh printing material and  it's  most uh efforts
""
""
yeah  it's  true
""
""
printing some thing and i  once i thought of leaving
everything  uh but uh anyway i  uh finished it but then it was not
satisfactory
""
then my aim i mean  it was my wish always  uh i was uh i
wanted to be a teacher
""
""
uh
""
""
but uh  that's  the only thing i couldn't  and when
i did get the chance  and uh  if i got i missed it  anyhow  and
now atleast
""
""
oh so you didn't get a chance
""
""
yeah a chance and
""
""
 that's  why you had to 
""
""
uh go for some other job and now i am working as an officer
steno 
""
and uh  i am  still  rethinking of teaching  uh uh i
mean coming again to teaching 
""
and i took my  pg degree in three subjects  in  
english  malyalam   and politics 
""
""
 i see  
""
""
 i see  
""
""
ahn
""
""
and now i am  doing my research in one of the topic in
english 
""
""
good    and  very good
""
""
 and  
""
""
 i'm  doing this course 
""
""
 that's  only for  inter 
""
""
i have no other i mean prospectus nor tried for because it
was late now i am age forty    oh  i have been late  so i
expect   in that things 
""
""
 oh  
""
""
 now you want   to change the line and go back to
teaching after all
""
""
of course i tried in many ways    uh  after my
s s c    uhm  which i was doing was trying many fields
""
""
 uh  
""
""
 uhm  
""
""
ahn
""
""
i tried some banks  and i knew kuchipudi  and 
one-word  bharatnatyam    oh  and i studied for seven years
 and i studied carnatic music also 
""
i studied uh some western music also  and i can play very well
 some southern musical instruments  and i participated in 
dynamora  one- word  forum
""
""
 oh  
""
""
ah
""
""
and uh i was the  one-word  the church choir being a
christian 
""
well i tried many way   but uh  luck  as if  my
star was not bright i think
""
""
 oh you did  
""
""
i see yeah
""
""
so i couldn't succeed
""
anyway i joined here  as per my interest 
""
anyway i am  hopeful i fought for the  best to come 
""
""
you seem to be versatile man with varied interests
""
""
thank you  laughter 
""
""
i   couldn't have guessed as much  from
""
""
 i did try it  
""
""
tried it
""
""
tried it of course 
""
you see uh  cough   man's  abilities are not written
on his face anyway 
""
""
oh yes yes
""
""
but then uh
""
""
it is uh   call   call   it versatile
because  my experience is when ever we go deep investing  we know how
little we actually know 
""
accepted  i can feel that that   from   from 
 my own experience  after simply taking a degree  i mean ba that
was in economics 
""
i simply  uh showed courage to  take the programme of teach
for a  wrestler  without any reference or preparation i mean
""
""
ahn 
""
""
but uh after taking my ma  i will now try  without
preparation because   that's 
""
""
no doubt
""
""
means that uh when we go deep into a thing  then only we
know how less we do 
""
then we have to prepare uh well
""
""
one has to recollect one stops on  uh  that's  uh
how we teach   literature  
""
before one  uh has to do any  talking on  that is
literature 
""
no doubt for uh on every reading  once  possibly see the
new meaning in it  one see something new
""
""
 sure sure  
""
""
oh
""
""
 it's  always  better  to  read the poem or
prose piece once again carefully before we  give a talk on it
""
""
 yes  
""
""
sure 
""
""
you know i used to have uh  some other interest too
""
i used to be a sportsman  at school 
""
and then college of course  i  my interests uh  were
 tape recorded  ultimately   it's  only books  uh that
have remained my first and last interest
""
""
uh
""
""
you may even call it my first and last love   i'm 
the complete bookworm  so to say
""
""
yeah 
""
""
but then  to deserve  that affiliation  that name
either  kam dand  one word  
""
""
uhm uhm
""
""
which  i've  not 
""
then  one's  administration  cuts into  one's 
 time which i would like to devote to books
""
""
well your major parts of your life was  connected with a
lot of administration and all
""
""
yeah that has to be    yeah  uh into most of my
time 
""
moreover  even  uh managing the household
""
""
 yeah  
""
""
yes yes that familiar thing
""
""
  yeah  that takes a lot out of us 
""
""
 yes  
""
""
yes
""
""
uh my mrs is not  a highly educated
""
""
oh 
""
""
and uh  so i have to take on most uh most of the burden
of the uh  seeing to the childrens education    sure  their
requirements
""
""
 sure  
""
""
universal
""
""
their upbringing
""
""
yeah 
""
""
you know  one-or-two-words 
""
""
 one-or-two-words 
""
""
my mrs can't be of much help to me in my profession 
rather i have to be of some help to her
""
""
oh
""
""
in fact in the household work
""
""
yes 
""
""
so  it's  like that
""
so even that  have  claims over my time
""
""
oh 
""
""
which i  wish could have been spent to my  which i
might have devoted to  reading and writing
""
""
reading and writing
""
""
yes 
""
 it's  always the problem with we people 
""
 i've  admired and been suffered with  uh mine has been
a  chequered career    uhm  i  for studied in three
colleges  i have taught in four colleges
""
""
 uhm  
""
""
uhm  that's  something great  you have the
experience   of teaching  in different colleges
""
""
 and uh  
""
""
again  one or two words  i had to  to be without
any employment for six months  uh i suffered uh break of service
""
and that told upon  my  one-word  also 
""
i suffered a great loss in terms of  one- word  
""
but  uh none of that  has been able to  uh darken the
horizon of my mind 
""
""
you really you have the presence of mind to fetch the
boundary 
""
""
yeah
""
""
yeah   that's  uh one uh has to do 
""
say then i just only remember  for telling these  night and
day  dispute but never be defeated  that these are the credit to our
 one-word 
""
""
one of these setbacks
""
""
ah sure
""
""
uh i have been able to  tell upon my  one-word 
tell upon my outlook on life 
""
i have always sought healthy  thoughts 
""
and uh never looked back 
""
""
to
""
""
especially in anger 
""
""
never  look back in anger 
""
""
ah not in anger 
""
""
oh sure you not you should not
""
""
regret uh  regreting the steps i have taken
""
""
yes
""
""
the  buses that  that i had missed
""
""
ah ha 
""
""
the wrong turnings i have taken in life
""
""
ah right 
""
""
 that's  why i never looked back
""
""
ah i see 
""
""
and uh had any regrets  for whatever  i  myself
done  or decided upon with my eyes open
""
""
oh 
""
""
so life has  it's   ups and downs
""
""
oh sure
