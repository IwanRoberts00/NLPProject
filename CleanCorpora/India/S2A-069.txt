""
""
it is duly proved by the prosecution beyond reasonable doubt
 that is main point 
""
my lord in this case  that only  this was  there  were
 two witness from the society  uh the p w six and p w seven
""
now p w seven  only he pointed out there are three watchmen are
there my lord  three watchmen 
""
only he stated three watchmen  uhn
""
""
two 
""
""
two two
""
""
there are uh one he includes that the   watchmens 
 watchmen   are here in the society  from the north
""
""
no when i come to read this thing no ?
""
""
so data should be  of three watchmen 
""
""
no that i come to look at and then that  what  idea in
the mind  you've  got then i am going to come to that point my lord
""
""
uh if there are three watchmen  are there  then i put the
specific question mr  pimpulkar   did you   recorded  
record   the statement of the if there were any watchman first point
""
""
he says he has not recorded 
""
secondly nobody has   from   from   the
society  or watchman  or p w six or p w seven
""
this is a registered premises given    to   to 
 these three watchmen 
""
they are residing together 
""
and second thing they could  the would  be  possibles
have to prove  the watchman should come and make a statement before the
police officer or before the court  that   ke  we are
residing there along with this accused person 
""
we are residing the  this  we are three watchmen of this
building  uhm 
""
""
yes 
""
""
 nahi  uh     que que   
question   if we put up the whether you have recorded a statement of
the any watchman  he say  no  
""
so it is burden of the prosecution that  to establish the guilt
on   uh  accu    this accused   
""
here the watchman has to come say  yes this accused was
residing there   when this article seven was seized  then 
 no no   not   any watchman has pointed this is a shirt
which belongs to accused number  s  this article belongs to this
accused 
""
there there is no evidence at all 
""
only the  only  shirt was found  and then only on suspect
 they drawn the inference my lord 
""
""
yes
""
""
this is one aspect so there is no connection with the this
shirt with the accused 
""
when uh  when this shirt was searched     se 
  sealed   with  when shirt was taken under the 
panchnama  my lord 
""
now now  now next point  uh next point my lord 
""
only p w six and seven said when this shirt was shown to them 
when this article seven  i'll  argue only on this point  article
seven 
""
when this shirt was shown to them they identified  so question
was put up  before showing this shirt    whe   
did you  have  you  given description of this shirt  
""
they said  no we have not given description of shirt 
""
""
now page twenty my lord 
""
""
yes
""
""
page twenty my lord    pa    para 
 six  page  page two two zero  when he was cross examined i want
that part my lord 
""
para para two  para two 
""
""
yes 
""
""
my lord may i read with your permission
""
""
yes
""
""
i have maintained a register of society employees
""
the employees would not provide any any form 
""
i will not give them the description of clothes of the accused 
in my statement before the police 
""
so i do not recollect whether article shown to me in the 
possession  of  panchas  known by the police 
""
article shown to me i had not checked up the label of mark of shirt
article and the article shown to me  by police it was not taken out of
sealed packet  article seven not sealed in my presence after it is shown
to me 
""
with with great respect to my submission  there are two things
from the  two things maybe gathered from this this evidence 
""
before showing this there there is no description 
""
second point when this shirt was shown  he doesn't  he
doesn't he he   do   does   not remember  whether
such  whether shirt was shown in the presence of  panchas 
 or not  
""
so therefore it  is  inadmissable under section one
sixty-two   ci ci  evidence act 
""
because if it should be
""
""
shirt was not taken in the hand of  in the presence of two
 two  panchas 
""
""
no no they did not when  when statement was recorded 
inst  of the p w six  and p w seven  and shirt was shown but it was
not shown in the presence of  panchas  
""
this  this uh uh article seven  this affects article 
which it was not shown in the presence of  panchas  
therefore it is hid by under section one sixty-two 
""
""
hence the statement must be  seized and statement was
recorded by by 
""
""
it was recorded  when the subsequent shirt was shown to
them 
""
so so that question is put whether this shirt was shown in the
presence of  panchas  or not 
""
""
whether these shirts
""
""
article seven
""
""
ah ha
""
""
whether it was shown to in the presence of  panchas
""
""
""
what
""
""
shown
""
""
it shown
""
""
shown disclosed
""
""
whether this shirt
""
""
sir was
""
""
or your point is that this article seven shirt was not shown
in the presence of  panchas  p w six and p w and seven
""
""
seven yes my lord
""
""
you wanted to prove that article should be shown in the
presence of  panchas 
""
""
 panchas  yes my lord
""
""
in the presence of  panchas 
""
""
if  if it is  if it does show on then it is hit hit by
under one section sixty-two my lord 
""
""
if it is sealed earlier    uhm  then it should be
sealed should be opened opened in the presence of  panchas 
and then only it can be shown
""
""
 uhm  
""
""
yes 
""
well uh we  now  that that is one of  if it is this shirt
now their case is  there when this shirt was  first  taken under
charge of  panchnama   by the  panch 
number two  uh p w two 
""
and it is their case it was sealed  if it is sealed  if it
is so sealed  the seal should be    b br    broken
  in the presence of  panchas  and uh  and this
shirt should be shown in the  pr   shown to in in the presence of
 panchas  
""
that is that is one aspect 
""
i  sugge  after showing this shirt  there there was no
sealing  that is most important my lord 
""
because this  this shirt was shown to them  there were no
sealing and subsequently sent to c a my lord 
""
after later days  so many days 
""
that is one point 
""
my lord p w seven 
""
""
after showing this shirt   uhm  to p w uh six and
seven   uh  you normally your witness is one zero two
""
""
 uhm  
""
""
 uh  
""
""
only two  six  two is
""
""
apart from p w number six and seven it was not shown to the
others
""
""
no there there other  panchas  were there my
lord 
""
""
 one word 
""
""
no they they would be just
""
""
article seven apart from  a few words   interruption
""
""
""
so only they want to they they established that the article
seven in connection with three my lord 
""
so with my respectful seven that  the p w six or seven they
admitted possession  before showing this shirt they have not given
description of article  if it is not given description article  and it
would not show in the  in the  pre   if it sealed   if
it is sealed it this seal was not    br br    broken 
 in their presence  in so therefore we had doubt about this genuiness
about this  prosecution
""
that is one aspect 
""
now my lord whether further if i may take  further evidence my
lord 
""
that  if p w two is    mo    most  
important of the prosecution witness  p w two   solid  
""
now  page nine my lord 
""
page nine cross section para two 
""
para two my lord 
""
my  l i  if  when question was put  when this article
seven  is there any passivity mark     man   
manufacturing   mark  manufacturing mark  this   i'll
 read my lord the fourth  uh uh
""
""
manufacturing mark of
""
""
means there is need no  label mark label mark  this
shirt was  there is some marking on this 
""
""
trade mark
""
""
trade marks  so that i i  trade mark  trade  tra
 if it is really  taken under  panchanama  they might
pointed out before in the  panchanama   this is  nino
 mark that it is not so mentioned in the  panchanama  
""
this there is no reference of manufacturing label  nino 
article seven in exhibit eight  similar shirts shirts like this are freely
available in the market 
""
so this there is  i now say  panchanama  was
explain 
""
now my lord the there is one point  so  similar question
were put up p w six and seven whether there is any label or trade marks 
whether did you point out in  panchanama  uh or in your
statement or in  panchanama  they said nothing 
""
my lord  now 
""
now my lord  p w two further says when this shirt was found on
the flooring  it uh he further says the blood stains mark mark by police
with the pen 
""
the shirt was then sealed and packed and labeled 
""
so it is presumed that the return must have must have done  at
that time in the premises my lord 
""
that is one aspect 
""
""
yes
""
""
that is  with uh  why it is very important 
""
this is   a   an   incidence of the 
panchanama  on twenty-seventh july ninety-one
""
""
yes 
""
""
that is there case it was sealed mark everything,
""
now my lord  if it so my lord  then this  when they are
searching  at that time nobody was there only  panchas 
were there  uh shirt was taken sealed

now with this  we we come to evidence of p w one most important

it disturbs it get disturbs and i may be i am not clear 
for the example my lord  if this one packet here is sealed  and if i
point to that  opened it  if it if it  is  not sealed it is
easily we may shown if it  if it is  if it is sealed it should be 
so so their connection in this  p  evidence of p w one and p w two sir
it is inconsistence evidence with regard to them
