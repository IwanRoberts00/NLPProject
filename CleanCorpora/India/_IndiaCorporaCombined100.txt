so proteins are the major bb-work   food material that is the important food materials  which are use used for the growth and development of the  of body either plant body or the animals body  so these proteins they are the macro molecules  proteins they are the bb-work the macro molecules  so this these proteins can be the several kinds of amino acids  several types of amino acids are present in the protein molecules  so in plants the amino acids they obtain from the inorganic process that's from that means it is from the   atmosphere itself  the plants and also some micro organisms they have the ability to fix the inorganic nitrogen and to convert it into the amino acid form  but in the case of these animals they have to depend on the plants for the amino acid source the source of amino acids they have either they have to depend directly or  indirectly  what does it mean direct depe uh and the directly dependent means   one-word  in the case of herbivorous plants uh sorry herbivorous animals  they have to depend on the animals they are depending on the plants for their foods  so they are getting direct ly the food materials from the plants understand  but in carnivores they are directly depending on the plants for their amino acid source  that means they are eating this uh flesh of other animals which are eating the plants or otherwise you can say that carnivorous animals they are eating herbivorous animals that means indirectly they we are getting the uh source of the protein from the plants understand  so this amino acids are the made up of the components of the amino acids are also carbon bb-work hydrogen  oxygen and the nitrogen  carbon hydrogen oxygen and the nitrogen and in some cases sulphur is also present in some cases the present of bb-work sulphur  bb-work  so there may be either monocarbocilic or dicarbocilic acids  bearing one or two amino groups  these amino acids may be either monocarbocilic or dicarbocilic acid bearing one or two amino groups  that means the you will you will not be know  knowing that a carbon atom has four valency isn't it  so these four valency for the carbon atom it is attached to one amino groups bb-work and to one carboxic group and to one hydrogen and one to the side chain one to a side chain  and the side can may be either polar or nonpolar  so every amino group is a so this amino acids may be they are of bb-work basic amino acids and acidic bb-work  and neutral amino acid bb-work  basic then acidic and the neutral amino acids then what does it mean basic amino acids  so every amino or group is known as the and amino acids having a free amino group is known as a basic amino acid for example lysine and arginine bb-work  so this lysine and arginine they have it they're having  one carbocil group and two amino group one carbocil and a bb-work and two amino group that is why they are known as the basic amino acids and the acidic amino acids they are having one such amino group and two carboxic groups  and two one carbocil bb-work one amino and a two carboxic group  one  so they are known as acidic amino acid  so and another group they are having one amino group and one carboxic group n h d   carbonic group  one carboxic and one bb-work they are known as neutral amino acids  for acidic amino acid for example glutonic acid and uh aspartic acids glutonic and aspartic bb-work  and for neutral amino acids examples glycine alanin valine  phenylalanine etcetera bb-work  glycine alanin valine etcetera  so these are the three main type of amino acids that is the basic amino acids acidic amino acid and the neutral amino acids understand  then if two amino acids can this these amino acids  can be linked together by means of peptide bond  two amino acids they can be linked together linked understand linked united together link  together like by means of peptide bond peptide bond  bb-works  so like that several peptide bonds to form a linear chain of many amino acids  have you understood that chain the two amino acids they can be linked together by means of peptide bond so like that several bonds will be forming and like that a linear chain of peptide bonds can be formed  so these are known by the name together these are known as the  peptide it is together form a peptide bb-work  so what is a peptide ? and what what will you say peptide what is it ? a peptide is formed by forming   by the  different parts of the  by by joining of  by forming pep several peptide bonds understand  that is peptide bonds are formed in between two amino acids two amino acids can be bonded together or joined together by forming peptide bonds  so like that several amino acids will be united or bonded together to form a linear chain of amino acids they are known that amino acid molecule is known as the peptide a single peptide a peptide is formed by the bonding together of several peptide bonds understand  that means several amino acids join together forming a linear chain of bonds known as the peptide bonds and these linear chains a of molecule contains a linear chain of these bonds they are known as the not a single  peptide okay a single peptide is formed from several amino acids joined together or bonded together understand  that is known as a peptide  so we will uh these proteins are micro molecules formed by  from a large number of peptide  that means a protein molecule contains the large number of these  peptide  but the function the the structure or the function will be different  the properties of protein will be different from the properties of a peptide or peptide bond understand  that means the protein molecule contains several peptides  and also the peptide bonds but the properties of the protein differs from the properties of the peptide understand  uh we know that a protein molecule contains several peptides but the properties are different   property of the protein is different from the property of the  peptide understand but protein molecule contains several peptide  then let us see the function of the functions of  amino acids bb-work  so the main function is the they are the building blocks for protein  that means what what does it mean ? main function building blocks for bb- work protein the the main function is the building blocks for proteins that means several peptides or the amino acids are uh  constitute the protein molecules that means the main function and another is that is said the specific amino acids are also converted into different types of biologically active compounds  certain specific amino acids they biologically convert to form several biological compounds  for example tyrocine it is converted into form of tyrocine is a amino acid bb-work  it is converted into the form of known as tyrocine  bb-work  tyrocine and a adrinalin that is also a harmone  bb-work  adrinalin and another the skin pigment melanin that is also melanin bb-work that is the skin pigment  melanin is the skin pigment you know what is it skin pigment ? you don't know so that is the skin colour you know we have the the dark people or black they are having in their skin having the larger quantity of the melanin pigments  so the less melanin pigments have the fair colour  that is the present presence of these pigment only give the colour that is the black colour individually and melanin pigments   some in some cases we have seen that the people they are not having this melanin pigment have you seen  so they are known by the name this such people they are known albino bb- work  albino  they are lacking the pigment they do not have this melanin pigment that is why they that means the these something  these amino acids or tyrocine will be lacking in their body for  for the conversion of this pigment for the production of this pigment melanine pigment producing a materials  material for blacking blackening in their body  that is the pigment the total pigment  is absent in their body that is even then why their skin   also is having white colour isn't it ? because our this uh our hair is uhm black due the presence of this melanin pigment  so in such people they do not have the ability to produce this pigment melanin that is why they look colourless colourless people or albino  so another uhm this plant harmone indole three acetic  acid and vitamin nicotinamide etcetera are also formed from a tryptophane bb-work  the amino acid from amino acid tryptophane  these plants harmone known as indole three acetic acids  and the vitamin nicotinamide etcetra are formed bb-work  indole three acetic acids that is a plant harmone and the vitamin nicotinamide that is also formed from the amino acids tryptophane  so we know that the main constituent of the glucose is carbon hydrogen and oxygen isn't it ? so here in the amino acids carbon hydrogen oxygen and nitrogen is also there so this here the n h group or the amino group is removed then it will be converted into glucose  and like that the carbo-oxyl group can be removed then it will form the carbon-dioxide  so these are the functions of amino acids understand  so next is the nucleotides bb-work  so these nucleotides are also complex molecules forming a part of the information transfer system in the cells  the inform what is information transfer system  ? what does it mean ? the transfer of information from cell to cell or nerve  from the nerve impulses like that that is the information  transfer system the information will be transferred from cell to cell that is the information transfer system  so they the they are the basic units of nucleic acids also you know that nucleic acid  which are the main nucleic acids ? the d n a and the r n a  d n a  what does it mean ? d n a means what does it mean power  deoxyribo nucleic acid and r n a ribose nucleic acid   power   ribose  so the basic unit of nucleic acids are the  nucleotides  so these nucleotides also contain carbon hydrogen oxygen nitrogen and phosphorus a nucleotide when are contained contains   carbon hydrogen oxygen and nitrogen and a phosphorus so each nucleotide is made up of a cyclic nitrogenous base apendo and one two three phosphate group  each nucleotide is made up of a cyclic nitrogenous base  apendo and uh one two three phosphate group  so the the nitrogenous base is bb-work  occurring in nucleotides are they may be either purine or  pyromidin bb-writing  so then nitrogenous bases occurring in the nucleo tides are they may be either a purine or a pyromidin  so the major purines are adanine and a guarine  bb-writing  so this the major purines are adraline and a guarine and pyrimidins are bb-writing thymine uracil and the cytocin thymin bb-writing uracil and cytocin  so this uracil is present in the r n a isn't it ? uracil that is seen in the r n a  so the apendo is either ribose or deoxyribose  the apendo that may be either ribose or deoxyribose  so the nucleo tides are thus called the ribonucleotides or deoxyribonucleotides  so if a nucleotide contains ribose the apendos then we will say it is a ribo nucleotide  and if it contains a deoxy ribonucleo tide then it is known as the deoxyribonucleotide  for examples of ribonucleotides are adrinalic acid  adrinalic acid bb-writing  adrinalic acid is an example for ribonuclei nucleotide an example for deoxyribonucleic nucleotide is the  deoxyribo nucleic acid that is the deoadrinalic acid  deoadrinalic acid bb-writing  so adrinalic acid is an example for  yes  it is an example for the  uhn  adrinalic acid  it is the example of ribonucleotide  ribonucleotide and deoxyribonucleotide example  deoxyadrinalic acid  so this ribonucleotides are the basic units of ribonucleic acids or r n a  the ribonucleotides are the basic units of ribonucleic acids that is r n a and also deoxy nuc uh ribonucleotides are the basic units of deoxyribonucleic acids  so that is the d n a  say a combination of these nitrogenous base is the pentosugar  is known as a nucleo tide  so what is a nucleotide then ? nucleotide bb-writing nucleotide what is it ? a nucleotide is formed by the combination of a nitrogenous base with a pentose sugar   a nitrogenous base  that is known as a nucleotide
