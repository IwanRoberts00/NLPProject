co-operation today is an economic system as a peaceful reaction against capitalistic economy which has resulted in the concentration of wealth mass poverty and decay of men  indian co-operative movement is probably the strongest  and the oldest movement among developing countries  the co-operative movement has been in existance for more than eighty-five years and would be hundred years old soon  the movement was introduced with high hope and big expectation providing a solution to india's rural problem  all the committees from the times of mr nicolson to this day  have constantly emphasised that the co-operative sector is a fundamental solution to the ills of the rural economy in general and agricultural economy in particular  in the first few decades the movement was not a significant movement but after independence due to government's  encouragement and the reserve bank's participation the movement began to spread  since nineteen forty-seven the number of societies have increased from one point eight lakhs to about three point fifteen lakhs  and the total membership has also gone up from one point thirty-seven crore to fifteen crore  the co-operative sector has provided loan to the extent of eight thousand crore during eighty-nine ninety as against rupees six thousand crore  provided by the commercial banks  the development of consumer store and industrial co-operatives has also been significant  thus the co-operative sector in india made a tremendous progress in various directions and has reached a stage when it can be said as an important factor in economic social and political development of india and has now become progressive and diversified national level statutory organizations like nabard l t d c n d d have been set up to promote new co-operatives in india in nineteen eighty-seven eighty-eight the co-operatives attended further heights  agricultural credit disbursed was around rupees  three thousand five hundred crore and the value of the credit marketed was around rupees five thousand  crore  the co-operatives distributed forty lakh  tonnes of fertilizers amounting three thousand five hundred  crore rupees and the co-operative sugar factories produced  fifty lakh tonnes of sugar in nineteen eighty-seven eighty-eight accounting sixty percent national production of sugar  dairy development and processing co-operatives also show  similar progress  the experience of number of successful co-operative organizations like amul in gujarat marksade in punjab  cooptex in tamil nadu apco in andhra sugar in maharashtra  demonstrate that co-operative sector has needful energy to forge ahead  there is thus vast scope for development of organized marketing processing and export activities in the field of vegetables flowers horticultural products forest produce and such other things  consumer store if managed honestly and efficiently can provide services to millions  important achievement during the seventh plan was a process of reorganization of primary society to viable unit  this process was complete in all the states except maharashtra gujarat and jammu kashmir  another milestone was the establishment of nabard in july nineteen eighty-two as an apex institution to handle all matters relating to planning policy and operation in the field of agriculture  the seventh plan also laid down great emphasis on development of professional manpower also  all these efforts brought economic social political  and educational benefits to the members of these societies  the economic benefits include providing of cheap credit  rescuing of rural farmer from the clutches of money-lenders  better use of credit better prices to farmer product and better marketing facilities to industrial worker  on social side idle men became industrial  the spendthrift the thrifty the illiterate learnt reading  and some drunkard person reform their ways  in short co-operatives have become a tool of self  aggrendisement  thus the co-operatives made great strides and influence  all spheres  however there seem to have crept in several distortions  on account of various reasons  actually the movement was introduced to uplift the downtrodden  and the small farmer  but in this respect we find that the movement has certainly failed in achieving these objectives   the rural credit survey committee has rightly observed that the slice of the co-operative finance was eaten by the big cultivator  thirteen percent of the total household got sixty percent share of the loan while fifty-three percent household got eleven percent only  mr c subramaniam governor of maharashtra has rightly said  that the co-operatives have unfortunately not catered to the needs of the weaker classes  on the contrary the leaders and the vested interests  had plagued the co-operative sector thereby the committed honest workers are ousted and driven out  for the poor performance the number of causes are responsible  among them lassez faire policy illiteracy  very small sized societies undue reliance on honorary services  inefficiency in management and partial coverage of the life of the individual  extrinsic factors include widespread indebtedness  lack of business experience uneconomic holding price fluctuation  dearth of regulated market old methods of cultivation  presently the co-operative banking sector faces the problems like overdue shortage of resources indifferent management and the lack of efforts to mobilize deposits untrained staff and weak arrangement for linking credit with marketing  in india twenty-five percent of the societies or say  thirty-four thousand societies are defunct and dormant today  this shows that the co-operative movement in india is not uniformly developed   there's marked regional disparity and unevenness  in the growth  in maharashtra punjab tamil nadu more than seventy percent rural population has come within the fold while in bihar  west bengal assam and orissa the coverage is below twenty percent  in andhra the development is restricted to to telangana  or railseema  one of the most disquietning feature in co-operative sector is  incidence of increasing overdues  in maharashtra alone overdues amount to rupees  two thousand four hundred crore in nineteen eighty-seven  in the past there were selfless and zealous workers who devoted their whole life as a mission  but today there is lack of dedicated leadership and lack of trained personnel also  the development is also hampered due to lack of inconsistant policy and rigid approach of the government  the formation of large sized society was rejected by the government without giving it a trial or a serious consideration  the defective loan policy also stood in a way of severe growth of the movement  in most cases the members of the society do not understand  exact aims and objectives of the co-operatives  the members therefore have become the clients of convenience  this has laid to all kinds of undesirable things in the management of the society  viewed in totality our co-operative sector is not that impressive and overall image is that one of the major reasons for this is that all initiative comes from the government agencies  and not from the people  it thus has lost its basic character  even today the movement is known as sarkari  movement and not the sahakari  there are several apex institutions which have no firm rule  and have a superstructure without infrastructure  there is also lack of inter-co-operative relationship both vertically and horizontally  the sector therefore cannot show its unified strength in the economy  there is absence of sectoral planning in co-operative sector  federal units like n c d c nabard nafed do not pay  sufficient attention to the constituent units   national co-operative policy resolution of nineteen seventy-seven relating to integreted approach has not yet been implemented  absence of such a policy has major limitation which has created  several problems in working of the co-operative sector  there is thus an immediate need for a clear government policy  for the co-operatives  now it is also quite necessary to incorporate role of co-operatives in indian constitution so that a clear prosperous future past could be defined  for the success of co-operatives three elements are necessary  a dedicated leadership professionally competent management  and enlighten membership  after all the co-operatives are owned by members and therefore members should know what they really expect from the co-operatives  awareness among the members is very poor  there is lack of free membership training and education also  leaders also have no clarity about their role  as the members of the co-operatives or resource poor in india government provide finance but with some directives  under such circumstances how to restore member confidence  is the highest challenge facing us  and as a first step in this regards the government will have to loosen its excessive control over the co-operatives  recently the issue of activization of democratic process  coupled with promotion and professionalization of management was discussed in registrar's meeting on twenty-sixth august nineteen eighty-five  and according to recommendations ardhanarishvaran committee was set up in march nineteen eighty-six  the committee in its recent report advised to restrain the tendency to abuse democratic rights in the co-operatives  exclusive of one or two recommendations all other recommendations unless adopted expeditously the movement cannot go further  india is thus facing a number of challenges and in changing situations the role of co-operatives depend on how swiftly co-operatives adopt and reorient to these challenges  fortunately in seventh plan adequate credit was made available to weaker section and less developed areas  in maharashtra from the initial role of disbursement of credit in rural areas the co-operatives have diversified into several subsectors  co-operatives now provide a full range of services to village level farmer in all respect  so all these are good changes yet hereafter the poor sections could be helped in income-generating  activities literacy programme village sanitation drinking water programme vocational training programme and community development activities  hereafter these new co-operatives are to be organized for weaker sections  the members should be provided training in general management along with leadership development programmes  in short co-operatives should do something for the community and then only people will begin to identify as their own co-operatives
