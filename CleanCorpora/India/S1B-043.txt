mrs jamuna is a congress-i member of parliament representing
rajamundri east godavari of andhra pradesh  in the  lok sabha
 
""
this is her first term as a member of parliament 
""
but  her talent is multifaceted 
""
long before she face the people  she was facing   life
   studio life   
""
yes  she is a famous film personality of andhra 
""
but she is known beyond andhra as well 
""
those of us who remember the film   milan 
  cannot forget her award winning performance as gauri 
""
but apart from  occasional stories into the hindi cinema  she
has largely restricted herself  to telugu cinema 
""
although she has also acted in tamil and kannada films as well 
""
jamunajee  considering how many films and how films have been
 making politicians in the south  it must have been smooth sailing for
you isn't it  ?
""
""
yes of course  because uh  being a cine artist  uh
we   use to   are    more accustomed to public 
""
because uh as a cinema artist we use to go into the masses  and
uh for shooting  and for for public meeting  as a social workers also
""
""
we have a lot of contact with uh  public in cine life 
""
so naturally when we have become a  uh politician  i think
uh   it's  not much difficult to  uh do our service  as 
one or two word  our politician
""
""
when did you actually entered films  ?
""
""
i was so young  i think uh  nineteen fifty-two  i was
just fourteen years  may be 
""
so i entered into the film fray  as a heroine  in the first
picture itself 
""
one    one word   uh
""
""
  one word     i'm  sorry 
""
""
uh my first picture was  the name   
foottillu   that means  in hindi you can say 
maike  
""
in nineteen fifty-two  one mr uh  late raja rao  he
introduced me to the film 
""
he hails from  uh rajamundri constituency which  i'm 
 now presenting  as a public  servant 
""
so he introduced me to the film  as a heroine first 
""
""
we know that you have  for thirty years  played a
leading role  in cinema 
""
especially that you have always played a leading actress 
""
how many hindi films have you made  ?
""
""
so far i have acted uh  nearly twenty  twenty films 
in hindi 
""
my first hindi film was uh    naya aadmi
   and that was superhit film in those days 
""
and then  second picture    miss mary
  
""
third was  uh   humrahi   
""
fourth   milan   
""
fifth   rishte-nate  beti-bete 
  and then   dulhan    uh
so many films
""
and    rajtilak   recently i
acted with uh  sanjeev kumar in   yadgar 
 and uh    naukar bibi ka  
""
like that so many films i acted 
""
""
yeah the song that was picturised on you  bol gori bol
tera kaun piya  that was a very famous song
""
""
 laughs  yes of course 
""
that was uh   milan   picture 
""
i received a filmfare award   from   for  
  milan   best actress award  in those
days 
""
i think  i'm  the first south indian star to receive a
filmfare award  as a best actress in    milan 
 
""
""
now that  you've  become a member of parliament  is
it true that people are now wanting to see more of your old films 
""
""
yes  especially  uh become mp all our  mp's 
collegues are uh  very much interested to see my films  old films
""
they are asking me  uh  jamunajee kahan milte hai apke
 films  apto bahot purani kalakar hai 
""
how can we get your   hamarahi  milan 
  ?
""
i said i will try to  bring some old films for you
""
i will give it  as a presentation to everybody 
""
i was trying to get hold of my old films 
""
 one or two words  you know that old films are very precious
to get
""
""
yeah 
""
we also know that you have been active on theatre  front 
""
uh  you're  also the president of the andhra pradesh
professional theatre group 
""
what are your activities there  ?
""
""
you see as a artist also  i acted more than two hundred
films 
""
we have  acted such a wonderful characters  unforgetable
roles 
""
uh even as a  old lady  uh and then uh  sufferring lady
just like  mother india  
""
i did  mother india  character in telugu version
which nargis did in hindi version 
""
so  it's  a very  beautiful motherly character 
""
so such  a  types of characters i acted 
""
and then  after that  i thought   of   to 
 do some  uh work for uplift of these  old  indigent 
theatre artist 
""
because cinema is uh  fundamentally  we should act in  uh
dramas only
""
from dramas only we have become a very famous actors in films you
see 
""
so one should not forget theatre at all 
""
we came from theatre
""
we hail from theatre 
""
we have learnt acting on theatre 
""
so i want to do service to theatre artist  i become a  uh
president of ap professional artist theatre federation 
""
it is uh  uhm state level body 
""
  i have   we have   got more than ten
thousand members  all over the state andhra pradesh 
""
and the president for that  for the last fifteen years  while
acting also i was so busy as a artist  even then i used to  uh give lot
of service to the  especially this old  indigent  artist giving
pensions  and then getting house  one word  for them 
""
and uh to improve their art to use to give  a lot of
encouragement 
""
still i am continuing as a president of professional artist theatre
federation 
""
""
 i'm  returning to the subject of films 
""
why did you  discontinued uh your    film career 
yeah 
""
""
 film career  
""
""
 laughs 
""
naturally after uh  becoming a  politician  i want to
give full uh  justice to  my  uh profession 
""
i i don't like to put one leg  this side one leg  in film
field and one leg in politician  as a politician 
""
i think we can't  do any justice to  our  performance
""
so i want to give up my film career due to  uh    po
   politics  
""
""
but your family compulsion as well 
""
""
no not much 
""
because my husband is a very co-operative man 
""
and then     sm    smoothly   going
my family life also 
""
i have married  to my   uh my husband is a  professor
of zoology  at osmania university 
""
i got  uh one son and daughter 
""
so life is going smoothly 
""
""
they must also be very fond of your old films i am sure
""
""
 laughs 
""
""
there is one question about film i wanted to ask you 
""
do your fans  feel still as the screen image that they have of
you  ?
""
or do they know that you only act  perform roles  ?
""
how do they react to you when they see you in person  ?
""
""
naturally they are uh  very much excited to see as a person
""
because uh  being a veteran artist for thirty years  uh uhm
for example i can say at my rajmundari constituency i used to go to  to
very rural places 
""
so there  they were  just like uh  they are worshipping as
a  goddess 
""
so after seeing me naturally they  will  get lot of uh
excitement
""
some people especially  uh lady character 
""
i have got  lady fans more than  uh gents i think so 
""
so they used to  embrace me and kiss me
""
they said oh jamunajee  we never thought  we'll  see you
 uh like this 
""
so we are very happy  we'll  vote for you  and then you
must do good work for those  our uh  you should solve our problems
""
i said i had given a promise 
""
so that excitement will be will be there 
""
not on uh
""
""
cinema has been contributing  uh to very large extent 
in the south especially it has been throwing up some very  interesting 
uh politicians 
""
why do you think more and more politicians in the south take to
 uh sorry more and more film personalities in south take to politics  ?
""
""
i think as a  citizen of india  every  citizen has
 a right to become a politician 
""
politician means not only a  uhm getting some money or getting
fame 
""
we can do service to the public 
""
as a democratic country we have got  uh every right to every
man and the woman and every citizen of india they got a right to  enter
into the politics there is no restrictions for that 
""
""
but does their screen image really help them  ?
""
""
sometimes    in this  that is image is there 
that glamour  will add our political 
""
""
 in this  
""
""
does it make your canvassing easier  ?
""
""
not easier 
""
just like other  a few words  canvass because now-a-days
 uh uh political situation and especially  rural masses also  there
public has uh  got uh political awareness 
""
now  they are not uh so easily  there now we can't attract
them with glamour all those things 
""
the glamour will be there  but one should not work  one word
 very hardly then only we will win 
""
otherwise not possible
""
""
in this modern world where we have television we have news
magazines  where they  keep telling us that  an actor  the role
that he performs is just a role  he is in fact  a simple man like us
""
""
there are still these images that people have 
""
how do they maintain  how does a man maintain his image  ?
""
""
the film ?
""
""
yes 
""
""
you see  the film  uh maintaining the image  one
should have certain principles in personal life also 
""
and then he should uh  take good characters  representing
 some social problems economic problems  with a  rural character
representing poor  family's  character 
""
then if uh act uh if he acts like this he can maintain his  uh
good image in film field also long  long standing image  like me  i
had so many variety characters 
""
""
what kind of screen image did you have  ?
""
""
i had uh  very good image otherwise i think i should not
say myself it shows  uh little bit embarassment 
""
even then i have to say  to public that i am i think i am the
first lady to  act in two hundred not two hundred films  as a heroine
 thirty years  as a leading lady  of south indian screen i can say
""
""
so like that  i got that image in public
""
""
how many of your films have won awards  ?
""
""
out of two hundreds may be nearly hundred films  state
awards  and then national awards 
""
while national awards  one word  to come to delhi very
often 
""
and mrs gandhi was there  information and broadcasting minister
  a few words 
""
and then state awards for so many films 
""
""
which is the highest award  that you have got  ?
""
""
i think in hindi film   milan 
 is uh highest filmfare  filmfare award is there for me 
""
and of course in andhra pradesh if we  state awards and best
actress award  in telugu films i am the first lady  continously nine
times i have been elected as a best  actress award  
""
""
""
welcome to the studio and thank you for being with us 
""
first of all when we talk about parallel processing and
super-computers  what are these things  ?
""
""
super-computers really  the  amount of data number it
contains 
""
the good old days about thirty years ago  big two garages will
contain  things  with small capability now it comes  it control
about ten  crore  of operations
""
ten  crores  the hundred mega flops  you see 
in  one second   that's  type of  that is super computing
""
""
why do we need it in india  ?
""
""
we require it for weather modelling  pollution monitering
 variety of things
""
where ever you need  too fast too big  these things if you
want to look at  you have to now crunch the numbers very fast 
""
do it  and then see what it means 
""
it has a lot of uh  uses in these
""
""
 lekin  super computer  ko banane mei
kharcha bahut hota hai rajan saheb 
""
is this expenditure justified  ?
""
""
 jyada nahi haan
""
yeh jo sidhaant mei jo  development  hoti hai uski
 thirty-six  crore ki cheez hai  aur uska jo  usse
 benefit  jo hota hai  ke  agriculture model
 ho   water modelling  ho   seismic
modelling  ho  aur  reactor  ki  safety
 ho   dam  ki  safety  ho 
""
""
so  itne hain ke woh  fed-up  ho jayega 
""
iske upar bahut sare uh   computer software  se
karne hai  woh itne hojayenge ke pura  society  mei hona
chahiye 
""
abhi kuch das saal ke  uh agle  jee saheb ke liye bahut sare
 robot  bhi ho sakte hain jo  translate 
karenge   laughter  hopefully  so knowledge  ko itni
tarakki jo  data process  karne     uhm 
the computer parallel process  ki bauchhar hogi 
""
""
 uhm  
""
""
we we don't want him to be replaced by
""
""
oh no no no not remove him  not him
""
""
 jee saheb  has to 
""
""
 jee saheb to bahut sare ka  use 
karenge     accha   aur thoda haan tum karo abhi
yeh tamil mei baat karo nahi to doosre mei baat karo
""
woh kar sakte hain
""
woh to  future generation
""
""
  accha   
""
""
and you know since we  you know  jee saheb 
and i are a bit ignorant about  technical terms 
""
 yeh  parallel processing would you like to explain
in in simple    uh terms 
""
""
 okay   
""
the computer for past thirty years has been doing  do one uh
competition  put it in a memory  do one competition put it in a memory
""
it does it very fast but  that has a limit 
""
when we are thinking in terms of tons and  crore 
 that is hundred million two hundred million five hundred million type of
operations  per second  then  this slows down the process
""
so  you do it in a different  multiple persons  many
brains using in harmony 
""
so actually some computer people say  tyranny of the central
memory will be gone 
""
many many places  they all do it in parallel 
""
so you can handle large amount of data
""
that is parallel processing 
""
it is essential  to  advance super computer in later stage
""
""
""
mr rajan  you're  closely involved in monitoring the
development of uh this technology in india
""
how far away  is india  from its own super computer  ?
""
""
not very far 
""
these works which are taking place in c dot  c tac  then
there are the number of parallel processing of course in n a l  indian
institute of science  d r d o barc  c m c l they are all doing very
well 
""
i would not like to see in terms of number of years of first and
second two or three 
""
but in terms of one  using the software for various uses
weather forcasting modelling etcetera 
""
as well as for these 
""
they are quite  in contemporary  to the needs of our
country we should be able to meet most of it in the coming years
""
""
how  far developed  how developed  is  india's
 technology in this field compare to other countries ?
""
""
contemporary  i would say not more than  in fact this
technology is itself only four five years or seven eight years old 
""
so we are very close to  those things
""
some of  it's  developments 
""
""
and once  we've  the super computers  how will you
 mr rajan use it  ?
""
""
oh there are number of possibilities say my job is technology
forecasting 
""
there are so many things which can be done whether it is pollution
monitering even heart stimulation 
""
do anything which you want to look at  before designing a car
 before designing an aircraft  you want to see 
""
do the design there  let it crash and see 
""
so you can  one word  build a dam you want to look at
safety  anything can be done in the computer  without spending any
money 
""
then you look at it  then you perfect the design 
""
many of these things  though i myself would not be  uh using
it in that form 
""
there are many hundreds of young men and women in the country 
who will use it  and then they will export even the software 
""
""
mr rajan one last question 
""
gaze into your crystal bowl  after the super computer in india
 what next  ?
""
""
artificial    inte    intelligence 
  fifth generation computer 
""
 that's  what i meant  jee  saheb  he can
have hundreds of them 
""
how many other  that's  right
""
""
 you're  obviously excited about the developments
taking place 
""
""
thank you 
""
""
and we certainly have shared the excitement  jee saheb
jinhone bataya  super computer  ke bare mein 
""
""
 haan deepakji bas mei itna chahata hoon ke 
science technology super computer  ka labh  hum tak  hum aam
logon tak  chhoti tabiyat ke logon tak  jald se jald pahoonch jaye
""
""
""
 yehi rajan saheb aap ko bata rahe the 
""
our guest this morning was mr y s rajan  adviser in department
of science and technology 
""
 we've  been talking to him about the exciting break
through in the field of parallel processing and super computer development in
india
