""
""
well dr nihalani we got a number of  uh articles  uh
 made of wood  just half an hour back what do you think about these
 ?
""
 ashok  is it  ?
""
""
i think they are quite good 
""
good and cheap 
""
""
uh  i think  one of the reasons why we liked them was
that  uh they were brought to  one word   and the other thing
was that they were very nice  and  uh we could  use them as a
presents to our  relatives and friends 
""
don't you think so  ?
""
""
yes  a very reasonably priced 
""
and uh  items were all very  compact 
""
""
oh yes 
""
""
 that's  what    uh  i i like them
immensely 
""
""
 uh  
""
""
what do you think about our visit to dhanyalok  the other
day that is last sunday  ?
""
""
it was quite uplifting  i should say  uh to be there
 uh it was a  lovely evening  we spent with dr c d n   
yes 
""
uh the warm hospitality    yeah 
""
and uh  that pleasant environment    yeah  uh 
was real good  that i should say 
""
""
 yes  
""
""
 yeah  
""
""
 yeah  
""
""
wasn't it a very memorable and treasurable experience ?
""
""
yes of course
""
""
yes 
""
""
uh especially when you are from  we were made to sit uh
 in the    in  vichar   yeah in the in the
 sanjay  vichara mantapum  when then  we had 
tea in the  garden  and then  dr c d n  uh talked to us about
several things    yeah  including poetry thesis poetry  
 yeah 
""
and uh  well his  first encounter with t s eliot  
 yeah 
""
now  well  this was really absorbing  very interesting
 uhm
""
""
 in  vichar   
""
""
 yeah  
""
""
 yeah  
""
""
 yeah  
""
""
well everytime we even see c d n  everytime we talk to him
   yeah  we find that well  we are energised and  we feel
inspired and  at same time we feel that we have to do quite a lot 
""
""
 yeah  
""
""
as compared to  what he does 
""
then he also uhm  you know gave us a copy of brindavanam 
  yeah  the new periodical started and then the recent issue of
 literary criterion  
""
uh number one is  tour of nineteen ninety-three 
   uhm  which uh has a  i mean which has special number on
 the drama in post graduate they conducted  uh sometime back 
""
""
 yeah  
""
""
 uhm  
""
""
and he was quite encouraging you know to  one word  
uh and at work    yes  uh  dhanyalok  to be just one man
show 
""
""
 yes  
""
""
yes
""
""
he said  he's  seventy-three now
""
""
oh yes
""
""
doing  an extremely useful work 
""
""
certainly  he
""
""
in the field of english studies and  indigenous arts
""
""
yes 
""
""
and i felt terribly inspired    yes  and uh 
that even at that age after retirement    yes  one can do lots
of good things
""
""
 yes  
""
""
 yes  
""
""
yes 
""
""
so to me it was extremely uplifting and educative   
yes  i must say 
""
""
 yes  
""
""
uh another thing
""
""
yeah, so please continue 
""
""
 a  another thing is that he  uh he  enc 
 uh encourages the scholars to come out there and  uh read  uh on
their own 
""
maybe  uh  concerning with their research topics   or
 maybe  the literature of their interest    yeah  because
he has a  number of books on commonwealth literature 
""
""
 yeah  
""
""
 yeah  
""
""
certainly   he has a 
""
""
 and a   
""
""
he has a very good library in fact
""
and at the same time  i suppose  uh there is a good place to
sit also
""
""
yes
""
""
especially in the library hall
""
""
library hall the sitting arrangement
""
""
the round table
""
""
the sitting arrangement   is quite good 
""
""
 quite good  
""
""
and then there are number of photographs also you must have
seen 
""
and he has the photograph of his teacher  uh dr f r levis
""
""
yes  yes 
""
hey you know these scholars are very well looked after
""
""
yes
""
""
uhm  as members of  uh his family
""
""
yes
""
""
i have  uh an occasion dr  inamdar's  in aurangabad
   oh yes  his wife 
""
he was  uh there for about a week
""
uh wanted to consult  books on commonwealth literature
""
""
 oh yes  
""
""
right yes
""
""
uh  they were all admiration for the  man and for his
family
""
""
certainly yes
""
""
you see and besides  uh the the guidence that he got 
here in the subject
""
uhm  i very much remember you know the warm hospitality and
affection that they
""
""
oh yes   oh yes we remember  uhm yeah
""
""
  one or two words   
""
""
everyone who stays with them has very fond memories of their
stay and uh  there you know  happy moments of talk and discussions
""
""
 that's  true 
""
""
i think there is also his assistant by his uh  son and his
sister-in-law
""
""
yeah one of his
""
""
and few others
""
""
daughters-in-law
""
""
yeah daughter-in-law sorry
""
""
and uh  some of his uh grand children
""
""
yeah some of the grand children also  yes
""
""
so  uhm
""
yes it it was memorable uhn experience through
""
""
uh so  one really feels like visiting mysore   
uhm  especially for this purpose of uh visiting brindavan and uh 
""
""
 uhm  
""
""
another advantage is  it's  quite close to  manas
gangotri  one word 
""
""
uhm the university campus
""
""
university campus of mysore 
""
so   it's  really situated at an ideal place
""
""
so that was one of my
""
""
it is uh far away from the noise and bustle and  one word
 tumble of the town 
""
and uh
""
""
well  it's  an ideal place for meditation and study
room
""
""
i very much wanted to visit the place
""
and  i'm  glad   i've  been able to
""
""
yeah 
""
""
uhm also that  one word   central institute of
indian languages 
""
""
yes
""
""
uhm i enjoyed my visit to that place too
""
""
yes
""
""
ah that way    yeah  some usual work
""
""
 yeah  
""
""
certainly 
""
another thing is that we were very fortunate in having  uh two
visits to brindavan
""
""
yeah especially when i  uh well i had stayed over here for
a month
""
""
yeah and uh i think we could consider ourselves fortunate in
having these two visits
""
so that we  have uh  have very close that  a few words
 and especially he gave us lot of information about that
""
""
yeah
""
""
uhm he gave us that  one word  also    yeah
  two words  and  he mentioned uh  i think you saw him 
didn't you ?
""
""
 yeah  
""
""
well yes  i was chanced to walk there  p g teacher on
the evening alone 
""
that was quite sometime ago
""
""
yeah a couple of years ago i suppose 
""
""
yeah  so  quite well done  that was also 
collected
""
""
yeah
""
""
we mentioned of that and uh 
""
""
yeah 
""
when you mentioned it to dr cyrian he was also there i think
""
""
yeah 
""
""
and uh yeah this is one of the institute in india  uh run
by one person    yes  and not an official institute
""
""
 yes  
""
""
no  but uh really a an ideal istitute  which caters to
needs of very  serene  uh devoted scholars  of english
""
""
shall we say something like  mini  shantiniketan
""
""
""
yeah mini  shantiniketan  but  you know
dr cyrian does not want to be name  shantiniketan  to be
given
""
""
uhn
""
""
because he says that uh  the the terms that that there are
no   one word  university and the campus of  shantiniketan
  as far as the  one word 
""
""
ah ha
""
""
so  that's  the reason why he  perhaps doesn't
like the name of  shantiniketan  to be given 
""
but  that's   that's  another matter
""
""
no no see
""
""
anyway we we we always like to associate  you know our own
perception of  shantiniketan  our own  uh you know
memory of  shantiniketan   with what we saw at uh 
 one word 
""
""
true the campus is simply   beautiful 
""
""
 beautiful  
""
""
true 
""
""
uh we had trip to ooty some  shall we say  about ten
days ten fifteen days back
""
""
almost fifteen days back
""
""
fifteen days back
""
now  uhm there is a certain problems for arranging this but
after having arranged it  and after having visited ooty what do you think
about your our visit ?
""
was it uh hurrying trip to ooty or  do you think that well it
was very  succesful trip to ooty ?
""
""
oh i think it went off very well 
""
uh the weather was    fine  extremely good that day
""
""
 fine  
""
""
and it was cloudy but it didn't rain
""
""
yeah
""
""
and it uh  i think we  very much enjoyed the scenery
""
""
yeah 
""
there was sunshine for sometime at  one word 
""
""
ah and uh  uh we were able to go round and see the
important stops
""
""
uh yes
""
""
and important spots
""
""
yes 
""
""
incidently you know later on from the photograph i discovered
that we have missed out on  two very important point
""
""
oh really  oh oh    yeah  what are they  ?
""
""
 yeah  
""
""
you see we  they didn't take us around the childrens park
""
""
""
oh i see
""
""
it seems ooty has uh    many nice  childrens
park you know so 
""
""
  one or two words   
""
""
and the other one
""
""
we missed out on that 
""
and there is uh  one telescope house  it seems
""
""
oh i see 
""
""
so we weren't taken to that spot
""
""
yeah i think 
""
""
these two spots were missed out
""
""
missed out on those two 
""
but don't you think that we visited a very wonderful and very
important  one word   the botanical garden
""
""
that was wonderful 
""
""
that was really    marvellous  marvellous 
""
""
 marvellous  
""
""
breath takingly beautiful i should say 
""
""
and uh  i mean we didn't feel like coming out of it even
we spent  an hour an quarter perhaps
""
""
oh yes 
""
""
that was  beautiful garden uh
""
""
that lake also that    lake  ooty lake 
""
""
 lake  
""
""
ooty lake also 
""
""
but this was much better
""
""
yeah yeah 
""
""
but  i didn't like the lake as much i like uhm 
botanical garden  especially the way it was maintained   along 
and uh
""
""
 yeah  
""
""
in fact uh 
""
""
yes  the bowers and uh  that it did better than uh
""
""
""
sky growing trees 
""
""
better than the brindavan   garden i should say 
""
""
 yeah yeah   and uh brindavan garden
""
""
and nurseries
""
""
yes hardly thing anything in brindavan garden that brings to
my mind 
""
""
yeah  that's  right 
""
""
uh except for those you know side  one word 
""
 it's  all giddish  talking of life and you know that
 mu  musical fountain 
""
""
yeah 
""
""
but for that  there is hardly anything in the   
brindavan  garden you know  and you know sprawling that way
""
""
 brindavan  
""
""
yeah
""
""
but you know the variety of   variety of flowers 
""
""
 brindavan garden   doesn't offer you much 
""
""
no  but this botanic garden at  at ooty  is simply
marvellous
""
""
marvellous 
""
""
regarding variety of colours  of    and and 
kind of flowers kind of trees
""
""
 and and  
""
""
 i'm  glad we were able to make it that day
""
""
yeah yeah  and fortunately the weather co-operated with us
""
""
""
yeah 
""
that wasn't it wasn't much crowded either 
""
""
because otherwise we wouldn't have been able to enjoy it 
  ah ha  much
""
""
 ah ha  
""
""
it all went up very well 
""
and uh later on we came to know that the  chief minister of
tamil nadu  uh visited uh  at same day    i see  and
perhaps the things were  well say in order then 
""
uh these streets were clean and uh  there were boards and
banners  welcoming the chief minister of tamil nadu
""
""
 i see  
""
""
i see
""
""
dr  jaylalitha uh 
""
""
yes
""
""
and perhaps  it was an advantage because uh  i don't
know whether we were  prevented from entering    one word 
area 
""
""
  one word   
""
i think good shape 
""
""
yes they think they will have a good shape 
""
""
 one or two words 
""
""
yeah 
""
""
no but you know uh  normally i think    yeah 
they must be maintaining it very well
""
""
 yeah  
""
""
 that's  right
""
""
i think   that's  it uh 
""
""
either way we had we had a very nice time   there 
in the park
""
""
 indeed  
""
""
indeed 
""
""
yeah indeed 
""
and uh  we also return in time  big thing
""
""
yeah 
""
""
uh well we  left this place around seven    yeah
 and we were back home by  seven
""
""
 yeah  
""
""
yeah and 
""
""
you remember that uh it started raining when we were nearly
 outskirt of mysore 
""
""
mysore yes 
""
""
yes  and uh well  uh we really succeeded in 
organising and enjoying    our our  sunday in ooty dated to
""
""
 ah that ooty  
""
""
dated to the 
""
""
yes  of course
