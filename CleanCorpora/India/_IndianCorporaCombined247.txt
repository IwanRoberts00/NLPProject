just wait uh  ah ha make this your honour uhm  your honour in this case the accused has been charged under section three hundred and two of the indian penal code  in this case clears throat the case is principally of  this is a case of what is called circumstantial evidence  this is a case of circumstantial evidence  in all matters the relevant definition is the definition of the word prove  the definition is the definition of the word prove and that definition is always relevant and i'm reading that definition  a fact is said to be proved when after considering the matters before it the court either believes it to exist or considers its existence so probable that a prudent man ought under the circumstances of the particular case to act upon the supposition that it exist  in other words the definition of the word prove in section three of the evidence act is a standard which is officially laid down for the purposes of highly given proof  this was later adopted in one case to which i will not come in this case i will come in a later case  your honour actually whether a given case is proved or not  has got to be admeasured with reference to this particular definition  in general sense this  in general sense  this particular definition section three  now section three relates to three types of evidence actually the evidence can be direct the evidence can be circumstantial  and the evidence can be partly circumstantial and partly direct  but the standard with reference to which the proof of a case has got to be assessed is in section three  the standard with reference to which the proof of a given case has got to be assessed is section three  on section three as i said there are three types of evidence  direct circumstantial partly direct and partly circumstantial now as regards circumstantial evidence the supreme court has  laid down certain guidelines  those guidelines are in the region of appreciation and not law  that must be understood  those guidelines are in the region of appreciation and not law  they're to be respected but they are not binding in the sense in which the interpretation of law is binding  they are to be respected  the reason is this what is the citation no i'm i'm coming to that citation is different  yes ci you know that that is year nineteen sixty supreme court page one nine zero  i will give your honour later on  page  one nine zero  my god this offence one nine zero yes  your honour one nine five  decisions even of the highest court on questions which are essential questions of facts cannot be called as precedents governing the decisions of other cases which must rest in the ultimate analysis upon their own particular facts  the general principles governing the appreciation of circumstantial evidence are well established and the and the broad  and beyond doubt or controversial  the more difficult question is one of applying this principles to the bare fact and circumstances of a particular case  your honour the point which we are trying to make out is this  those general principles are known  what is necessary is actually both application of this particular principles and taking the spirit of that particular principles and not the literal words   i'll come to that and explain  from the first ever case after the birth of supreme court in nineteen fifty-two was what is called the hanumanta's case  in year nineteen fifty-two supreme court page three forty-three now here he is going to use it against me and i know it  no no it's alright  continue it  supreme court  on page ? three four three  that was the first ever supreme court case which laid down the general guiding principles as regards circumstantial evidence  and what the supreme court in that particular case said was this   the main three principles which were laid down there in that particular case were that the facts must be first established  they must have what is called the conclusive tendency and they must be incompatable with any other hypothesis except  that of guilt  these are the three basic principles which were laid down in  hanumanta's case  and in the light of the principles which were laid down in  sup by the supreme court in that particular case clears throat we shall try to assess whether in this case the facts  cumulatively drive this particular court to the conclusion that the accused and the accused alone has committed that crime  your honour has followed  now let us go through the first case  so i will just  yes  your honour the first point is this p w six and p w seven were the office bearers of pushpavila's  co-operative housing society  yes  i have established  ah  have established that on the twenty-seventh of july nineteen ninety-one the accused was functioning as a watchman of that particular building  one  that is the first point  yes and being a watchman and being on duty from nine am  on that onwards he was expected to be on duty throughout the day  expected to be duty on  throughout the day  yes  number two  yes  being a watchman he had an easy access to all the tenements  of that building  now this is very important  yes  this is important for this reason that no lady who is all by herself in a flat will open the flat to an outsider  no lady who is all alone in the flat will open the flat to an outsider but will readily open it to a watchman  whose duty it is to protect them  yes third  since he was expected to be on duty throughout the day  he was expected to be available for help after murder not yet  after  supposing he has not committed murder someone else has committed murder and he is on duty  so he was not here it is he who is supposed to help that is what i am trying to say  being on duty he was expected to help  yes  being a watchman  yes  he was not only not available but was missing  and had to be traced through efforts  your next point  he was not only not available but was missing and had to be traced through efforts  yes  according to p w seven who is the chairman of the society  according to p w seven who is the chairman of the society  yes  this is at page twenty-three  yes he was wearing that check shirt which is article seven on that day   a few words  when he was on duty  both p w six and p w seven  this is article  seven  article seven  your honour this is very important i will give the list afterward  article seven was stained with group blood  a group a according to the c a report  what is uh the group of uh deceased ?  a your honour blood group of deceased was a because according to exhibit twenty-nine  yes twenty-nine is a exhibit according to exhibit twenty-nine  c a report c a report  the saree the petticoat the blouse the brassiere the curtain and the piece of curtain there are as many as  one two three four five six items which had a  group  your honour may take it down the saree  article three  blouse  the no no we'll go in order uh your honour   saree article three  petticoat article four  petticoat  blouse article five brassiere article six  yes and curtain article two all these items bore  a group and therefore i say that the blood group of the deceased was a although when the blood  was taken and sent to the chemical analyser independently he could not say  saree was wet no no no the blood of the deceased was taken by the doctor he could not conclusively say what group it belonged to because perhaps it had disintegrated  it happens sometimes that a given portion is disintegrated  but i say blood was taken yes also taken  but he could not express an opinion as regards the blood group  but i say that the deceased had a group by virtue of the fact that all these items had a group has your honour followed this  this is at twenty-nine exhibit twenty-nine will show this have you examine the group blood of the accused yes that is also a  that is  a  that is also a  that is exactly i will let let me complete the argument  one minute  your honour the point is although the blood group of the deceased according to exhibit thirty-one thirty-one is  a  deceased  no no accused accused his blood group the blood group of the accused is a  the blood group of the deceased also is a  according to this according to this you mean the mark  this is therefore of  yes that is the blood of the accused that is  a  i have taken care to ask the police officer at page thirty-eight para three i have taken the special care and  i'll read that  earlier on twenty-nine seven ninety-one we had sent the accused to the hospital for obtaining blood  when the accused was first arrested there were no injuries on the person of the accused   that's the point that is why this answer was taken  your honour i'm very vigilant about my duties according to  i'm very vigilant about my duties have you established no no your honour we'll go to him later on i mean  two words  otherwise my link will be broken  two words  no no   two words  your honour i'm not anxious to prove his blood lying on the saree i'm anxious to prove his blood lying on his own shirt that is what i'm trying to say  he could have well pleaded that he was injured and therfore he could have well explained but both on no no that is the main thing that is my argument that is not whole circumstances uh no no no your honour allow me to complete otherwise the whole thing will be  yes your honour article seven had blood group a  since he was not injured and since he was wearing that shirt the blood of the deceased has spurted on him that is what  i'm trying to say  the blood of the deceased had spurted on him the blood of the deceased has spurted on him on two items  according to the exhibit twenty-nine let me just add and it was here at page thirty-eight when he started the cross examination  my learned friend should have asked the police officer  yes  and cross examined this police officer on the point of there being an injury  he should have asked the police officer  and he should have put the case to the police officer that the accused was also injured  that is the main point in this case  and he did not do that  now the point which i am trying to make out there are two items on which the blood group is a article seven is one  and article  two two seven but it have no no  on article seven is a shirt shirt shirt no no we'll forget your honour the deceased the blood on the deceased we'll forget because since she is stabbed it is going to be full of blood  we are trying to book him and therefore the blood on him is relevant blood on the saree is not relevant at all it is bound to be stained with blood  total there are fifteen injuries on the lady so that is that presents more difficulty  the blood on the saree the blouse the petticoat and it is bound to be there  what about him  may i no no please please he says he has have had no no no you don't help anybody when i'm  i'm addressing i don't do you help yourself i can take care of myself  your honour there are two items let it be very clear  there were two items on which the blood group on his person was   a one is this shirt which he was wearing on the twenty-seventh when he was on duty at that building and when from which he ran away that is one  and the second is the shirt which he wore when he was arrested at bombay central police station and came back and which was taken on the mo taken charge of on the morning of twenty-eighth  which is article thirty-three
