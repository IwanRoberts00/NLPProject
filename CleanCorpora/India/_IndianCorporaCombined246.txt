forwarding letter exhibit twenty-five collect recording broken  two signatures of uh p s i poi interruption  yes next para mr uh nanya appearing for the accused  has canvassed before this court that uh disposed that uh the accused is charged for the offence under section three nought two i p c  fullstop  he has canvassed three points before this full uh  before this court for uh consideration  they are as follows  point number one is whether this is a homicidal death second  whether that uh homicidal death was uh caused by the stabbing  the deceased by the accused and third if if it is so  what is the offence  full stop  next para  the learned special p p has uh canvassed before this court  prosecution has laid evidence of p w number one to seven and the documentary evidence to that effect in order to prove the point number one the learned uh special p p has invited the attention of this court to the evidence of doctor jaswant  tampure and p m notes ex at exhibit fifteen  according to the learned special p p the death was caused by uh haemorrhage and shock  therefore it was unnatural  he has also invited the attention of this court to the  postmortem notes and the opinion of the opinion express by doctor jaswant uh tanpure  he has also canvassed before this court that one injury over the uh  person of the deceased which which can also be prove fatal  according to doctor tanpure  in the instance case the injury sustained by the deceased  was perforated uh was uh eh has perforated the wall of the  abdomen  that is the reason why there was uh haematoma on both the kidneys because of the impact and force used in assaulting the deceased by the knife by the accused  full stop  the injury was uh caused by a rampuri  knife full stop  rampuri knife is not used for uh suicide by a person  a person committing suicide can commit suicide in the  house or uh at uh secluded place but not on the road  at uh ten pm  therefore suicide eh uh suicide in this case if  canvassed by the defence is ruled out in all possibilities and probabilities looking to the uh nature of the injuries nature of the injury sustained by the accused  full stop  even on fall uh falling on the ss some sharp cut shovel uh object is also ruled out to cause uh accidental death therefore all the probabilities and possibilities regarding of  injury by accidental and uh uh by accidental death is also ruled out  he has also canvass before this court that the defence  has not uh suggested to any of the prosecution witnesses in that respect that the deceased fell uh deceased met with an accident  in fact the learned sp special  p p has canvassed before this court that the defence of the accused is shifting the liability of this injury and the death of the deceased to p w number one two and three  therefore the learned special p p has canvassed before this court that there is there uh there is and in all probabilities the deceased met with the homicidal death  next para  he has further canvased in order to elaborate and uh  placed his reliance on uh second point is that that it is not the accused but it is p w number one two and three jointly killed  the deceased  full stop  in this respect the evidence of p w number one two and three is on the record  they support each other  they say that the deceased and the accused are known to p w number one two and three as there are uh from the same locality  therefore there cannot be mistaken identity  provocation in fact was given by the accused to the deceased by saying caw caw  full stop  also in this case cannot be make available to the accused  because he gave provocation to the deceased  it was not a sudden sudden quarrel  two parties at the outset were also separated by p w number one uh p w number one alone and uh and the same have cooled down as the accused thereafter went to his house and brought uh uh  rampuri knife article one from his house  he has also canvassed before this court that the offence  in this case was premeditated for the reason that the accused brought a knife caught hold o caught hold uh caught hold of the deceased by his uh one hand and pressed the neck of the accused and stabbed the deceased in his abdomen  he has also canvassed before before this court that there is no time to connect the uh sto uh to concoct the story  because p w numbers uh two and three came on the scene of offence after hearing the shouts after hearing the shouts caught hold uh  the hand of the accused in which knife was there and ask p w number three to call police  sufficient light was there at the scene of offence of the electric lampost of the municipal corporation uh on the road and from the shops in the surr uh in the surrounding vicinity full stop  there is no animosity between the accused uh and p w numbers one two three  there is no substitution of knife  p w number uh four in this case is examined for uh taking charge of knife and p w number uh five for taking charge of article numbers article numbers one and uh two shirt and lungi   the lear next para the learned special p p has also canvassed before this court that the the blood group of the deceased could not be proved as uh c a could not uh give the conclusive uh conclusive evidence  and uh the same the blood uh the blood file which was sent to the chemical analyser of which the result shows inconclusive  the blood group of the accused appears to be of o group  it also appears on articles one two and three cough  the same blood of group o was also found on the above said uh  articles  the blood found on articles one two and three and article five  is also uh is also the same  if the blood of uh the blood group of o was also found article five  then it fixes the liability of the accused that the accused had  accused and the accused has only committed the offence in the instance case  therefore the learned uh special p p has canvassed before this court that the intention of the accused was uh to assualt the deceased  hence the learned speical p p states that he was uh he has proved the case against the accused and he may be convicted  the learned defence counsel shri  chari appearing uh for the accused has canvassed before this court that that the blood group of accused is admittedly of o group she has uh c a has also opined that exhibit numbers one two three and five were having blood uh of blood group o  in this case the uh uh accused assaulted the deceased  with article uh three knife  the knife article three is having blood group of o  uh o category that is of the accused  the learned uh defence counsel then raised a query before this court and then uh and has canvassed before this court that in that case how is that that the blood of o group can be detected on article uh three  because according to p w number uh p w number one two and three accused assaulted the deceased by article three and that the knife had uh uh on its blade  full stop admittedly that blood on the knife can also of the deceased of o group  full stop it is possible that the deceased can have also the blood group  o  but iron of the blood sent to the c a for blood grouping of the deceased was analysed and the c a in his uh in this respect  uh in his report exhibit sixteen opined that the blood group of  uh exhibit uh one cannot be determined as the result results are inconclusive  he therefore uh doesn't say that the deceased was also having o group  but he says that the blood group of exhibit one cannot be determined as the results are inconclusive  next para then uh next question arises for the consideration  according to the learned defence counsel is that as to how the blood of the accused appeared on article three and five who was not assaulted by the deceased  no witness is saying that the deceased had uh also uh  also assaulted the accused  full stop  according to mr more therefore states that the accused is falsely implicated in this case and that he may be  acquitted  i have considered the arguments canvassed from both the sides  while considering the points raised by the learned by the learned uh special p p that whether this is a homicide death  full stop  looking to the evidence of p w number uh p w number six  dr jaswant tanpure and p m notes exhibit fifteen and the evidence of p w numbers one two and three is prima facie appears to be a homicidal death  it can be seen that from the p m notes exhibit uh exhibit fifteen it appears that there is only one wound one injury  on the person of the deceased that is incised wound over  right apochondrial region
