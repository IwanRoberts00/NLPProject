how was the day today ? for me not very well it's been like usual  what happened ? today also i faced the same problem with tenth standard  what was the problem ? these children though they are in tenth standard they are not very serious about their studies  they keep on talking mostly the back benchers  and there are some students who come from the aff  influential families yeah they also trouble the others   yeah  yeah  yeah  actually because we can't say anything we can't do to this people these children because they have their business and all that they are not more interested in studies and all that  yeah  they might be thinking that we carry the same business  keep on troubling yeah  yeah  so no need for study actually i've heard one of the boy no  actually he said that sir i have my father's  business i just come here see to pass my time   see  yes one word  so he is troubling the others  yeah their parents should be called but  that's why the others  the parent should be called and actually now we are going to call the parents you know after the first unit test result uhm so we'll call them  we'll talk with them   uhm  their parents come and sign the results no  ah actually the parents no we have not still given but the students for they have been troubling not only me other teachers also lot of time so from them we had taken in written writing  that they will never do such a thing and twice or thrice they did the same thing  but still we find their behaviour the same way no change  they themselves have given in written writing   when we reported to sir and madam  they said that okay we are giving in writing that we'll  not trouble any teacher we'll be serious about our studies   but the same thing we find still they are troubling  or they would be given by   even i face the same problem  when i punish the student their parents come and ask me why you punished the student  they don't want punishment to be given to their children and they don't  they'll take the side of their children   and they want uh only benefit means like making them uh improvements in their writings and yeah actually when the child is doing something wrong  then also you should not punish and uh  yeah they should study  yeah even if they get zero we have to grant them anyhow  marks yeah actually no they they won't study  because of the parents attitude no we find even the  childrens children behave the same way the students when we try to yeah they take it lightly say something yeah it is   it is of their benefit they don't listen  yeah benefit they don't understand the meaning of benefit i think   yeah  yeah actually now a days keep on just uh doing that whatever they want in their  yeah actually now a days we find mostly earlier the parents were not like this  yeah first they used to ask   they used to say beat us  yeah  but make the student even i find so many sa  but now a days the parents have just become the opposite yeah  now they say don't beat the children even if they are doing something wrong don't do anything  even now the now a days parents emphasise no  that my child is sick everytime yeah and he doesn't eat properly he keeps on playing if uh they will say this all   but they won't say that ki ma make him uh beat him or make him do whatever you want never  but they they have to pass   yeah   yeah  yeah actually now a days especially we find earlier it was different during our time our parents they used to come and tell the teacher yeah we know how we have studied yeah yeah but now today you find the situation totally different the parents they encourage the children  yeah  encourage means they won't be uh looking at what they are doing but if they have been  not to be beaten  in these things only they are encouraging  if this happens no  teacher beats the child yeah they will come to fight  they will come till to the principal  then they have to  yeah  yeah see we teacher have to and every time they've to scold us  and that's the thing that is the problem with me also  even i face the same problem but i try to tackle it you know with uh i've got some problems whenever i have  actually not in this earlier school no i had problems like this most of the students no they are just like hooligans and all that yeah  become since i've dealt successfully with some of the children see if we love them if we pamper a little   you had to do that na that is yeah no if we pamper them little yeah  but sometimes no we have to go out of our way  yeah for these childrens especially though others they will think that the teacher is going out of the way means we have to give them many means whatever at first they have not done home work   yeah   some punishment is required  no actually at first no for these children no we should not give punishment  we should pamper them a lot  then try to make them understand  yeah because they understand  ah now now once they come closer to us no then only we understand now in the tenth standard they are grown up they understand the meaning of punishment yes they feel some shameful about that punishment  no actually i'll tell you  yeah they are not ashamed i'll tell you because once  when we took from them in writing the next time they did the same thing so when madam came to the class she punished the whole class  and then means to make them that whatever they are doing they were standing on the bench to make ashamed we send eighth standard students just go and have a look at them and you know what was the remark of tenth standard what's  to us let them come and see  means that was their reaction  so they were not bothered   two words  yeah that was their reaction when this eighth standard students they came in class there no reaction they didn't felt ashamed nothing like that  in even my class  though they are small they are very clever  clever in the sense uh not in studies at all but uh they are doing co-curricular activities and all that  one word  yeah beating and everything and using and abuses that don't know what they are saying sometimes actually what's the thing you know the parents they don't respect the teacher so the students also don't respect  yeah in our cla  class i can make out what the parent might be speaking   because at time you see even the parents when they speak about the teacher in derogative manners yeah yeah  so the children learns the same thing same thing and so we have to just shut them and nothing  that's the state  yeah now a days the situation has just become so different that uh we have to bear even whatever they say i never beat a student never in my whole life  i've never beat a single student but now when i came to  third standard i can see that uh they are something different because they are never means uh guided in a way to how to behave or how to talk with a teacher atleast  whenever we are uh saying something they without thinking they say out the words now  even i never beat  without thinking what are the words  yeah  yeah and whatever i've written on the board they take out the meanings of that but don't understand what is the question what is the answer for that never  but take out other meanings from that means how clever they are mean uh means unwanted things they are clever  other one word   yes  yeah actually that's the thing suppose  they'll always see what's the mistake teacher is doing yeah  they pronounce one word   not even that if that were always they will be uh what's the teacher  one word  i will uh give marks for the student if he takes out my mistake but they don't even take that much of pains to one word   that is they try no always they try suppose the teacher is writing the chalk is not proper  it's not writing  laughs  yeah yeah it's making sound and all they  it's a funny idea  yeah they will start laughing and all that yeah even we feel one word they will keep on saying they are very particular about these things laughs  when you ask them question the whole class never even i can make out only few students   yeah those coming in five firstly i think those only will give the answers everytime ahn yeah and even during inspection and all they only are very active and particular their parents do come and meet me but yeah  uh about others maximum i can find that i can give the examples  these students never never bothered  yeah   yeah   yeah   yeah  yeah actually even i two words  but their parents whenever i beat them the parents came and ask me purposely why  and the same parents said unnecessarily you beat my child  even for me the other teachers first only they warned me yeah that don't beat these these these child  because as i'm new no they told me  because if you will beat even if they have done something  wrong   yeah   but we feel about them no something no action will be taken against that you will be the  person to be blamed  so the parents will come and they will blame you only   blames means uh we have to take the blame  sometimes we have to take the blame on that  i feel about that only not sometime most of the time we have to take   most of the time means yes that is true  but uh sometime for these students also we feel yeah  even madam has told me that some students are such you don't beat them  yeah  yeah but i feel somewhere if these are to be guided just now  this is the way see i had a show-down with yeah one of the boy no tenth standard i had a show-down  yeah  now tenth is a and then i told them okay because  he argued with me like anything as i was means equal to him  one word   one word  ah that way he argued with me so i said i will not enter the class till he says sorry to me i came back i didn't went to that class for two three days  then madam interfered that boy was called and he said sorry even when he said sorry he was crying then i told him i made him understand see i'm not happy making you say sorry to me  that's not the thing but you should means respect me as a teacher  i'm elder to you i'm not equal to you you can't talk me just like you talk to your friends or your younger ones you can't talk to a teacher like that way so i made him understand nahi  that but now a days i find him but it has one word   nahi  don't speak that way but atleast he should be clever   no actually what the thing you know  somewhere you know what the student they tell no at home they don't treat us like this  if we shout at him no means this very particular boy when i shouted at him no to other teacher he said at home nobody shouts at me  so what that means we have to behave just the way their parents behave at home yeah parents behave and uh parents should come to know  they expect the same behaviour  but how can we behave that way you would have called the parents you would have called the parents  no actually he himself said sorry   one word actually i find yes  because this is not proper   but we should actually  now a days i find him little bit one word he scores he pays attention  yours is tenth so it is nice but uh we said that   so it is yeah we can't help out means whatever the way their behaviour   yeah we have to deal with you have to make make them understand and one word  but in our class what happens being a third standard we  one word should guide   yeah   no actually no there has to be a communication with the students and the teacher i i find that i have a gap with my students  yeah because i cannot have a proper communication with them that is true   that's why no we can't understand neither they understand me and i also can't understand them that happens with every teacher and yeah   yeah that's the thing and if once we have this no full communication with one other two way communication  then only we can say that
