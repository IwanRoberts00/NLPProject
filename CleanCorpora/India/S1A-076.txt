""
""
so  it's  a kind of marathi  influence on me
""
""
so you had  uh how did you begin your  education where
""
""
""
oh mine i told you  my village is very small and we had
education only upto fourth standard 
""
so then after fourth standard when i was nine years so  i had to
go to a nearby town taluka place
""
""
uhm uhm 
""
""
so  three miles  that is about five kilometres everyday
we used to walk in the morning and return back in the evening like  
that  
""
and sometimes  so we were nearly twenty  persons uh uh 
fifth standard sixth standard seventh standard eighth standard like that 
""
so all of us together  we we were going to  take a room 
  uhm  and uh on rental basis  stay there
""
and turn wise  everday some persons were coming back to village
and collecting our tiffin and bringing there 
""
so that kind of living
""
""
 uhm  
""
""
 uhm  
""
""
so it was of course  sort of cooperative
""
""
oh yeah yeah  laughter 
""
""
living together 
""
""
no it is very funny  so   it enlightened  my life
 in the primary and uh high school 
""
so uh  i i cannot forget it
""
so 
""
""
 and after that  
""
""
after finishing your secondary education 
""
""
uhm uh after secondary education  the college was uh
available only  in bagalkot
""
""
uhm
""
""
so that was about thirty miles away from my place
""
""
uhm
""
""
so  naturally i had to go to bagalkot 
""
and another place was dharwar 
""
so dharwar was bit away  so i   had to go to  i did my
this uh
""
""
 so you did it in bagalkot  
""
""
and where did you stay in bagalkot
""
""
bagalkot uh  in the beginning  uh you know  i i had
felt home sickness
""
""
uhm 
""
""
so only because of for the first time i left my family  and
all that 
""
so in fact  i didn't want to continue my college and i wanted to
go back 
""
and i went back to my village 
""
and then my father was so much interested in education  though
he was uneducated 
""
and he wanted me to educate 
""
and uhm  i was okay and i was considered to be somewhat
intelligent and as well as  and uh  so my mother actually came with me
 and for one year she stayed with me
""
""
she stayed with you yeah
""
""
and  that's  how  then uh  so after one year
passed you know afterwards i    became  acquainted with with the
""
""
 became  
""
""
got   accustomed  to living in bagalkot
""
""
 accustomed  
""
""
then then i started staying in some  hostel and some 
pri  private apartments like that 
""
""
okay 
""
and how many brothers and sisters you have
""
""
uh i have that uh  two brothers 
""
so including me we are three 
""
and uh two sisters 
""
so   i'm  the   youngest  i am the youngest one
""
""
 youngest  
""
""
uhm
""
""
and uh my eldest brother is  uh taking care of this uh uh
uh 
""
""
agriculture 
""
""
yeah 
""
and basically we are agriculturists 
""
and my middle brother he was a school master 
""
and very recently he retired as a head master of a  primary
school
""
""
uhm 
""
""
and my two sisters they are married to some uh  village
people and they are alright after all 
""
""
did you do your m sc also from bagalkot
""
""
no there  m sc cannot uh  we in karnataka you know 
the p g is only at the university centre
""
""
uhm 
""
""
so i had to go to  dharwar for m sc 
""
""
there also you stayed in the hostel 
""
""
yeah i stayed  uh in the hostel
""
""
and immedietly after your m sc you   took up teaching
""
""
""
 yeah i uh  in    while doing m sc  so
there was  uh uhm a special provision  for some of the students they
used to give  uh uhm uhm a a piece of research work 
""
uh that minor research we used to call 
""
so in the second year of m sc i was given  a piece of research
work and i was assigned to one professor dr rajgopal
""
""
uhm 
""
""
and uh so i worked with him  for minor research 
""
and uh  in that year i came in very close contact with dr
rajgopal  so i promised him  to continue ph d with him only 
""
so after completing my m sc i joined dr rajgopal sir for ph d 
""
""
do you get any scholarship for doing   the ph d 
""
""
 yeah   i got uh  c s r some  two words 
to start with 
""
and after two years i got this u g c fellowship 
""
and then after completing my ph d  i stayed in nineteen
sixty-seven i got my ph d degree 
""
and i stayed there  uh since i was married at the age of
twenty-one only  because my mother  wanted to see me married  uh
because she was almost ailing
""
""
uhm
""
""
and uh so  because of that i had to set up in dharwar 
 otherwise  otherwise i would have gone to some other place outside
the state poona like that 
""
uhn so  after uhm after getting my ph d in nineteen sixty-seven
i got  three fellowships one u g c  senior fellowship c s r senior
fellowship  another i i t senior fellowship from kanpur
""
""
 uhm  
""
""
uhm
""
""
i would have gone to kanpur and made a very good career 
but uh because of marriage i couldn't go 
""
so i had to
""
""
stay   back in dharwar 
""
""
 stay in   dharwar yeah 
""
and for two years i was there sixty-seven to sixty-nine as a 
two words 
""
and later on you know with great difficulty because   i'm
 coming from  a  agriculture background and no godfather so  i
entered the university as a demonstrator 
""
and three years i was a demonstrator
""
then with great difficulty i  got a     lecturer's
  post 
""
and i was sent to gulbarga 
""
and after that i had no problem
""
 i'm  coming up  from my own  laughs 
""
""
 lecturer  
""
""
yeah on your own
""
""
yeah 
""
""
and  how many years you have been visiting kolhapur 
""
""
uh  this is my third visit to kolhapur
""
and uh  once i came here for examination work 
""
and once uh  to participate in a conference which was organised
by the chemistry department of this university
""
and now this is third time 
""
""
do you understand marathi 
""
""
a little bit 
""
because uh  i i   it's  uh   i'm  from 
the bombay karnataka
""
""
uhm
""
""
so  there are quite a number of people speaking marathi
""
""
and uh as i know hindi    uhm  which i can speak 
""
and so  there are many common words in hindi and marathi so i
can understand uh  though i may not speak uh   in  marathi
""
""
 uhm  
""
""
no how did  how did you learn hindi 
""
""
so hindi it was compulsory for us  in uh
""
""
in the school
""
""
yes yes in the school
""
""
uhm 
""
""
and i passed the  rashtrabhasa 
""
""
uhm 
""
""
out of my own  interest
""
""
uhm 
""
""
so  since  it's  a national language  i felt i
should
""
""
you can read hindi 
""
""
oh yes sir
""
""
means   you can read marathi also 
""
""
 yes hindi i can read   hindi also
""
""
so marathi and hindi 
""
""
oh yes   script they are  the same  i can read
marathi without any problem
""
and i can understand also
""
""
 as the  one word  same  
""
""
uhm 
""
""
but uh  speaking is a problem and uhm 
""
""
tell us something about gulbarga 
""
""
uh  gul 
""
""
and how big is the city 
""
""
gulbarga is quite big 
""
and it is a divisional place
""
and uh  the population i think somewhere around  three point
five to four  lakhs 
""
and uh  uhm because of this  uh uhm there in that part of
karnataka uhm there is no  other big city
""
""
uhm
""
""
and uh  there are several colleges  and educationally
uhm  that is a very well developed this i can say
""
and there is a medical college 
""
and there are two engineering colleges 
""
and there are so many   colleges 
""
""
 private   colleges or uh  government colleges
""
""
yeah both of them are private colleges  and uh
""
""
and the medical college also is a private college 
""
""
medical college also a private college  and uh engineering
college one of the engineering college they started long back and it is 
uh i think it has got grant  uh this  though it is a private college
""
""
and there are several pharmacy colleges 
""
and uh  science colleges and  women's  college like that
educationally i think uh uhm 
""
""
when when was the  university in gulbarga was established
""
""
yeah it started as a post graduation centre in nineteen
seventy-one
""
""
of   karnataka university 
""
""
 karnataka yeah   yeah karnataka university 
""
and initially they started  uh two or three departments 
kannada english uh   that's  all
""
""
uhm 
""
""
and later in this nineteen seventy-two they added uh  some
more departments  chemistry department then uh  this uh mathematics
department were added 
""
so i went in nineteen seventy-two 
""
so we were uh
""
""
so gulbarga has been a university for the last twenty-five
years
""
""
no no  seventy to eighty  upto eighty it was part of
karnataka university as a post   graduate centre 
""
""
 centre   uhm 
""
""
so only in nineteen eighty it became another university 
along with mangalore university 
""
""
so mangalore and uh    gulbarga 
""
""
 yeah gulbarga   are of the same age
""
""
were established as   university in the  same year
""
""
 yeah in the same  
""
""
yeah same year 
""
""
so  it's  a only a fifteen years old university
""
""
yeah fifteen years old 
""
""
now  do  uh does the university  have departments
like uh  nuclear physics  or computer science    yeah 
bio-technology
""
""
 yeah  
""
""
yeah 
""
sir we have  uhm uh almost all departments  the the the
master of computer  uh uh i think m c a course
""
""
uhm
""
""
so that is there and our vice-chancellor since  he is the
uh person from mathematics and computer  so he our present vice-chancellor
  he's  invested lot of  one word  computer science  and
m c a course is there
""
and we have got bio-technology course also 
""
and uh nuclear physics  uh there is this department
""
and there is a separate applied electronics department 
""
so in physics department  i don't think they have nuclear
physics 
""
so they have solid state physics and    one word 
""
""
""
 how   how big are your physics and chemistry
departments 
""
""
chemistry is very big
""
""
uhm 
""
""
so we have uh  about twenty-one staff members
""
""
uhm
""
""
twenty-one staff members 
""
and we are educating every years fifty students 
""
we have got five branches  organic  inorganic  physical
 and medical and pharmaceutical
""
""
uhm 
""
""
and also for each branch we are admitting about ten students
""
""
so in all we are admitting fifty students 
""
so  that's  a very  and first year  fifty second
fifty  we have got quite a number of ph d  m phil and p g students 
""
 it's  a very big department
""
""
and what is the procedure of admission in  gulbarga
university 
""
""
sir the admission procedure is uh  almost  uh uhm
government type of procedure 
""
sir we strictly go by merit and uh  following the  one word
 system 
""
and uh we conduct the entrance examination 
""
so uh    university 
""
""
 so even   even students from your own university
have to appear for the   entrance examination 
""
""
 oh yeah definitely  
""
""
  definitely   and uh
""
""
  one word   
""
""
sir mostly you know the  the seats for uhm  post
graduate seats are  mainly allotted to  this uh students of affiliated
colleges
""
""
uhm 
""
""
outside the university students hardly one or two seats will
be  uh available for   the year 
""
""
 yes  
""
""
so most of the seats are for only  affiliated college
students 
""
so uhm immedietly after their undergraduate examination b a or b
sc or b com  sir we conduct  the entrance examination 
""
and uh  so we have  evolved a formula
""
""
uhm
""
""
about seventy-five percent weightage is given to their  uh
first class degree   performence  
""
and twenty-five percent weightage is given to   entrance
examination  
""
so both together we  uh prepare a merit   list 
""
""
 uhm  
""
""
 entrance examination  
""
""
 merit   list
""
""
and then  according to the  one word  system  we
allot seats 
""
""
is the medium of instruction  at the graduate level 
english or kannada
""
""
uh as i know  in the science uh  there is no medium of
kannada  in uh in almost all colleges it will be only english  in the
science
""
""
uhm
""
""
and uh in arts i think 
""
""
in    one word  and arts  it is kannada 
""
""
  one word  and arts  
""
""
yeah  they use kannada 
""
and uh students are allowed to write uh  uhm either in kannada
or english
""
""
uhm
""
""
and even in science also that provision is there 
""
but none of the students they write in kannada 
""
   they're   since they are taught in english 
  uhm  so they will answer in english
""
""
 uhm  
""
""
 uhm  
""
""
english 
""
and how many students in all are there in your university 
""
""
uh i thought there
""
""
but it is not a constituent colleges
""
i am talking about  the   post graduate uh department
""
""
""
 oh yeah so yeah   we don't have any  uh
college uh  run by the university
""
""
uhm
""
""
so  only the uhm the p g
""
""
uhm
""
""
uh courses are run by the university 
""
and i think uh  that must be somewhere around fifteen hundred
 uh students
""
i don't know the exact strength
""
""
uhm
""
""
but it is uh  somewhere around fifteen to fifteen hundred
to two thousand 
""
so in that range
""
""
yeah  and uh  government of uh  karnataka 
gives all the grants  and the u g c also gives the grants
""
""
yeah  so
""
""
but  beside these two  funding agencies  are there
other agencies which also fund the  programmes   in the university
""
""
""
 yeah there is one   uh this  hyderabad
karnatak uh uh  development fund they have  uhm the the karnataka state
in order to develop that hyderabad karnataka  area  so
