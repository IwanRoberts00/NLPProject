""
""
 area and volume of a regular solid  
""
so what is a regular solid  ?
""
a regular solid is one in which  all the sides  and angles are
  equal  
""
""
 equal  
""
""
can you observe here ?
""
""
yes sir
""
""
all sides and angles are equal
""
""
yes sir 
""
""
so what is the name of this figure  ?
""
what is the name of this solid ?
""
""
prism prism
""
""
yes  this is called  prism
""
""
prism 
""
""
now observe this  face of this prism 
""
so here  this is what is  it's   top
""
""
top 
""
""
this is base   base  and these are   height
 height 
""
""
 base  
""
""
 height  
""
""
the lateral faces
""
""
lateral faces
""
""
now see this  shape of what is it is of base and its 
 lateral faces 
""
""
 lateral faces  
""
""
and now the shape of  shape of what is it  base and
lateral faces are different 
""
shape of  lateral faces and base are   different 
""
""
 different  
""
""
now compare these  lateral faces only 
""
what is the shape of the lateral faces ?
""
""
rectangular rectangular
""
""
rectangular   faces 
""
""
 faces  
""
""
and compare to what is it ?
""
""
rectangular
""
""
compare the  top and the base
""
""
base 
""
""
what is the name of this one ?
""
""
square
""
""
square base  isn't it  ?
""
now  see the  top as well as what is it the lateral faces
 how these two are there  ?
""
""
which  ?
""
""
top as well as    lateral  lateral face 
""
are these perpendicular to one another ?
""
""
 lateral  
""
""
yes sir
""
""
no sir  yes sir 
""
""
lateral faces and  the coordinator  the base  are
  perpendicular to each other 
""
""
 perpendicular to each other  
""
""
understood  ?
""
""
yes sir
""
""
so such a  figure or such a solid is known as what does it
is ?
""
""
prism 
""
""
and here this figure that is prism  has how many faces  ?
""
""
six faces
""
""
six faces
""
""
sir shailaja patil 
""
""
here this  prism is having what is it is square shaped 
face
""
therefore this is called  square based  prism 
""
and  let's  take another prism  which has  three
lateral faces 
""
understood  ?
""
so here what is the shape of the lateral face  ?
""
""
rectangle
""
""
rectangle  or rectangular  face
""
and shape of the top of the   top and the bases 
""
""
 triangular shape  
""
""
triangle bases
""
so this  prism is called  ?
""
""
 triang 
""
""
  triangular based prism 
""
""
 triangular based prism  
""
""
now  we want to find what is it is  surface area 
""
do you know how to find the surface area  ?
""
or do you know how to find the  area of a rectangle  ?
""
""
yes
""
""
how do you find the area of a rectangle  ?
""
""
half base into height
""
""
area of a rectangle
""
""
length into breadth
""
""
  length into breadth 
""
""
 length into breadth  
""
""
and how do you find the area of a square  ?
""
""
side into side side into side
""
""
side into  side because all the sides are equal   in
  square 
""
""
 square  
""
""
now see here
""
how to find  the surface area of what is it is  prism ?
""
in order to find what is its total surface area  what we should
do  ?
""
total surface area  here we can find what is it is  the area
of    rectangle  rectangle
""
""
 rectangle  
""
""
that is of one shape 
""
similarly you can find the area of this shape
""
similarly you can find  the area of this shape
""
means we can find the areas of quadrilateral lateral faces 
""
and we can also find what is it is  areas of top as well as 
 base  
""
""
 base  
""
""
so total surface area means what  ?
""
total surface area ?
""
now we can calculate the  what is it surface area  of what
is it each face 
""
but to uhm find the what is total surface area  ?
""
it means what we have to do  ?
""
we have to find the we have to  find the sum of the what is it
is  areas of all these faces 
""
so total surface area include  the area of what is it is the
lateral faces  as well as the area of what is it top and   base 
""
""
""
 base  
""
""
now here we have the what is it is model 
""
model of the  prism 
""
understood  ?
""
can you prepare  a model of this type ?
""
""
yes sir
""
""
so you can cut out the shape of a prism  in cardboard 
""
now here  see you have what is it is  prism
""
and  you have prepared what is it model  and open it up 
""
when you open it up what happens  ?
""
you will get what is it is  figure of this prism 
""
""
yes sir 
""
""
do you get the figure of this kind or not ?
""
""
yes sir 
""
""
suppose here the length of the what is it is 
""
""
prism
""
""
the length of the what is it is
""
""
prism 
""
""
rectangle
""
""
rectangle
""
""
taking the rectangle 
""
length of the rectangle is  eight centimetres  and its
breadth is    a centimetres  
""
""
 a centimetres  
""
""
now here do you see that part  ?
""
do you find that it is a  big rectangle ?
""
""
they are not the same 
""
""
and here what are these ?
""
""
square 
""
""
yes what are these actually ?
""
""
  top  and the   base 
""
""
 top  
""
""
 base  
""
right 
""
so it means we want to find what is the total surface area of the
prism 
""
to find the total surface area of the prism what we have to do  ?
""
we have to find and we have to add  the surface areas of these
lateral  fa  faces  plus what is it  ?
""
""
the base is
""
""
the area of the top and the   base 
""
""
 base  
""
""
right 
""
so  total  bb writing  surface area  area  of
prism  is equal to what is it is  area of  top    and
base   plus area of
""
""
 and base  
""
""
rectangle 
""
""
area of
""
""
lateral faces 
""
""
four rectangles
""
""
four rectangles  four rectangle
""
""
yes sir 
""
""
so area of top and bases
""
these two have the shape of a  square 
""
therefore what you can write here ?
""
area of base  into  two  because these two have what is
it is  same area 
""
these two squares have same area 
""
plus what is it is area of four rectangle 
""
now compare here  all the rectangles have  same height 
""
""
yes sir 
""
""
that is same length  and they have same breadth that is a
centimetre 
""
understood  ?
""
so area of four rectangles  what you can write four into 
area of  a rectangle 
""
area of a   rectangle  
""
""
 rectangle  
""
""
now how do you find the area of a rectangle here  ?
""
and how do you find the area of a square ?
""
just find out this one 
""
so what is the  formula to find the area of a square  ?
""
""
side into side
""
""
side into   side  
""
""
 side  
""
""
so here area of  base  these are base  but the bases
have the what is it shape of  what is it square  therefore what is the
formula here  ?
""
""
side into side
""
""
what is the side of the square ?
""
""
a
""
""
a
""
""
a
""
""
a square 
""
""
a
""
""
therefore  area of  base  into two is equal to what
you can write   two into a square 
""
""
 two into a square  
""
""
plus   four 
""
""
 two  
""
""
sir four
""
""
four 
""
now find the area of a rectangle
""
how do you find the area of a rectangle  ?
""
we require length and    breadth 
""
""
 breadth  
""
""
so what is the length of the rectangle here ?
""
""
h
""
""
h centimetres  and breadth of the
""
""
a 
""
""
so it is  length into what is it is  breadth
""
""
breadth 
""
""
understood  ?
""
now here  two into a square  plus  four into a 
""
four into   a 
""
""
 a  
""
""
four into a means what it gives us  ?
""
""
four a square 
""
""
four into a  four  a's  are here  a plus a 
plus a  plus a  means what is it ?
""
""
four a square
""
""
what is it  ?
""
""
a length
""
""
yes  what is the length of this side  a
""
""
a
""
""
this is   a  this is   a  this is a
""
""
 a  
""
""
 a  
""
""
you are adding a    four times 
""
""
 four times  
""
""
it means what it gives you  ?
""
""
four a  four uh  four a 
""
""
breadth of four triangles 
""
""
length of 
""
""
breadth of four triangles 
""
""
not breadth man
""
sit down 
""
that is called as perimetre 
""
this is the perimetre uhm 
""
perimetre means what  ?
""
sum of the sides 
""
sum of the sides
""
do you know that ?
""
""
yes sir
""
""
so here we can do what is it sum of the sides of this 
base
""
""
base
""
""
so four a means what is it is  two a square plus four a
 into what is it base
""
""
base 
""
""
so two a square means what is it  two into  area of the
base   bb writing  base plus    plus four  perimetre
""
""
""
 plus four  
""
""
perimetre  of the base  into height  bb close 
""
""
height 
""
""
height of what is it  ?
""
""
prism
""
""
height of the  prism 
""
it is as well as height of the    rectangle  
""
""
 rectangle  
""
""
height of the prism 
""
so will you solve an example now  ?
""
""
yes sir 
""
""
so  let's  see the  model example that is given
here 
""
find the total surface area of a prism with  square base 
in which the side of  the square base is  four centimetres and height
 six centimetres 
""
so what is given in this problem i shall write here  just here
""
""
 blackboard work 
""
find the total surface area  surface area  of a prism 
prism  with a square base  with a  square base  in which the
side of the square is  four centimetres  and height  six
centimetres   bb work end 
""
yes what is given in the problem  ?
""
""
side and height
""
""
side of the what is it is  square base and height of the
 prism is given 
""
then what we have to find here  ?
""
""
total surface
""
""
total surface area 
""
now here  we've   derived what is formula  to
calculate what is it is  total surface area of the    prism 
""
""
 prism  
""
""
so what is the formula to  calculate the total surface
area of the prism  ?
""
two   into  area of the base plus perimetre of the base
""
""
simple
""
""
 into area of the base plus perimetre of the base 
""
""
height into height plus base 
""
""
so substitute these values in your what does it is 
formula 
""
so total surface area   bb work begin  total surface
area is equal to   bb work end  what is given  ?
""
""
two  area of square
""
""
area of the   base 
""
""
 base  
""
""
how do you calculate area of the base  ?
""
""
four into four 
""
""
has he given the  side of the base ?
""
""
yes sir yes
""
""
here 
""
what is the length of this one ?
""
""
four centimetres
""
""
if this is four  can you calculate the area of this base ?
""
""
yes sir
""
""
how do you calculate it  ?
""
""
side into side 
""
""
 bb work begin 
""
area of the    base  is equal to what is it is
   four into four  that is equal to   sixteen 
what is it    square centimetres  square   
centimetres   bb work end 
""
""
 base  
""
""
 four into four  
""
""
 sixteen  
""
""
 square centimetres  
""
""
 centimetres  
""
""
so here two into area of the base
""
what is the area of the base  ?
""
""
sixteen square centimetres
""
""
 bb work begins 
""
square    centimetres   bb work end  plus 
perimetre of the base 
""
so how do you find  perimetre  ?
""
""
 centimetres  
""
""
that is nothing but what is it  sum of the sides 
""
so here how do you find  the perimetre  ?
""
sum of the sides of what is it is  base 
""
so what is the  length of this base  ?
""
  four centimetres  
""
""
 four centimetres  
""
""
four plus four   plus four plus four 
""
""
 plus four plus four  
""
sixteen
""
""
so here we can calculate and what is it is all the sides or
you can also multiply the side of the  square by  four
""
so what is the  length of the side here  ?
""
""
four a four 
""
""
what is the length of the ?
""
""
four  four
""
""
four centimetres
""
 bb work begins 
""
so four into    four  
""
""
 four  
""
""
and what is the  height of the prism  ?
""
""
three
""
""
three
""
""
height of the prism is    three  six centimetres
""
""
""
 three  
""
""
now solve this one 
""
here two into    sixteen  centimetres
""
""
 sixteen    noise 
""
""
thirty-two    square centimetres  
""
""
 square centimetres  
""
""
square centimetres plus    sixty  here  
 twenty-two  four into four    sixteen  plus  six 
  twenty-two  thirty-two  plus what is it is ?
""
""
 sixty  
""
""
 twenty-two  
""
""
 sixteen  
""
""
 twenty-two  
""
""
twenty-two 
""
""
twenty-two  so
""
""
fifty-four 
""
""
fifty    four square  centimetres 
""
""
 four square centimetres
