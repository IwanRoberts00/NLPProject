okay today we are going to do the topic   cell
specialisation  that is  how cells are specialised to form
tissues 
""
so far we have learnt all about   mi  uh  unicellular
organisms 
""
okay
""
how a single    plant looks   plant cell looks 
 like  ?
""
how a single animal cell looks like  ?
""
what all it contains  ?
""
what are the organisms within a cell  ?
""
also now we have to study  how many cells  are  arranged
together  or when they are grouped together what do they form  ?
""
what is the form of cell organization ?
""
please raise your hands 
""
""
a collection of cells 
""
""
forms  ?
""
""
tissues
""
""
tissues 
""
so this is what we are going to study  a collection of cells 
forms a particular tissue  and why are the cells organized together to
form the tissues ?
""
 it's  because  they have to carry out a specific
function 
""
so far you have seen that one single cell carry carries out all the
activity 
""
now when a group of cells get  get together they will carry out
 the same activity but at a larger level
""
at the more quicker rate of doing it 
""
one cell and ten cells doing the work 
""
it is just like  one person doing  one work  and ten
persons doing the same amount of work 
""
which will get over faster  ?
""
""
  ten persons 
""
""
 ten persons   doing the amount of work
""
so  the specialisation of cell  to form a tissue is to carry
out a work and this is mainly found up in  higher animals and plants 
""
now the definition of the tissue is   a group of cells
 specialised for a particular function  
""
okay
""
a group of cells  specialised for a particular function  to
perform may be absorption of water  in the plants  or to perform  uh
energy  uh energy production 
""
okay that is work in plants and animals 
""
or like chlorophyll production in plants  or the enzyme
production in animals 
""
so for a typical function in the cells are grouped together  a
set of cells are known as  tissues 
""
today we are going to study about  the types of, plant tissues
as well as animal tissues 
""
the plants and animals are totally different  from each other
""
both of them are basically living organisms 
""
but what is that one  one feature which distinguishes plants
and animals  ?
""
""
plants prepare their own food 
""
""
and animals do not prepare their own food  ?
""
""
they take it from others  from the plants
""
""
what is it present in the plant cell ?
""
""
chlorophyll 
""
""
the presence of  chlorophyll
""
what is chlorophyll  ?
""
""
green colour 
""
""
green colouring matter
""
""
green colouring matter 
""
what does this green colouring matter do ?
""
what ability does it have  ?
""
yes ?
""
""
it gives the green colour to plant
""
""
no 
""
""
it is  brown 
""
""
no
""
yes uh anybody  ?
""
""
it absorbs the heat of the sun
""
""
it is the only substance from which the plant which has the
ability to absorb the  sun's  rays 
""
do you understand any animals which can absorb the  sun's 
light and prepare their own energy ?
""
""
no no
""
""
so the green chlorophyll that is uh  the green colouring
matter the green pigment within the cell  of a plant  has the ability
to absorb out the   sun's  rays and convert it uh  use it for
the preparation of  starch that is the basic food material of plant 
""
now what are the plant tissues  ?
""
plant tissues are of  two types  one is   
meristematic tissue  and the second is permanent tissue 
""
""
 meristematic tissue and the second is permanent tissue
 
""
""
for example  ?
""
and the second is ?
""
""
permanent tissues 
""
""
now meristematic tissues are usually found at  the tip
where  tips of the plants where active growth is taking place 
""
like  the tip of the root  the tip of the shoot  that is
when leaves are being produced  or the bud that  the bud is going to
give rise to a plant  or the lateral graticules which you are going to
give direct to the animal plant cell and leaves etcetra  or the auxillary
bud 
""
what does the auxillary bud forms  ?
""
uh auxillary bud is the thing which will give rise to leaves
etcetra 
""
now meristematic tissues  are uh those cells which are found at
the tips of actively growing parts of the plant 
""
these cells are  polygonal in shape  and it has a centrally
 placed large nucleus  a very dense cytoplasm  and they do not have
any  vacuoles in them
""
no air pins are present  and there are no intercellular spaces
within these meristematic tissues  okay
""
and these tissues are contrary devices they form in larger size and
give rise to a new set of cell 
""
and the main function is to form new tissues for the plants 
""
then you have the second set of plant uh  the second set of
tissues sorry  and that is the   permanent tissues  
""
""
 permanent tissues  
""
""
now in the permanent tissues you have again two types  as
""
""
simple permanent
""
""
simple permanent  and
""
""
  complex tissues 
""
""
 complex tissues   
""
okay 
""
the simple permanent tissues are  they are not uh  very
complex in their structure and also their functions are not very  high
""
that is  they do not have to  perform extremly vital
functions for the plant 
""
vital means  those functions which are vital for the  life of
the plant
""
so the uh  to see that the plant keeps alive 
""
okay 
""
these types of tissues will perform certain functions and the vital
functions are the permanent permanent tissues
""
and the simple tissues  the simple form of  permanent tissues
are the one  which form a support adding support for the plant or which
forms the main structure of the stem or the root or the leaves 
""
and it provides support mechanical support  to the plant and to
some extent they also help in preparing food for the plant 
""
okay you have learnt about plastid  in our previous chapter 
""
then we have learnt plastid as the starch 
""
one is the 
""
""
   chlor    chloroplast  
""
""
please raise your hands 
""
girls  durga ?
""
""
chloroplast
""
""
yes
""
""
  chloroplast  chrmoplast and  one word  
""
""
 chloroplast chrmoplast and  one word   
""
now chloroplast is the one that absorbs the sunlight 
""
chromoplast gives    colour  colour to the plant other
than these  and it use of  flower  is very important one with
starch present in the  flower  
""
""
 colour  
""
""
so the simple permanent tissues  some of them i mean the
leaf or flower and as well found in the preparation of starch  one word
""
""
the preparing of the  one word  now suppose if you put
simple permanent tissues in the  two words  
""
there is no simple permanent tissues when the name of five  a
few words  and these which help out in the preparation of starch
""
okay  now which are the type of simple permanent tissues we
have to see 
""
the first one is  parenchyma  the second is  
collenchyma  collenchyma    and the third  and the third is
  sclerenchyma  
""
""
 collenchyma  
""
""
 and the third is  
""
""
 sclernchyma  
""
""
we are learning what is it  ?
""
""
 noise 
""
""
okay  now  out of these simple permanent tissues 
the most simple structure is of a  parenchyma cell
""
these are usually  green in colour  they are spherical 
root in  cell there are lot of intercellular spaces in between them 
""
they have a large nucleus  and  many vacuoles  around
along the thin cyctoplasm  plus the other cell uh  cellular orgnelles
are present 
""
and they are filled with a number of  plastids 
""
these plastids help in the preparation of  food 
""
the parenchyma cells that is revived  they are circular in
shape  loosely spaced  having a lot of inter-cellular spaces 
""
the cell walls are thin  and they have a large nucleus which
push to one side by the secondary based vacoule  plus  the plastids are
present in large number in the case of parenchyma cells 
""
plastids are not  are  present in the leaves and the 
cells
""
and if you have to release the very green in colour in the
presence of the green colour plant 
""
then we have  a second  okay the function of the parenchyma
is preparation of  food 
""
the second type of cells are the  collenchyma cells 
""
these have got  a very definite structure  and  they
provide mechanical strength to the whole plant 
""
there is a    charact     characteristic
  thing about the collenchyma is that  they are  a firm
thickening at the corners of the four corners of the cell 
""
this is  one of the characteristic features of the collenchyma
cells that is  the cell corners show thickening of a specific substance
""
""
the thickening is made up of  cellulose  plus pectine 
""
okay 
""
these are substances which are found  uh mainly in plant  uh
plant bodies rather than animal cells 
""
do you know that the cell wall in  in plant is made up of
cellulose which you studied in your lower classes 
""
okay but uh  collenchyma cells are made up of  uh additional
substance called pectine which gives it more strength or which makes it more
tougher than the normal other cells 
""
even though parenchyma cells  contain cellulose in their cell
walls  yet  uh which gives it a definite shape around the  around
the structure 
""
but uh  collenchyma cells are  i told you they provide
mechanical support to the plants  and for this sake they have to contain a
certain hard structure in their cell body 
""
and this is made by  a combination of cellulose plus pectine
and this is    fo    found   in the presence of
in the form of  cell thickenings at the corners of the cell 
""
also then the rest of the structures are there like the vacuole or
 nucleus  the other chloroplasts and the cytoplasm 
""
so remember collenchyma provide mechanical support to the plant
body 
""
they are mostly present in the outer layers of a structure like
 the periphery of the leaf uh  of the cross section of the leaf or 
the borders of the stem 
""
okay the outer walls of the stem  to give that thickness to the
stem or the outer walls of the root are all made up of  collenchyma cells
and it gives that stiffness to the plant 
""
do you understand  ?
""
now the last type of permanent permanent tissues  uh sorry
simple permanent tissues  is the sclerenchyma cells 
""
these are  single shaped cells  and  as it is growing
or as it is maturing  what happens is  the central part of the cell 
starts moving in cytoplasm 
""
and in fact the part gets tougher after sometime  and it  it
becomes very hard and tough 
""
and the collection of sclerenchyma  forms uh  structure
called as   one word  
""
what do they form  ?
""
   one word   
""
""
  one word   
""
""
okay this is  the  one word  formed in the
sclerenchyma cells start moving and start moving  moving out in the inner
part of the cytoplasm
""
and what  what is important is that  the sclerenchyma 
gives out the important fibres that we obtain today in the form of jute and
uh  from the jute plant and the hemp plant okay 
""
so these fibres which we use for making sack  or for making
even now a days uh jute cloth is attaining a lot of importance 
""
all these can be obtained from our sclerenchyma fibres  which
on maturing  have got certain stone cells or  one word   and
these stone cells give  a toughness to the cell and they end up 
becoming the fibres of the plant 
""
thus the sclerenchyma cells are found in large numbers in certain
type of plants like the coconut 
""
the coconut palm  then you have your jute uh  tree or your
hemp  etcetra where fibres are obtained from these plants
""
i shall tell you about these again we use for variety of uh 
provisions like making of rope  of choirs  or even matresses coir
matresses or then  the latest is  jute cloth 
""
so this completes our  uh one topic that is  simple
permanent tissues 
""
these tissues have not  uh have not totally lost  their
ability to  divide
""
that is if we want  we can bunch their form  they can still
undergo cellular division and form new set of cells
""
this is what distinguishes  simple permanent tissues from
complex permanent tissues
""
they have not totally lost their ability to divide that means 
when the cell is formed  it grows in size but also it has a necessity 
it can also divide and form another set of cells 
""
what we have learnt is that only meristematic cells are capable of
function cell doesn't it  ?
""
but in certain cases usually simple permanent cells can undergo
 uh cell division if the need arises though not always 
""
then you have  a large size  of   cell  plant
cells  and that is  the complex  permanent tissues 
""
these are the most important tissues of the plant because they
perform  the very vital functions  like conducting of water  and
conducting of  food materials 
""
this cell  the complex  uh permanent tissue  which 
conduct water are known as your    xylem cells  
""
""
 xylem cells  
""
""
and the permanent permanent tissues which conduct food
materials are known as your    phloem cells  
""
""
 phloem cells  
""
""
these are found in the innermost regions of the plant or 
of the plant structure like the stem the root or the leaf  of the tree 
""
the inner most structure of these  is form of these root
structure the xylem and the phloem 
""
why are they called as complex permanent tissues is because 
the word complex is a very key word 
""
if these cells once they are formed  once a particular cell is
formed  it loses its ability to divide
""
it can not divide again and form another xylem cell 
""
it remains by itself  and it goes on performing its function
and after a period of time  when it has finished its  uh life  life
cycle life period it might die off
""
then a new xylem cell might come in its place 
""
but this cell on its own will not give rise to a new set of cells
""
""
now both these  uh cells that is xylem and phloem  are found
in the form of tube  towards the whole  length of the stem or the
whole length of the root or the whole length of the leaf 
""
they are perfectly arranged in such a way to form a tubular
structure or tube like structure so that  conduction of the material
becomes much easier
""
but even  may be in the form of water based minerals  or it
might be  food materials in the case of  phloem 
""
okay  xylem  conduct water through out the plant body 
and phloem conduct waste food material  towards the plant body 
""
now if you want to see the individual structure of xylem and
phloem 
""
the xylem has got  you have two sets of cells again in the
xylem and they are called as  tracheids and vessels 
""
okay  so you have xylem tracheae and xylem vessels  and
both these are found  in association with each other
""
you will never find only a xylem tracheae or you will never find
only a xylem vessel 
""
and in the phloem you have two types of cells  you have 
sieve  and companion cells 
""
and one characteristic feature of the phloem cells is that  at
the top walls  okay  the top walls are not continous  but they have
got fine pores in them to form a mess like structure  or matting like
structure in between the two top walls the top wall structure in between two
cell 
""
and this fine mess like structure acts as a sieving place  for
all the materials food materials that passes along the wall 
""
so only a certain type of food material can pass pass through the
phloem tubes having a definite size 
""
all the larger materials will not pass through the sieve 
""
the food material can be easily accumulated by the  rest uh 
the leaf of the plant through the  one word  of plant
