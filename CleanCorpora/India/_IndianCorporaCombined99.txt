yes sir i will come now please talk for ten minutes i will come sir ah accha  but uh uh the same drafting i can do na   ? the dealing  the same type of that some of it are to be changed okay sir because yeah that is from my point of view  yeah and uh catering to my yes sir  requirements and needs perhaps yeah and probably i think uh you have to yeah change it a little bit ah ha  and project a little more ah ha about your own grievences or whatever fresh points are there ah ha that we have to put it down and then write isn't it ?  yeah   yeah   yes sir   yeah   yeah   ah ha   ah ha   ah ha  ah ha  sir about that chaya i received a letter from uh the director of uh uh school education that chaya katti uhm could you tell me something about it sir ? even i don't know anything about it   uhm  see  ah the nineteen eighty-six  ah   called that national policy on i mean that new education policy is there isn't it ?  programme of  right sir  national policy of education yeah  uh they have prepared a kind of uh programme of action  pune yeah for the state  right sir   yeah   haan  that is for the state they have prepared in nineteen ninety-three  ah ha about that they want to finalise  ah ha  and they have identified some people  ah ha uh in each department ah ha and uh they wanted uhm that this person should go through the d o a draft which they have prepared at s c r t   yeah and then to the governments and uh whatever additions deletions will be there ah ha they should make it and then hand it over   uhm   yeah   ah ha  thats all  thats all  haan  and for that probably i think we did a kind of honorary job uhm uh but the new syllabus and new programme of action and whatever we decide ultimately ah ha will be the final one and should reach entire state  and the all the direction and all the ah ha  uh schools ah ha will be impleminting this particular kind of new contents that all we suggest the thing  uhm   ah ha   ah ha   ah ha  i see otherwise you know the programme of action actually what to do  ah ha that we have to suggest to them  ah ha  ah ha  they are keeping a book in the sense  it is in the book for no no programme of action nahi nahi you can you can recommend for preparation of new books  i see you may recommend for preparation of new contents   ah ha a new methodology new approaches new a t or i t   ah ha whatever it is uh yes whatever you suggest  uhm will be taken up uhm uhm then the action will be permitted   ah ha   ah ha   yeah   uhm   uhm uhm  who are the other members sir ? uh from our college uh because that day i was there i gave all the names of our college first ah ha  uh mrs katon ah ha  for minorities and or something like that i ask her ah ha  probably she must have been given minorities and only accepting that kind of strategy ah ha even that several  two words ah ha  then myself   ah ha   ah ha  i see and for english uh sharma ah ha  dr sharma  ah ha  and then uh uh professor venkateshwar rao for telugu ah ha  and then uh like that quite a good number of people are drafted ah ha  uh professor anwar jahan for administration ah ha  is there any chapter on science education also sir ? science education is there that was given to you  no sir they have given   there are measurement problems  evaluation means ah evaluation measurement  ah  yeah evaluation measurement must have been given you are you are dealing with education research also perhaps   ah ha that's why  ah ha  sir before going to the meeting shall i read something and go or uh   nahi nahi not not necessary because content point of view ah ha there will be absolutely nothing  ah ha  so need for pre no need preparation  no need  no need  i see well you just go yeah and uh you can discuss and prepare a kind of plan  for action uhm uhm  what we should do ? you know they they want to know uhn what shall we do first of all  uhn  yes sir  and this these are the things which we you should do  that you are going to tell them  right sir  and uh while telling uh that you will be uh already you have prepared a kind of draft or some directons they have given that is not uh open and one that is almost a special one  right sir  uh for the structure you have to give final consent  right sir that you know this you should do this we should not do and ultimately you can say that this can could be taken up this could be  not be taken up etcetra i see  now that you can complete that way  today i have taken leave sir after taking first pay i know i know i understand i  as a first pay you know infact somebody told me ah ha ha   that's why uh i was just asking you know   ah what your tommorrow's programme ?  ah  yeah  by the by a very interesting information yesterday have you seen eenadu ? yes yes we have discussed already about telegu university judge  we've discussed it we've discussed i want to go to the court today  you ? yeah myself or uh someone uh who is known to us   ah and we want to collect that judgement copy  ah  yes yes yes yes  that we can manage yes because they conducted interviews during elections  uhm so judgement gave in favour of uh not in favour of university   uhm   that's okay but anything uh   it's very positive point no which one which one is it conducting these elections are important ah or issuing the orders are important ?  ah  uh  issuing the orders is the main thing isn't it ? yeah that they should note out ah  ah that part they have to stress not conducting the interview  interview you can conduct at any time there's no problem ah ha  that is that are for that also there are some restrictions  nahi but you know we don't fall in that  in that provision that's all because this is in september november and september yes  elections uh held in november uh december uh elections elections were last month november uh december sir  yes december first and december fifth  no no  they are telling no the elections notification came on first or second november isn't it ? right sir since   haan  uh this uh as far as the severe circumstance they won't come under the perview of ah ha this category  ah ha  but uh it seems eiliah told to tirupat that they should not no organisation should conduct interviews before three months  that we don't know because ah ha from the date of notification is of course we know  ah ha  i see uh date of notification came at what time ? ah ha  was it in september ? notiification came in the month of july  no no no no  haan  this notification must have come somewhere in the month of october or so ah ha exact dates you know  ah ha our first time elections were held in andhra pradesh   yeah yeah that kind of notification   yeah yeah  and primarily you know the the issue orders were issued on fifth that is on the election day itself   that is wrong  that is wrong that is wrong  haan that is wrong  on the election day they should not issue  yeah  and specially these elections the orders should not be given uhm  because the candidates if they are if they belong to a particular community or category or uh political party they the what you call the wave reaction will be there isn't it ? uhm  a ripple of it  yes sir  and the ripple of it goes to larger communities and then they begin claims and vote for this a particular section  yeah yeah thats how uhm  these election orders also should not be given ah  but they may argue they will say on first we have not given because ah on first uh the election in the city was there  ah  right sir  when they only ripple in the but in the telangana region was there anywhere  yeah yeah in entire north telangana ah uh there was a that was election day  ah  uh then it is alright  and then we you have a chance yeah  because uh north telangana means osmania jurisdiction  one or two  yes sir  nizamabad yeah  ah ha then its alright yes  nizamabad comes under osmania isn't it ? yeah yeah  not kakatiya  yes sir okay then we can take it up yes sir  its okay then that part is that way yes sir  today what are your plans sir today ? are you coming ? no somebody is coming ah ha at two thirty  ah ha   accha   i'll wait for them shrinivas is here now ah ha  and then you could have  that's great no now he has come back  ah ha  i think uh he understood things ah ha  he went to namrata institution and was saying it all that now he realised  a little bit not fully  still uh of course its okay we'll slowly console him uhm yes sir sometimes some consolation should be given to him yes sir and already one project is there in hand yeah yeah c i r from that i can divert the funds to him yes sir  already he has done some amount also yeah yeah of course there is uh only five or six thousand yeah  other thing also we can give what is there we've  the amount together yes but then unfortunately that thing is not working thats all   yes  yeah yeah uhn yeah he needs money  yeah yeah he is a brilliant boy but uh somehow ah ha  psycologically he is upset   ah ha  ah ha  thats the point ramakrishna has come today ? no he is on leave today  ah ha ramakrishna is on leave i think so because he has not applied ah ha  he may apply tomorrow  ah ha  ah ha he may come and then say for yesterday i'm  giving his application i see  because  sir from monday onwards i too want to take leave sir for four days because total i have five c ls uhm so from monday to twenty ninth   uhm  monday is a holiday function day isn't it ?
