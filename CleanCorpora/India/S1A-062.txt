""
""
archana are you there  ?
""
""
yes i am there
""
how are you sonali  ?
""
""
i am fine
""
how are you  ?
""
""
how are your studies going on  ?
""
""
they are going on pretty well but i am now reading for the
examinations that are going to come up in  april or may 
""
""
why  ?
""
""
i don't know i have not been studying too much that is why 
""
""
what has happened sonali you were a too studious girl i think
""
""
""
yeah may be because now-a-days i just keep thinking of  one
of the ideas i am getting
""
""
thinking of what exactly about getting married  ?
""
""
no  not marriage  marriage is another two to three years
   uh before that 
""
""
 uh too long   i think sonali
""
""
no because before that i have to sit for my civil services 
""
i have to do i a s
""
""
oh   it's  really fabulous thing 
""
""
okay now  i won't talk about that much of future right now
""
i want to talk about may be say  november december 
""
""
about november december  i did not get it sonali 
""
""
okay   i 
""
""
 can   you explain it  ?
""
""
okay here we go 
""
i have this idea of  conducting one fun-fair at the university
""
""
""
of conducting a pardon i beg your pardon 
""
""
a fun-fair 
""
""
oh i think  it's  really a fabulous job 
""
""
thank god you appreciate it and you like it 
""
""
i think it will create a history in our department  uh not
only in the department but in the university itself 
""
""
why  ?
""
""
why because i think no one has uh  conducted this fun-fair
""
""
""
before  ?
""
""
yeah
""
""
so that means  we'll  be the pioneers 
""
""
yeah  laughs  probably so 
""
""
in fact you are the one who started the mister english  and
miss english competition also in the department 
""
""
yeah 
""
""
isn't it so ?
""
""
isn't it 
""
""
okay so now   i'll  start up with the fun- fair 
""
the first thing is  what you say  should it be done on a
humanities  department  or a humanities level  as a whole or in 
eng  english department level 
""
""
if you ask my idea i think my opinion is that it should be on
the humanities level  so that  we can know each other 
""
""
yeah thats nice atleast everybody will be  coming together
""
""
so all the departments can come together we can just enjoy
have fun 
""
""
yeah that will be gutsy imagine  eleven department one hand
  oh  on one ground 
""
""
 oh  
""
""
i am dreaming about that day  laughs 
""
""
yeah but the thing is the first problem what i think we may
face is  the money 
""
""
yeah
""
""
because for any good thing and any bit thing you need cash on
your hands
""
""
so i think you have to plan it all 
""
""
yeah  in fact i i just let me know because i am new around
here so i don't know 
""
is it possible for the department to  dish out some money or
something 
""
""
ah yeah   it's  possible we can talk with maya 
ma'am  
""
""
yeah we can  otherwise we also have a i think 
department of social welfare  which can give us money
""
""
yeah yeah yeah  otherwise we can go for any sponsorship
 archies hallmark they sponsor so they can sponsor
""
""
but what will be the conditions  and what are we supposed
to   offer them 
""
""
 nothing conditions   i think uh 
""
""
okay like we can always talk about them  we can talk to
them if they are not charging going to charge or something very
""
""
okay  let's  see i will talk with them  and let you
know
""
""
okay  and as for the stalls 
""
you know one of the stall ideas i have is a  request stall 
""
""
request stall i did not get it 
""
""
i will tell you what a request stall is 
""
you are supposed to have a music system on your stall  that will
be only system and or  that is the only stall where you are supposed to
play  play music for the whole of the fun-fair 
""
""
   ok  
""
""
 you   can have a  may be forty songs on the
list 
""
""
i think  request songs is it ?
""
""
yeah request song it is and anybody paying you  the amount
you play their song for them 
""
for them or for their  people around or something like  
that 
""
""
 okay    so we can get money also i think 
laughs 
""
""
yes you can earn
""
see the basic thing of fun-fair will be one of this that we will be
coming together 
""
""
  okay 
""
""
 secondly   any fun-fair has to end in profit or in
 pour  income 
""
""
yeah i think it   is yeah 
""
""
 it is   very difficult for a  fun-fair to end
up in a loss 
""
""
yeah yeah we have to consider the monetary part also
""
""
yeah monitory part is there but then again  some other
stalls 
""
can you think of some other stall  ?
""
can you think of some other stall  archana  ?
""
""
i think you better think  laughs  
""
""
may be okay what do you say about an eats  you should have
something   to  eat upon also
""
""
 eats  
""
""
yeah eatables i think   samosas  will do
""
""
""
 samosas  yeah  that's  not a bad idea
then   the chips 
""
""
 because   they are  chi  uh cheap also 
""
""
yeah chips can be there 
""
""
yeah 
""
""
and you can charge the double amount for them 
""
""
i am getting hungry 
""
""
same here  laughter  but  yaar  we have
to talk about it you know
""
you have to talk about  this and tell to the other classmates
also 
""
you have to take their  yeses  and 
noes  also
""
""
i think sonali  you are the right person to take the
initiative 
""
""
okay  let's  see that but uh  and the next stall at
but of course about double your money 
""
i know  it's  a sort of gamble in the university campus 
 but 
""
""
 i think   you should explain this thing 
""
""
yeah but  diwali  is there  come on 
diwali  is supposed to be a bit of gamble a bit of  paisa
  money here and money there you know 
""
""
so we can have a  chakli  stall also 
laughs 
""
""
you   may 
""
""
 like    diwali  stall 
""
""
yeah we can have it  but in fact for double your money it
is always like uhn  you can have a car race stall 
""
""
okay
""
""
that you through the dices and the   person  who
reaches at next end  the earliest  the person  earns double the
money    so  if at one time you are getting ten people on
your stall  you pay one person twenty bucks and still you have  i
think ninety bucks on your hand  or   okay  eighty bucks on your
hand
""
""
 okay  
""
""
 okay  
""
""
 okay  
""
""
 it's  really a good idea i think 
""
anything new  ?
""
""
the new thing may be  we may have a dance floor or
something 
""
""
yeah i think rain dance 
""
""
yeah rain dance   laughter  but from where the
water is going to come 
""
""
we can go outside   it's  raining  laughter 
""
""
 that's  not a bad idea at all  but then we can
always have something of uh  you know what they call that lucky draw 
you   know 
""
""
 okay   yeah yeah 
""
again we can have miss personality mister personality 
""
""
yeah and we have a miss rose too 
""
""
yeah
""
""
how come there is no mister rose around  why is always
there is a miss rose you know 
""
""
i think we  this time we will conduct a mister rose
competition also  laughs  
""
""
uh mister rose competition
""
""
yeah 
""
""
not a bad idea at all 
""
""
the most handsome boy will get the award 
""
""
yeah  and the most beautiful girl will get the award 
""
""
oh
""
""
that is the person who gets the maximum number of roses from
the people   around 
""
""
 i wish   i could get the award 
""
""
ahn  that has to be seen  there can be many competitors
at that time you know  but the thing is we have to let all the department
in the university know about it 
""
 in  infact the people  outside the department also 
may be the colleges or something 
""
""
yeah we can popularise it to the newspaper  t v media like
the cable   news 
""
""
 that   is going to be an expensive 
""
the thing can be  you can have some  what you call the
notices  and then  just go and  just put them up in the colleges 
the different departments of the university physics department is there 
you don't have any interaction with the people from that department 
""
""
yeah yeah yeah 
""
""
chemistry department the geography department is also there
""
""
i think we can make it on the university level also like 
all other departments  excluding uh including the humanities and also the
science  computer this thing we can include all of them 
""
""
but then that will consume lots of time and after december
 please no more  active    activities only 
""
""
 i know   studies are there
""
""
studies are there 
""
this is m a part two with final year 
""
and after this i will be thanking god like anything if i just
complete this m a with good marks 
""
""
sonali don't worry  you'll  complete it 
""
""
i hope  i really hope
""
i scored pretty good marks in my first year  but i don't know
what is going to happen in second year 
""
""
you will score  yaar  believe in god  work
hard 
""
""
hey speaking of this uh  m a and what do you plan to do
after m a  ?
""
""
now  let's  see   i'll  just finish my m a
 and then god knows 
""
""
god knows are you planning to get married or something 
""
""
i don't know probably may be   laughs 
""
""
may be of course  fifty percent of the class girls will be
  married by the  time m a completes up 
""
anyway i  i have in fact planned about  doing i a s now
""
my parents   wanted  it  and in fact first i was
thinking of becoming a lecturer only  but then something happened and now
 i am going to sit for i a s
""
""
 married yeah  
""
""
 vow  
""
""
i think you can be a lecturer   better 
""
""
 yeah   that is  it is a job  and it is the
profession i love 
""
i love to teach  but   let's  see what happen in the
future  mean net and set are to big hurdles that are standing in the way
   in  i a s also    similar  one word 
""
""
""
 oh  
""
""
 but they   are   channel uh  
challenged   i think you can accept the challenge 
""
""
i can   let's  hope god is on my side and we
compete in a  proper way 
""
and what about you like  you are doing a computer course
now-a-days
""
""
yeah  right now i am doing my computer course so  so
after the m a i think i better do my computers  continue my computers 
""
""
continue your computers and what about the job  or
something
""
""
job  let's  see 
""
i have my own school like my aunty has my school so i can work
over there 
""
""
you worked before somewhere 
""
""
no sorry 
""
""
i worked for two months with a private firm and it was one
good experience you know
""
""
so you have to give a party i think pending  laughs 
""
""
god why do all these people just go for party  yaar
 you never asked    before 
""
""
 because   you have got your own money
""
""
i had it i spent it i have blown it up  laughs 
""
""
this is not fair sonali
""
""
it is  it is  in fact it was a good experience the
confidence i have in me now    to handle  different kind of
people 
""
i mean people can be rude if they want to be  and they can be
very sweet  if again they want to be
""
""
 yeah yeah  
""
""
i think now-a-days everyone needs exposure 
""
""
everyone   needs 
""
""
 isn't   it  ?
""
""
yes 
""
that is why i am sometimes surprise to see the girls out here 
like when we have a welcome function  i was the only girl who danced 
two words  you know and rest of the girls  okay there were another
two of them who were going to sing or something  but  you you ask them
to do a  group activity maybe a group dance or song none of them come
forward
""
i don't know why do they have this inhibitions about themselves
""
""
""
you know sonali i always dream that i i could dance like you
""
""
""
thanks a lot for the compliment 
""
""
 it's  a god given gift i think 
""
""
thank you so much  but this is
""
""
which is i can only do i think  ganpati  dance
 laughter 
""
""
that is also true art there you know  to dance like a god
""
""
but in fact i feel  i feel sometimes very bad when i see my own
 friends   gi  girl friends
""
""
oh oh oh
""
""
i don't have any boy friends don't look at me like that
""
""
oh oh wondering are you telling the truth  laughter 
""
""
yes  a proper truth 
""
in fact it is very  sometimes it is very hurting to see them
just sitting there like  somebody should go to them and then  they
should be told to do something   no initiative 
""
""
 i think   they need exposure  thats the 
lack  they are lacking it
""
""
yeah that is why i  wish all of them should work atleast
for two months  on hand  and they should come to see the world properly
""
""
the feel of your money on your hand is very different 
""
""
yeah yeah 
""
""
it is
""
""
i am dreaming about it 
""
""
yeah we can just dream 
""
