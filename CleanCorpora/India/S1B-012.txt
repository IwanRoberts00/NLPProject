""

what is his attitude  to  having  moralising  ?
""
you will find the answer  in this prose 
""
when i was a very small boy  i was made to learn by heart 
certain of the fable of  la fontaine 
""
and the moral of this was carefully  explained to me 
""
among those  i learnt was the ant and the grasshopper  which
is devised  to bring home  to the young  the usefulnesses  that
 an    im     imperfect   world 
industry is rewarded  and  greedyness  punished 
""
it is  the meaning of fable 
""
my apology  for telling something  when everyone in politely
but inexactly  supposed to know  the ant  spends a laborious summer
 gathering its winter store while  the grasshopper sings on a bale of
grass  singing to the sun 
""
winter comes and the ant is comfortably  provided for  but
the grasshopper has an empty larder 
""
he goes to the ant  and begs for a little food 
""
then the ant gives him  a classic answer 
""
what were you doing in the summer time  ?
""
saving your presence  i sang all day  all night 
""
you sang  why then go and dance 
""
i don't ascribe it  to perversity on my part  but rather to
the habit of childhood  which is deficient in moral sense  that i could
never quite see those advantage to the lesson
""
my sympathies were with the grasshopper  and for some time  i
never saw an ant  without putting my foot on it 
""
in this summary  and as i have discovered since entirely human
fashion  i sought to express my disapproval of prudence and common sense
""
""
i could not help thinking of this fable when the other day i saw
 george ramsay  lunching by himself in a restaurant 
""
i never saw anyone  wore an expression of such  deep gloom
""
""
he was staring into space 
""
he looked as though the burden of the whole world fell on his
shoulders  shoulders 
""
i was sorry for him 
""
i suspected at once  that his unfortunate brother  has been
causing trouble again 
""
i went up to him  and held out my hand 
""
take down the difficult words 
""
you read out the words

""
""
the ant and the grasshopper  it  is a fable 
""
fable means a short story which deals with the animal  and it
gives us a moral 
""
so fable  the ant and the grasshopper it is based on and is
famous  and it also teaches the moral  that one must work hard 
and  one   will   should   save for the  future
""
""
so this moral we will get from this lesson the ant and the
grasshopper 
""
it is written by the famous british writer somerset maugham 
""
the famous british writer somerset maugham  he deals with a very
 conscientious and prudent  elder brother  and a happy go lucky
younger brother in this story 
""
so we have two brothers  which is  one is very careful
prudent  and conscientious very honest  and another is  very
carefree  happy go lucky
""
they are the two brothers in this story 
""
why does he refer to the fable  ?
""
what is his attitude  to  having  moralising  ?
""
you will find the answers in it
""
so  first the writer has given  the fable  the story 
about the ant and the grasshopper 
""
when i was a very small boy i was made to learn  by heart 
certain of the fables of  la fontaine  is  a french poet and the
scholar 
""
and the moral of this  was carefully explained to me 
""
among those i learnt was ant and the grasshopper  which is
devised  to bring home to the young  the usefulness  that in an 
imperfect world industry is rewarding 
""
 it's  always hardwork industry means hardwork  it is
rewarding
""
if you do the hardwork you will get the prize which is a reward 
""
and  greedyness  is punished 
""
 greedyness   irresponsible behaviour in this parable 
""
if you do you will be punished in this world 
""
so this is the moral of this lesson 
""
it is a reasonable fable  the ant  spends the laborious
summer  gathering its winter store 
""
so throughout the summer season  the ant worked  very hard
and gathered  its food for the winter season 
""
while the grasshopper  it   sit   sits   on
a bale of grass and  is  singing to the sun 
""
so instead of doing the work  grasshopper  in vain  waste
the whole time in singing  instead of doing the work 
""
while the grasshopper sits on a bale of grass singing to the sun
 winter comes and the ant is comfortably provided for  but the
grasshopper has an empty larder 
""
larder  the room where the food is kept 
""
so the ant  it  has full  of  larder  whereas the
 grasshopper's  is empty 
""
he goes to the ant and begs for a little food 
""
see what the ant says  the ant says
""
then the ant gives him  a classic answer
""
there is a traditional answer 
""
what were you doing in the summer time  ?
""
she is not ready  to give food   for   to  
the grasshopper 
""
then the grasshopper answers  saving your presence  i
sang all day all night  
""
so throughout the day and night  the grasshopper   
waste   wastes   his time  in singing 
""
you sang  why  then go and dance 
""
so like this the ant gave the answer 
""
she is not ready to give the food  to the grasshopper 
""
i don't ascribe this 
""
so here the writer refers to the story  i don't ascribe this to
perversity on my part  but rather to the habit of childhood  which is
deficient in moral sense 
""
so this story  it is lack of moral sense  in his childhood
 that i couldn't  never first reconcile myself to the lesson 
""
so which is moral of the lesson  the author  is not agreeing
""
""
my sympathies were with the grasshopper  and for sometime  i
never saw an ant without putting my foot on it 
""
so here the  writer has a big sympathy for the grasshopper 
not for the ant 
""
so this reference   we'll  get in the story  of this
reference 
""
why the author showed the sympathy to the grasshopper  ?
""
my sympathies were with the grasshopper and for sometime  i
never saw an ant without putting my foot on it 
""
in this  a few words   i sought to express my
disapproval of prudence and common sense 
""
so he is not agreeing  about the  prudence that he could not
""
""
it was not being careful  that is a prudence 
""
i could not help thinking for this fable when the other day  i
saw george ramsay  lunching by himself in a restaurant 
""
so in this story there are two brothers  one is george ramsay
and another is  tom ramsay 
""
so next day the writer  saw george ramsay  in restaurant 
""
i never saw anyone wear an expression of such deep  gloom 
""
so he was in very  sad mood 
""
he was staring into space  or looking to the sky 
""
he looked as if the  the burden of the whole world fell on his
 shoulders 
""
i was sorry for him  i suspected at once  that his
unfortunate brother has been causing trouble again 
""
so he was worried about his younger brother tom ramsay 
""
i went upto him and held out  my hand 
""
so who are the two brothers  ?
""
