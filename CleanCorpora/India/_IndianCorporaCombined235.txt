hello i am tabussum khan and i love cooking  but cooking is not such a minor job as some people make it out to be take for example the simple act of boiling an egg  if you don't know how to do it properly you can make a mess  yuk if you want to avoid a mess like this then you must know some basic facts about eggs  remember what you learnt at school ? just inside this shell there is a membrane called the outer shell membrane  and at one end of the egg usually the broader end there is an air space enclosed by the outer shell membrane and the inner shell membrane  now when you heat an egg this air space expands  and if you heat it rapidly the air space expands rapidly since the volume is uh restricted by the shell the shell cracks  and the contents leak out  and this is the result  now if you heat the egg slowly using a low flame then the air inside the air space expands slowly  the outer shell membrane is made up of methastheracin  protein the kind which you find in our skins and the air can escape out of the membrane towards the shell  the shell is calcium carbonate and it has very fine pores  the air can escape through these pores outside  let me demonstrate demonstrates  notice may i am not taking too much of water than is needed to immerse the egg  if there is too much of water then the convection current can take the egg up and down hitting it against the sides of the vessel  that can also lead to the cracking of the shell  now a slow flame and a long wait music  the problem with this method is that it takes a very long time to have a hard boiled egg music  now if i want to go to college in the morning i would definitely get late  so i have learnt a simple trick music  first i determine the approximate position of the air space inside the egg  then using a sharp pin i make a tiny hole in the shell  just on top of the air space  now i can get a hard boiled egg very fast music  the natural pores of the egg are too tiny compared to the hole that i have made and all the air can escape through that hole the result is a perfectly egg shaped egg when i feel it  music  notice the difference in the shape of these two eggs  the flatness of the egg where there was an air space is not present in this one  aesthetically more pleasing isn't it ? so there is no point in looking at the beauty of these eggs  unless we can eat them  and sometimes i find it very difficult to eat an egg  because of the smell  it reminds you of the chemistry laboratory which keeps apparatus and the horrible smell of hydrogen sulphide  usually it's a rotten egg which smell of hydrogen sulphide but if after boiling it if you leave the egg in hot water  even a fresh egg can smell of hydrogen sulphide  to understand this phenomenon we must look into the contents  of the egg white music  the egg white is not actually white in colour until you boil or cook it  it is transparent and consists mainly of a globular protein called albumin  protein as we know it is a long chain of amino-acids  among the twenty odd amino acids which are normally found in protein there are three which have sulphur in them cystin  cystine and methionine  when the long chain of amino-acids folds on itself to form the globular tertiary structure quite a few hydrogen bond and a few s s bonds help to stabilize the structure  when we heat the albumin these bonds are broken  the protein settles out and undergoes what is known as denaturation some of the s s bonds are also broken down and ultimately form  h 2 s which gives you that typical smell  the denatured protein then cross to into each other  and cogulate  this is how the albumin becomes white and opaque  the tendency of the liberated h 2 s is to move towards cooler areas that is towards the center of the egg where it comes into contact with the yolk and reacts with the metallic irons of the yolk to form a green coloured salt  thus the yolk gets a coat of green  personally i don't like the egg to smell nor do i like it to be green  so i'll tell you a simple trick to avoid both these problems music  as soon as the egg is boiled take it out of hot water and put it into cold water  and as i told you before the tendency of the liberated h 2  s is to diffuse towards cooler areas  so now instead of moving towards the center of the egg it will move out of the egg  so there will be no bad smell and no green coloured yolk  the problems arise only when you leave the egg in hot water now we come to the last problem of dealing with hard boiled egg  the difficulty in peeling  sometimes along with the egg shell the egg white also seems to come out  actually this does not happen with all the eggs  usually it comes up very easily  this only happens if you have a fresh egg  the solution to this problem is simple  do not hard boil a fresh egg  the intermolecular forces between the shell membrane and the egg white are stronger in fresh egg  within two three days of laying these bonds become weaker so if you want to have a hard boiled egg choose an older egg   music  but if you want a fried egg it's better to go in for fresh egg  the intermolecular forces are stronger in fresh eggs  so you get a more compact looking fried egg  and if you use an older egg it tends to thin out into the pan and run and it becomes difficult to handle when you are turning it  so boil or scramble an older egg  i suppose we talked about fried egg the boiled egg the scrambled egg and the list is more than completed if we add omelette to it  music  the delicacy or the softness of an omelette may depend on how much of froth you manage to make when beating it  the method of beating the egg or the technology may contribute to the frothiness  but more important is that vessel in which you are beating the egg  i have cleaned this vessel very well with soapened water to remove all the grease from it  and in another vessel i apply a light coat of oil now i take two egg from the same batch of eggs that i received  from the poultry farm this morning meaning that the age of both the eggs is the same  now watch beating the egg  notice there is not too much of froth in this vessel with the coat of oil in it whereas in this one there is a lot of froth  why ? in the physics classes at school we have learnt about surface tension  bubbles are more easily formed in water if we add soap to it  because soap produces the surface tension of water  if we apply this principle of surface tension to this phenomenon  you have solved another practical problem in your kitchen  oil increases the surface tension so it is really necessary to clean the vessel thoroughly  before you beat the egg that is if you want a really soft omelette  in this programme we have eaten boiled eggs fried eggs scrambled eggs eggs made into an omelette  but i am sure we will have indigestion if we have any more of this stuff  so let me conclude this programme by merely mentioning the mouth watering delicacies in which eggs are used  caramel custard pasteries cake meonade and a lot of these delicious stuff  and i'm sure a song in the praise of egg would include the voices to the from some of us who are vegetarian  but you wouldn't mind eating a so called vegetarian egg  a vegetarian egg is nothing else than unfertilised egg  there is of course no difference in taste between a fertilised egg and an unfertilised egg music  hi rajan  hi  how are you ? fine   kya hua again you have got pain in your  yeah shoulder base and neck   yeah  yeah it's paining  lal sahab this is my brother rajan  hello jee  hello nice meeting you   in hindi i think because of prolonged driving throughout the day he is driving around  do you think you have any simple exercises for people who do a lot of driving ?
