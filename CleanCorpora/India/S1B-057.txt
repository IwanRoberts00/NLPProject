emerging optimism  and this optimism  is basically
because of the policies of the government 
""
a response  by the people  of our country 
""
the indian community has a great sense of patriotism and tolerance
 and we have to struggle hard 
""
our late  prime minister our leader   smt 
indiraji gandhi has said  i quote   strength never comes from
the comfort of smooth path  but from the most sterness  of the efforts
 unquote 
""
honourable president in his address there are sixth state situation
in jammu and kashmir i think
""
that is quite sufficient  a warning to the pakistan and the 
united states  of america not to  fear   interfere in the
matters of jammu and kashmir 
""
and not to teach us  the human rights 
""
it is that i must say  that  a minor national minorities
finance development corporation has been set up  and five hundred 
crores  are kept for the development of minorities 
""
and a new  wakf  bill  nineteen ninety-three
will definitely help  in deciding the matters of  wakf 
""
""
with this  the development of the poor  by way of 
 jawahar rozgar yojna   for i r d p  employment
assurance scheme  mahila samrudhi yojna   
safai karmacharya   they are the  main  milestones  in
the development of our  poor and  down-trodden people 
""
let us be proud of all the men and women who are doing their best
in building our nation 
""
we are approaching twenty-first century  and twenty-first
century will be of  the honesty the integrity the accountability the
productivity  and the quality also 
""
and we intend to pursue all our efforts to produce  more oil 
more electricity  more fertilisers  more foodgrains  and more of the
basic needs of our people 
""
our government and our political system  are strong enough 
technologically and otherwise  not to allow our self- reliance  to be
mortgaged outside by an outside funds 
""
so friends we must come  together we should march ahead for the
self-reliance 
""
we should call little operation forward  faster and forward

shri pawan kumar bansal 
""
""
sir  in an ambience of  widely present chaos  and
lack of self-confidence  that permeated the national thought  when the
present government  took over the responsibility 
""
it was a doubting task  particularly as a minority government
 to rebuild  brick by brick  in situations that least settled
""
""
rejuvenate the economy  that was in a shamble  and regain
 practice in the  comedy  of nations  that was its lowest at
its lowest ebb then 
""
in june nineteen ninety-one  there was a frightening question
mark  mocking at us  about the future of india 
""
a resolute endeavour  was steadly transforming that into a ray
of hope  when suddenly  a cataclysmic event  on sixth of december
nineteen  ninety-two  threw the nation  in the throes of 
communal  two words  
""
with the fall of  the mosque  dangers of equating democracy
 with the tyranny of group  ascerting or claiming to act on behalf of
the majority  religious communities  became real 
""
this  cast a telling impacts  not only on  india's 
honour  but also our economy 
""
clouds of uncertainity started hovering  for the economic
reforms  initiated  one word  by the present government 
""
the foreign investors  grew doubtful about the  disability
 of investing in a country  which was  in the whirlpool of 
communal  unrest 
""
it was  with this uncertain  and  unpleasant prospect
 that we entered  the year under review 
""
the deliberate  and concerted effect from forces from within
and across the borders  to destabilise the country  only strengthen
the resolve of the prime minister  to fight that  with greater vigour
""
""
the people also extended support  in ample measure 
""
sir today  with  congress   attaining
majority in this house  these reckless moves  which we have witnessed
over the last two and a half years  and which gave  a friend on the
other side some false hopes  have been given  a fitting burial 
""
and the subsequent event  has started getting results 
""
the prime  minister's  recent visit  to germany  and
about the  switzerland  was a resounding success 
""
with the brightening up of  the investment climate in our
country  offers for economic tie-up  are pouring in faster than never
before 
""
the government on its part  has made it a  two words 
 but the changes under way  do not and will not  tinkle with the
basic postulates of a mixed economy  and that none in the country 
would be adversely affected thereby   noise 
""
fears and strength on behalf of the workers     a few
words    two words   seem to be only stimulated for
critical purposes 
""
all ventures are rather intended to create greater 
opportunities for the people to improve  their living conditions 
""
sir  a natural outcome of  the sober and mature leadership
provided to the country by shri p v narasimha rao  has dealt that our
stock has risen in the international community 
""
a position that kashmir  is an integral part of india  is
once again appreciated by a  very large number of countries  and 
pakistans'  efforts  to rake up the matter in the international meet
 have been tactfully   one word   and  defeaed 
""
so the president has unequivocally  expressed the feeling of
the issue  as also a determination to safeguard  the integrity  of
the nation  and our preparedness to meet  two words  
""
when we take over  we at the same time do wish to express  a
feeling of most cordial relations  with the people of pakistan  with
whom we have much in common 
""
we hold our ground firmly on issues like kashmir  non-
proliferation treaty  as a need to face the united nation security
council 
""
terrorism  and tenets of the factionalism  has been met
remarkably in  punjab  and the government is determined to fight it
 resolutely in any part of the country 
""
donning the robes of  a prosecutor  shri jaswant singhji
 charged the government  and he was uncredible using the word charge
again and again sir 
""
he charged the government for not raising hazrat bal shrine  so
that  the tact and patience  with which the government dealt with the
issue  has been applauded all over the world 
""
and who can deny the perceptible improvement in the situation
thereafter 
""
sir but it causes agony  to our friend there  because it has
deprived them  of an opportunity  to bake  the political  cake
 on the fire of communal frenzy 
""
sir  we have today charted a boat  which would  intends
to take india  to the forefront of international community 
""
and our confidence  our faith in doing so  eminent from our
 one word   to change with continuity 
""
we are proud of our past  and have duplicit faith in the future
""
""
we believe  in  honouring  difference of opinion 
""
we believe  that national issues  should be addressed to
 in a  spirit of  understanding and co-operation 
""
sir  if  it is narrow political considerations  which
dominate our thinking on every score  i am afraid  certain goals which
we wish to achieve  may not become unachievable  but our  struggle
in achieving those would become a little adverse one  and if it becomes
adverse  the government headed by  shri  narasimha raoji
 would remain undeterred 
""
he would remain unflinching in his determination  to achieve
those goals 
""
  a few words     
""
indrajit gupta 
""
""
we were discussing the budget just now 
""
with the great uh  uh  incentives which have been provided
by the finance minister for the  uh unrestricted growth of  of the
private sector  both domestic private sector as well as foreign investors
""
""
i am afraid this growth of black money  will be further
accelerated  leading to more and more corruption 
""
this is a sort of encouragement to what we should call financial
criminality 
""
corruption is too  mild term 
""
in some countries it is referred to it as financial criminality 
""
that is what is being fostered now in our country 
""
the  president's  address madam  has consciously 
consciously or unconsciously i don't know whoever prepared the address 
obviously did it consciously  has blacked out  all reference to this
 spreading cancer  and has given no indication of the type of people
who are indulging  or who are in the position to indulge  in this kind
of  financial criminality 
""
so on the twenty-nineth of january  a front page  news item
 has appeared in one of our leading dailies  namely  the
statesman  
""
giving a list of forty-two  people  belonging to different
parties  who are alleged to have been funded 
""
i  the same people the same group of people  who had uh
 been used by the  isi   to fund the 
hizbul mujahideen   and the accused in the bombay  bomblasts
""
""
i don't know what is the political connection i can't uh 
easily find it out 
""
but anyway  this is a case there in the supreme court now
pending 
""
their names are given in this news item along with  the amounts
of money which they are alleged to have received 
""
among that  uh major  number of people come from the
 congress party   than uh  from also from  the
 bjp   also from the  janata dal 
 also from the  janata dal samajwadi   fewer fewer
 the bulk of the names are from the  congress party 
""
""
sir these are all honourable gentlemen 
""
most of them are members of parliament some have been ministers
some are presently minister  and uh i think that a paper which 
publishes this kind of  serious type of allegation  should either be
proceeded against by way of defamation proceedings  in the court which has
not been done 
""
or atleast the people who are named among these forty-two 
should have come out publicly with some  denial or some contradiction 
which has not been done 
""
i neither know whether this allegations are correct or can be
correct or not 
""
but what is surprising me is you see a news report like this 
had created quite a lot of  uh sensation  and pendomonium among the
public who read these papers 
""
but no contradictions denials or  defamation case or anything is
coming 
""
so this is very curious  it seems to me 
""
and i want to draw the attention to this house that  the
honourable members concerned  should really be more serious about this
and take uh  whatever necessary action they feel they should take 
""
but nothing has been done 
""
so my point is  interruption   that these  these
cases will go on multiplying 
""
not because of any individuals  proclamities because of what i
said there is a economic and social forces are operating 
""
black money is at the root of it  and black money is leading to
proliferation of this  type of corruption 
""
and the more that spreads  people are thinking that well so many
people   two words   whether mps or ministers or anybody else
 must have  got  also got something to do with this corruption
""
is that good for the future of our country  ?
""
so i am saying that this is a matter which everybody  should
take seriously 
""
the  president's  address doesn't  say anything about
these things
""
it doesn't  say anything
""
it doesn't even mention  a big event which took place in 
last year  in ninety-three  a very big event  which was the scam
 the banking scam 
""
is it just a small trivial matter  ?
""
is there no mention about it  ?
""
you could say that such a thing happened we set-up a  joint
parliamentary committee  the joint parliamentry committee  two words
 do it they have uh  submitted their report and  the uh  prime
minister has assured parliament that  a follow up action will be taken
against people who are guilty and all that 
""
there is no mention of the fact  that eight thousand 
crores   or may be more twelve thousand  crores 
some people say 
""
the bofors is chicken feed compare to this 
""
bofors was only some sixty sixty-five  crores  
""
eight thousand to twelve thousand  crores  
which was  public's  money deposited in the banks 
""
why do public put money in the banks  ?
""
because they believe that it is in safe custody when it is in the
banks 
""
in small people also pensioners  small people put money in the
banks 
""
but if  thousands of  crores  of  rupees
  you see  is  goes away from the back door  the 
banks'   one word   virtue of a nexus  between brokers 
bankers  the businessmen  and so many types of people who are in nexus
with each other
""
that money is funnelled out  siphoned out from the bank 
""
in order to go and  put money in the hands of these
speculators on the  stock market  stock exchange 
""
is it a small matter ?
""
such a thing never happened in our country before  and it 
 is   has   affected mainly the public sector banking
system 
""
the nationalised banks  about which indira gandhi has spoken
at the time of nationalisation  that these are going to be the real
commanding heights of the economy 
""
now what what is happening  ?
""
so  there is no mention  in the  president's 
address
""
so how can i thank him for this address i don't know  which
completely  avoids any mention of these things 
""
and what fate will other committees have  ?
""
if the j p c  is  report is dealt with like this 
""
when the debate took place here in this house  some people were
doing their best to  denigrate  such a report to dilute it and to say
which is not of much consequence 
""
so what will be the fate of other committees ?
""
what will be the fate of these uh  uh standing committees
which are now operating  which are also formed on an all-party basis 
""
what will happen to their reports and their   recommends
  recommendations  
""
no body will bother about 
""
see  it's  part of our system isn't it ?
""
 it's  part of our parliamentary system 
""
it all depends how you look at it how much you  respect those
 institutions and how far you are prepared to  carry out what they say
or not 
""
we are in a parliamentary form of government
""
if you want to have some other form of government of course it is
different matter 
""
but so long as this country has been commited to the parliamentary
democracy form of government multi-party system based on adult franchise 
so long you cannot escape what is called parliamentary accountability 
""
 thats'  the  big  biggest and only surviving super
power in the world today  is deliberately trying to  fish in troubled
waters  in kashmir  and their spokesman have been coming out with so
many statements which are patently  anti-indian  anti-indian
sovereignity 
""
i believe mr chavan has said something quite   was 
right  about this yesterday
""
if  i'm  correct then i congratulate him for that 
""
and uh  it would have been better  if the  president's
 address had also  you see  included something about this 
because i want to point out one thing it is not correct that will be wrong to
think  that what they what the americans are raking up is only a question
of human rights  violation of human rights 
""
 that's  only one aspect of it 
""
they are talking about a civil war  they say civil war is
going on  in kashmir 
""
in his   addressed   address   to the general
assembly of the united nations the president clinton has said it  that
conditions of civil war  are developing in kashmir 
""
civil war is a term which has a  specific meaning
