""
that  i'm  same we are working in same place
 
""

""
""
but there are so many different problems and so many different

""
 nai     that's  not a problem
""
""
""
 and no she came   from different background i came
from another background    uh 
""
but still on some problem specially women problem   
 haan   this is the very current and controversial issue in
this country    uhm  we know
""
but considering that point our views are equal our views are
similar i think    uhm 
""
so uh 
""
let us talk on anything because we are friends in that context 
  uh 
""
so  uh for let us start from this department    uhm
""
""
here uh  you are teaching so many papers no ?
""
so out of that which paper do you like to teach more ?
""
""
 uh  
""
""
  haan   
""
""
 uhm  
""
""
 uhm  
""
""
 uh  
""
""
 uhm  
""
""
i want to like because uh my specialisation in modern india
""
""
uhm
""
""
and i want to  study it and i want to  dis  discover
out some research work  on the modern indian history    uhm 
mainly on the  uh problems of women
""
and recently there was some uh women problems and there is uh women
policy  uh that is uh declared by government of maharashtra
""
and there are so many problems related to the village woman
particularly
""
and these women  uh village women are not knowing anything about
it
""
now because of it
""
""
 uhm  
""
""
just just a minute
""
""
uhm
""
""
uh   i'm  interested to know whether in your
syllabus the paper which you are teaching    uhm  modern indian
history  is there any topic which has been  uh recommended  
 uhm  by the committee  specially based on women problems ?
""
""
 uhm  
""
""
 uhm  
""
""
yes
""
there are  a  all in all indian history from ancient to
modern    yes  there are one topic    uhm  in
every paper
""
in ancient indian history in medieval indian history in the  uh
peshwa period or we can say in maratha period    yes yes  and
also in the  uh modern indian history
""
but in modern indian history specially it was concentrated that is
their development and social movement in nineteen century women problem in
maharashtra all over india
""
in bengal movement and there was young  one word  movement
coming from england
""
and the rajaram mohan roy   it's  progress
""
and then he was discussing  thinking his views  on that
""
and that  uh  topic is here in the modern indian history
""
""
 yes  
""
""
 uhm  
""
""
 yes yes  
""
""
okay it means you think that as the topic has been included
here 
""
so our students they will learn
""
they will come to know about the problems of women in india 
  uh 
""
but do you think that these  uh problem of indian women
especially    uh 
""
it has its roots right from ancient period because   i'm 
teaching ancient indian history
""
and  i'm  interested in it
""
so when we start from the age of vedas    uhm  or
more than that if we  uh goes back to much earlier period no doubt 
indian history goes back to much earlier period 
""
but right from the age of  ri  rigveda  i have ample
truth that the status of women or the position of women  uh it has been
fixed  uh
""
 manhje  though the people say  that in the age
of rigveda we don't get secondary status of  women or like that  but i
don't agree with them 
""
 manhje  though there are references to 
gadgi  and    maitreyi  and 
""
so many women   those who are   uh  tho 
those  uh got the opportunity to learn
""
but apart from that  in uh considering with vedic sacrifices and
all other things i feel that status of women was secondary
""
and vedic age was  a base  manhje  when we come
to modern indian history or modern    civi uh   how
complex is history
""
""
 uh  
""
""
 uh  
""
""
 uhm  
""
""
  maitri yeah   
""
""
  women's  status  
""
""
 no that was uh  
""
""
medieval indian history also
""
""
yeah
""
""
because of the invasion of the moghals
""
""
no i know very little about   medieval period 
""
""
 during that time   also there was also supression
of woman because of the that  that is the invasion of  moghals  in
india and that was mainly on in north india  because  they invaded
south afghanistan and  two words  because that impact was on north
india mainly
""
that was not in south india
""
so there was  so many other societies which were women  apart
from other field
""
no doubt there are some impact on all religions on caste and on
this religion
""
they  were  started the  purdah  system 
uhm not giving exhibition to the women  and during that in the home only
not giving outside them permission  to go outside
""
that was the same thing in medieval period
""
and when there was started modern indian history and then new ideas
came from  west 
""
therefore some impact in the thinking of our individual that who
were taken the modern indian education  that is not english education
""
and because of there was something strange in nineteen century
""
and that was concentrated in our syllabus only
""
""
okay in this way  we have added all these things in our
syllabus    uhm  that our student  manhje  
  uhm  our syllabus had been constructed in this manner
""
that right from ancient period  to modern period the students
should have a link    link   manhje 
""
""
 uhm  
""
""
 uhm  
""
""
 link  
""
""
what is the development of  one's 
""
""
 haan  when we talk on once
""
""
 haan 
""
when we talk on or linking between the development   of
women  from ancient to modern  till now 
""
and they have concentrated
""
they have to work on that research or anything
""
or thinking because  uh historian  or any man living in this
time thinking about the ancient period and he is linking the scene between
the  things happened on the human behaviour
""
or the development of human behaviour 
""
that is most important thing also 
""
""
 yeah yeah  
""
""
no considering    uhm  this syllabus we are 
  uhm  uhm quite satisfied    uhm  but  uh have
you seen recently the various types of advertisements on the t v   and
""
""
""
 uhm  
""
""
 uhm  
""
""
 uhm  
""
""
 there   are so many advertisements
""
""
 haan  but considering that  i feel that
 uh we are  deliberately  making     haan 
 the status   of  women secondary
""
""
  haan   
""
""
 women  
""
""
 haan 
""
""
means how the  standard of  uh women has been exposed
there  i don't like this
""
""
that is the commercial purpose no ?
""
in commercial purpose every company or every advertising expose a
bit thinking only benefit of their  product
""
""
 manhje  for every
""
""
and because of that because of they are doing and  we are
permitting them always  because one lady has even that  uh photo copies
no ?
""
""
yeah  manhje 
""
""
that is   why our main impulsion  we are giving we
are also contributing them
""
""
 that is very recently that  
""
""
madhu   sapre  is that
""
""
 indirectly  
""
""
madhu sapre is one of the representative of us 
""
no doubt she is a model
""
""
no after all  laughs 
""
""
but she is representing us no 
""
""
although   expressing 
""
""
 we can't   change    yeah  we can't
change her views  though she afterward thinking about that  i'm 
not doing it purposefully and that is 
""
but that is purpose commercial she wants to acquire money by that
way 
""
""
 yeah  
""
""
look commercial purpose is okay i can understand it
""
but on one side you say  that women lib when we talk of women
liberation and secondary status of women  and on other side we are
allowing them    ah yes  to express to expose
""
""
 ah yes  
""
""
 nai nai  women is permitting them gents
""
""
yeah
""
""
even well they are taking such a poses and such photos if she
denies it 
""
how they were able to take it 
""
""
because if you will look at all the  ac  actresses 
  uhm  mainly marathi actresses they are that mamta kulkarni and
shilpa   shirodkar 
""
""
 uhm  
""
""
 always there   is a rule
""
""
it is a shameful thing i think   manhje 
""
""
it is shameful  laughs  thing but it is
""
""
yeah
""
""
being  men focussed by  men but ladies also giving 
pro  protection by  girls also  that is they want so uh become
something  hero 
""
and because of that they exposing even they themselves only 
""
""
uhm no but  uh what is your experience about your  uh
village ladies and village girls  specially
""
""
uh village girls
""
""
those who are taking education now a days
""
""
no what is the problem
""
""
women
""
""
only then one  uh thinking going on in the  mothers of
that girl  that there are so many  uh    one word  
changes no not changes and because of that my son will marry with educated
person
""
""
 changes  
""
""
okay
""
""
and so she  will take the education
""
that is not another thing because educated  uh  b 
bridegroom want the educated girl because they mostly live in city
""
and there is a a natural feeling in the all girls and also their
mother and family members  in their mind  that there was a  well
behaved educated and there must be  well man must be working in the city
level not in the villages because there are so many problems in villages
""
there are so many they  send that girl in the farm 
""
they don't want no ?
""
because of that each have a feeling going on that  uh girls
must be  given some higher education till their marriage  not for
there  one word  that is wrong  that is not 
""
because  she must marry with doctors so they are permitting
them to go into medical college  for d h m h or b a m a only that one 
""
they are not giving development to their career  that is my
point 
""
""
no but you feel that all these new ideas and this
modernisation in every aspect    uhm   manhje 
not only considering pressure    uhm  because village girls
they are   more modern  they are making quite modern now a days 
  uhm 
""
not like but  uh this modernisation of thinking in that context
i am talking 
""
so whether they  uhm they are well acquainted with these ideas
 because all women are like this
""
""
 uhm  
""
""
 uhm  
""
""
 they are  
""
""
 uhm  
""
""
never never   because there is a lack of  one word
  lack of  rea  reading there are no never they  a book 
though they are  uh matriculate 
""
they never read any paper any book any magazine
""
only they sometime go into the meetings  that is the  uh
some uh   festival 
""
""
 ahm they have t vs and  
""
""
 no uh no but   i think the impact of television
 on a   village woman 
""
""
 television   that is quite high 
""
""
 manhje  at every evening    that
after completion of their 
""
""
 that is not changing in the   thinking ability it
is changing in the only their uh entertainment
 
""
yeah 
""
""
they want entertainment
""
""
 haan 
""
""
  not actually  one word  
""
""
 they just want these movies   and when the news
will start they   will just stop 
""
""
 will stop    haan 
""
""
they will stop the t v
""
""
and they will go for their work in the house
 
""
yes  
""
""
they
""
""
only they will see movies  and dancing programmes  and
other programmes like this some  uh good  family   programme 
""
""
 programme  
""
""
they also thinking about their
""
""
they are  inte  interested   only with this 
""
""
 that is not   emotional feeling  that is
emotional feeling only 
 
""
reading habits must   help  because of the feeling
isn't    yes  what do you think 
""
""
 ah  haan   
""
""
 yes  
""
""
yes uh    uhm  that is why if anyone   that
is a 
""
""
 uhm  
 
""
 uh   
""
""
 easily stopped    na  not in this
context nobody is reading now a days 
""
""
that is not the case with village girls or village women 
in cities also you know  i feel  uh this  uh problem mainly with my
son 
""
now he is in in uh third standard 
""
but  uh just from seven or seven-thirty  he used to sit 
uh with the t v  and used to see the programme every programme  upto
eleven pm 
""
in our village also we have started  uh one uh  personality
development class for some a ten year students  uh in the village but
never the students went there  because he wants only t v 
""
they never goes there 
""
in any  one word  or any social or even they not in this
for playing also 
""
they are their interests are also 
""
""
so this is a common problem
""
""
common problem or 
""
""
 manhje  impact of t v in this  aspect that
is it
""
""
uh
""
""
if it is a good impact  then  ah then we would not
have talked like this 
""
""
yeah
""
and there are so many  english programmes and english movies
and all these things are very nice on the t v after ten 
""
but  uh   they never uh  because they want to go
in the farm   tomorrow  morning and so they   were 
 are   going to sleep at eight  o'clock   laughter 
""
after completing the marathi and other  uh that is a 
provincial movies and all the things 
 
""
 they don't they don't go   
 
""
 yeah   
""
""
but nobody is well acquainted    uhm  with the
 current   problem  of the women again this is my opinion
because  uh day by day when we look at the newspaper  and when we look
at the number  of this dowry cases all these    oh yes 
burning down the girls and burnings of the  women   so  that's
  number is increasing  on one side  and  on another side
  that attraction 
""
""
 uhm  
""
""
 problem  
 
""
 oh yes   
""
""
 and they  
""
""
 and here  
""
""
not only cities but in villages also there are  every
mother wants that she will give more and more to her daughter  in
comparison with others 
""
that is their thinking and because of that they demanding  that
uh from husband that we want to  one word  we have to give it 
because it is our duty 
""
we have we must have satisfaction to our  uh daughter we must
satisfy our daughter 
""
and daughter  is also demanding there is not feeling that my
mother is   fa  father is not he  he's  giving it is not
enough  but they are demanding
