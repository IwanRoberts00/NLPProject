i am told i have coronary artery disease what does it  it actual actually mean ? you see normally your heart requires inadequate supply of blood  right to enable it to perform its function of pumping blood to the body  now this blood it receives through three major arteries  which as you see on this model yeah goes on the surface of the heart  right  when these arteries get blocked the process is known as atherosclerosis  uhm uhm then the blood supply to the heart suffers  and when this occurs during periods of stress the diminished blood supply to the heart manifests as pain  uhm which is called angina  so if one of these vessels were to get suddenly completely blocked  i see  then a portion of the heart muscle would die  oh  and this is called miocardial infarction or in  layman's term a heart attack  and therefore why does this disease occur ? nobody really knows the exact cause for this disease  i see  but medical science has been able to identify certain risk factors which predispose a patient for this disease uhm  of these risk factors one of the important ones is smoking  oh  the other risk factors are diabetes hypertension  a high cholestrol diet belonging to the male sex and a strong family history  for example if your father or brother were to have pulmonary artery disease ahn hn hn then the risk of having this disease is increased   ahn hn hn  how do you confirm that uh an individual has got the disease ? you see initial investigations like a chest x-ray and an e c g ahn ahn which should be performed by a private practitioner would give a clue to the existence of this disease   ahn  but the actual confirmation that one has this disease can be made only by taking recourse to certain sophisticated investigations  ahn ahn   ahn  right  and the first of this is called an exercise electrocardiogram  uhm uhm  in this a continuous record of the patient's  electrocardiogram is taken while he is subjected to graded exercise  right  and this gives us an idea of the capacity of the heart  to cope up with the exercise  right  and if the heart is unable to do so uhm uhm  then this manifests as chest pain or as changes in the electrocardiogram which is recorded uhm uhm or as a rise in the blood pressure   uhm uhm   uhm uhm  nuclear anginography is another recent innovation in modern medicine i see which helps us to further define the function of the heart  and in this a radioactive drug is injected into the blood stream   i see  right  this accumulates in the heart and is picked up by sensitive sensors  uhm uhm  this gives us an idea of the exact amount of blood being  pumped by the heart during each beat  uhm uhm  it also tells us that the certain portions of the heart  are not contracting properly uhm uhm or there are certain areas of the heart which are receiving less blood supply   uhm uhm  right  the final diagnosis of course can be made after a test called coronary archiography angiography  uhm uhm  and this is the test which is performed under local anaesthesia by the cardiologist and radiologist  uhm uhm  and in this test a cathater is passed through the femoral artery which is the blood vessel supplying the leg  right  this cathater is pushed into the heart uhm  and the radio opaque dye is injected into the heart and the coronary arteries   uhm  right  this tells us firstly the function of the heart  uhm uhm as well as delineates the anatomy of the coronary arteries  uhm and shows us exactly where the disease process is blocking the arteries   uhm uhm   uhm  uhm  this not only confirms the diagnosis for us uhm uhm but it also tells us whether surgery is feasible and if so uhm which portion of the artery should be repaired  uhm uhm   uhm  i see  so what is this bypass surgery ? you see in bypass surgery our aim is to increase the blood supply to the heart by surgical methods  i see  there are two ways to tackle this disease  one is by giving medicines  uhm uhm  however medicines can only improve the blood supply  to the heart marginally  uhm uhm  they mainly act by reducing the demands of the heart  uhm and thereby the work capacity of the patient is now significantly increased   uhm  oh  in bypass surgery we aim to actually increase the blood  supply to the heart by creating bypass channels surgically  right  thereby not only the capacity of the heart is increased   uhm uhm but the capacity of the patient to lead a normal active life right is increased   uhm uhm   right  i see  but what do you exactly do during this bypass surgery ? i mean  the exact surgical procedure is difficult to explain  uhm uhm  but i have a video recording of a bypass surgery  uhm uhm in progress   uhm uhm  oh  if you would like to see it ? i will show it to you  ah ha certainly love to  you are looking into an operation theatre  the preparations for a coronary artery bypass procedure up in the way  the patient suffers background noise from coronary artery disease and requires bypass graft of the blocked artery all the perfusionists the nurses and the anaesthetists get ready the patient is put under anaesthesia  the chest and the leg are draped in sterile towels  to expose the heart the skin overlying the breast bone  is cut  the underlying fat and subcutaneous tissue are then divided to expose the breast bone  which is then cut through with an electric saw  the procedure called sternotomy noise of sawing  the heart is covered by a membranous sheet called the pericordium and when this is cut the first view of the heart beating underneath is accorded  meanwhile another set of surgeons has exposed the long vein of the leg known as the saphenous vein  portions of this vein will be used as conduits by bypass graphs cough  when this has been done the stage is set to connect the heart to the heart lung machine  this machine will perform the function of the heart and lung  during the entire procedure  so this blood must be drained from the heart to the heart lung machine and this is done by means of special plastic cannulae this tube attached from the right side of the heart will drain impure blood from the heart to the heart lung machine  the blood will be purified in the heart lung machine and will then be returned to the heart by means of another tube attached to the aorta background noise  this then completes the circuit which diverts the blood  from the heart to the heart lung machine and then returns it to the patient  thereby bypassing the heart and lungs  during this time the heart can be made to stop and the main operation performed  the connections between the tubings and the heart must not only be watertight but must also be secure to prevent any accidental blow out during the operation  also care must be taken to prevent any air bubbles from entering the circulation  and the heart lung machine is started  blood will be pumped into the body and the patient's  own heart will slow down and will stop injecting  the saphenous vein is then distended and checked for any leaks  and prepared for the anastomosis  for this the heart must be completly stopped and so  the blood supply to the heart is cut out by planting the aorta  the cordioplagic solution is injected into the heart an ice cold saline is poured on its surface to lower its temperature this protects the heart during the period that is blood supply is entirely cut off  the selected artery is then cut beyond the block and this probe shows that one end of the artery is completely obstructed the grafting procedure starts by attaching one end of this saphenous vein to this cut in the artery  this anastomosis is performed with a very fine  polypropelene suture  a high degree of precision is required at this stage  for this anastomosis must not only be watertight but must be absolutely smooth so that the blood flow from the vein to the artery is absolutely unhindered cough  while all this is being done the heart lies completly still protected by its lowered temperature as well as the effects of the cardioplagic solution that has been injected into it  surgeons at work: visuals  once this end of the anastomosis is completed the completion of the graft requires that the other end of the graft be connected to the aorta  but this does not require a stand still heart and so  the heart at this stage can be made to beat again after its blood supply has been restored  the other end of the saphenous vein is now prepared  this end has to be connected to the aorta  and for this a portion of this bl  blood vessel is isolated in a special form  an opening is made in this isolated portion of the aorta  and to this opening the other end of the saphenous vein is carefully sewn sewing the vein  this again is performed with a very fine polypropelene suture the completed graft now fills with blood and supplies blood to the portion of the heart which was earlier deprived of blood supply  the oxygenator is the centre piece of the heart lung machine  and performs the vital function of purifying the impure blood that it receives from the body  it oxygenates the blood and removes carbon dioxide  advances in modern medicine have made coronary artery bypass surgery not only a safe procedure but also accessible to the common man  the same sequence of events continues and the second and the third graft are placed in succession  thereby bypassing all three blocked vessels  the completion of the procedure the heart beats vigorously  and is now ready to be disconnected from the heart lung machine  the connecting tubes are then removed one by one  disconnecting tubes in machine  all the openings in the heart are carefully stitched and a final check is made to look for any bleeding points at the side  of the anastomosis  the major operation over the chest can now be closed  the divided breast bone is approximated with stout sutures and the subcutaneous tissue and the overlying skin are stitched together in layers  the graft at the end of the operation the patient will be revived from anaesthesia and shifted to the intensive care unit  for recovery
