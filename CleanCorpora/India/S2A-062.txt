as in the session  ex ex ex  is concerned  against
the accused number one 
""
the prosecution has  miserably failed to establish the charge
""
""
p w one   kadu achari   in his uh  evidence says
 that  i picked up a stone  which was  which which  hit
the  rear side of the accused shoulder  and the accused sat down 
""
this statement  this very version of the evidence  has been
contradicted repeatedly  not twice but repeatedly  by p w three  and
p w one himself 
""
according to the  p w one  he picked up one stone  and that
hit  that  one word  
""
according to p w three  the p w one has picked up two stones 
""
this is the contradiction 
""
now  the p w  one  p w three says  the accused number
one was at  distance of at about twenty feet 
""
""
yes 
""
""
and above all your honour  p w one himself does not say
 that  he was assaulted by  n h s  
""
your honour will see page number five  paga page number five 
""
 interruption 
""
yes your honour  i'm  coming to the cross examination 
""
before cross examination   i'm  coming to the cross
examination 
""
before cross examination  let us see what the  p w one has
said 
""
he had stated  in examination you see
""
 interruption  
""
sir here are the contradiction which i want to point out 
""
in this examination you see  at page number six  p w one
says   i picked up a stone  and threw it at that  n h s
  which hit him on the rear  on the rear side of his left shoulder
""
""
thereafter all of these five assailants surrounded me and 
assault  started assaulting me  
""
he does not say  the effect of  throwing and hitting with a
stone 
""
he does not say anything  that the accused sat down 
""
he says  all the accused surrounded me and  started
assaulting me  
""
 interruption 
""
no no what he says against 
""
 interruption 
""
no i have to  i am pointing out from the p w one himself 
that he does not say  as the latter said he does not say that  n h s
 has assaulted me 
""
 interruption 
""
no no contradiction not in that sense  i'm  talking 
""
contradiction so far as his  sta  his own statement is
concerned  uh his own  evidence is concerned 
""
contradiction not between the statement and the evidence 
""
 interruption 
""
there were inconsistency  between the  e   between
the evidence of p w three  and the examination in d 
""
i realized in the cross examination 
""
now here he says   i picked up  a stone  i threw
it  it hit  the rear side   of  sh    of shoulder
  of the  n h s   
""
he does not say  that he sat down 
""
he says   then all of them surrounded me and started
assaulting me  
""
now your honour  your honour thereafter  p w  one 
further goes on saying   they surrounded me 
""
they started assaulting me  
""
how  how  ?
""
  mota umesh  assaulted me with sickle  on my
left forearm   big umesh  assaulted me with  by sickle  on my
right wait wait 
""
 big umesh  assaulted me on the right thigh  
""
he does not say  n  
""
 interruption 
""
no no no 
""
 interruption 
""
your honour  i'm  not  on that angle   i'm  not
on that angle 
""
 interruption 
""
he says   interruption 
""
no sir what he says that he was assaulted by  c d e and f 
""
""
he does not say he was assaulted by  n h s  
""
he says he was assaulted by mr  c   with   this 
weap    this weapon    sickle   d  by sickle
again  d  by this weapon  and  e  by  last  e  by
 nothing no weapon is there 
""
so he does not implicate   n h s  accused number one 
that he assaulted him 
""
page number six your honour top  p w three  at page number
forty-six says  that  accused number one told the other assailants
 to assault him 
""
page number forty-six your honour 
""
yes  yes 
""
so  yo   interruption 
""
no your honour  interruption   i'm  coming to that
your honour 
""
here i wanted to draw your attention  on this  this piece
piece of evidence  that he has not implicated the  n h s  so far as
any weapon is concerned  with which he was assaulted  interruption 
""
this   achari's   statement   interruption 
""
the three nought one coming to that 
""
so far as this   interruption 
""
three nought seven also   interruption 
""
sir   interruption  
""
thirty-four   interruption  common intention 
interruption  
""
sir therefore your honour  the common intention is to be proved
 uh  i'm  coming to that also 
""
first of all  charge under section  three hundred  
interruption 
""
not i want to prove the insistent inconsistency with the  piece
of evidences 
""
now here   interruption  uh at page your honour at page
number four  he says that accused number 
""
page number five your honour sir p w one says   n h s 
was armed with  button knife 
""
sir we had  interruption 
""
where your honour  interruption 
""
where your honour  this is there is a lot of inconsistency with
 in the evidence of the same person 
""
your honour once approved  that the case which is defective
because of the infirmity of the evidence 
""
no then there is no point question of common intention your honour
  interruption 
""
here your honour he says that all the accused assaulted me there he
says that i was having the  butto  he was having the  button knife
 and what he has stated  before p w seven came  that m g r was
having sickle 
""
p w three says  n h s  was having sickle 
""
nobody says button knife   interruption 
""
no  i'm  connect  see  i'm  read it jointly 
connect  jointly  connect 
""
so that uh  any  uh  any formal statement  can be made
before the court  interruption 
""
so your honour my submission is  my submission is your honour
 that  the particular witness p w one  has not stated any
previous evidence  that he was assaulted by p w  uh
""
he was assaulted by accused number one with any weapon  
interruption 
""
no your honour your honour has corrected my word  can't i
instead of contradiction  inconsistent 
""
yes your honour 
""
aa at page number thirty-four your honour what p w  three says
about the stone 
""
your honour if  if that is so your honour then  nothing
remains 
""
if the  stone is hit to the accused  then accused sat down
  interruption 
""
i am a  interruption 
""
i am on the point  there once that  interruption   p
w one sustained injury he sat down  if he sat down 
""
and if he sustained injury  he cannot be expected to act 
actually  to assault  the accused  num  of p w one  is the
means  it's  this     acc aa    accused 
 number one  would have suspect is accused number one would have been
 hit with that stone 
""
and his commission was that  he sat down  accused number
one according to the  evidence of  p w three  p w one  that he
sat down  and thereafter  your honour he cannot be expected to act
actually  to assault someone to that extent 
""
he could not bear even a stone 
""
that was his health 
""
so your honour  your honour presuming the two days later as 
interruption  and sat down thereafter 
""
thereafter what happened  ?
""
thereafter they went away   interruption 
""
your honour according to p w three  thereafter  accused
number one    respected accused was   rest of the accused
  according to p w three were assault 
""
that means accused number one did not assault at all 
""
para twenty your honour page number forty 
""
your honour not only that he was simply hurt  he shouted 
""
in a  expec   interruption  page number forty para
twenty one 
""
page forty  interruption 
""
here  n h s  was armed with sickle   interruption
 
""
yes  he is talking about deceased 
""
he is talking about deceased   iyengar  
""
i am talking about  kadu achari    interruption 
""
i am coming  to that  a  afterwards  finishing the
charge so far as  kadu achari  is concerned   interruption 
""
yes uh i i was   interruption 
""
yes  he says here  and thereafter she says   i
 i do not know  what weapons who was having  
""
she says that she doesn't know  which accused was having 
which weapon   interruption 
""
no mainly on the benefit of doubt it is not over  yes which
which arm   interruption  no no assault assault with what  ?
 interruption 
""
the same witness  interruption   number p w three
herself says  at page number forty-five  p w three says  i cannot
say  as to who was armed with which weapon 
""
when she cannot even see the weapon with which her own husband was
assaulted in  in her  before her own eyes 
""
she cannot see all  she cannot  interruption  she cannot
exactly say  who has assaulted  interruption 
""
she cannot exactly say who has assaulted 
""
just merely taking  somebody's  name  interruption 
""
""
sir  blood mark on the knife  though before  before the
court when you had pointed out the knife 
""
he says  there's    there's  no blood mark on the
knife  interruption 
""
it was  it was sealed in the wrapper  interruption 
""
it was sealed  labelled   interruption 
""
if if  if at all the blood was there it should be there  
interruption 
""
no no it is  it is very risky to leave this type of evidence
your honour when she says at page number forty-five  i cannot say who
was having what type of weapon   interruption  
""
then uh  it will be very hardship if the portion of the
evidence  which goes in favour of the prosecution is to be selected 
and the evidence  the fortune of which something might even 
interruption 
""
yes there are contradictions your honour 
""
here i will point out the supreme court judgement  whenever
there are two versions  one goes in favour of the accused  one goes in
 fav  against the accused
""
the version which goes in favour of the accused  or any version
chosen by the accused  interruption 
""
no no here   interruption 
""
they have what  interruption 
""
yes your honour at page forty-five she says  i cannot say
 what type of weapon who was having   interruption 
""
why should i put that he he was having this weapon  
interruption 
""
sir how can i suggest that i was having weapon  i was not
having  knife i was having sickle can i suggest him   interruption
""
""
yes your honour  interruption 
""
at last line paragraph thirty-six she says  i cannot say
as to   interruption 
""
cross examination  interruption 
""
forty-six  last line   i cannot say as to who was
armed with which weapon  
""
so  that  both the witnesses  p w three and p w one
 i have not established  any particular weapon which i was having 
either sickle  or  a a knife
""
therefore  the assumption is that i was not having any weapon
either sickle or knife 
""
at page number thirty-four your honour  the p w three says
  n h s   and  asami  told to kill my husband
 
""
here  here also your honour  told 
""
so your honour may say that there are  having common intention
 your honour here also  the  n h s  is inactive 
""
he does not  inactive 
""
  he  doe    he does   not act 
positively  by assaulting 
""
after hitting with the stone   interruption  regarding
common intention 
""
now your honour  interruption  no  interruption
