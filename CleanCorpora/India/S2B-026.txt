hello viewers 
""
all of us are interested  in developing the ability  to speak
english fluently  and expressively 
""
but many of us are unnecessarily diffident about it 
""
you will find  that with a little guidance  and constant
effort   it's  possible to make remarkable improvement  in the
ability to speak english 
""
the aim of this programme  is to highlight  some of those
aspects of speech  which contribute  to better spoken english 
""
i am sure all of us refer to a dictionary  whenever we don't know
the meaning of a word 
""
but we quickly have a look at the meaning  and then close the
dictionary 
""
there is one important bit of information  which we generally
don't use  and that is pronunciation 
""
every good dictionary  gives the pronunciation of a word 
""
whenever you refer to a dictionary  you will find  that
immediately after the entry of the word  its pronunciation  or
transcription is given in bracket 
""
 let's  have a look  at one such transcription  given
in the dictionary 
""
this word  is to be pronounced  as  agreement
 
""
listen carefully   agreement  
""
we are aware  that many of us say   agreement
  and this pronunciation seems to be influenced by spelling
""
""
look at the first symbol  in this transcription 
""
it is rather a strange letter  because that doesn't appear 
in the ordinary letters  of the alphabet 
""
that    sta    stands   for the sound
  ipa symbol   the weak sound  ipa symbol  in english
""
""
the next three symbols  give us the sound   gree
  and the next four symbols  give us  the sound 
 ment  
""
if you put this together  you get  agreement
 
""
you will find that there are about fifteen such strange looking
symbols  used in most dictionaries 
""
and it is a matter of a few minutes  to get familiar with those
symbols 
""
you will find that once you know those symbols  you will have
the ability  to read the correct pronunciation  given in a dictionary
""
""
any dictionary gives  a list of phonetic symbols  right at
the beginning 
""
for example  have a look at this table 
""
in this table  you find  that on the left  there are some
symbols  phonetic symbols  as we call them 
""
towards the right  there are some words  which point out
what are the sounds  represented by those symbols 
""
if you go through this carefully  you will find that  in
fact you already know many of the symbols 
""
as i said  there are only a few symbols  that you will have
to try and remember 
""
let us move on  to one important aspect of speech 
""
as we all know  there are vowel sounds  and consonant sounds
""
""
 let's  consider  two important vowel sounds 
""
first   let's  take up these words   lip
   leap  
""
listen carefully again to these two words   lip
   leap  
""
you will find  that there is difference in the vowel sound 
of these two words 
""
the first sound  is a short sound  the sound is  i
 
""
the second one is a long sound  i:   and
that gives you  lip  leap 
""
have a look at the next pair of words   pull
   pool  
""
listen again   pull    pool
 
""
the contrast  is between short  ipa symbol   and long
 ipa symbol  
""
i would like to give you a simple hint 
""
in case of short vowels  try to make your vowels as short as
possible 
""
and in case of long vowels  try to make them as long as you can
""
""
this will help you retain the distinction  between the short
vowels and long vowels 
""
 let's  briefly talk about  some consonants  which are
problematic to many indian users of english 
""
 let's  have a look at the next pair of words  
fan    finish  
""
listen again   fan    finish
 
""
many indians have a problem  in articulating the first sound
""
""
instead of saying   fan   they say
 phan   instead of saying  finish 
 they say  phinish  
""
have a close look at my lips now 
""
the english sound is   fa    fan
   finish  
""
and you will observe  that there is a contact  between the
lower lip and the upper teeth 
""
please observe again   fan   
finish  
""
in the indian equivalent  you will find that there is a contact
between the two lips 
""
look carefully   pha  
""
many indians say   phan   
phinish   instead  they should say   fan
  and  finish  
""
 let's  have a look at the next pair of words  
think   and  thank  
""
again  note carefully the first sound 
""
the first sound is   ipa symbol   and not 
tha  
""
many indians say   think  and  thank
 
""
i hope you hear the difference  between the english sound 
and the indian equivalent 
""
listen again to the difference 
""
the english pronunciation   ipa symbols   the indian
pronunciation   think   the english pronunciation
  ipa symbols   the indian pronunciation   thank
 
""
what really happens in the articulation of the english sounds is
 that the first sound in these words  is a friction sound  the air
comes out  between the lower and the upper teeth 
""
look again  think  thank 
""
and if you are a little aware  of how these sounds are produced
 that will make a lot of difference  to our spoken english 
""
we have to take one important piece of care 
""
many of us  are exposed to spelling first  and then to
pronunciation 
""
this gives rise  to what some people have described  as
spelling pronunciation 
""
look at the next three words on the screen 
""
the first word  is   immediate  
""
some of you might wonder  that this word has another possible
pronunciation   immediate  
""
 that's  right 
""
some words in english  have two or more acceptable
pronunciations 
""
this word is either   ipa symbols - immediate  or  ipa
symbols - immediate   but not   ipa symbols - immediate 
""
""
many indians think  that because there is double  m
 in spelling  there must be two  ipa symbols  sounds 
""
and therefore they think  that the pronunciation must be
immediately 
""
but  let's  remember  that there is only one  m
 there  and therefore  the pronunciation is  ipa symbols -
immediate   or  ipa symbols - immediate  
""
the next word  is often pronounced by indians  as 
ring  
""
listen again   ring  
""
but the british pronunciation would be   ipa symbols - rin
 
""
the difference is in the last sound 
""
in the british pronunciation  there is no  ga
 at the end 
""
 it's   ipa symbols - ring  and not  ipa symbol -
ring  
""
similarly  in the next word   it's  not  ipa
symbols - ringing   but  ipa symbols - ringing  
""
again there is no  ga  
""
there is a tendency to go by spelling  and this is one
important piece of care  that  we'll  have to take  about
english pronunciation 
""
in the pronunciation that we showed you  from the dictionary
 there was one mark  which i didn't explain earlier 
""
before  g   you must have seen a short
vertical stroke  on top of the word  and you might have wondered 
what it was 
""
in fact  that is called the accent mark  or the stress mark
""
""
accent or stress  is a very important feature of english speech
 and it has been proved  that that lead to intelligibility of english
""
""
between the correct articulation of vowels and consonants  and
the correct accent  what is definitely more important  is the right
accent 
""
and therefore  all of us should be bothered about this feature
 of english speech 
""
you will find that  in any dictionary  the accent is
indicated  by certain kinds of strokes 
""
most of them  use a short vertical stroke  before the
accented syllable 
""
 let's  have a look at some of these words on the screen
""
""
the first word is  character  
""
now this word is made up of three syllables  or three parts 
 cha    ric   and  ter
 
""
remember that all these three parts are not said with equal
emphasis 
""
listen again   character   and you will
find  that i am emphasising  i am somehow highlighting  the first
part  cha   character 
""
i must not pronounce the word  as character  or character
 because this would be a shift in accent 
""
it has been found out  that english is often understood  by
the right accent 
""
and there has been an experiment  an interesting one  where
it was found  that if indians pronounce the word as character 
english speakers  heard the word as  director  
""
you might wonder why this happened 
""
look at the next word on the screen  and  you'll  find
 that that has accent on the second syllable 
""
therefore  the english  listeners thought  that if the
word  character   had accent on the second syllable it
couldn't be that word 
""
it has to be a word  which has accent on the second syllable
""
""
and therefore  they thought of the nearest word  which has
accent on the second syllable 
""
in the word director  there is accent on the second syllable
""
""
again as i told you before  this word has another possible
pronunciation  you might pronounce it  as director 
""
in whichever way you pronounce it  the accent must be on the
second syllable 
""
 let's  have a look at the next word  which is often
mispronounced by indians   employee  
""
there is accent on the third syllable  neither on the first
syllable nor on the second  but on the third   employee
 
""
whereas many of us tend to say  i am an employee of this
institution 
""
the correct pronunciation would be  i am an employee of this
organisation 
""
the next word is an interesting case 
""
all of us know this word  and we know  that this word
functions  as a noun  an adjective or a verb 
""
depending on its grammatical role  there is a change in accent
""
""
when it is a noun or an adjective  there is accent on the
first syllable  and therefore the pronunciation is present 
""
when it is a verb  the accent shifts  to the second
syllable  and the pronunciation is  present 
""
 let's  try to use this in sentences 
""
first of all  the word  present   as a
noun 
""
he gave me a nice birthday present 
""
the word as an adjective  thirty students were present in the
class yesterday 
""
the word as a verb  we are going to present a play tonight
""
""
and i hope you have listened to the two different pronunciations
 of the same word 
""
the main difference  was that of accent 
""
in english there are a few words  pairs of nouns and verbs
 which behave in this particular way 
""
if they are nouns  there is usually accent on the first
syllable  and if they are verbs  there is usually accent on the second
syllable 
""
 let's  consider one more example like this 
""
the next word on the screen  is both a noun and a verb 
""
if it is a noun  it can be pronounced as produce  if it is
a verb  it should be pronounced as produce 
""
and i hope you hear the difference in accent 
""
 let's  use these words in sentences 
""
the agricultural produce in india has gone up 
""
india produces a lot of wheat 
""
therefore  whenever we use words  which can function either
as nouns or verbs  we should be careful  about the accent 
""
when we move from words to sentences  there are certain
problems 
""
 let's  have a look at the next two sentences  on the
screen 
""
each sentence consists of a few words  and many indians try to
give equal emphasis  on each word 
""
for example  many indians might read the first sentence like
this  my friend has finished the job 
""
whereas  if you are a good speaker of english  you might
read it in some such way 
""
my friend has finished the job 
""
listen again to the difference between the two 
""
my friend has finished the job 
""
and  my friend has finished the job 
""
in the english sentence properly said  you will find  that
certain words  stand out as more prominent 
""
in this sentence  the words that stand out as prominent  are
 friend  finished and job  
""
the words my  has  and the  are relatively unimportant
 and therefore  you can speak them faster  and more weakly 
""
listen to the sentence again   my friend has finished
the job  
""
consider the next sentence 
""
 the machine is being repaired  
""
many indians might read it as 
""
 the machine is being repaired  
""
compare this with 
""
 the machine is being repaired  
""
look at the first phrase   the machine  
""
now you hardly hear  the article  the  
""
i am not saying  the machine  but i am saying  the
machine    the  is relatively unimportant in
this sentence 
""
if you remember this simple fact  that content words  that
is  nouns  adjectives  adverbs and main verbs  are usually more
important  than words like  conjunctions  articles  auxiliary
verbs 
""
you will find that it will make a lot of difference to your speech
""
""
 it's  also necessary  to have proper pauses  at the
right places 
""
because if you don't pause at the right place  you will find
that the sentence can convey a wrong meaning 
""
many of us are also aware  of the necessity of using the right
tone  or the right intonation 
""
 let's  have a look at the next two sentences 
""
the first sentence   she is beautiful  
in a sense is not ambiguous 
""
the word  beautiful   has one meaning here
 but depending on the tone  that you use  in order to say this 
it can convey different meanings 
""
i am going to say this sentence  in three different ways 
and listen carefully to the difference 
""
one   she is beautiful  
""
two   she is beautiful   and three 
 she is beautiful  
""
i am sure you have heard  the difference between the three
sentences 
""
and  you'll  find that all these three sentences  said
with three different tones  convey three different meanings  in english
""
""
 let's  consider their meanings 
""
number one   she is beautiful  
""
this is a matter of fact statement 
""
the speaker really appreciates  the beauty  of the person
that he is talking about 
""
but if he says it with a different tone  as in number two 
 she is beautiful   you might perceive it as a
question  or you might think  that the speaker wants to add something
after this 
""
this might convey  the sense of incompleteness 
""
consider the third way  of saying that   she is
beautiful  
""
this in english  indicates that there is some kind of implied
meaning  and that is left to the imagination of the listener 
""
this sentence   she is beautiful   could
mean  okay she is beautiful  but  foolish  or unreliable or
something like that 
""
so the praise  the appreciation  is not really unqualified
""
""
there is some kind of implied meaning  that the speaker is
trying to convey 
""
 let's  consider the next sentence 
""
 close the door  
""
this sentence in isolation  is a command 
""
but if you use the right kind of tone  this can be perceived
as a request 
""
let me point out  that there are different way  of making
requests in english 
""
you can add words like  please or kindly 
""
you can change the sentence construction and say  
would you mind closing the door   or  may i ask a
favour of you   and then you ask the person to close the door
 or  a third possibility  is to use the right tone 
""
for example  listen to the difference  between these two
sentences 
""
 close the door  
""
 close the door  
""
the first sentence is perceived as a strong command  whereas
the second one is seen as a polite request 
""
this indicates  that intonation or tone plays a very important
role  in speech 
""
a wrong intonation  can sometimes convey wrong meaning 
""
and this can cause a lot of misunderstanding 
""
as we said at the beginning  all of us would like to speak
fluently  and there is a common misunderstanding  that fluency means
fast speech 
""
this is not really right 
""
you can be slow in speed  and yet be fluent  because
fluency depends  on the kind of flow  that your speech has 
""
the speed must be controlled by what you are talking about  and
it is also directed   it's  also controlled by your personality 
to some extent 
""
even if you take into account  all these aspects of speech 
which we have discussed  there is one extremely important thing  and
that is confidence 
""
unless you feel self- confident  you will not be able to make
significant progress  in spoken english 
""
of course  your confidence must be supplemented by hard work
and patience 
""
at the end   let's  try to sum up  the important
aspects of speech  to which we must pay attention 
""
one  the correct articulation  of vowels and consonants 
""
two  the right accent 
""
three  the right kind of rhythm  depending on  accenting
important words 
""
and lastly  intonation 
""
as i said  all these should be supplemented by confidence 
and hard work 
""
thank you
