we had already learnt about the space flight of yuri gagarin the pioneer in the field of uh space flight  we have come upto the launching of the spacecraft  further we studied will study on page fifty-seven  page number page number sir page number sir page number  fifty-six at fifty-seven  fifty-seven  how many days after the launching the first and the second stages of rockets had bend down and fallen away the spacecraft projectory altered as i turned to go into orbit parallel with the earth  surface  gagarin pulled himself towards the window i can see the earth in a haze   i'm feeling fine  a moment later he added it looks uh beautiful   he was rather uh startled and exasperated when he looked through the window to the earth down below  he says i can see in a haze or it was not very clear the vision was not very clear it was murky or rather uh foggy or misty  therefore he says in spite of the fact that i can see the earth in a haze it looks so beautiful  he loosened the scarf holding him to his couch  his body weightless in space rose slightly above the seat  though still held uh loosened scarf  he was in fact floating in his cabin  when he loosened his belt he was floating in the cabin  as you are aware of he experiences the weightlessness there in the outer space therefore he was floating  every three or four minutes he repeated his instrument reading through the radio telephone and received confirmation from ground control  straight in front of him in his cabin was an instrument panelled with the globe navigator  a remarkable device which represented the earth below him  the globe slowly resolved as his position altered in relation to the earth  quite often he had to come into contact with the earth station  or it is otherwise known as the earth controlling station  there was the panel of instruments displayed in his cabin  he had to observe the readings and the functions of this cabin  and it has to be conveyed through the telephone to the uh ground station  and they will confirm and accordingly they give instructions  what is to be done uh how it should be done so that he is always in contact with the uh earth station though he is all alone in the  vostok  in the cabin away from uh the earth hundreds of miles  travelling at the tremendous speed of uh about eighty thousand uh  miles per hour  still he is in contact with the earth station and  it is the two way system  he will inform them and they will accordingly uh instruct him what is to be done and what not to be done  but the minutes after the launching he was over south africa  south america   all is well he reported i am not too much troubled by the feeling of weightlessness  the report was given to the world by way of moscow radio  forty-six forty-five minutes after launching he was just above the south america and he conveyed uh to the earth station though he experiences weightlessness fear of gravity   it does not cause any harm to him and this report was rather broadcast by the moscow radio to all the  peoples in russia  a little later the atlantic was below him just visible only surface and of course quite invisible was the russian tracking ship  using radar equipment to keep contact with the invisible spaceship a little later he was above the atlantic ocean  so he could see the sea or ocean clearly  he could not see the tracking ship  a ship was uh equipped with radar sophisticated uh  instruments to track the uh course of uh gagarin's flight he could see the ocean clearly  despite he couldn't see the ship which is uh detailed for tracking his uh flight  after just over an hour the space flight he was passing the coast of africa a red light in the instrument panel gleamed  this was a warning that the descent would begin in ten minutes  he checked the instruments again and then reported that all was well  while he was above africa a red light was gleaming  shining this was an indication his return journey should start within a short while   do you want to make an alteration in the flight plan  ? he was asked from the earth station the ground control he was asked whether he would like to change any uh change in the  schedule of his or plan of his flight whether he wants to remain in the space for a uh extended period ?  cough  he replied that he was not to be brought down as planned sorry  he replied that he wanted to be brought down as planned although he would how nice to go round the world again  and although the cabin was stored with ten days supply of food in case of any landing difficulty gagarin thought it best to keep to the  prepared flight scheme  he informed the ground control though he would like to continue the flight for an extended period he wants uh everything should be done according to the plan or the schedule  therefore he said that he is ready for everything is ready he checked for the return journey  at just the right moment retro-rockets were automatically fired  to slow off the spaceship at the same time the cabin was turned to exactly the right angle for the entry of the earth atmosphere  this operations were dealt with the with by a computer on the ground although in case the need gagarin could have used manual control  automatically the retro-rocket that means to slow down the speed  and tearing off the uh spacecraft because when it enters the atmosphere there is rather there is the line imaginary line the outer space and the atmosphere  there was a lot of rather you see that what you call that uh  heat generated when the space spacecraft re-enter our uh atmosphere that is why they used to make the spacecraft with a particular  uh metal which can resist or withstand the astronomical amount of heat produced even then uh spa cosmonauts astronauts are also uh made to wear a number of space suits to avoid any harm when it re- enters the uh our atmosphere  so it was ready retroket rocket that means for receiving coming back automatically it was fired everything was done by computer  though there was the alternative provision for gagarin to operate these things manually if something goes wrong he has to come back to the earth therefore they always keep the contigency plan or alternative arrangement  if everything goes smoothly the computer will operate  if the firing of the rocket from time to time the tearing off the spacecraft everything will be monitored and controlled by the earth controlled station  after this exactness was record a very slight error might mean a lightening at a point of many miles from that intended  a slightly greater error could result in a descent with a space cabin at the wrong angle and it's destruction by the heat resulting from the air friction  it had to be done very meticulously  very uh rather you see that uh uh exactly in the sense very with clinical precision precisely everything has to be done  a minor negligible error can cause uh a tremendous uh rather you see that a damage which may cause the destruction of uh  spacecraft and uh cosmonaut gager gagarin himself  so everything has to be very precise  gagarin felt the jolt of the breaking rockets gave the shattereing rock but the change was not violent as he has expected  he felt the sensation of weightlessness gradually leaving him as he started his returning journey the air brake was applied he could feel the jolt suddenly he was rather you see that uh jolted or moved  and then he was feeling the rather you see that the  gravitation of the earth as he was nearing to the earth the weightlessness was rather vanishing or on the decrease  the pressure became stronger and stronger as the vostok  descended  his face visible on the television screen became drawn and tight almost in the flatness  the nose forced in the eye sockets widened  he could barely see  speech was beyond him though his hearing remained  the voice of the ground controller was saying that all was well when that spacecraft the vostok re-entered the atmosphere for a few moments it was unbearable for him  his face was flattened his eye sockets were bulging and  he could not even speak  only he could hear and he could hear the ground station was telling everything was going on smoothly after the schedule  don't worry  otherwise he was experiencing there for a uh few moments  quite uncomforatable because his face was swollen or flattened eyes were bulging  he could not talk  restlessness he felt drowsiness he felt except he could  uh hear  the agonizing g-pressure lasted only a minute or two  then it was lifted his weight became more normal  this unbearable and agonizing the painful the most painful experience lasted for two minutes  then he was alright  above target and on coast parachute raised coming on it was control system  then again it was conveyed everything was in perfect trim perfect condition   extended noise  the voice prepared him for the physical shock as the parachute opened above the capsule  the slowing down of the vostok was so abrupt that it was like a blow in the church  the spacecraft also is fitted with a parachute  we can imagine when it travels at a tremendous speed of eighteen  thousand miles if if it comes back to the earth at the same speed  it will come and dash to the earth to the destruction of uh  spacecraft and occupant  therefore it has to be the speed had to be curtailed or contained the there was the parachute it was opened  from the window he could now recognise features of the land below him  it was an old training base in contrast with the rest of his journey  the descent was quite slow  but the ground in fact was coming closer and closer to the  consider considerable speed  as he was coming down and down descending flight returning flight he could see the land  it was an old discarded uh uh training station there he was going to land  the final stages of the descent were first seen by two women working in the fields of the widely spread parachute descended  with the mysterious cabin suspended below it  the woman's first thought was that they were witnessing the arrival of a spy  it was not very long since an american airman reconnoitre high over russian territory had been brought down  the resulting neutral spy trend in russia had got great sensation  throughout the world  when he was descending two women happened to see  they were rather frightened because at that time the  sensational uh bringing down of the u-two plane  u-two plane is a it was a spy plane of america  it is took it took off from pakistan  uh it it could not be rather you see that traceable unless a country has got a sophisticated instruments  if it flies over india we may not be able to know whether it is flight of course now we are in a position in those days you can imagine in sixties only uh russia or some advanced country could detect the uh reconnoitre means spying flight of this planes it is called u-two plane  it took off from pakistan because it is a close ally of united states even today it is the close ally  so they allowed the planes the spy plane to take up reconnoitre plane or otherwise it is called espionage spying is called bb-work  this plane was on a mission to espionage or spying  russians uh could uh detect the presence of this plane they brought down uh with a missile  and the pilot was captured his uh name uh if i i'm not wrong uh powell  an air-force officer a pilot called powell  he was imprisoned  after many years with americans and russians negotiated and uh  he was released he was given his freedom  in those days this sensational news was spread all over russia  about the bringing down of uh u-two spy plane  this woman the poor uneducated woman of the countryside  took this as an ameriacn spy plane  they were rather frightened when this spacecraft was coming down with the parachute over it  they mistook it for a united states or american spy planes because the news was uh raging at that time about the bringing down of this u-two plane the spy the plane on its espionage or reconnoitre was brought down
