kate chopin's the awakening sex-role liberation or sexual liberation  over the centuries women writers have written openly or implicitly about the right of woman to passion  in fact as ellen moers in her literary women  says it was ovid who with his with his heroides  first gave voice to the heroine in love  according to moers ovid started a tradition which extended well into the eighteenth century to become part of the infant novel in britain  and which was born anew in women's literature of the nineteenth century  mary wollstonecraft the strong-minded feminist comes to mind in this respect  for it is in her fiction reviews and letters that  wollstone wollstonecraft is explicit about love  the wrongs of women or maria  by wollstonecraft is a celebration of an unhappy wife's   adulterous love from the point of view of a woman not only with a mind but a body capable of passion  women writers also inherited from rousseau the novel of adultery  as seen from the woman's point of view  as moers put it i quote the adultery novel after rousseau became the woman writer's vehicle of attack on the economic and social class realities that make a mockery of love as well as a vehicle of demonstration that woman has a capacity to think feel and act for herself unquote  a whole host of writers and novelists spoke frankly about the positive consequences of adultery  george elliot the bronte sisters gaskell browning collette and woolf to name only the most well known ones resolved to talk openly about the forbidden subject and the right of a woman to participate actively and consciously in the affairs of love clears her throat  the american literary scene had not witnessed the presence of a traditon of novel writing by women who talk about their heroines from a  woman's perspective  the awakening of female novel writers to a sense of their own identity begins only with the publication of kate chopin's   the awakening at the turn of the last century  one may even say that the american that the tradition begins in the twentieth century  incidentaly the awakening may be read as an  adult adultery novel also   chopin's novel sent waves of shock among the pre-dominantly patriarchal set up of her time  she became almost the first woman writer to create a woman in edna  pontellier who not only awakens to her sexuality but makes bold to confess it  linda huf puts it succinctly i quote the novel  suggested that the renegade heroine had not forgotten herself but had in fact found herself had awakened to her full potential as a human being and all because without consulting any one but her own willful self she had taken un an unlawful  fancy to a younger man unquote  when the novel opens the twenty-eight year old edna pontellier is holidaying at grand isle with her husband leonce pontellier and her  two children raoul and and etienne  i am sorry i don't know how to pronounce the french words so i am  i am just talking in terms of the anglicised pronunciation  pontellier a successful brokerage businessman is one of those husbands who prides himself on his many possessions of which his wife is the most precious and attractive  little wonder that he reacts typically when he reprimands edna for exposing herself at midday in such heat while bathing in the sea  he is anxious that she should protect her complexion as jealously if not more as her honour  he scrutinizes her as he would a piece of personal property which has suffered some damage  during the six years of her married life edna too has lived like any other southern wife in her beautiful house in new orleans  immersed immersed in her home and social circle  she was married she sorry she has married pontellier for the same reason as any woman of her class would  she chooses leonce to become the devoted wife of a man who she felt worshiped her  she feels she would i quote take her place with a certain dignity in the world of reality closing the portals forever behind her upon the realm of romance and dreams unquote  the opening pages of the novel would give one the impression that edna is one of those usual southern women who is contented looking after her husband and children  yet through the flashback technique chopin employs we know that edna had been a different person in her childhood girlhood  and youth  as a lonely and imaginative person she has given herself to secret and intense infatuations  first it is the dignified and sad-eyed cavalry officer at another time it is i quote the young gentleman who visits a lady on a neighbourhood plantation unquote yet a third time it is i quote the figure of a great tragedian that possessed her mind  but marriage with the tragedian which would have been the highest point of her happiness was not for her in this world  however if he does not come in the form of a leonce he comes in the form of robert lebrun who awakens her to a sense of herself as a person rather than as a piece of personal property  but even before robert begins to arouse edna's dormant passionate self it is the sea at grand isle which without her realising it has begun to exert a powerful pull towards her  the seductive voice of the sea never ceasing whispering  clamouring murmuring invites edna's soul to wander the abyss of solitude  the solitude of the sea as judith fryer aptly says propels a real awakening in edna which i quote frees her from her place in society unquote  fryer further maintains that in her illumination edna is most like whitman's awakened self and that once we recognize the extent to which edna's awakening is the whitmanian song of herself the radical nature of chopin's  intentions becomes clear  fryer considers the awakening as a song a celebration of a woman who awakens to her identity as a person quote  defined only in terms of her own experience not in relation to any other person unquote  among the many images that chopin uses to project either edna's  restrictive life or her freedom from this life the sea is the most dominant one  it frames both edna's awakening into life and her final suicide  the first six chapters of the book describe the seductive quality of the sea which stirs edna's awakening  so seductive is the pull of the sea that edna experiences  contradictory emotions of attraction and resistance to robert's  invitation to her to follow him to the shore or into the sea  i quote this is from the text a certain light was beginning to dawn within her the light which's showing the way  forbids it  in short mrs pontellier was beginning to realize her position in the universe as a human being and to recognise her relations as an individual to the world within and about her unquote  that edna's awakening is clearly sexual is indicated by  chopin's description of the sea and its effect on edna  the touch of the sea is sensuous enfolding the body in its soft  close embrace  when edna first arrives at grand isle she cannot swim the sea is dangerous to her  quote a certain ungovernable dread hung about her when in the water unless there was a hand near by that might a hand near that might reach out and reassure her unquote  and of course it is robert whose reassuring hand  encourage encourages her to realize her power to control her body and soul   chopin's aim is in describing edna's trial in learning to swim is clear  it becomes symbolic of edna's moving away from a state of dependence fear and repression to a state of independence  boldness and an awakening of a sensuous self  edna wants to swim far wide where no woman has swum before  as a consequence her will gradually turns resistant and stubborn and eventually refuses to obey her husband's whims  chopin juxtaposes edna's emerging self with her previous dormant self to show how redundant her husband has become for her  her bathing in the sea with robert and her going on a day-long boat trip further shows edna's boldness  yet neither while bathing in the sea nor during their day at  caminada do we see edna and robert in any kind of physical intimacy  in fact the high point of edna's sensual awakening comes when edna is alone at madame uh madame antoine's   co sorry cottage while robert is waiting outside patiently for her to recover from her exhaustion after their boat ride to caminada  more than robert it is adele one of the boarders at grand isle who seems to play a significant role in edna's sensual awakening  it is adele who em emboldens  edna to exalt over her body without any shame  chopin devotes considerable space to describing the intimacy with which the two women sit and talk on the beach at grand isle  yet as long as edna is on grand isle her awakening remains at the level of the sensual only  there is no element of sex involved in her relationship with robert before such a possibility arises robert leaves for mexico  the sexual freedom that edna experiences vis-a-vis  arobin comes much later this is a lover that she consciously takes in the in the novel it is shown that later in the novel  the sexual freedom that edna experiences vis-a-vis  arobin comes much later after she has emancipated herself  from her marital familial and social ties after her return to new orleans  edna has begun to defy her husband's whims even while they are at grand isle that is on the holiday  but in new orleans where they live it's it's their home there she decides to free herself not only from her family duties but also from her social commitments like her weekly reception day  which she has had to observe to further her husband's business  and his status in society  she defiantly moves about alone at odd hours and in odd places  as if this was not enough she turns to her old hobby of painting  which at first she undertakes to kill the boredom of her life but later with a seriousness which eventually helps her helps her to handle her brush with a new sureness and ease helping her to work  to grow in force and individuality these are all textual quotes  the next step in edna's emancipation is her desire to become economically independent which she becomes with the help of her teacher laidpore who sells some of her paintings for her  this in addition to her small inheritance plus the money she has won at the race track makes it possible for her to buy her pigeon house she lives in a separate house from her husband's now thus edna awakens to her full identity as an individual  quietly but firmly freeing herself from the stereotypical roles of a wife and mother which society has imposed on her  an important influence on edna in arousing her later creativity  which ultimately makes her a professional painter is madame reisz a pianist edna has met at grand isle  edna has been attracted by reisz's professional performance that is soiree for the vacationers s o i r e e please how do we pronounce it ?  soiree  soiree okay  but more than this edna has been fascinated by reisz's  independence and her self-assertion and her tendency to trample on the rights of others  in new orleans too edna calls on reisz quite often to hear her play the atmosphere of her room invades edna with repose   reisz's music has the cons  consistent effect of playing upon the responsive chords of her inner being  although reisz's rudeness and offensive manners try  edna's patience her divine art reaches edna's spirit  and sets it free  her observation that reisz's observation in the text i quote to be an artist includes much one must possess many gifts which have not been acquired by one's own effort  to succeed the artist must possess the courageous soul  the soul that dares and defies unquote  challenges edna to further free herself from the shackles of social conventions  probably it is reisz's indifference and unconcern for social norms and conventions that emboldens edna to confess what she has not been able to do to anyone her passion for robert  it is then that reisz says something that is at the centre of  chopin's examination in the novel  i quote the bird that would soar above the level plain of tradition and prejudice must have strong wings  it is a sad spectacle to see the weaklings bruised  exhausted fluttering back to earth unquote  obviousely through the bird imagery which like the imagery of the sea flows throughout the novel  chopin is trying to portray the plight of women who either remain imprisoned in cages of conventions or tear these conventions of  and soar freely doing what they want to do or after having dared to defy and soar find the freedom so daunting that like weaklings  they fall on the land bruised and broken
