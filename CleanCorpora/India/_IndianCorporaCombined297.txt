uh now before i go on to the way  indian writing in english got a new lease of life in the  in the in the seventees uh it it got a new lease of life by being a part of whatever you call commonwealth literature   i mean i want to talk about that a little later  but before that i want to say one or two things about  present critical responses to indian writing in english   certain trends and possibilities you see  i read a paper on this some time ago and i thought uh  some of the things that i mentioned in the paper are relevant to our  discussion in indian writing in english  uhm in this paper first i take three poles  i mean i say that we can uh uh arrange a critical responses according to the three poles that are in indian writing in english  one is related to the term indian the other is related to the term english and the third is related to the term writing  so i say let's first concentrate our attention on the pole of english and survey the area of responses centred upon it  the early british responses are to be understood i think in the context of the colonial situation that existed at that time  characterised by the master-slave relationship tempered by the teacher-student relationship of of uh liberal encouragement and patronage  you all know about the concept of the white  man's burden  the question is whether the british attitude was really  what david mccutchion thought it was that of patronising approval  and with david mccutchion who talks about indian writing in english and what the british thought of indian writing in english   he he his uh he saw he thought that uh  there is always a patronising approval there is a patronising attitude  uh we are astonished he says not that it is done well but that it is done at all  uh i'm sure david mccutchion judges his victorian eh uh compatriots like edmund gosse then m a h a l fisher  arthur symons laurence binyon and young w b yeats rather ungenerously attributing to them an attitude of superfluous  superiority  these are these were the people who talked about indian writing in english  uh uh you know edmund gosse wrote about uh uh toru dutt poetry  and he has referenced it to all these people who uh uh liked indian writing in english for one reason or another  i do not think that gosse was patting on toru dutt's  back out of uh adulterated kindness born of parental superiority  if you look at what uh gosse wrote about toru dutt he don't uh find this uh this kind of patting it is genuine criticism  now this is what gosse wrote to toru dutt literature has no honours which need have been beyond the grasp of a girl  who at the age of twenty-one and in language separated from her own  by so deep a chasm had produced so much of lasting worth  when the history of literature of our own country comes to be written there is sure to be a page in it dedicated to this fragile  exotic blossom of songs  of course i mean uh he likes her for what she has written  and also with the word that term exotic is important  that she has a place in the history of english literature  and uh he also likes her because of uh the the the exoticism that she brings in through her poetry  this surely is not a patronising approval  it is uh serious criticism expressed with certain generosity  without falsifying the truth of his judgement  now the second example that i give for such genuine kind of uh response uh without any offence of pat   patronage uh or one word is that of  yeats's appreciation of tagore's gitanjali  if you read uh i refer to this yesterday if you read uh  yeats's uh uh preface to tagore's gitanjali  we find that uh this appreciation uh of tagore his appreciation of tagore throbs with a singular sincerity of response  i quote the work of a supreme culture they yet appear as mu as much the growth of the common soil as the grass and the rushes  a whole people a whole civilization immeasurably strange to us  once again the the note of exoticism immeasurably strange to us   seems to have been taken up into this imagination and yet we were moved because of the strangeness but because we have  met our own image as though we had walked in rossetti's   willow wood or heard perhaps for the first time in literature our voice as in a dream unquote  what we had to accept is the sincerity and genuineness of critical response in tune with the literary tradition to which the critics belonged  i don't see any exaggerated and patronising praise in for example graham green's comparison of uh uh r k narayan  with chekov or herbert read's faith in shankar mokashi  punekar's poetry or milton brown's comparison of the chronicles of kedaram with main street and cranford  the tradition of enthusiastic appreciation of indian works in english by western critics they include the australian critics as well  is a continous phenomenon which has to be accounted for i think  phase-wise taking into consideration the changing context of indian writing in english  the early phase was coloured by a certain self confessed  generosity i mean we should agree  even though it is genuine there is a certain amount of self conscious generosity  and uh there was no question of misreading our indian indo-english literature since it was well within the traditions of english poetry with which they were familiar  the so called exotic element in it might have cast a little spell  but it was never blinding or binding so as to distort their critical sense  after independence indian writing in english  achieved its identity as a viable body of literature  the responses of people like graham greene william walsh e m foster and laurence durrel were seized by us with avidity  since they helped us in building up our confidence in the valley of our literature soon thanks to the rise of uh commonwealth literature  in answer to the new political and cultural needs of the erstwhile colonies of england indian writing in english  claimed a place legitimate and illegitimate at the same time legitimate because of the medium and illegitimate from the point of view of the centrality of indian experience uh obtained the place in it and it was subjected to scholarly study of western and australian commonwealth literature experts like riemenschneider  keith uh uh carelein syd harrex haydn moore williams dorothy spencer kai nicholson etcetera  this post nineteen sixty criticism is characterised by a good deal of misreading although it was based on well meaning laborous close reading  they misreading being the result of a lack of cultural inwardness  these critics trained in uh in the tradition of new criticism discover in our novelist patterns and layers of meaning not easily visible to a norman normal indian reader  now i make this uh uhm po point  with a reference to william walsh what he wrote about r k narayan and also what uh uh some australian critic wrote about  jejuri  so jejuri i mentioned yesterday today i'm going to say something that william walsh's response to r k narayan's  fiction and uh particularly you should r  read in his book commonwealth literature  his uh response to r k narayan's guide  his response is sincere and subtle no doubt but the question is  do the novels of uh r k narayan really stand this over subtle and over enthusiastic scrutiny ? but then what is historically important is the western  critic's joy of discovery which always colours their perceptions in the case of narayan's or anand's fiction the western reader finds an easy entry through ironic or realistic modes  employed in it  but it is when they encounter raja rao that they are baffled  david mccutchion for instance confesses frankly the anglo-saxon mind does not understand india very well he says with aurobindo too they experience an opacity of response walsh for instance finds aurobindo evasive  constantly escaping the grapple of the western mind and dismisses him by saying the importance of aurobindo ghosh belongs rather to the history of ideas and of religion than literature   the western critical sensibility loves irony realism concreteness conflict and rigidity of form and it gets baffled and frustrated when it faces something abstract apparently formless  spiritual and mystical  in the dialectics of critical process or to use leacis's  phrase in the collaborative effort of literary criticism this honest bafflement has a significant role to play  it leads to a healthy discussion of a literary and critical assumptions and to certain important clarifications  the bafflement of the western readers with regard to raja rao's  fiction for instance particularly serpent and the rope  and uh one word and shakespear uh for instance inspired professor narasimaih and dr na m k naik uh narasimiah and dr m k naik's excellent analyses of uh raja rao's works  what is important is the livingness of the critical process  which ultimately cannot be dis dissociated   from the process of culture or life in general  thanks to the fact that indian writing in english  is easily accessible to the western english speaking and english knowing world because of the medium the western response has grown into a tradition to such an extent that the western and australian critics can carry on their dialogue on indian writing in english without reference to indian critics at all  no other indian literature enjoys this exposure to the outside world which therefore tends to equate indian writing in english with indian literature  this has created an anomalous situation  in commonwealth studies literary conferences and festivals  it is this indian writing in english that gets  national representation  what is of relevance to the uh question we are discussing in this seminar is the fact that the western response is a positive factor  in the development of indo-english literature and criticism  with its enthusiasm its over estimation with its quest for indianness for indian philosophical and esoteric speculations for indian sociological pecularities with its bafflements and limitations  with its habits of close reading in search of deeper layers of meaning  the western response adds a new dimension to our own critical awareness which it keeps alive and kicking all the time   let's now move uh uh to the pole represented in term in the term indian  this uh of great signi significance  in the context of the critical climate that we have been talking about because it is the it is the uh centripetal movement towards the roots  as far as indian writing in english is concerned the first  uh big uh movement is to be discovered in sri aurobindo's  criticism of his own poems and his critical remarks on fellow poetic poets like tagore  then i have uh talked about aurobindo and how i mean during the pre-independence period uh he was uh a a a an indian critic very conscious of his indianess and uh he knew his western  poet and western critics uh but still he has uh great faith in the kind of uh new uh poetry that he was writing in epics like uh  savitri  uh yesterday i talked about uh this and so i don't want to repeat this  the attainment of independence was followed by a certain  uneasiness towards english and indo eng  anglian literature as it was then called  uh a certain ambivalence of attitude towards english still continues though indo-english literature gained gradual acceptance during the late fiftees and the sixtees  the rise of the commonwealth the concept of other literatures in english uh the multiplication of uh universities and university departments of english are some of the factor that changed the climate for the development of indian writing in english  yesterday also i i referred to the the uh the multiplication of university departments of english because of which  i mean the indian writing in english uh got a special place uh as far as research is concerned  the growth of the thesis industry demanded complete exploitation of the nearest and the most easily available area of research the increase in the u g c and university supported seminars  this is one of them uh conferences journals created a suitable climate for intense critical activity in the area of indian writing in english  the pioneering work of professor k r narsimh uh k r srinivas iyengar uh in this area opened new vistas of critical studies and research  first the problem of english as a creative medium was thrashed out after tremendous warfare of passions and the value of indo-english literature in the new national context of emergent indian literatures in re regional  languages was questioned and after a good deal of uh discussion it has been accepted to use professor narasimaih's words   not in a not as an exotic plant but as an expression of a distinctive sensibility which is indian
