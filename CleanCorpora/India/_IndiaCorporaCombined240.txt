may it please your honour  now this is a case in which originally there were five accused persons  there were five accused persons  and the police was able to get the presence of only three persons they could arrest three persons  so we have started with the case against these three accused  two have clarified right from beginning interruption they are not there no one of them  thereafter your honour was pleased to frame a charge against them on two accounts the charges execute them  interruption  against three persons interruption  three accounts interruption  which is that charge number sir ? interruption  that is there that i'll i'll i will be giving up that charge sir thirty seventh read is bombay police act for that purpose i have not laid the evidence sir  because in order to prove the charge under bombay police act  it is necessary for the prosecution to show that the promolgation  order was duly exhibited and it was promulgated in various parts and not only that but there was it was specially also there interruption yes yes the bandra police station then i have to examine the constable i have to examine the police officer i have to produce the diary entries showing all those things which has not been done in this particular case  therefore as it has cou code  number three two words your honour can take it that the prosecution has not laid any evidence on that account  therefore now the first charge is that your accused number one two three along with absconding accused motu mota umesh and kadam on or about the third day of april nineteen eighty-eight at about eleven ten hours in presence of the common intention at open place near harbour railway line   shun shunting track pragati nagar  matunga dharavi bombay at nine committed murder by intentionally  and all knowingly causing the death of iyengar  silkrumal pandu and thereby committed an offence punishable under section three naught two read with section thirty-four of the indian penal code and within the cognizance of this court  now second this is one charge of murder  murder in respect of iyengar  second charge is under section three nought seven sir  that charge is that you accused number one two three  along with the absconding accused umesh and kadam  on about third april on the same day at about eleven thirty-five in presence of common intention did an act of causing with  rampuri knife and koyta causing heart attack near government milk booth opposite madrasis masjid dr ambedkar road matunga bombay with such intent interruption  ahn with such intention and under such circumstances that if by that act you had caused the death of kadu hosappa achari kadu hosappa achari you would have been guilty of murder but the kadu he is survived and therefore  and that you caused the hurt to the two words and thereby committed an offence punishable under section three nought seven of the indian penal code with read with section thirty-four of the indian penal code and within the cognizance of your honours court sir  now therefore there are two charges one charge  interruption yes interruption because i have not laid any  interruption in entire view  no evidence has been laid  therefore as we got third cause prosecution itself is that they have not proved the third charge because no evidence was there on the third charge sir  now your honour as far as the background of this case is concerned actual interruption actually we started recording the evidence on fourteenth october ninety-two  prior to that this case went from various courts to various courts and thereafter ultimately it came to this court sir  till then the accused prevent at the trial court from commencing the trial sir interruption did not allowed  interruption  they made all efforts to see that the accused that the advocates are made to run away  they would say that we don't want these advocates we don't want that advocates and ultimately even the court also cancelled those prosecutors they made allegations against the court also  all types of allegations were made and subsequently the case has come to this court  moment the case came to our court we we immediately framed the charge and started with an assertion proceeded from day to day  right upto eighteen december  on eighteen december ninety-two i closed my case  thereafter it was expected that immediately your honour will  take upto thirtieth  that your honour has done  and after two words judgement of the accused it was expected that i should start with the argument and the defence should do immediately commence with their arguments  unfortunately mr seth the defence advocate on behalf of number two and three went out of bombay making a promise to this court  that he is going to give a written argument or if he is not  then he will come and argue himself and at the most it will take another two or three months so your honour was to give then didn't  interruption by march interruption  and he said that but he promised that even prior to that  he would send the written argument so the interruption   haan they have got this to say  but nothing of this kind kind was done   it's only about couple of weeks that only two or three weeks back that he happened to be here in bombay and that is how we have fixed up this particular date for argue  therefore lot of delay has been caused in recording the evidence and the arguments because we started with the  recording of the evidence on fourteenth october and on now on fifteenth september i'm arguing the matter  therefore i'm sorry that i will have to take your honour through the evidence of each witness because nobody is expected it is not expected the court to remember what evidence was laid one year back practically one year back  so i will have to go through each and every witness read the evidence and thus start commenting on it  so i will start with the first witness p w one sir  interruption  in all in all in this particular case are examine  twenty-four prosecution interruption witnesses  to divide this into two separate compartments because some of the witnesses will be in respect of murder some will be in respect of the second charge interruption and some witnesses will be common witnesses namely when both both the accused both the persons were taken to hospital the same constable there he made diary entries etcetera  so there would be some common witnesses sir  then regarding scene of offence and all these thing some common witnesses will be there  so now we'll i'll start reading p w one sir so that will give the list of f i r  if your honour wants this facts i'll give the this facts sir interruption  now this has not been done in chronological order  we have not examined the witnesses in a chronological order  therefore some witnesses are pertaining to first charge immediately some pertaining to second charge  so whichever witness was available those witnesses were brought by the officers because the accused as i have said  in the beginning when i open up the case i said that these accused are notorious type kind of notorious character bad character  accused  and witnesses were afraid of coming  so the police officer mr ansari and other officers they had to take lot of pains to go and collect them search them and then get them here in the court  so it which ever is available i started examining  so normally otherwise what happens normally our practice is a a all prosecutors that  when we find that there is charge of murder then we start examining all the witnesses regarding that particular charge in a chronological order  then three nought seven same order and then some common things  doctors etcetera they are all common thing which are there  but in this case unfortunately for the prosecution it was not possible because victims were afraid they were running away and the officer has to go get them locate them and then they were brought here interruption  yes because they were afraid running away means they were they made themslves scared to the police officer  the moment they found that some officer from dharavi police station interruption  the people are interested but unfortunately for the prosecution  two accused are were abscounding and they are still abscounding  and and those accu accused persons has a gang and this gang was moving in that area with the use of this  tho constant fear in the minds of witnesses that these two other persons may not directly but through some other persons may attack them and therefore they were not willing to come interruption these interruption of course this gang consisted of this main five persons out of which two are now ab ab   absconding interruption ah yes  and apart from those those two persons again formed another gang because these three persons were not there they formed another gang  but then they were not directly coming in dharavi area they were sending those persons in dharavi area because they knew the moment they come to dharavi area these officers from dharavi police station ansari  and other other jadhav they will definitely arrest them because they would arrest them  therefore they would not come personally  they would send their other gundas there in that locality to settle everything interruption  and therefore this is the this therefore when i read the evidence some of the witnesses will be for first account some of the witnesses of second account  so i will then up subsequently while concluding the argument cough i will see that all those witnesses are i will  some arrange and then i will say that i will point out the exact interruption haan  then i will say therefore in this case this is the scene regarding this this witness is regarding this  that we can register afterwards  so therefore i will now start with the p w one cough  now the important point in this particular case is that this incident that taken place on the on the on sunday  it was on sunday third october   i'm sorry third april sir was sunday  interruption no third sir  it was third april nineteen eighty-eight interruption  haan nineteen eighty-eight  it was sunday and it was in the morning at about eleven ten  eleven ten or so morning time interruption  at an open place near harbour railway line shunting track  that was the interruption  so i am i am talking about the first offence of murder  interruption  so now was of the interruption masjid masjid  so now what i am giving is the first offence of murder took place first  so therefore i am giving this place interruption  at open place near harbour railway line  interruption matunga  harbour railway line shunting track  this track which was not operated except for shunting purposes  pragati nagar hutment at matunga sir one word  but interruption dharavi sir interruption no it comes in dharavi sir  and now as it has this is the incident regarding murder of  iyengar and now i'm giving the timing of the  other persons  that is uh kaju kadu   hosappa achari regarding three naught seven there the timing is about eleven thirty interruption  no because we have started with the evid i am why i am  tak talking about this because the p w one is kadu achari when i read the evidence i'll  be reading the the evidence of kadu achari  therefore i'm giving the timing sir   kadu hosappa achari interruption because we started with the evidence of kadu achari p w therefore  i'm giving this first these particular timing sir  so this incidence took place at the masjid dr ambedkar raod opposite some madras maderesa maderesa   ka kazi masjid ambedkar road matunga and this took place at about eleven thirty sir  now there is a connection between this murder and that murder in the sense that iyengar happened to be the  brother-in-law of achari   iyengar who was dead was murdered was the brother-in-law of the witness achari interruption  he is husband of his sister  i will tell your honour why i examined this achari  person
