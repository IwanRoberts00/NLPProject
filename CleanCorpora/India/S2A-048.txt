mr vice chancellor  mr narayana rao  distinguished
members of the faculty  ladies and gentlemen 
""
you know the great advantage of being chief election commissioner of
india  is that in the last few days and a last few months i have been
able to achieve  life long ambitions 
""
only last week i achieved the life long ambition of entering into
the stella  mary's  college in madras   laughter 
""
and today  i have achieved the ambition of getting into the
central institute of english and foreign languages 
""
a  kind of  place of education academics and learning 
which would normally frown upon any bureaucrats  much more a bureaucrat
whose name is synonymous with controversy 
""
the vice chancellor has been good enough  or bad enough not to
give me a subject   laughter 
""
in the trade  which i follow once i get hold of the mike you
don't let go off it easily 
""
so if i don't let go off the mike  kamal narayan will show me
some little  symbols to show that it is getting late and that his blood
pressure is rising   laughter 
""
mr narayana rao gave you  an introduction about myself
""
he said many nice things he said so many nice things that i thought
he was describing somebody else   laughter 
""
he didn't tell you that i wrote the s s l c exam what used to be
the end of school exam twice   laughter and applause 
""
he did not tell you that i wrote what in those days days the plus
two exam used to be called the intermediate  i wrote that twice  
laughter 
""
and when k subramaniam taught me english at the madras christian
college  in march nineteen fifty-one i wrote the english preliminary exam
for the physics honors twice   laughter 
""
so how can you invite a person of this kind of academic
qualification to the most outstandingly academic circmustances  of the
central institute of english and foreign languages
""
no no no i forgot to tell you  i wrote those exams twice each
year  because the question papers had leaked   laughter and
applause 
""
nineteen  nineteen forty-seven was the first time the s s l c
queation papers leaked in madras 
""
nineteen forty-nine was the first year  in which the
intermediate question papers leaked in madras
""
nineteen fifty  was the first time when a honors degree
preliminary examination question paper  be it english or something else
 leaked in madras 
""
so i wrote most of them twice
""
i am not going to tell you my academic abilities because  they
are part of the history of an extinguished civil servant 
""
i have been in bonded labour with government for thirty-six years
from april nineteen fifty-five till december of nineteen ninety  when 
in a moment of  extraordinary carelessness  the then prime minister put
me into this job  despite the warning   laughter  of a previous
prime minister who said this gentleman will still live to rule the day they
make you chief election commissioner 
""
""
he did 
""
""
he did 
""
roughly two and half years later speaking on the floor of
parliament in february ninety-two mr chandrasekhar the former prime minister
said    i've  done many  serious mistakes in my life
none has been so serious  as the appointment of mr seshan as the chief
election commissioner    laughter and applause 
""
i have a feeling  that mr  chandrasekhar's  feeling
towards me are slightly less frozen now  because  more recently i have
noticed the sign of thaw 
""
you  basically are a set of teachers  teachers and 
teacher's  teachers and  teacher's   teacher's  teachers
""
""
and who am i to speak to you about  ?
""
what am i to speak to you about  ?
""
the vice chancellor to some degree  and mr narayan rao to a
greater degree spoke of india and its democracy 
""
when you talk of  india's  democracy  you can hold your
head up in  great pride and say  where else  in the world do
you get the democracy of this kind  
""
on the first of july last about two three months ago  india's
 population was nine hundred and nineteen million people 
""
of that about a five hundred and fifty million were voters above
the age of eighteen
""
anybody who is above the age of eighteen who is an indian citizen
 who is not a confirmed lunatic and who has not been declared disqualified
by some law  is entitled to be a voter  and he is entitled to be a
voter in a particular place if he is ordinarily resident in that place
""
that is what the law says 
""
the law was not passed by me it was passed in nineteen  fifty
 when i was still studying physics 
""
when we run a full national election in this country we run the
election in eight hundred thousand polling booths  man by four million
civilian employees at the rate of five  per polling booth
""
 we're  going to shortly make it six 
""
why are you suddenly increasing it five to six  ?
""
because we are going to have compulsorily atleast one  woman
polling officer in each booth 
""
so that mr lalu yadav  who told the t v last week only 
""
he said  in hindi   laughter  who will be a lady 
 laughter 
""
and mr lalu yadav will not be unhappy 
""
so i was saying  we use four million employees in addition
to that  we use a million and half policemen outside  all kinds of
policemen state policemen state armed policemen state reserved policemen 
uh state home guards policemen  state every kind of policemen  central
policemen central reserve police border security force indo-tibetan border
police  central industrial security force railway protection force  
laughter  any number of forces  we use one and half million policemen
to run a full election in this country  
""
when parliament run its election in nineteen ninety-one a few
months after i became the chief election commissioner  we had nine
thousand candidates for five hundred and odd parliamentary seats 
""
but what an average of about eighteen candidates per seat there
were some seats in which  there were even a hundred candidates were 
per constituency 
""
in one part of india not necessarily for a parliament seat for an
assembly seat  in tamil nadu at a place called araba puruchi we had three
hundred and seventy candidates  for the assembly seat
""
so that the ballet did not look  like a sheet out of  india's
  todays newspaper  it looked like todays edition of the newspaper
  laughter 
""
when parliament election runs in a normal course if there are nine
thousand candidates we consume twenty thousand tons of high quality paper
 and to each and every polling booth we reach seventy-five items  like
alice in wonderland  of ships and shoes and sealing wax of cabbages and
things of why the sea is boiling lots of ballet boxes  and ballet papers
and sealing wax and the  melting wax and wires and threads and uh  all
kinds of things hurricane lantern  if the andhra pradesh electricity board
to switch off electricity don't worry i can reach you without benefit of mike
  laughter 
""
seventy-five items are reached to everyone of this places not all
of them are easily accessible  to motorise transport there are places
where only the camel can reach as in jaisalmer  or in bahmer or in sawai
madhavpur 
""
there are places like not only in ladakh  or kargil  but
also in lahore and  spity  where only the largest helicopter of the
indian force  the mig twenty-five can reach those polling booths  with
the polling party and the polling material
""
there are parts of the  sunderban's  jungle were only
elephant back will reach
""
there are parts of the island territories  which only a boat
would reach 
""
and thanks to the extraordinary  good arrangements made by
distinguished predecessors of mine  i've  had eight predecessors 
i'm  the nineth chief election commissioner of india 
""
those arrangements are so good  that they are  the eighth
wonder of the world   laughter 
""
make no laughing statement about it 
""
hold your head high 
""
adult franchise was introduced at the point of time at which 
india's  literacy was less than twenty percent 
""
today  gentlemen in-charge of education programmes in different
parts of the country put out lie after lie after lie  all of governments
programmes are called crash programmes because they all crash  
laughter 
""
crash programme in english education do you conduct those  ?
 laughter and applause 
""
crash programme in rat elimination   laughter 
""
every crash every programme is called  ra  crash programme
in malaria eradication crash programme in  women's  environment 
everything is called a crash programme 
""
but today at the end of all kinds of crash programmes literacy
amongst women in bihar is still about four to five percent 
""
the chief minister will be angry to hear me say so
""
he says  it is ten percent  
""
doesn't matter  i'll  concede ten percent 
""
in haryana they say  it has reached thirty percent 
""
but brides are largely  for burning  still in haryana 
""
in haryana brides are largely still for burning 
""
if they don't produce a son they are burnt if they don't produce
dowry they are burnt 
""
generally if they don't like the  dau  daughters-in-law they
are burnt 
""
first burn the daughter-in-law then ask the question  
laughter 
""
in  their jest   our fore-fathers  the founding
fathers of our constitution decided to endow upon the people of this country
adult franchise that anybody who was twenty-one at that time now converted to
eighteen in the last four or five years  has the right to elect the
government of this people  of this country 
""
when you talk of india   you're  talking of indian
democracy you talk of india  what is the picture of india that you get
 ?
""
the picture of india taught to our children in our schools today
most of you are english teachers you don't know this but go and sit in
english class and the history classes  whether in college or in school
are there any history teachers here  ?
""

""
in fact there are twenty-five states and six union territories and
one national capital territory of delhi  there are chief minister and
there are air bus cabinets and eyebrow cabinets and air bus three twenty
cabinets in these places 
""
they teach you  about the greatness of my literature in telugu
and my literature in tamil and my literature in kannada  and my literature
in marathi and my literature in gujrathi and my literature in something 
""
 there's  hardly anybody to teach  any of my children
 my literature  in india 
""
but that is not all  the history you got to teach people in
this country  in bad english
""
if you go to the history classes  mr ashoka dugged wells and he
builded hospitals   laughter 
""
that is the kind of history being taught  you know what is the
use of giving only the english teachers to this class what about the history
teacher who gets into the class and dictates notes saying  ashoka
dugged wells  and he builded hospitals  
""
justice india evoking you  a feeling of an india  which
made my  grandfather's   grandfather's  grandfather look at a
little pot of water  and say  in sanskrit 
""
that was long before somebody said kaveri is my  grandfather's
 river  or my  grandmother's  river 
""
today you and i have been taught  english must be abolished
 the local language should be brought in   in hindi  
laughter and applause 
""
have you taught the children of this country the greatness of this
country where there is a part of the country  which get five hundred and
fifty inches of rain per year and still has drinking water problem for five
months in the year  because they have rendered the total topography 
similar to my head   laughter 
""

annual rainfall is two inches  ?
""
do you know the rann of kuch where only the white wild ass  and
the red flemingo are available ?
""

alone lives  ?
""
do you know the rain forest of kerala and of arunachal  where
botanical and uhm  zoological diversity  is at its acme of completion
 ?
""
not of perfection but of completion 
""

""
you teach them  that the kakatiyas were in warangal  and the
chalukyas were in badami 
""
fact what lot of good it does to me  to know that kakatiya were
in warangal and therefore warangal university is named after kakatiya  is
that right  ?  laughter 
""
oh fact lot of good it does to me if somebody comes and says
 what is the kakatiya  ? 
""
now if  i'm  especially when the  doordarshan
 prouncer prounces it 
""
you don't know whether she is speaking english or french or what
foreign language she is speaking   laughter 
""
our education system to which i shall come back  which is going
to be the theme of what i want to say today  is the greatest tragedy
which is available in this country today
""
or in their greater tragedy there are  there are any number of
tragedies in this country  and those of you  who're  standing i
recommend warmly that you sit down  otherwise you will get tired  
laughter
