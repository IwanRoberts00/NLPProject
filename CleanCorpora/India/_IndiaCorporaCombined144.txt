good morning  professor savitri laxmanan is a congress-i member of parliament representing mukundapuram of kerala in the lok sabha  this is her first term as a member of parliament  her entry to into politics have  has been fairly recent  infact she joined politics less than three years ago  professor laxmanan is basically a teacher by profession and continues to be so  she is professor and head of department of malyalam   at the st joseph's college at eranjilakuda in mukundapuram  she is also an accomplished playwright and a dramatist  she has written two books one of which is a collection of one act plays  professor laxmanan has also been associated with all india radio for almost sixteen years now  professor laxmanan can you describe mukundapuram to us your constituency  why not mr hemant  mukundapuram is a place so nice  it may attract so many people  uh i think it's outside appearance is uh extra beautiful in all senses  there is uhm one place called one word  which can be converted into a best tourist centre   one word includes my constituency  and and there is another place called malaytoor and  malaytoor attracts so many pilgrims  and one irykod near the famous kudvillur devi  temple  uh and it is supposed that st thomas came first to this place  in india  he landed at irykod says so the history  and irykod is very near to that devi  temple kudvillur and uh kudvillur devi is supposed to came from that kannagi   you've heard the story of kannagi ? not really ? uh kannagi also is related to south india  that may be the reason you've not heard or to  she is a powerful goddess uhm uhm  and uh about my own place in srinelkuda there is a famous temple kudmadikum shree kudmadikum temple  in which lord bharda is the deity and lord bharda uh  and no other places in india there is lord bharda  only at yetinedkuda people says so  but beyond all this mukundapuram is very poor and in  it's living uh people are very poor there  uh or probably too old or to meet the both ends meet  uh so many are labourers and they find it very difficult to earn their livelihood  but they are trying somehow or other and they expect me to help them  and uh though even though it is very beautiful with lakes rivers paddy fields trees etcetra etcetra we've to uh supply some food to them   that's right you were saying before uh we to me here that there is no such place as mukundapuram on the map is it true ? uh there's is a small village it is it is known as mukundapuram but uh no notable place in this mean mukundapuram uhm uhm but constituency is named liked that mukundapuram  uh it is connected uh with an old story that lord mukunda  this vishnu had great place in some good old days  uhm uhm and the place is named after lord mukunda  mukundapuram puram means town town of mukunda  uhm uhm  uhm uhm  in your five year term here uhm what you really plan to do for your constituency ?  uhm  i want to do a lot for my people  but i don't know whether all my hopes will be fulfilled or not  and i know very well that uh all the needs of the people can not be fulfilled by my by me alone  but i want to do something for the ordinary people  by helping in some way or other   i'll do my best to  one or two words  uhm uhm  the teaching community and also that of students they must also be looking forward to you to help from you of many kinds  then i'll help and allow them  what can you do for them as as an m p ?  and  to my all students i think uh i lost my students  this is the only grief i have now  i lost the good field of teaching uhm uhm  it was so nice in my college with my students and my colleague  but i do i love one word  do you uh want to go back to teaching full time ?  that's a que a very difficult question to answer i don't know exactly  uh people in my party ask me you you are not contesting this election   that's why i came into politics and uh truly speaking i love all the topics in between sky and earth  and i love politics too  and i take it as a challenge  and for the first time i was facing an election  fortunately or unfortunately i won  and now uh i take my constituency as my institution to which i'm so fond of  i think uhm now mukundapuram constituency is my st joseph college  one thing uh now that you've become member of parliament uhm has the attitude of your students or that of your collegues changed towards you ?  uhm  uhm i think no  do they notice a change in you ? i don't know  uh i want to be with them uh in the what i want to say   i'm the old savitri laxmanan among them  i see  certainly  and i'm sure that they'll consider me as their old savitri laxmanan uhm uhm   you've written two books one of which is the collection of short one act plays  uhm  tell us a little more about these books that you've  written   uhm  uh act one of it uh one of them is a collection of short stories uh sorry exclusively one act plays uhm uhm  and other is full fledged drama  uhm uhm  uhm uhm  uh and uh drama is published by national book store  uhm uhm   it's a reputed firm in kerala uhm uhm  it is published some fifteen or sixteen years back  and i got some prizes for the script uhm uhm  from kerala sangeet natak academy   uhm um and it is broadcasted through all india radio  to one word is one from trivandrum  uhm uhm   uhm uhm  uhm uhm and i took the female part uhm in my own drama   uhm  i think it's a rare oppurtunity for a woman artist   i'm sure it must be  how long has been your association with all india radio  ? uh i too may for the past fifteen or sixteen years i was participating in radio plays uhm uhm   i'm approved as a staff artist there in  all india radio trichur  they used to take i used to participate in some of the plays uhm uhm   you've also done discussions for them  haan some discussions some talks   uhm uhm some speeches etcetera   uhm uhm   you're a teacher by profession  one thing i would like to definitely ask you is about your  opinion on the education policy do you think there should be a uniform education policy for the whole nation ? what i know of course mr hemant the education must be uniform  but it it's not practical i think  why do you think so ? there are so many who seek higher education  but i think ours is a poor country  for that uh we're unable to fulfill the hopes of the  rising students  so private schools must be encouraged in my opinion uhm uhm  i say so because in my state there are some who says that all must be uhm government oriented education  private school must be abolished from the field  but i don't think so because in our state private school and private colleges are doing a lot for the students  they're not making second rate citizens sort but that uh when that is some round about now a days our school rise people say these schools are creating second rate citizens  i feel that is what i think do you also think the medium of instruction ah  should be uniform or that uh the three tier system that now exist  is all right ?  ah  uhm we've to give due importance to the both language english one or two word  in my case too i bid farewell to this uh international language from one word back because i'm a professor of my original language malyalam  and i used to talk and write always in malyalam and now i almost forgot english but when i became an m p english is the only force through which i can communicate my ideas uhm  so also with the other m p's   uhm  some of them knew very well hindi because hindi is their mother tongue  but they are unaware of the fact that happens in in the south the sole reason is that they are not uh uh trying to  learn or write this english so english could be the link language in my opinion and then hindi our national language  that must be also given due importance  and i'm trying to learn hindi  now uh you are also based in delhi uhm  and when the ses when the parliament is in session you've  to be hear ah  how how difficult or how easy is it for you to communicate here  ? when you are here  uhm   ah  i always depend upon my little english  are you also comfortable   and i uh i've said i'm  trying to learn hindi  have you started   i've a servant who only spoke  hindi uhm uhm  and uh i too learn uh thoda thoda  hindi from her  that's very nice uhm   i'm sure she will be   uhm   i know uh from this kuch nahi malum to kya to kya that's all  i'm sure one day  and i uh bought my uhm little daughters book she is doing studying in fifth standard  and in my state fifth standard onwards hindi starts  and i bought her books and i read and write  uh yeh kalam hai yeh kitab hai laughs   that's very nice  now you've spoken of your daughter  it must be uh a fairly uh tough task for you to manage your school college your family and now this uh new thing of being a member of parliament  how do you manage it ?  it's i can't extend very difficult for me to part with my family  uhm but i've to  during uh lok sabha sessions is going on   i'll be here at delhi and i'll be back at my constituency whenever i i'm needed there  and of course if there is no meeting is going on here at delhi i can be at srinelkuda back with my people and with my family and somehow or other they're managing  they rise upto the moment i think uh i am sure  my husband will look after all such things in my absence i think  that's very nice   i'm sure you consider the entire student and teaching community as one family  as a family that uh is really closely knit   i'm very glad that you could come here and share some experiences with us  thank you very much for being with us thank you mr hemant
