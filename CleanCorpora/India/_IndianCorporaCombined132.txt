 one or two words laid down their lives in the last twelve month  and since nineteen sixty-nine when six brave policemen patrolling in leh were ambushed and killed by the chinese  but such acts of courage have not really altered the public image of the police  ask any ordinary citizen of the country and a city dweller  or uh a peasant in a village or indeed women and they will tell you  that police have quite sincerely tried to enchained them at the level of interaction of the ordinary citizen and the police why this is so ? is change really possible ? is it impossible ? why things not changing ? who is at fault ? who is to blame ? to answer these and several other question we have a hand picked and distinguished panel mr m n jacob state home minister mr soli sorabjee eminent eminent supreme court advocate and former attorney general and mr t anantchari who is director general of the border security force  so you are two words we can start with you  you have been a consistant and unsaving critic of the government  and also of the police and you have said that there've been many human rights violation  why have you been saying this ? well uh human rights violation i would  concentrate upon specially the method and the procedure that the police employ in investigation at the time of crime  one of the things which we commonly find is the use of  third degree method  sometimes even the recourse to torture in extracting statements and extracting confessions   there're constitutional prohibition against it  when even the criminal procedure code has provisions against the use of such methods  but in actual practice these constitutional provisions are really  two words  then one of the reasons which i find because i've also friends in the police force  i know the one word we should understand their problems  their difficulties they have to cope with not ordinary criminals  but today these criminals are very well armed they have sophisticated technique  so one of the uhm excuses reasons to give forward is  it's not possible to deal with harden criminals   it's not practical to investigate these cases unless  we have recourse to these methods mr jackob is it possible or is it not possible to deal with hardened criminals without using third degree method ? i think it is a mixed reaction because it is not suppose to be a torturous method or a third degree method  but at the same time there do come across some instances  where uh unwanted methods are also adopted  and may be it has certain various reasons  we will have to find the solutions now   i i i will project it like this  that we have to have more of team trained well trained in this task of investigation or extracting the truth  modern methods will have to be used  then there will be more simplified one word  the coarse methods are rotten  sometimes as a hang-over of past when you were not having  any thing of that sort  but by and large it's it's a all not a general complaint it is an image that is projected outside  but i don't agree that totally it is true but there are cases but it is refreshing to have the government admit that uh  coarse methods are used by the police mr anantchari  well i think this problem you cannot uh discuss in isolation i would like to say first of all there can be no two opinion about the need to eradicate third degree method  police cannot adopt it as a method of that's the method or as a policy  having such reason i would like to say that police cannot function diverse from the cultural one word of the society  the legal system the restrictions that it imposes  first of all i would like to say when i say cultural one word  of society  there is uh that i am permitted to say we are having double standard in our society  they would say one thing in law  they expect something else to be done   e it depends on who is affected and who is wanting to police one word  i think that is the point we've got to understand we cannot run away a few words totally secondly in our country everybody seems to be in great hurry and want results  and when it when they want results from themselves they would like to adopt their own method  and then the police becomes uh important hand made  this is one aspect of it  secondly you want to run the society on modern basis on terms of modern terms of modern concept with a law which is totally hackneyed  i do not know if very many of us know that the institution called the fir this institution called the fir first information report is peculiar to the sub-continent  nowhere else in the world do you have it  once you write something in the fir it becomes impossible to  even the telling the truth to get out of it  so you will have to often to satisfy the courts add up  the evidence to see that what you said in the fir uh come through the investigation i think it is a very big  third is we must also when you think of police image  you think of police as part of the total criminal justice system  thus they have the criminal justice system improve has it uh soli  in fact i think that specially is relevent  improvement in the criminal justice system is nothing to do to  sanction tolerate mitigate and absolve the police from the use of methods which are not correct  i appreciate what mr anantachari has said about the double standard but what he meant by double standards and people want results is really the two words of the police  orders come from political bosses from people in authority to see there one of their cousins and one of their friends who is being investigated two words  policemen says baba kya karega order  ho gaya  there are exceptions  there are some bail source  another way the order comes when they want their political rivals to be arrested order goes to the police station and the orders are carried out so i entirely agree about the double standards and i think the real if i must say so one word of the police is the politicisation of the police  and that must stop  because many unconstitutional illegal commands are carried out  just in order not to get into trouble they may be transferred they may be suspended  but criminal justice system has not improved by means one or two words  the delays in the criminal justice system investigation as part of the criminal system justice system  and if the investigation is not covered the investigations is not  one word naturally we won't have a sucessful prosecution of the criminal yeah soli politicisation is there i was just trying to uh see through your word politicisation  because uh my experience i think that there is not politicisation as people imagine because every political party come to the police  everyone has a faith in police  and even in india the states and states differ in political systems seldom changes  so everyone come to uh power  one party or other  and the police had to follow a middle course  they are not pressurise by the politicians  even if the pressure goes police is not listening to a politician because it is the system  but i see the very fact that all the party people or politicians are relying on the police  irrespective of nature of the government i think though there is some truth sometimes someone may   one word it but it may not be a genuine case that there is the politicisation of the police force in india i beg to differ from one word   but  mr jacob what you're saying is that all political parties manipulate the police  as far as one or two words i am not picking out one political party what you are saying comes to these all politicians no no i am the i think they're well independent in their own investigation well i wish that was true  i don't blame the police mr anantachari why don't you one word  in fact in fact i thought i should appropriately get an opportunity to one word  you will have it right now   because because the whole thing arouse out of my statement which are in two parts one when i mentioned about the criminal justice system and second about double standard  this double standard i related to the cultural one word  in the society as a whole  it is if you ask me it is not merely the politicians  it is a neighbour if your house is burgled so long as his house is not burgled  the neighbour will keep quiet  when his house is burgled he does not mind the police using any method to get his things howsoever   correct  so i am only this this runs through our society  and i must say as a policeman as a well meaning policeman  as a policeman who would like to live within the system and reform it if there are reforms required with a high sense of motivation  uh i would like to say that this is uh i think which is a very important uh factor that hampers the police that is the one  and not this kind of effort would policeman change  second i must also clarify was the criminal justice system  today there is no point uh in saying that uh police role should change  i think the police have to change a lot there is no doubt about it  there are good people there are like any other organisation  institutions there are also bad people  but only thing supposed to be accountable to law  if the judiciary the judicial process has functioned properly and i am very sure we'll have very well behaved police  today there is so much of tolerance so much of one word  so much of uh looseness in the entire judicial process that you see when i say judicial process it started it is uh something you will form to find at all the levels of judiciary  whether it is prosecution whether it is defence whether it is uh administration of justice so therefore i feel that police is only one of the links of  one word system  and it is the one that is the cutting edge but mr anantachari before we loose track of politicians  would you say that politicians apply pressure on the police or don't they  ? you see politicians may or may not apply  but it is upto the police officer i i would like to say that i have this holding important charges as sp dig dig cid in the state various jobs  politicians have continued with this one word  they have tried to also put some pressure  but it did not do and explained to them most of the time they did not interfere  and if you kept your end clean i think very few politicians really try to interfere with you   it's a question of it's it's a double game that is what the politicians wants and what you want to play i think both have to one word   soli what is in your experience  i think we repeat itself of course if we say so the fact of the matter is pressure is a fact and money two words politician don't think even politician even the industrialist capitalist people wealthy people people who built ill-terms and power  they do trap  let me ask one question  why is it that despite of so called failure of the criminal justic system a citizen will certainly go with more confidence into a court of law before a magistrate than before a police ? why is it that no woman will dare to go to a police station alone  ? why is it that the landless labourers especially the schedule caste is directed he will not dream of going to a police station ?  i'm talking of rural areas  the reason is and i don't say that why do you why don't you let mr jacob   a few words  i i'll complete the question the reason is the perception  may be it is an exaggerated perception  but it is there that the police is not our friend and an ally  police is an instrument of the system and that system is oppressive as far as the landless as far as the deprived sections are concerned mr jacob would you say the police is for the rich  no i'm i'm i am afraid that i may not be able to agree with sorabji though i've i've  tremendous respect for him as a lawyer  but yes every police station in india is almost crowd of these all these people who are who are affected someway or other  the women the backward the weaker section  i don't think they are afraid of going to a police station  they don't go to the police station the first thing they will do is to go to the police station and report the crime whatever happened  then of course we have go to the court so i think by and large the police stations are crowded  and the policemen's workload is also very heavy  correct uhn  but mr jacob please ask the several ngo's  non-governemntal organizations who appear on behalf of landless labour one word workers you will get more precise information and statistics from them as to how they really fear entering a police station  may be you may be right in saying but there is no reason for the fear  but the whole impression that has been built up in some of the areas is landlords vested interest are in cohout with the police
