see my   name  is  susheela padmanabhan  from
cochin 
""
 i'd  like to  deal with agriculture  in india 
""
do you  ?
""
""
 uh  
""
""
yes i feel that  i'm  interested in    too 
agriculture 
""
""
 too  
""
""
then  can you suggest  to  me something about 
the development of agriculture during this    age  in this 
age  and this year  ?
""
""
 at this stage  
""
""
no
""
""
then 
""
""
i think so that  agriculture is not more  important at
this stage  due to the   uhn  climate   uhn 
climatic conditions   uhn  because i found  that  before
just two months back   uh  just one month time   uhn 
that it was not   rain   raining   very heavily 
 uh  see the monsoon was not  that much perfect   uhn 
""
actually what the crops needed   uhn  i feel like that
""
""
 uhn  
""
""
 uhn  
""
""
 uhn  
""
""
 uh  
""
""
 uhn  
""
""
 uh  
""
""
 uhn  
""
""
 uhn  
""
""
uhm 
""
""
but now it has uh  the monsoon has started    uhm
 to a  middle  extend i feel
""
""
 uhm  
""
""
uhm  uhn   i'm  going to talk about the
development  we want  in especially in india when  are 
comparing india with other   countries  
""
i want to know more about the development  how we can develop
our own  crops   uhm 
""
now it is we are depending   more  more   for 
 on     othe  other countries we are depending now a
days   uhm 
""
but i want to  have idea  how we can develop our agriculture
in india  with our own   efforts  
""
how we can keep  our own crops  means now a days that  uh
biological  experiments are going on   ahn  and we are totally
 changing our crops  all this uh  biological experiments  we are
grafting  we are taking other  crops   uh  to develop it
more and more  to uhm  produce more size uhn   uhm  that you
  may be  knowing 
""
""
 countries  
""
""
 uhm  
""
""
 more  
""
""
 uhm  
""
""
 efforts  
""
""
 ahn  
""
""
 uh  
""
""
 uhm  
""
""
but uh
""
""
but i feel   uhn  you told me about the crop 
 uhm  much depends upon the soil 
""
""
 uhn  
""
""
 uhm  
""
""
soil 
""
""
soil 
""
""
uhn 
""
""
okay  each one soil differs    uhm  and each
one chemical fertilizers differ
""
""
 uhm  
""
""
uhm 
""
""
chemicals were being used    uhm  for growing the
crops
""
""
 uhm  
""
""
yeah 
""
""
i feel like that
""
""
uhm uhm 
""
""
if they depend on the high quality chemicals   uhm 
then the crops will grow better   uhm  i feel like that way 
 uhn  and if they use uh just rough materials   uhm  i
don't think the crops will grow   uhm  grow   uhm 
means this all depends on  the materials   uhm  what they use
""
""
 uhm  
""
""
 uhm  
""
""
 uhn  
""
""
 uhm  
""
""
 uhm  
""
""
 uhm  
""
""
 uhm  
""
""
uhm  but my   opinion is  know   uhm
 if we don't use chemicals   ah  also    haan
  we can  uh keep our crops when we are during uh  
twenty-five years back   we are not much depending on the chemicals
  uhm  we are using that cowdung
""
""
 i think  
""
""
 uhm  
""
""
 ah  
""
""
  haan   
""
""
 twenty-five years back ahn  
""
""
 uhm  
""
""
cowdung and all
""
""
we are using that  one word     uhn  waste
""
""
""
 uhn  
""
""
waste materials
""
""
waste materials    uhm  with that no  if we 
 continues   continue   that only we can  uh keep the
fertility   of the soil   and we can keep the taste of that
 uh vegetable or fruits 
""
now a days we are not getting that taste   which  we
were enjoying  twenty-five years back
""
""
 uhm  
""
""
 of the soil uhm  
""
""
 but  
""
""
uhm 
""
""
that taste is   different  and now a days is uh
  taste is  quite different
""
""
 different  
""
""
 but now  
""
""
what you know  but now a days   uhm  they are
using all the superior materials   uhm  because of that only the
taste is going   i see  in olden days they used to use all old
methods   uhm  now new methods have been started
""
""
 uhm  
""
""
 uhm  
""
""
 i see  
""
""
 uhm  
""
""
uhm 
""
""
like uh  that uh different types of  water facilities
and all
""
""
uhm 
""
""
due to that also and especially they use this different types
of chemicals what they use
""
""
uhn 
""
""
rough chemicals
""
""
uhn 
""
""
in olden days what they used to use that cowdung manure 
  uhn  and different types of soil
""
""
 uhn  
""
""
uhm 
""
""
but now those soil also are not  available   i
 think  due to the  uh this uh  poverty and  due to the
soil is not    levelled 
""
""
 uhn  
""
""
 that soil   i know want 
""
""
soil is not   levelled  here  na 
""
""
 ahn  
""
""
uhm  i want to  uhm have an idea    uhm 
whether we can go to the  olden days agriculture  is it useful to our
""
""
 uhm  
""
""
yes  but i think so  few of them follow this method 
  uhm  few of them  not to use the  one word  they don't
 laughs  even   know  use of the
""
""
 uhm  
""
""
 yeah  
""
""
i want 
""
""
i feel like that
""
""
yeah yeah 
""
what is my opinion is no    ah  we can have the
olden methods    ah  but in a modern type
""
""
 ah  
""
""
 ah  
""
""
way ah
""
""
  in modern way 
""
""
 ah modern way  
""
""
see  uh dripping  uh  wat    irrigation
system  we can use
""
""
 irrigation system  
""
""
yeah 
""
""
and we can use this uh waste material   of our things
 what this uh waste of   vegetables and leaves   and we
must keep in that uh    cowdung  cowdung and uh  bio 
""
""
 waste  kya hota hai   
""
""
 vegetables leaves and all  
""
""
 cowdung  
""
""
bio gas 
""
""
bio    it is not bio  gas
""
""
 gas is also bio  
""
""
this bio means 
""
""
manure manure
""
""
manure  bio manure
""
""
ah  that cowdung if we waste uh which is decayed and we
can keep those  uh give those manure and uh  that system we can  
if we use  no  that taste  the quality  everything
""
""
 if follows  
""
""
uhm
""
""
now what we are eating no  just   a waste 
""
""
 it is just   of a grass    it is  i
feel
""
""
 it is  
""
""
uhn  it is quite harmful after  your years  uh the
americans will only will prove that it is a poisonous thing  after using
this chemicals and all no you will become a  uh this uh harmful only for
our health 
""
my opinion is that if we go to our olden days  but in a modern
way  modern    type  type of  irrigation   or 
irrigation we can use for dripping and all that is quite  convinient 
and useful for us    ah 
""
but manure which we use now a days we can change
""
if we change that  system of manure  and if if we
concentrate  on this agriculture  we can have our own india which 
the  gandhiji
""
""
 type  
""
""
 yeah  
""
""
 ah  
""
""
had started
""
""
dreamt    dreamt  i would say
""
it is not materialised
""
""
 dreamt  
""
""
uhn 
""
""
it is only a   dream of gandhi 
""
if everyone  uh instead of running   beh  uh 
after   this jobs  and services and industries
""
if we use our own   india   our own land for our
agriculture purpose  we need not depend on other countries for  
food   uhm that is my opinion 
""
and  from let it be we got small poor or rich  if we
concentrate our  aim on this agriculture  we need not depend on others
and we can have our own things so 
""
and uh this uhm  my uh aim is know  if we use all this
without using chemicals more  if we use natural  manure it is quite
good  for our   health for the taste  uh  that in india it
is   possible 
""
""
 dream of our gandhi  
""
""
 taking uh  
""
""
 india  
""
""
 food  
""
""
 ah yes natural manure  
""
""
 possible    in in other countries it is not
possible but in india it is possible    uhm  because it is each
one in uh  we actually we indians    uhm  use different 
old things only    uhm  old material old manure  all these
things 
""
many villages  are using this type of old things  so their
crops are growing    i feel  like that way
""
""
 uhm  
""
""
 uhm  
""
""
 uhm  
""
""
 growing but uh  
""
""
now it has   some  no that
""
""
 but  
""
""
due to the temperatures no    uhm  due to the
monsoons also    uhm  and due to the  it depends how much
 ma   manure and all the this soil    uhm  mostly it
depends upon the soil 
""
""
 uhm  
""
""
 uhm  
""
""
 uhm  
""
""
uhm  that is depend   on the rain 
""
""
 that is the and   rain soil
""
""
uhm soil 
""
""
and different types of manure    uhm  when
these three things are used or levelled    uhm  when they are
 put in a proper order    uhm  i feel  there is no harm
in agriculture 
""
that is no harm in growing the crops    uhm  but
these things must be in a right order i feel  i feel like this  
 uhm uhm  uh    okay  because all these three must three
things must come in a  right line  then only you i feel that  we
can grow agriculture
""
but i found some of them  even though they are means even in
their house they have a small crop   they grow uh   haan
   kitchen garden 
""
""
 uhm  
""
""
 uhm  
""
""
 uhm  
""
""
 uhm  
""
""
 uhm uhm  
""
""
 okay  
""
""
 uhm garden  
""
""
 kitchen garden   we can
""
""
they do  they even if there is no rain    uhm
 they just try to    uhm  store water for the crops to grow
""
""
what they are making for their own  livelihood   
uhm  for their own purpose    uhm  i feel like that way 
""
now some people are doing like that way    uhm 
simply keep on buying buying  then it is no  means actually  first
of all   it is  one word  
""
""
 uhm  
""
""
 uhm  
""
""
 uhm  
""
""
 uhm  
""
""
 uhm  
""
""
 means there is   some kind of satisfaction 
  yeah  at the time   same time we are 
""
""
 yeah  
""
""
 and you can say no   that we     are
  have   done our  own  with our efforts   
uhm  i feel like that way
""
""
 making our  
""
""
 uhm  
""
""
uhm 
""
""
because we ourself are doing there   uhm  in our
place   uhm  different types of  uh this  beans and all
  uhm  we have done
""
""
 uhm  
""
""
 uhm  
""
""
 uhm  
""
""
uhm 
""
""
and it is growing    uhm  but we are doing 
  uhm  when there is no rain    uhm  we are putting
 laughs  we are storing  one word  for the water and all 
  uhm  like that way when  we get proper sunlight   
uhm  heat  soil  monsoon   all these things 
""
""
 uhm  
""
""
 uhm  
""
""
 uhm  
""
""
 uhm  
""
""
 uhm  
""
""
 now a days uh   so many  uh this inventions
are there   uhm  we can heat we need not uh  depend on sun now
a days 
""
if gardens are there we can  ke   uh keep the heat with
the proper want  those inventions are going on   yeah  and we
can keep those heat temperature i mean
""
""
 uhm  
""
""
 yeah  
""
""
temperature and all
""
""
temperature  water we can give   in time  how
much water that   crop need 
""
""
 yeah exact  
""
""
 ah that   only  i feel all these when 
you   are   have   given everything in time know 
  uhm  i think so  then and india will become a prosperous
country    uhm  in agriculture    uhm  then all
these three things  if they are looked after well    uhm  i
feel that way    uhm 
""
even if there is no water    uhm  we can bring water
from   some dam  storage  or bring from anywhere and  we can
 cultivate the land 
""
""
 uhm  
""
""
 uhm  
""
""
 uhm  
""
""
 uhm  
""
""
 uhm  
""
""
 uhm  
""
""
 yeah yeah  
""
""
and the cultivation is    more 
""
""
 most   important
""
""
essential now 
""
we can   produce   manufacture   the 
machines  with the use of that mechanical technology technology with
technology we can   produce   manufacture   this machine
""
""
but agriculture  is we depend on other countries  this uh
inflation will go high    high  and uh it is not our   
one word   to meet all this expenses 
""
after all uh 
""
""
 high  
""
""
  one word   
""
""
there is some
""
""
an indian
""
""
uhm 
""
""
means  we have to depend fully on agriculture and we have
to develop our land 
""
we have to develop our  cro   crops 
""
and in such a way  that it is useful for the ordinary man
""
""
man 
""
""
common man can do this agriculture  if all this  uhm uh
""
""
materials and all   the soil 
""
""
 what is needed   that if it is given  we can
cultivate the land   properly  uh  and our uh people also
should be very   hard working 
""
and especially
""
""
 land properly  
""
""
 hard working  
""
""
hard working makes more   ah  man   yeah
 uh  ha   happier life   yeah  i feel like that way
""
""
 ah  
""
""
 yeah  
""
""
 yeah  
""
""
uhn 
""
""
when once you are hard working in your work what you do 
 uhm  you will gain for what you have done   yeah  in the
end
""
""
 uhm  
""
""
 yeah  
""
""
yeah  and for health of the old man or medium man
""
""
yeah
""
""
if we start the agriculture no i i don't mean that it should
go on the large scale  if it is
""
""
just you start   from the  small scale
""
""
 large scale  
""
""
you may have heard no
""
""
 haan  yeah
""
""
even one drops make a   a sea  ocean
""
""
 sea  
""
""
yeah
