""
 it's  a good morning to you all 
""
uh  in fact you see my aim  is to give you  as much
information about indian english  as possible during these two lectures
""
""
 it's  uh there has been a lot  there has been a lot of
work  in fact you see done  in order to  establish  indian
english  as uh  a standard  variety of uh british english 
""
so  uh i will give you  means in fact you see  i'm 
just giving you  information about whatever has uh  gone in for 
the establishment of  the identity of  indian english 
""
so most of you  know that uh  the term  indian
english   is used  to describe english  as used by 
the indians 
""
uh there have been several  attempts to establish the identity of
indian english through investigations into its major distinctive features
""
""
uh the seminar on indian english  held at uh c i e f l 
hyderabad in nineteen hundred seventy-two  may be described as the first
collective effort  to arrive at  some definite conclusions regarding
 the status of indian english 
""
now the conclusion  arrived at  were  indian english is
not a substandard english  it is not  pidgin english  it is not
just british english with a few indian spices  added to it  it has its
own distinct identity 
""
so these were the conclusions  uh at which  the seminar 
on  indian english   held at uh hyderabad  arrived
you see 
""
so  uh ramesh mohan later on  edited the paper  published
 the the papers  i'm  sorry  the papers which were presented at
the seminar  uh with the title  indian writing in english
 
""
now as the title of the book suggests  the emphasis was on
indian writing in english  only four papers  attempted to describe
 the lexical  phonological and syntactic features of indian english
""
and one of the papers was  by kachru  one of the papers was
by kachru 
""
now  you must be knowing you see during the colonial days 
englishmen considered  indian english as a substandard variety of british
english 
""
uh now for instance you see certain  uh derogatory terms were
used to describe indian english  terms like  babu english  butler
english 
""
now you get reference  to these terms in  yule and 
bernell's   hobsan and johnson  uh hobsan and jobson   i'm
 sorry hobson  hobson jobson it is  hobson jobson  uh which was
published in eighteen hundred eighty-six 
""
uh  now indian english was also described as kitchen english 
and  arey bhai slof   by p lal in his article  on uh
 indian writing in english which was published in harward educational
review  uses these two terms  kitchen english and  arey bhai
slof  
""
so uh  so the  means uh during the early days  indian
english  was not acceptable to the british people  and uh probably the
indians even did not think of indian english  as uh  having its own
distinct identity 
""
but uh  the sustained efforts  made over years by indian
english linguists  critics  creative writers and teachers of english
have now established  indian english as a standard variety of  english
""
""
now i would uh  uh comment on you see indian english as a non-
native variety of english 
""
now some  researchers or investigators would accept  indian
english as a non-native variety of english whereas some  uh researchers
 would not accept  some researchers like daswani he would not accept
 indian english as a non-native variety of  english 
""
uh  now it was prator  who first  talked of uh indian
english this i have provided you with uh  select bibliography  and uh
there are  references  to some of the  articles to which  i'm
 going to  refe  to which  i'm  going to refer in my 
lecture you see 
""
so prator  uh dismissed indian english  as a local 
unintelligible model of english 
""
so he said this is a local model  unintelligible  and uh 
uh he objected to the setting  up  of the local variety of english
instead of r p  as a model for the learners 
""
so he insisted that r p should be the model for the learners 
and there should not be uh  any attempt  to  present the local
variety of english 
""
now  uh prator in fact called  it the heretical tenet 
""
he said it was uh  it is the he said you see it was the
heretical tenet  that the local  model should be given uh  for the
learning of the pronunciation 
""
now uh you probably might be knowing you see it was bansal who
insisted that there should be  a local model  a local model for 
the teaching of pronunciation 
""
uh so far  uh there have been some attempts you see but so far
 we have not been able to  come to  a local model
""
probably it would be possible in future when  uh the  i c e
project will  come out 
""
i c e project that is the international corpus of english project
 which  is now  being carried out you see
""
and the for the first time you would be uh  for the first time
you see the spoken aspect of indian english  is taken into consideration
""
""
so later on  it's  quite possible the  possible that the
local model  of spoken english  would be  uh presented 
""
so prator  uh seems to have ignored  the basic principle
regarding intelligibility  which when he calls indian english as  uh
unintelligible he seems to have ignored the  basic principle now 
""
now catford  in his uh  uh article the teaching of english as
a foreign language which was  which was published in nineteen hundred
fifty  says that  the concept of intelligibility  has to be related
 to the concepts of appropriateness and effectiveness  in a speech
situation 
""
so he wants that we should relate the concept of intelligibility to
the concepts of appropriateness and effectiveness  in a speech situation
""
""
now kachru adds to these  to the parametre of the context of
situation 
""
kachru talks of the context of situation now
""
uh  so   i i  indian english has  all of you know
 is used in  uh socio-cultural context 
""
it is used even 
""
so indian english as uh  most of you know  is used mainly in
indian socio-cultural educational and administrative contexts 
""
 i  indian english has been used  as a link language as a
 official language
""
so we need to take into consideration  the context of situation
""
""
now uh  uh  talking about the phonology  or the
phonological aspect of indian english  it may be said that uh  we
should give more  importance  to the meaning rather than the noise 
""
now i would like to refer to j r  one word  book  uh
 speech  which was published  in nineteen hundred and
thirty-three and uh which was reprinted in nineteen hundred sixty-six 
""
now j r  one word  says that uh  uh meaning is as much
 a property of the situational context of people as the noise is 
""
so meaning is necessary  and  that's  why  uh i
think you see it would uh  not be sensible at all  to present the
speaker of r p  as the model  for spoken english  uh to a junior
class in a village in india 
""
uh it would not be possible uh  uh it would not be sensible and
it wouldn't it would not be even necessary 
""
now it has been claimed  that uh  uh indians  need not
concentrate much on the spoken form 
""
it has been claimed you see means when you  uh take into
consideration  the aspect of communication 
""
uh now it is said that  uh the meaning should be taken into
consideration rather than the noise that we make 
""
so the role of english in india has been  to integrate 
culturally and linguistically  the pluralistic societies within india 
""
and uh it has never been the primary aim of  uh english in india
 to integrate  with the british or american culture 
""
american culture and  that's  why  we did not  pay
much attention you see to the  spoken aspect 
""
but uh we should rather concentrate on the written communication
""
""
so throughout the years  indians  accepted english  they
acculturated english  and uh  the acculturated english  is what we
call indian english  what we call indian english
""
so this linguistic assimilation  that has taken place  
 in   with   regard to english in india  may be
compared to  it may be compared to the indianisation of persian language
 or the dravidianisation of sanskrit language  or even  the
indo-aryanisation of dravidian languages in india 
""
it may be compared  uh to these now 
""
bhatia  uh  presents  four criteria  on the basis of
which he would establish indian english as a non-native variety 
""
for the first  criterion about which he talks is that  in
india english is learnt  from the school stage of education 
""
so before  uh uh before a boy starts  before a boy or a girl
 uh starts  learning english  he or she has already learnt the
mother tongue 
""
she has already learnt the mother tongue
""
so  the use of english in india has been  from fine to formal
 or sometimes even informal  situation 
""
but uh  uh english in india is never used for  intimate
situations 
""
it is never used for intimate situation 
""
uh so  uh  the  according to him you see the second
criterion is this  the intimate situations  are not  the region
of uh indian english 
""
then a non-native speaker  has  limited facility to use the
various registors  of the language 
""
so the native speaker can use all the registors of the language
whereas uh  uh indians in  uh indians  cannot use all the registors
of language 
""
then  as a non-native variety  english in india has uh 
phonetic  syntactic and symantic deviations 
""
so these deviations even would establish  india english as a
non-native variety 
""
now bansal  objected  to   prator's  observations
""
""
uh bansal  bansal infact you see uh  wrote uh  in his 
nineteen hundred sixty-nine article  that the subjective element or the
 uh or the  puritan attitude  which uh prator  had been
representing in his criticism of  indian english was altogetherly wrong
""
""
so uh  bansal tried to measure the intelligibility of indian
english 
""
so he wanted to establish  that indian  in indian english is
intelligible  as against  prator's  criticism of indian english as
uintelligible 
""
so uh  he  uh came to the conclusion  that uh  an
average figure of intelligibility between educated indian speaker  and r p
speaker  is seventy-three percent  is seventy-three precent 
""
so uh  indian english cannot be dismissed as unintelligible
variety  of english 
""
so his study was based on a  on recorded specimens of english of
the indian speech community  and uh it described even  the phonetic
features of indian english speech  which uh  differ from the  r p
""
""
 bansal's  nineteen hundred seventy-two study  was an
attempt to analyse  and describe  the common core of language patterns
 the common core of language patterns 
""
now uh  later on you see perk even quirk talked of  the 
uh nuclei the nuclear  english 
""
he talked about the nuclear english later on quirk 
""
now  the common core  uh of course uh  uh one of the
conclusions  i would be arriving at  would be that  when it comes
to  the  common core  indian english does not differ much from 
british english 
""
so this would be one of the conclusions  uh at which i would
like to arrive at the end 
""
so bansal  wanted  to uh  find out  if it was possible
to have the common core  shared by  all the members of indian speech
community  all the members of indian speech community
""
now he said you see  uh now of course you see  in india 
english is used for uh  a variety of purposes 
""
but bansal compares the variedness of indian english with that of
human behaviour 
""
so he says human behaviour when we  talk of human behaviour 
we concentrate on similarity  and not on differences 
""
so in the same way we should think of this similar  uh the
similar aspects or the similar features  and uh that would enable us 
to have  a common core  for the  spoken  indian english 
""
now verma  uh describes indian english as an offspring yielded
by english  a second language with a distinct indian flavour 
""
he would describe indian english as one of the languages of india
 used by a community of people at different  levels of communication
""
""
so  and then further he says within the overall general
framework of the basic linguistic systems of british english  it displays
certain distinguishing features  and uh he would say  it is the
interlanguage situation  that contributes to the distinct status of indian
english 
""
so  he would say that it will be interlanguage situation
""
so his concentration is on the interlanguage situation 
""
so verma  did not want  indian english  to be grouped 
with american english  canadian english  and australian english because
 he said these are the mother tongue varieties  whereas indian english
is a non-native  second language variety  it is a non- native second
language variety 
""
now as i told you before  daswani  would not accept indian
english as a variety of british  british english 
""
so  but uh there is some  positive  element in his
criticism of indian english 
""
he says  if systematic relations  uh if systematic
relationship between varieties of english  such as  american australian
canadian english and indian english is established  then only  indian
english may be accepted as  uh a variety of british english 
""
so  the relationship  between  the mother tongue variety
 and the indian english  needs to be established  and then only we
would accept indian english as a variety of british english 
""
now if you know you see  uh chowmsky  would uh say that 
uh the  divergencies  this when we talk of a language  when we talk
of a  a a language let us say  uh divergencies at the divergencies are
shown  at the level of surface structure  rather than at the level of
deep structure  rather than at the level of deep structure 
""
so daswani says that  it has not yet been proved that  face
structure rules of british english  and indian english are the same 
are the same  and that the difference is only in the area of uh 
transformational  and phonological rules 
""
so only when  it would be proved  that at the level of deep
structure  indian english  is  the same as british english  and
uh  only at the level of uh  the surface structure indian english
differs from british english then only we may accept indian english  as a
variety of british english
""
this is what uh  uh daswani would say 
""
uh daswani also comments on the eratic use of articles and
prepositions  in indian english 
""
he even comments on the phoneic interference  on account of
negligence of some phonological rules 
""
so we  uh infact do not know certain rules  and we ignore
certain rules and  that's  why there is phonic interference in indian
english 
""
so he would say uh  he would say you see it is  out of our
 ignorance it is out of uh  our ignorance or negligience  that uh
 we use uh  different  structures 
""
we use different structures and  that's  why indian english
is not a variety  of uh  british english 
""
this is  daswani's   uh point of view
