""
""

""
""

""
""

""
""

""
""

""
""

""
""

""
""
lal lal 
""
""
lal  lal 
""
now  you joined here some three years ago 
""
""
four 
""
""
four years ago 
""
""
no three years ago  three three and half years  you are
not going sir 
""
""
uhn  probably 
""
""
no no not like that  physical 
""
""
no physical  i'm  alright 
""
""
i thought you are
""
""
i am yet  differed  because of the some problems knotty
problem 
""
""
as a head of any  institution  it has to be there 
""
""
loudly   laughs 
""
""
as a head of any institution  the problem 
""
""
yeah  you must face  yeah 
""
""
yeah  i think that is the  first requirement of  that
chair   laughs 
""
but anyway that way our department is quite  cool and calm that
is what  we think    yeah  students  i don't know  what
staff members feel 
""
""
 yeah  
""
""
that way  what you say is correct
""
""
 haan  yeah there is not much of a politics and
uh  people are quite cool 
""
even non- teaching staff is good 
""
""
cooperative
""
""
faithful and cooperative 
""
""
but that will become element 
""
""
 that's  always
""
""
prospectus element    yes  beside  it's 
very  in their way in their own way 
""
""
 yes  
""
""
yeah 
""
""
and they erupt some time  they try to show there it will
solve  they want to show that  one word   in the department 
they make sometime 
""
 you've   worked on synthelysis or  electrons  
""
""
synthelysis not analysis
""
""
not analysis 
""
what is this sythelysis when the anyway you are going to have your
appendix  but say for a common man  like dr shastri
 
""
yeah for a common man  yeah 
""
""
so how do you  say intellectual and what is  a viva 
in a very general term
""
""
yeah in general term i can uh say  there is uh  a layer
called as ionosphere  in the in  earth's  upper atmosphere 
""
you may be knowing about it
""
""
yeah
""
""
if you are uh 
""
""
i may be
""
""
if you are studying science
""
""
yeah
""
no no i have different side
 
""
i am in english  
""
""
no you can
""
""
so this uh this ionosphere is held by ionised electrons  in
sufficient numbers  so as to affect the radio waves latitude 
""
they effect on the radio valency  they have the effect on radio
valency 
""
now this uh  ionosphere  though it has all the ionised
species and all 
""
now  it's  very nuclei ionised plasma  because the 
air density  at that height where this ionosphere is present
 
""
but what i could understand is not some physics  that's 
something your your uh  personal things you know like you were in bombay
or you were in goa  
""
""
goa that way we will
 
""
that is much indian understand  laughs  they are
appreciated now rather than 
""
""
but you see their is another side of her life
 
""
uh ha  
""
""
which seems more more interesting 
""
she is uh defending uh  uhm rights of these uh  one uh
rights of women 
 
""
oh rights of women 
""
""
or legal  no no on the legal side
 
""
 that's  very interesting 
""
""
on the legal side not on  so  social side 
""
""
no even on social side
""
""
but uh
""
""
when i was working  yeah i was working with one
organisation which had many activities of this type 
""
and i have got even uh  experience of working with  family
council  and uh legal examiners 
""
""
 haan   that's  what  it's  legal
examiner
""
""
legal examiner 
""
""
then how many cases you have handled so far 
""
""
uh  as a social worker i have handled around  eighty to
hundred cases  hundred cases
""
""
uhn 
""
""
because  that  legalised centre which we had  we 
we used to have a thrice a week 
""
and you won't believe sir  the day we had the office  it was
 fully crowded  on those days since morning till evening 
""
and we were so many of them  some fifteen twenty people 
""
we used to sit in one one corner with  one one  lady and with
her family and  that boys side and  uh  husband's  side and 
her side her father mother and everyone 
""
and that  chou chou chou    laughs 
""
""
i see 
""
""
 it's  really i mean when you go into that  na
  we realised that there are so many  not only  i'm  not
talking about women  but there are so many things in our society which
 have not yet come upto that superficial level or at the discussion level
""
""
and so many supress things within the family  they affect
individual ways very much 
""
""
so  for example you can think of something which is
dreadful event  one case  which you would call very much far
""
""
uh uh there was uh there was one  very peculiar case  uh
in the sense that it was from the  very low income group 
""
they they used to stay in bombay you know  slum kind of area 
""
not fully slum but you can call it uh semi-  slum kind of thing
""
""
and that man he was the only son of that man 
""
and uh he had some three or four sisters  all of them they were
unmarried 
""
unmarried in the sense they were uh  of course they were 
younger to him  that is why they were unmarried he was the eldest and he
was married 
""
uh his first marriage was broken in the sense that uh  because
of the torture from these    sister-in-laws   sisters-in-law
  and from  mother-in-law and from father-in-law 
""
she left him  and in  that category i mean like low income
group  they don't go for all these uh  legal processes  through
court and all 
""
the  breaking that is the divorce is a very simple thing 
""
they just leave the person and then they go 
""
then he got married to a girl from his own  relations  that
is uh  his   mama's   daughter  cousin sister
""
""
and even then  she was having a similar kind of torture 
torture means i cannot explain you to what extent that torture was
""
that girl  she had to  go in that uh common  lavotory
""
in bombay  in the slum areas there are these common toilets and
common bathroom 
""
so she had to go there 
""
she used to come back window she used to call someone 
""
she used to tell them that please give me some  chapati
 or some bread to eat 
""
i mean it was that  kind of thing they were not giving her food
 no water no food 
""
and they used to  and  when we had some people setting it
""
""
we really couldn't find out what identify what is the problem
""
actually that her husband was a good man 
""
the only thing is he used to drink
""
he was a worker in some factory 
""
he used to drink a little bit 
""
he never used to  hit her like  nothing 
""
but all this people they used to harass her 
""
then after three four sittings we realised that the problem is 
he is the only earning source of the family 
""
and all of them they had this fear  that if this person  if
he has a very good relationship with his wife  and if there is a sound
relationship   fam  sound family life  there is a possibility of
him going and staying separate 
""
""
oh 
""
""
so that was the sole reason for this torture to the 
daughter-in-law 
""
""
you know that's a fact 
""
""
and then we had to
""
""
complex issues 
""
""
and then we had to  uhm inform her father 
""
her father was in some village 
""
she didn't know the address properly
""
she was illiterate 
""
and then he was working with one sugar factory 
""
so at the address of sugar factory so somehow we  contacted
some official to tell her husband  that if this if this person working
with you then we found out his address we used to go to him we informed him
""
""
so  then he came  to bombay we talked to him
""
but these people they didn't even allow her to meet him 
""
and there were so many problems and finally  we rescued that
girl because  she didn't want  she had the total  one word  
""
""
uhm 
""
""
so she was sent back to her parents 
""
but one good thing in this case was the parents were ready to take
her like 
""
""
i see
""
""
and yeah in certain cases they they refused  they say that
we don't 
""
if she she is married  she is to come out of the house  and
she has to die and she has to come out 
""
that is she is not allowed to come out 
""
atleast in this case they were ready to take her 
""
""
fine 
""
""
what we did anything
""
""
and that man didn't comment anything 
""
""
he didn't say anything 
""
he had no voice 
""
though he was the earning soul  he was  treated or or he was
atleast he was brought up  he started earning very early  at early age
""
""
so i think he was brought up in that manner that uh  you know
 in this entire world his parents and his sisters    is  
are    everything for him nothing more  other relationships
are not important 
""
you work so many and uh it was really a  i mean   it's
 very difficult to work continously at this branch  you yourself uh
 and then you have so many problems of your own  listening to all
things no  then you disturb  you get disturb like emotionally 
mentally 
""
""
there is one case in our department  right now
""
""
is it 
""
""
that that uh  different case is   it's  not a
bit  uhm yet selfish to say
""
""
uhm 
""
""
but the problem is  that  girl's  father came 
and got her admission under the v j n t quota 
""
""
which quota
""
""
v j 
""
""
uhn 
""
""
 vimukhta jati 
""
""
 haan haan  yeah
""
""
some nomadic tribe
""
""
some nomadic tribe 
""
""
and she went through the waiting list and all that 
""
but according to medical level we have to categorise she got 
""
now she completed part one  then part two  and she gave 
her specialisation  theoritical specialisation
""
""
uhm uhm
""
""
she is the only one in the batch
""
""
is it
""
""
this girl sat for this
""
""
uhm uhm
""
""
so i was surprised that uh  record uh  showing class
student  it gave uh subject of such a high  a few words  
""
then  uhm  after that she joined 
""
the classes started  her father came 
""
then he talked to me  one and half hours in marathi  like
that 
 
""
uhm 
""
""
so  that  lady's  father came and told me  that
uh  he he is responsible for her  education and uh you know there must
be coersive data 
""
and uhm  uh and she must marry to  a person uhn  who is
some relative 
""
but who is a  uh rock breaker 
""
""
uhm uhm 
""
""
not educated 
""
but uh the family relationship required the man  uhn the father
 to fix that  she had to marry that fellow 
""
now  then uh  but personally  i don't know how to solve
this problem  and she stopped attending the classes now 
""
""
now she will get marry 
""
""
no we don't know  because she refuse  she refused to
stay in the hostel  though her father is paying the money  she got the
admission in the hostel 
""
she is staying with somebody in the city 
""
""
she is uh
""
""
and uh
""
""
i i don't think that she will agree for this 
""
""
she will not agree but she will not study
""
my problem is how do you solve her educational problem 
""
   i'm  not  worried about her
""
""
 that is uh  
""
""
as i said it will take uh  sometime in the sense when she
will uh  get settled mentally
""
""
no   that's  not the point 
""
when you take a subject like theoritical physics  the proper
environment  in the first week itself  you've  to study book  if
it is not so  this is not something like you can wait to  it's  not
history or geography 
""
""
uhm 
""
""
when the same classmate  same group of students are
studying  one has to study
""
""
uhm
""
""
if they miss that bus   it's  very difficult for
them to cope up and adjust 
""
you may say that  i'll  settle the life  after uh 
some day
""
""
has she has she talked to you or uh 
""
""
no she is not opening her mouth at all 
""
she is so obstinate  she comes to the classroom  she is dead
silent  no sign on the face 
""
not even acknowledging  presence of others 
""
she is she is slight  so stern and strong willed 
""
""
so she was not like this in  one word   or uh have
you have you found out any sudden changes in her behaviour 
""
""
definitely  much more  than she was last year
""
""
uhm  last year she was quite social
""
""
some  not quite
""
""
but little bit 
""
""
little bit
""
""
she has cut off 
""
""
now she is not attending classes 
""
and if she doesn't attend  i've  to cancel her uh 
""
""
admission 
""
""
but ususally  what they say  i have to do  in the
vacation 
""
then the government of india has given thirty percent reservation
in this category 
""
""
yeah yeah that reservation is said only for the government
services  isn't it 
""
like how it is for other uh 
""
""
no it may be implemented  na   say for
admissions 
""
""
for admissions 
""
""
oh
""
""
is it
""
""
uhm  why not 
""
not present why  thirty percent in the nomination  they're
  put so  and actually  for every type of uh activity  for
group 
""
that is educational  political  administrative  any kind
of uh  national activity 
""
and muncipality they are having certificates
""
""
yeah they have held 
""
""
people are contesting now elections
""
""
in kolhapur was the first   city  to
""
""
 yeah  
""
""
have a both mayor and deputy mayor  mayor yeah that is
mayor came under that category 
""
women woman
""
""
uhm   now thirty percent reservation 
""
""
 thirty percent reservation  
""
""
certain seats were reserved  so certain constituency they
were reserved for women 
""
so kolhapur is the first  city in maharashtra  after this
rule came 
""
""
uhm
""
""
we had that uh election 
""
""
so naturally kolhapur may be  shivaji university may be
the first university in implementing this  thirty
 
""
not fashionable to talk about uh  women lib and all that
""
but uh   laughter  
""
""
women lib has nothing to do
 
""
i know  obviously 
""
""
women lib is a problem of the west 
""
""
uhm 
""
""
here the women programmes i think they are  social
 
""
yeah they are social  more then uh  yeah 
""
""
i  exactly i don't know obligation 
 
""
what are you going to do after  completing your ph d  
""
""
i will try to find out some job 
""
""
 it's  always apex  kolhapur  bombay  goa
""
""
ah  nai  i don't think that uh  i will be
in goa 
""
uhn i don't want to change the state  but  most probably
 i'll  concentrate in  bombay and poona 
""
""
have you uh taken up any place here in kolhapur
""
""
uhm  so after coming to kolhapur  it was told to me
that   i'm  supposed to concentrate only on my work  and not on
anything else 
 
""
like a good girl  
""
""
like a good girl  laughs   it's  first time in
my life  i've  obeyed someone   laughs
