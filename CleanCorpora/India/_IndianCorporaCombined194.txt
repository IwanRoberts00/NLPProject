harpreet ripudaman with the ball ripudaman is a new comer which amarnath is forward darryl d'souza   onto the right side now  right  changes air india right side forward pass the ball went too fast going over the backline   it's in a free hit towards the left flank from punjab sindh bank  good scoop intercepted but  down comes gundeep gives it to ramsharan ramsharan down to left flank  but fails to beat surinder who loses control a free hit to air india free hit going over the sideline on the hit in for punjab sindh bank  nearly twenty one minutes of play gone through air india  leading by a goal  score in the seventeenth minutes of first half by aranha and for the continuation of commentary in hindi it is abhay chaturvedi   in india  abhay i would just like to say one thing five of the  interrupt land  for the air india team now darryl d'souza and  edgar mascarenhas they are infact trained as defendant  but these are the two players who besides being playing as defendants they are always leading the attack  and they are always keeping them forward on the move whereas  there in the punjab sindh bank team the size of these a few words is very long  ah ramsharan gundeep ripudaman  they have not been able to combine well whereas the air india forward they're just lurking near the goal mark  they just get hardly chance at the two words  they would have been thrown up but for aranha that you cast in last line who catches the one with one day and centrally  one word feeling i don't know whether you agree with me or not punjab sindh bank having nearly five internationals is kill their act but i think over confident must have started with that  and this is what you are paying for your over confidence  and so far they have not been able to combine well and all the players played so far ah practically you a few words  before we leave on to catch the relay a few words  i was considering they got just four chances  and out of the four chances they converted three  fourth one was edward aranha a ball going just by yard  otherwise the goal keeper was awake there was no one to  to me it appears the punjab sind bank defence does not know what it was to be  they are running everywhere but not marking defence  who lies the whole side aranha here follows rajesh chouhan and darryl d'souza alex d'souza all coming into the attack nobody is marking  they come into the attack and immediately don't go back  that only shows their partners their thinking which the punjab sindh bank boys two words  the two words  and they are more uh selfish  if ramsharan gets the ball he goes down the left flank he doesn't look for a opening they are along with him  same is the case with uh uh gundeep they have got a very good chance and gundeep has given a back pass to ramsharan  a swing way down the near the right back line  and from here specially  once they go after the back line they are tied because they can't do it  now here is the punjab players back on the crease   the leading team has to prove a few words playing final of the third lala bhim sain memorial invitation hockey tournament  at shivaji stadium  venue of many international tournament  the punjab sindh bank boys just relaxing but no strategy is being formed  again on your same replaying delhi policeman in hindi  punjab sindh bank going into the field  now the second half will start  abhay the three goal lead in the final   it's a very great moral boosting  in fact punjab sindh bank was expected to do very well  played very well  for them it is demoralising  in second half we'll have to see whether they would be able to recapture their form and fight back  yes they have thirty-five minutes or so  because one can't imagine that the punjab sindh bank won't come back into the game  they have the capacity they have the capability but the only thing is they will have to stretch during individual approach  and combined and move ahead with a combined move  here are they air india team on the screen and number eight  where  this rajinder amar on the right side of the screen  with yellow shirts is the punjab sindh bank team and right in the middle with the red shirts on the right is t s bullard the international umpire and on his right is kukoo walia another international umpire  now there goes the scene form rest of the day i shall  suppose the former lieutenant governor of delhi  the punjab sindh bank team being introduced to him  this is narender former international umpire  sorry here is bullard the international umpire kukoo walia  and now the air india team  edgar mascarenhas now introducing his boys to the former lieutenant governor h k l kapoor to his team mates from air india  the four teams presented with the souvenir of this tournament all there is over the two teams take their respective places  punjab sindh bank will attack from right to left  now already down by three goals  they will have to work very hard to get back into the game and the morals of the air india boys is very high  and one thing very notable that the air india defences they are marking their players very well  they are not letting the rafter gundeep and uh ripudaman  ball on to the side and they know the passing would be given to one of them and they are marking it very well  all the attempt of punjab sindh bank to pass on the ball  to either ramsharan gundeep or ripudaman are being frustrated by the passmanship of the well marked passing by the defenders  of air india  air india to start on the second half  edward aranha with the ball the one who scored the first two goals in the seventeen and twenty-third minutes the third goal coming of that stick of rajesh chauhan in the thirty-third the first half itself  back pass chauhan to harpreet on to the right for clive d'souza   that's superb  good take work  to darryl darryl gives it to mascarenhas edgar now from there to rajesh chauhan good shot but it fine play by goalkeeper teja  corner hit by him mascarenhas free hit air india  between the a few words  aimless forward pass over the backline  ripudaman rajinder quick pass to gundeep pasha side by umpire kukoo walia  free hit for air india  first hit for the in the first second half itself by punjab sindh bank that showed their determination now  but lets see  rajinder gundeep keeps at the ball free hit for air india ball with darryl d'souza darryl d'souza  forward to aranha aranha to alex d'souza   d'souza to aranha
