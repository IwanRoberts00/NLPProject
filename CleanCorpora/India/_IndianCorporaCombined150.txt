chairman sir when we go through the budget apparently  it will exceed to just the budget with the duties set upto four thousand five hundred twenty-two crores rupees capitals and excise and no further taxes levied  the central plan outlay have been increased by thirty-two percent when we show all these things and expecting our one word  be close by four point five percent  it seems to be kept bold and imaginative budget  but what is the real scenario of the budget we have to go through little bit deeper they are speaking thousand one hundred million man-days of the employment that can be created what they feel  but for nineteen ninety-two ninety-three when we go through the reality the first six months where we are able to create only two hundred forty-three million man-days of employment interruption  outside  that means now what we envisage to create only twenty-five percent of that man-days we are able to create in the last last year last six months of the budget year  i want to know from the government what infrastructure has been created to fulfill this year's target  sir while we say that for central plan outlay has been increased by thirty-two percent we must also go through with the subsidy issue  sir according to subsidy whatever finance is assigned  i want to quote financial resource if i have gone to create the i c o if i have gone the same way as the last year the fertiliser subsidy alone would have gone up to rupees eleven thousand crores  because of the action taken in the last two years the fertiliser subsidy could be only rupees three thousand five hundred crores  from this you can find out sir more than seven thousand five hundred crores has been put on the farmer's  shoulder already  when we say that the subsidy keeps speaking that subsidy is something wrong policy no what is called subsidy ? subsidy is nothing but the transfer of income from one section of the society to another section of the society  suppose for example if i tell if you want to stop the entire subsidy for fertilizers and if you wanted to take up all the concessions that what they are giving on the per tariff the electricity tariff  then suppose the production of the agriculture comes down  then we may have to take the grants from the foreign countries like  states or european countries  for example what it pays about three hundred and fifty it is approximately i'm telling for three hundred and fifty  rupees what it pays to our indian farmer the same rate we may have to import from the american farmers as five hundred and fifty  rupees  two hundred rupees we have to pay more  instead of that what i say is instead of paying to the american farmer why should not we give to our own indian farmers  what is wrong in giving subsidy ? sir regarding the subsidies i wanted to tell that share of the subsidies to the non-plan expenditure during the seventh plan period  approximately this is sixteen percent  now this side share of the subsidies in the non-plan expenditure during this year it is reduced eight point seven percent they think that subsequent reduce in the subsidy they are actually pleasing the one word a body of the world bank  this is not good for the common people in the india  sir regarding the interest payment i want to tell sir the interest payment is now forty-two percent of the total non-plan expenditure  now it accounts forty-two percent of the total non-plan expenditure  but in the seventh plan average it was only twenty-seven percent sir  then personal income tax exemption  the income tax exemption till nineteen eighty-one it was fifty  rupees fifteen thousand  in nineteen eighty-five it was eighteen thousand in nineteen ninety it was twenty-two thousand nineteen ninety-two twenty-eight thousand  sir the nineteen eighty-one well what they say fifteen thousand  rupees exemption into that system sir  now it is the value of that fifteen thousand rupees  now it is said about forty thousand rupees  what i wanted to emphasize through you sir in australia different method is applied  in australia what they did australia one word according to australian one word first they fixed the base or base amount  that is their triparty two words that government employers employees all together they have come to one conclusion and it is taken as a base year  from that base year when one's accepted exemption amount that every year what is actually inflation takes place in australia they have according to that percentage the exempted limit also keep being enhanced sir through you what i wanted to emphasize to the government of india that please atleast now you replace that nineteen eighty-one you please take it as a base year fifteen thousand  rupees  after that every year how much deflation takes place in india  so far taken in india you please translate it that this inflation  after hopeless that inflation it enhance the amount then it will be one scientific way sir regarding unique system of india the investment is so far  it attracts the eight to eighty of one word so far but now it has been given up  our honourable finance minister says we have today equal treatment with other financial institution we are dealing  but for this one gentlemen what the economy they have given the proper replace for that objectively the finance minister has taken this step so as to put the u t i or bond with other mutual fund however if that was the only reason surely his left technical method would have been the extensive a few words  benefits to other mutual funds  instead of taking the benefits what people are enjoying in the u t i they would have experienced the same benefit the other mutual funds  then sir when you object actually enhance the prices   you're doing not only the interest one word   not only in the tax one word but the administrative prices for example i tell you before announcing the budget  pre-budget you can say pre-budget announcement you have enhanced the price for sugar  you have enhanced the price for actually the rice's  price increased  the actual price increased gold price increased that the prices of the coal prices of the sugar price of rice price of the  then increased automatically it all the product put on the floor therefore what i request the government that government should what they they have shown what they have printed what they have said is totally different from what they are doing  what is their real intention ? therefore i wanted to i want i request you truly sir  that please bring in practice that the one word be the government  with these words i conclude thank you   one or two words  from the last two years we successfully withdrew money from the  one word   a few words  and thereby about thirty-two thousand crores  of rupees has been withdrawn from the market   and thirty-two thousand crores of rupees  has been invested in the financial market in the share market   a few words   a few words  therefore within last year shivaji when we proposed the budget and uh due to the a few words lot more concessions were announced for the industrial set-up than the capital market shivaji  then we we then the entire nation witnessed the goings  in regards to the scam scandal  the hopes were raised among many people including the rural folk to invest in the industrial sector and thereby lot more money has been diverted from agriculture to manufacturing sector and from rural area to urban area  i will also budget when we budget at the budget there was no hike in the tax component and uh additional component was not enhanced nor the custom duties  but at the same time they gave certain relief to other sectors and he said that everything is going to be cosy but he can't lend us we analyse the figures  here they purposefully and calculatively transferred about thirty thousand crores of rupees from capital account to revenue account  and so then once money is transferred from capital account to revenue account all your balance expenditure will be cut and all your  development developmental activities will be affected  and we are witnessing in this in this country that every developmental activities is cancelled  no construction of roads no construction of bridges for industry and no allocation or any land allocation in this country  as the finance minister day-in and day-out he talks much about the so called liberalisation and the so called delicensing policy  but this delicensing policy is yet to touch the agricultural sector  and several manufactured goods and several consumer goods  includes the motor cars refrigerators as well as the one word  and washing machines are under the delicensing policy  as far as exemption is concerned than the so called delicensing proposal and so called liberalisation it is hardly that it is changing the attitude a few words in the agriculture sector  for example you take the example of the sugar industry  then all of our industries are related to sugar industry is kept with the ministry of industry  in andra pradesh about ninety-two applications were received by the government  and the application was forwarded to the union government to the minister of sugar factories in andhra pradesh with an install capacity of twenty-five hundred metric tons per day and with an investment of not less than forty crores on each unit and the larger units are allowed four thousand crores  of investment has been pumped into circulation as far as the sugar-cane industry is concerned  then you take the example of the dairy industry  when the government in their own one word they have given us into dairy industry also  so there are about six fifty people applied for to go for dairy industry  many people like both domestic as well as the multinational they came forward to go for the dairy industry as there is potential in this country also  but i was made to understand that mr balram jakhar he came in the way and he wanted to bring same other narad   through back door  so mr balram jakhar announced through his animal husbundry department of the ministry of agriculture an offer by then milk and milk products are to the n f n f d o  so if anybody wants to go for dairy with an install capacity of more than ten thousand litres per day then entirely he has to get his name registered and we get registering form from the agriculture department  it is challenged in the court of law  so for the last two years instead of the liberalisation in the dairy industry two words applications are pending with the union government for want of the registration with delay ministry of agriculture headed by mr balram jakhar  i take another example  for example the second biggest monopoly in the world the r k reynolds company they approached this government to allow them to produce cigerettes in this country and they ensured the nation to  to the extent that they would consume about twenty-eight thousand metric tons of sugar metric tons of tobacco in this country  and not only that they ensured to export about one forty crores of cigarettes to the other countries and they also ensured that about six hundred crores  of revenue they will contribute in the form of excise on this cigerette  but their proposal was was also turned down  i visited one word to the minister of commerce and the minister told me that as the deputy chairman of the planning commission he vetoed it  since the last forty-five years this is the only year when there is no hike and the excise component on the cigarette  but the answer to this the cigarette manufacturers in their own wisdom during last january february as they rotate they enhanced the prices of the cigarette then anticipating some enhancement some hike in the excise components on the cigarette in the budget proposal  but to their fortune there was no increase in the excise component  thereby the cigarette manufacturers drawn an opportunity  to garner three hundred crores of rupees   which did not circulate to the government in the form of the revenue  and nor to the tobacco grower for in the form of the price of the tobacco  add to this two words the prices of the tobacco are going down when compared to the last two three years so we suggested to the government to impose a levy of one percent on the sale of the cigarette and which money which amount  can be utilised as a market stabilising fund for the tobacco  and i hope the government will come out and the finance minister will come out while answering these by answering  the finance bill and see that the one percent is imposed on the sale of the cigarette and that money can be utilised as a market stabilising fund so i hope that the finance minister will come out with the proposal while answering these fi financing  it thank you
