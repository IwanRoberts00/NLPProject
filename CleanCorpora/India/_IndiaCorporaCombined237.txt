i first became interested in fabric painting when i saw it  advertised in a magazine  so i went out and got a whole lot of colours and uhm i first started out by painting on pieces of pa on pieces of uh cloth  i took the designs from magazines from uhm cards  and uh sometimes i just used my own free style design  then uhm i started uh painting  now this is a pillow case   i've done a few designs on this pillow case with fabric paints in the beginning i diluted it very thickly didn't use much water so it's come a bit crudely  it hasn't come very well  so uhm i decided to dilute the paint a little more  and make the colour more refined  now i use all sorts of colours like blue green yellow  violet indigo black white on black  you can use any colour on any kind of cloth and the results are fantastic now have a look at this bedsheet  this is something i tried quite recently  this is a mixture of all sorts of ideas   i've taken it's some kind of ink freaking  you can do the same sort of thing on paper take a piece of string dip it in ink put it between two pieces of paper flatten it the paper and pull it out slowly  now the same idea has been applied on this bedsheet  but the string i have taken is slightly thicker and i have streaked the bedsheet all over and then the results that you can see are fantastic  it has given it a very printed kind of look and uhm very professional  and not only that i spray painted all over the bedsheet  with different colours and i've used enough stensils to mark a ki kind of outline all round the end of the bedsheet  so uhm the effect is quite good actually  now uh this was just a trial actually starting with sort of bedsheet because bedsheets aren't very expensive  now here is another piece of cloth  this is a dress material  i have decided to go a step further and try out this kind of fabric painting on dress material  i have done the same sort of thing but i've used uhm  cut out moulds  the moulds are potatoes and ladysfingers  these can be used as moulds for printing in different colours all over the material and i've also spray painted the material  and streaked it  you can even draw your own little stars here and there and see like this and uhm the results are quite good  now all that has to be done with this material is to be cut out and sewn into a dress  i still haven't tried making a dress out of it yet but uh  once i do it the results are good enough i am going to start selling them and i am sure the market is going to be quite good for this kind of stuff because its quite original and i don't think anyone has quite tried this sort of thing before  you can do almost anything with fabric painting you can paint curtains you can paint bedsheets you can paint uhm dress-material handkerchiefs pillow covers  table-cloths  all sorts of things you use around the house even like uhm  just little designs wall designs to hang on the walls and anything else you fancy actually  uhm so uh fabric painting is fast becoming quite popular especially for curtains and other things used around the house but this is the first time i am trying fabric painting on dresses  people have tried it before on uh t-shirts and uhm  other things but i am going to start something new now i am going to start fabric painting on jeans and other articles which haven't been painted so far  now uhm this is a pair of jeans  the modern trend is not to wear jeans that are flawlessly clean but rather to be speckled with all sorts of colours and paints and uh patches  in other words jeans are fashionably dirty these days  people prefer to wear them dirty  now instead of making jeans dirty i think a better idea would be to paint the dirt on  but not exactly paint the dirt on we would rather paint patches on or paint little things on it or even use stensils or potatoes and ladysfingers  you won't believe that a pair of jeans could be made to look like this  now this looks as though it has been done in a factory  and uh i have tried selling a few of these dress and few of this  some of the dress-material before and uhm the prices are people are willing to pay a fair quite good prices for this sort of things  they don't get this kind of print on material which they can buy which they buy in the shop  and uhm well they are willing to pay quite well for it  now these are some curtains  i have hung them up in my bedroom here  see how the outline has been carefully sketched on to the curtains first  these are not quite finished  but the outline has been sketched  now what i have to do is yes since it's been done with carbon paper  now uhm i have to paint the outline and then  paint it in  i also get ideas for my designs from a monthly subscription for a magazine they send pamphlets  small pamphlets with different designs in it that can be used to  fabric painting  and the designs are quite originals in them you can draw animals or flowers or just abstract designs  you can spray paint you can use strings of one word  if you have a good imagination sky is the limit you can do anything now here is another thing  here is a bag  this handbag is made of denim and it has been painted  with fabric paints  there are special types of paints we use for this kind of painting they are camlin wat uh they are not exactly water colours they are fevicraft  they are called fevicraft colours and they are available in a wide range of colours they should be diluted quite a bit and you can paint  see how i have done this bag  the result is astonishing  not only can you paint bags and other pieces of cloth but you can also paint vessels infact anything that you use around the house you can paint practically anything  you can paint claypots  you can do all sorts of designs on clay-pots even egyptian designs like the old egyptian urns greek designs like graceo urns  and uhm they will make wonderful ornaments put all over the house  then uhm some people so  some people just come and ask me to paint things on any object they bring either pieces of cloths or some a  pie a piece of cloth they want to make into something or any sort of cloth actually plus different sorts of articles  you can even paint uh vehicles like bikes  you can do all sorts of designs on a bike  and uhm this is becoming quite a fad these days with the younger generation specially people in colleges because they go in for all sorts of crazy things on their bikes these days like stickers and other things  and fabric painting happens to stay  it stays on bike for a much longer time  it doesn't come off like a sticker  not only can you do fabric painting on all these things you can also paint canvas shoes  you will be amazed at the sort of things you can paint on canvas shoes  you can totally change the colour of plain white canvas shoes  you can make them look very trendy and very fashionable by  painting almost anything on them from your relations to all sorts of exotic designs  you can paint towels skirts jackets  denim jackets are another fashion these days with fabric painting people go in for all sorts of things written on the back of their denim jackets here is one  this one somebody gave me and told me what to write on it  so i have painted it the way that person wanted  i take orders sometimes but mainly i use my own imaginations  and i normally do exactly as i feel like i let my imagination run wild sometimes and the results are usually very good  they are impressive  and lot of people like my work and uhm here all the things in front of you   it's quite an array here and uhm it's   these are most of the things you can uh use fabric paints on  i am sure other people with good imaginations can think of many more things from fabric paints  and uhm that's about it the fabric paints  so this is how fabric paints can be used  hello there today's topic home-made cosmetics  out of the fifty or more cosmetics that are available today we have selected a few for your preparations at home  the accent has been on easy availability and processing  please have your books and pens ready so that you can note down the formulae and procedure that are going to be flashed up on to the screen  follow the safety precautions to the best of your ability so that you can get serviceable and usable material  many people say the use of cosmetics is a luxury  others are equally voceferous that it is important for personality development and en enhancement    we leave it to you to decide  but have your books and pens ready and for your information cosmetics is derived from the greek word cosmeticos  meaning skill in decorating  another meaning for the word cosmos is ornament  and as you know cosmos also means the whole universe so the supporters of cosmetics say that the scope is wide ranging and far reaching  now professor sai prakash will tell you more about this let us start with the first procedure of preparing a cleansing cream  historically one of the earliest creams was prepared by  jaily around the year one thirty-two hundred a d  and he was one of the famous physicians of that particular time next only to hippocritis  his cooling ointment called serateem refrigeran  they call into a present cleansing cream has the basic ingredient  bees wax olive olive oil rose water etcetera  and the combination of this cleansing cream even to this day is almost similar  in chart one you have the basic ingredients present in a cleansing cream like bees wax mineral oil or vegetable oil as given in part b of the chart water and borax  these are the ingredients with which you can prepare uh a simple cleansing cream at home  and the purpose of this pa  particular cleansing cream is to remove oil grime  facial make-up etcetera from face or throat or other parts of the body  and other creams such as uh vanishing cream hand cream or one word creams are prepared with this basic formulation  we have the method of preparation in the flow diagram given in chart two  and uh in the chart you see that we have uh bees wax and mineral oil taken together melted and heated upto seventy degree so that the wax melts and we have a homogeneous solution  borax taken in water dissolved in water and once again heated to seventy degree so that both these reacting  bees wax in mineral oil borax in water are at seventy degree  and they are mixed up slowly  borax in water being added to this bees wax oil composition slowly with continuous stirring  and when all the ingredient has been added you stir vigorously and allow the temperature to cool down when it comes to around fifty degrees or so you add uh uh perfume of your choice   it's because one has to be very selective in adding  perfume because the choice varies from person to person  a suitable perfume can be added and then the temperature brought down further  at this stage you see that the whole thing emulsifies  and you get the cold or one word cream of your choice  now the procedure is very simple and uh we will be doing that particular experiment now  here we have bees wax it is made into small chips uhm  when it is marketed it's of this particular shape  this is done to see that it melts easily and this has this has got to be dissolved in mineral oil  here is the mineral oil sample  i am going to pour this into a beaker and uh the quantities are as given in the chart the same poportion being taken  this is the mineral oil transfered into a beaker and then  the beas wax is crushed into this utensil  and uh we have a set up of uh i'll  take it out with the help of a glassrod  after tranfering bees wax into mineral oil we now take  borax and dissolve it in the wa dissolve it in water for according to the quantities given  and then heat these two ingredients to seventy degrees and i have the set up here the heater and then uh water inside and that water is getting heated up  i now transfer this beaker into the water bowl  arrangement i have made and also the borax water  combination  borax dissolves and we now have to heat it to seventy degrees now if you are doing it at home and if you don't have  thermometer with you you can as well take seventy degrees as an approxiamate temperature when vapours just start coming out  now that the temperature has come to seventy degrees we  remove these to and i place at top bees wax borax or bees wax and mineral oil combination  and i start adding borax water mixture slowly  with uh continuous stirring  you see a sudden change and a sort of a emulsion forming  and this is done under hot conditions both of them at seventy degrees  initially both these solutions were colourless now we will get a beautiful cream and i add the whole thing and  stirr it vigorously  you can take the one word surely it's  different beautiful cream that is prepared
