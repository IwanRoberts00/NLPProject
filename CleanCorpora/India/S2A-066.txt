""
""
your honour this is a case  where earlier the section was
applied was three nought seven 
""
but later on as the  as the deceased  as the  pa  as
the patient  was  uh  succumbed to death  it was altered into
three nought two   ipc  your honour
""
""
 no  
""
""
three nought seven to three nought
""
""
yes three nought two 
""
""
yes
""
""
five  p w's  were examined by the prosecution 
""
five prosecution witnesses were examined by the prosecution 
""
but uh  there is no eye witness in the whole case  unh 
whole case rested upon the circumstantial evidence  and three dying
declarations 
""
as far as  your  your honour dying declaration by the s c m
is concerned  the the first dying declaration recorded by p w number one
s c m  is concerned  there is no any endorsement of the doctor  to
the effect  that the patient was in a  fit uh fit there was no
endorsement that the patient was uh  despondent is in a fit state  to
make a declaration 
""
""
then
""
""
then as such it  wishes   it  wishes  the
whole dying declaration 
""
""
and then
""
""
ans as such it  wishes   it  wishes  the
whole dying declaration 
""
because there is no endorsement of the doctor to the effect 
that  patient was conscious and was in a free state of mind
""
""
what number
""
""
but uh  inspite of the fact that uh  no endorsement of
the doctor was obtained  in evidence of p w number five  on page uh
""
""
your honour  as far as  p w number three is concerned he is a
doctor who has uh  he who has uh performed the post mortem your honour
""
and  what is relevant is at the time of the
""
""
 one word 
""
""
yes your honour it is very much necessary because  as far
as the  doctor's  endorsement is concerned your honour  it is
relevant because at the time  when the declaration was made whether the
patient or the despondent was in a condition to  condition to depose 
is very much material
""
""
but the doctor is   there 
""
""
 and   and and   and this this 
""
""
 when the doctor   is present before them
""
""
yes your honour
""
and uh in this case  apart from whether the  con  patient
was in a condition to talk is not sufficient what is sufficient is the mental
act as well your honour 
""
a patient uh  if it is   a   an   incident
as alleged by the prosecution  then a patient can be under the mental
shock 
""
""
yes proceed
""
""
and  maybe due to one reason or the other his uh 
reasoning capacity  may be affected 
""
she may not be able to understand the questions which were put to
her 
""
the 
""
""
yes
""
""
and uh here your honour  it is a clear case that uh  it
is she herself  it is not the case that i had uh  gone and i had read
the message
""
but  i fully aware your honour that it is a superficial when
injury everything is there  and your honour when uh even the  i o also
here says that uh  doctor was very much present 
""
even the evidence of p w number four was also there that he was
very much present at the time 
""
""
who  ?
""
""
your honour i am relying upon the evidence of uh p w number
five upon two 
""
here he has said this since the doctor was very much present 
while the complaint was being recorded 
""
your honour  i am  on a   on the point that when the
  pa  condition of the patient was not serious as alleged by the
prosecution 
""
as far as your honour condition uh whether he is in a condition to
make a statement or not
""
""
that of course
""
""
honour  my honest submission is this that the
""
""
make it clear 
""
""
p w seven doctor  ram   who has first treated this
patient  immediately after the patient was brought to the hospital has
deposed in words that she was   a  con    in a condition
  to speak 
""
""
your honour my question was that whether at the time of
admission he was in a condition to talk or not 
""
i am not on that point your honour
""
""
doctor miss  maya 
""
""
your honour but i am not on that point your honour
""
i am not uh  challenging the qualification of a doctor your
honour i am also admitting that she is m s  but i am only on the point
your honour whether the time when the deposition was made  it 
doctor's  endorsement was necessary to that effect  and because 
doctor's  endorsement is not there your honour  a reasonable doubt can
be there your honour that he is not uh  he may not be in a condition or
uh  or in a mental state  to depose  what she has deposed 
""
""
yes 
""
see the next point 
""
""
yes your honour 
""
my next point is  in this incident your honour as far as uh 
kerosene uh  prosecution is silent as to from where the  complainant
or  i'd  say deceased  has procured kerosene oil 
""
different versions are before the honourable court 
""
according to f i r your honour  f i r is silent on this point
""
""
as far as  panchanama  is concerned  exhibit
eighteen  that a plastic bottle was containing kerosene uh kerosene oil
""
""
as far as evidence of p w number three  uh two is concerned
mother of the    de    deceased    but uh 
""
""
number over six before the judge she has removed the
""
""
yes  it is exhibit 
""
""
yes your honour  but as far as the evidence of p w number
two is concerned your honour  p w number two says  that uh  yeah i
am on page uh  two upon two your honour  that uh  in anger she
poured kerosene on her person from a lamp 
""
and uh when i asked the same question in cross examination  the
uh  witness says i didn't state in my statement before the police that my
 daughter  binaka  poured kerosene from a lamp on her person 
witness volunteered the lamp was made of a glass bottle 
""
""
then what is there 
""
""
that lamp was made of a glass bottle 
""
that means she poured  herse  uh that means the  deceased
had poured kerosene oil  uh from the  bot  uh  bot  glass
bottle made uh  lamp made of a glass bottle
""
""
yes 
""
""
and uh  if that is so  then there is a   
contrad    contradiction   between the two  that
whether it is from the plastic bottle that she has poured the kerosene oil or
from the   lamp 
""
""
 as a fact   what type of the bottle 
""
it is from the lamp or from that plastic bottle
""
""
exactly your honour but as far as the duty of the
investigation officer is concerned your honour  it is the duty to find out
that exactly from where it was procured your honour 
""
""
yes 
""
""
thirdly your honour uh as far as
""
""
keep the rest free
""
""
yes your honour 
""
thirdly your honour i  i would uh like to submit that as far as
the clothes  under sealed the article under  panchanama 
is concerned your honour  i am on that point 
""
""
over this
""
""
yes this point is over
""
""
the kerosene is uh
""
""
yes
""
""
bottle or a lamp
""
""
so  yes your honour 
""
""
article  four  article four  before the court 
""
""
yes
""
""
now your honour my next point is   regarding  
""
my next point is regarding the seizure of article
""
""
  what's  that  
""
""
seizure of article
""
""
article 
""
""
yes 
""
""
now your honour in this case  if we believe the
prosecution case  where there was a burn injury  on the chest portion
 from front
""
""
chest to abdomen
""
""
chest to abdomen 
""
then in that case the blouse which was produced  by the  uh
under  panchanama  seized in a  seized and produce under
 panchanama  your honour  that should be in burnt condition
""
""
but here it is in torn condition your honour
""
""
uh now this uh 
""
""
now your honour  in this case  the only thing which i
would like to say  that  now your honour  as far as uh  on
this point your honour only thing i would like to submit  that uh  in
forwarding letter  in forwarding letter  the officer has stated 
certain queries  in that queries your honour  the first question was
that whether the exhibit one two three contains any kerosene 
""
and  clear report to that effect  is that  on exhibit
one two and three are positive 
""
but no where your honour in clear report it is mentioned as a 
blouse  wa  blouse  was in burnt condition your honour 
""
""
oh
""
""
yes your honour
""
""
and  the  a few words 
""
""
yes your honour to have a kerosene on the  article 
and  and your honour  when the kerosene is sprinkled on the article uh
like a blouse  or any cloth material your honour  then there is
likelihood that uh  it will burn your honour  even it will not be in
 this position
""
secondly your honour i am on the point as far as uh  cap 
 it  nowhere the witness or the  in f i r neither in the 
""
""
at the scene of
""
""
dying declaration your honour  it is stated that it is
sprinkled your honour  there is difference between sprinkling and pouring
your honour 
""
here it is poured your honour
""
""
but the 
""
""
yes your honour but i am confining myself on the day of
incident your honour 
""
as far as on the day of incident is concerned your honour
""
""
yes
""
""
different   version is   versions are  
there in the f i r and in the  uh dying declaration your honour
""
""
yes 
""
""
as far as f i r is concerned your honour     sh
   she   has stated that  today that means on eleven
nine ninety-two at about three pm my husband  mahesh  assaulted me
 as i didn't go to collect scrap and further picked up quarrel with me
 at about four pm  that thing 
""
there is a time gap of one hour 
""
it means assaulting  and between the quarrel 
""
that means  uh assaulted and picked up quarrel with me at
three p m  and  at about four pm i poured kerosene on my own person
""
""
ah 
""
""
at about four pm  i poured kerosene  on my own person
""
""
""
so
""
""
so within
""
""
article seizure of article  seizure of
""
""
very well your honour i will first confine myself to seizure
of article your honour 
""
as far as your honour seizure of article is concerned  i will
uh  humbly submit that as far as uh this uh  blouse piece is concerned
 and if your honour will notice  then  i don't know whether uh
 yes  i think this is the first front portion 
""
this is the front portion of the blouse your honour 
""
and  as per medical evidence your honour  there was  a
  injury  burn injury 
""
i will say  major burn injury  on chest and abdomen your
honour 
""
in that case your honour this blouse would not  be  have
been intact your honour 
""
this is intact because if your honour will see
""
""
ah  this 
""
""
if your honour will see the uh   patti 
your honour
""
""
ha
""
""
then it means this is a complete blouse 
""
the only thing  somebody has cut  if your honour say that
it may have cut uh  by the c a  uhm
""
""
it is taken by the c a
""
""
yes  that's  your honour 
""
your honour my only submission is that looking into the condition
of the   bl  this piece of cloth blouse  your honour it is a
full uh  it is a complete one  only it is in torn condition  but
not in burnt condition
""
""
it is not torn  here it is burnt 
""
""
your honour but uh then i will submit that looking into the
uh  medical uh     me me    medical  
evidence your honour 
""
i will say that uh this is not   a   the  
same  blouse  which could have been worn by the complainant on that
day your honour 
""
this is on that day 
""
""
yes 
""
""
and uh same is my argument as far as two  sarees
 are concerned your honour  two  sarees  have been
produced  but
""
""
 sarees 
""
""
no your honour  i am not on that point your honour 
""
i am on different point now 
""
as far as this is concerned i say it is not uh  burnt  but
it is only in torn condition 
""
but as far as this  uh these two  sarees  are
concerned your honour  my submission is that  that a person  cannot
wear two  sarees  at a   at one  time 
""
and practically it is not possible  to wear two  sarees
  uh on the time of alleged incident your honour 
""
""
therefore
""
""
so 
""
""
it was  one word  
""
""
blanket
""
""
blanket  a few words 
""
""
your honour if that is case then the prosecution has not
brought on the record  that uh  why the two  sarees 
were used
""
""
no no maybe
""
""
sir  there is  as i stated that there is no eye
witness in this case
""
""
yes
""
""
therefore i cannot say whether this  saree 
was worn by that  victim  only thing is that whatever the officers
found there  has been taken charge under the  panchanama 
""
""
but looking at the burnt  saree  it appears to be
the  saree  which was worn by the 
""
""
her
""
""
victim 
""
and obviously  that  because we have to see the 
circumstances that strata from which this community comes 
""
""
and 
""
""
so
""
""
strata society from which they are coming   i know
poverty 
""
""
yes your honour i fully agree
""
""
they come from different strata you have to explain that 
to her   two words  blanket 
""
""
no your honour i am not expecting your honour 
""
but my only humble  submi 
""
""
 a few words 
""
""
yes your honour 
""
and uh  for that reason only your honour nowhere in the f i r
nowhere in the  evidence of the p w   or the dying declaration your
honour it has some 
""
""
  a few words   if the articles are there the
police have seized not uh
""
""
yes your honour 
""
yes your honour  exactly this
""
""
then why it is not the circumstance
""
""
exactly the same thing your honour
""
i want to submit that circumstances may not lie your honour 
because two  sarees  are there why two  sarees 
are there your honour 
""
""
 a few words 
""
""
your honour  in that uh  in that way i will submit
""
""
about say
""
""
your honour in f i r one  gontat  was there
""
""
do you agree statement
""
""
fully agree your honour and for that reason your honour i am
submitting  that uh because two  sarees  are there  in
f i r as well as in uh 
""
""
 one word 
""
""
yes
""
""
 a few words 
""
""
no your honour  as far as  gontat  is
concerned   because   in f i r it is clearly mentioned that the
 accused has tried to extinguish the fire  by uh throwing a gunny bag
or  gontat   on the burning person and therby he has tried
to extinguish the fire  and from where this  saree  has
come your honour 
""

  one word
