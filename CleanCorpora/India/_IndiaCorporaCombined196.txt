honarary minister of information and broadcasting shri  k p singh deo chairpersons of the different jury different phalke award winners award winners of this year excellencies  distinguished film personalities representative of the film industry the media ladies and gentleman  it gives me great pleasure to welcome you to this evening function to honour the artists and technicians who have con  contributed to cinematic excellence during the course of the year  indian cinema has today carved out a place for itself in popular imagination and convincingly left behind all other forms of entertainment  the credit for this goes to those innumerable artists who constantly endeavour to attain success of perfection while adhering to the indian spirit  over the years as a number of films produced has gone up  so has the number of national awards confer  three awards for feature films were given in the year nineteen fifty-four  today one hundred sixteen persons involved in fifty-one films will receive awards  we do need to review regulations for these awards and make further improvement to effectively encourage the best in indian cinema  shall we take this opportunity to greet all the award winners who are assembled here  we take justifiable pride in their achievements  and i earnestly hope that this recognition of their merit will act as an incentive to them to strive for greater excellence in their chosen disciplines  we have with us shri k p singh deo honourable minister for information and broadcasting to grace the occassion with his presence i extend to him a very warm welcome  the honourable president of india has also consented to join us today  we should be welcoming him in our midst later this evening  may i also welcome dr subbarama reddy chairman of the jury for feature films mr vikram singh who chair the jury for non-feature films and shri khalid mohammad chairman of the jury for the best writing on cinema  i also extend a very warm welcome to the past dada saheb phalke awardees shree jairaj shree ashok kumar  and shri bhupen hazarika  this years phalke award recipient shri majrooh sultanpuri other winners of national awards distinguished representatives of the film industry the media and special invitees who all here to share the pride and joy of this momentous occasion  thank you   in hindi  good evening  honourable minister for information and broadcasting mr k p singh deo the secretary information and broadcasting ministry mr bhaskar ghosh dadamuni bhupenda jairaj saab chairman of jury and distinguished guest  perhaps it would be churlish to say that the entries received  for the best popular cinema and this film criticism where by large  mediocre and substandard  on a more positive note let me state that it was an interesting exercise  to plough through the entries and separate the wheat from the chaff  a handfull of the books and articles indicate us that there is hope yet for analytical and insightful writing  the award wining book nalu nenu by the veteran actress dr bhanumati ramakrishna underscores the point that we need more candid and informative autobiographies from film personalities i need to hardly remind you that biographical accounts  written in west have been important adjuncts to the process of film making  for instance many of us have cherished the life stories  authored by the greats of cinema ranging from memorable biography of charlie chaplin to the flashback on the life and career  by vanessa redgrave  curiously very few of our own film luminaries have opted to put pen to paper  it would indeed be wonderful if directors technicians and the acting fraternity recounted stories of their tryst with the art and craft of film making  at this point i must regret the tendency of most indian publishers to capitalise on the deaths of film personality  whether it was the legendary meena kumari or the grand showman  raj kapoor scant attention was paid to the artistry during their own lifetime  in addition a note of caution has to be struck  the year nineteen ninety-five will be celebrated as the centenary of cinema the world over  if the event becomes an excuse for sketchy and quickly assembled books on cinema it would indeed be a pity  both research and reflection are essential before any major endeavour in film writing is undertaken  to come now to film criticism on the whole the entries in this section displays a thorough lack of humour  most of the reviews and the report submitted were weighed down  by excessive verbiage  without adding anymore verbiage of my own let me conclude with a small request to the authorities from me and my colleagues on the panel miss vasudev and miss uday tara nair could the cash prize in the categories of the best book on cinema and best film criticism be increased from the current amount of rupees fifteen thousand each  dare we say to rupees twenty-five thousand each that would be an extra incentive  here is ending then on the note of optimism  thank you  thank you very much khalid for presenting your comments  i now like to invite the chairman of the non- feature film jury  shri k vikram singh to present his address  good evening  honourable minister for information and broadcasting  shri singh deo secretary information broad   broadcasting shri bhaskar ghosh fellow film makers ladies and gentleman  it has been a great pleasure for me and other members of the non- feature film jury to see and select films for the non-feature film awards  i am happy with report that the documentary film in india is in a state of good health  and the short drama film is also picking up  this is despite the fact that the number of entries in the non-feature category has declined from one fifty nineteen eighty-five  to only sixty-eight this year  this decline i think is mainly on account of the fact  that is lot of non-fiction work has shifted from the film format to the video format  this body of work on video format is still going largely unrecognised  this jury has therefore separately recommended that documentaries and short films on the video format should be brought within the fold of the national awards  how that can be done is left to an expert committee  but there is one field of documentary film which is facing imminent death  this is the yarn of political documentary  there were very few political documentaries in this years entry  it is not as if the film makers have lost interest in this one word  perhaps the real reason is that the culture of respecting dissent is fast disappearing from our social political life  and therefore the social funding political films have died out  if different and even clashing views are not battled and sorted out on the floors of legislative body and in the media they are bound to violently overflow on the streets  there is an urgent need therefore for creating a framework  on our statefunded television that is doordarshan  within which voices of dissent can be responsibly expressed  i would urge the government as a research step  doordarshan should air off a weakly slot which may be called the other vaults the other views in this research oriented documentaries of the political nature  should be shown  these should be funded by doordarshan but the overall thing is monitoring of this slot should be vested in a non-political body of indepen of independent  intellectual  national film awards are a celebration of cinema as an art form a beginning was made several years ago to name an award  after dada saheb phalke and another award after nargis dutt  it is time we took another step in this direction  i suggest that the government should name the awards for the best film on social issues in the non-feature category after s  suth ray who still remain inadequately recognised  i would also suggest that the government should name the best feature films award after satyajit ray who is without question the greatest film writer and one of the finest mind that india has produced in this century
