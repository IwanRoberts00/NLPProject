what is the uhm necessity of obtaining endorsement of dr uh uh

that the accused has reported the incident to p w number two 
the mother of the deceased after going to her house  and then telling that
he would bring some money for medicine and went away and he did not return

""
the learned special p p has then canvassed before this court as to
why the accused ran away on the  pretext of uh bringing uh money from uh

""
   e e    if    according to  him
the accused had not    commi   uh  committed  
the offence of throwing the uh  lighted match-stick on the person of the
deceased
""
he would not have uh  he would not certainly run away

articles 
""
lastly the learned special p p has canvassed before this court 
that all the threee dying declarations are consistent and uhm  there is no
different version in this respect 
""
uh according to him each one of the dying declaration is sufficient
to prove the guilt of the accused uh  independently 
""
he has also canvassed before this court that about the conduct of
the accused that uh  by not remaining present in the hospital uh 
hospital    show   shows   that it is the accused
only who is uh  responsible for  this offence

urged  that he has proved the  charge beyond a reasonable doubt against
the accused and that the accused  may be dealt uh with accordingly 
""
miss  dwivedi trivedi the learned special p p   clears
troat  uh appearing for the    def  uh   defence 
  has canvassed before this court  that there is no direct eye
witness to the incident

she has canvassed before this court that the accused was charged
for the offence under section three nought seven i p c  at the outset 
""
and that the charge uh  appears to have been uh altered to
section three nought two uh i p c 
""
she has also canvassed before this court that this is a case of
circumstantial evidence 
""
she has also canvassed before this court that  on the first
dying declaration recorded by p w number one  there is no endorsement of
the doctor  to the effect that the deceased was in a position to speak and
to make the dying declaration 
""
she has also canvassed before this court that the doctors
endorsement is necessary to show  that patient was in a position to speak
""
the second uh point which the learned defence council has canvassed
before this court is about  uh procuring of kerosene bottle which
according to her  is silent 
""
uh the  panchnama  showed that the plastic was
containing kerosene
""
the learned defence council  relied on the evidence of p w
number two and has stated  that the deceased poured kerosene uh from the
kerosene lamp article four
""
the learned defence council further canvassed before this court 
that regarding the seizure of articles  the blouse  article number
three ought to have been  burnt if the deceased had burn injuries from
chest to abdomen 
""
however according to the learned defence council looking to the
evidence of p w number one to five  she has canvassed that the blouse
article three is not burnt but it is torn 
""
she has also invited the attention of this    cou 
 uh   court   to the two  sarees  in this
case and raised the query as to how two  sarees  are taken
charge of 
""
the deceased cannot  be expected to wear two  sarees
 uh  at one and the same time
""
therefore according to her  it creates doubt about this case in
view of the  uh production of two  sarees  by the
prosecution
