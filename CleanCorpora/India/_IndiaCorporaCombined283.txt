radio sangli  the time is eight fifteen p m  tomorrow is to observe this event we now bring you a talk entitled higher education and women  the speaker is dr vasanti rasam  and she is highlighting the factors responsible for such a low female literacy and makes certain recommendation  problems of women can be visualised in almost all forms of system with varying degrees  neverthless women in socialist nations seem to have come a long way in achieving equal status to that of man  on the other hand indian women have been oppressed in all the fields at two levels at the caste and class level  in educational sphere too women have been opressed under the traditional set up of our society  recently there is a growing tendency towards improving the conditions of women in india considering them to be a part of national development process  the major thrust of the seventh five year plan   was on the development of women  the basic approach would be to enable women to acquire confidence in themselves and to develop a sense of responsibility  towards the overall development and betterment of society and their individual personality  all this comes in a country where horrifying atrocities have been committed against women since ages  even fifty years ago female infanticide child marriage  and subsequent widowhood sati devdasi etcetera were widely prevalent and are still heard of in rural areas  with independence came the age of social reform to eradicate the evils against women  but still today even if you just scratch the surface of indian culture we are exposed to the male dominated society  where did we go wrong then ? why does the indian women still reveal in stereotype role of self sacrifice rather than those of self awareness ? the blame must surely lie at the doors of our educational system which is nearly a ritual rather than an effective means of equalising opportunity and erasing the sex bias  education for girls was and is still influenced by a wide range of factors which are considerably different from those that affect boys education  it can be noted that girls education at large was encouraged  and tolerated after an age or after certain standard at which it can do little good or little harm  the notion that education itself whether primary secondary or higher is harmful was prevalent upto yester years and is still relevent as far as higher education is concerned  this notion limited the exposure of women to the external world and influences  the basic conviction that there is something special about womens nature which could be destroyed by excessive education portrayed the uniqueness of women and hence the difference in the syllabii of boys and girls  the rudiments of reading writing a little arithmatic hygiene needle work embroidery and vernacular language were being regarded as more than adequate for girls  once a demand for women's education came from the social reformers for their emancipation there was also demand for educated bride for a new western educated breed of men  thereby expanding the aim of education for girls from competent wife and mother to intelligent companion  the liberational role of education emphasised by the radicals had been subordinated to the social goal of willing admissal and not a questioning and an enquiring mind  here one can note the conflict between the ideals of womenhood of our society and the ideals of education which lead to creation of a certain measure of independent thought a spirit of enquiry and of objectivity which as a bind by men of our society could threaten  the well maintained differences between the sexes  and they also feared that their control over women would be marginalised with too much of education of wrong kind  this ideological difference continued to be preserved today  despite the efforts made by various planning commissions for the improvement of female literacy   mrs durgabai deshmukh committee put forth the view that in no way was education a threat to family life and that today  there was a need to break the barriers of the gender based division of work  this opinion was reiterated by the kothari commission  also   the hansa mehta committee holds that inequality of sexes is built in the minds of men and women through socialisation which continues to be extremely powerful  which was also accepted by the committee on status of women in india in ninety seventy-four  of recent the seventh five year plan  threw the challenge to education a policy perspective listed some laudable goals of education for women also  despite the above effort and an increase in the girls enrollment at primary and middle school level the percentage of absolute  or absolute magnitude as compared to boys is still low  further even though the performance of girls compared favourably with that of boys only a limited number of girls seek admission into higher education or professional courses other than those pertaining to medicine teachers' training and nursing  the drop out rate also in case of girls at middle school level is much higher than boys  what then are the specific reasons for such low female literacy  ? one of course is poverty where a family's economic  and financial problem do not give an opportunity to girls where preference is for educating a son rather than a daughter who is to be married off and sent to some another family  the second reason could be classified as ignorance or cultural biases of society and the consequent belief that education is irrelevent to the future role expectation of a wife and a mother  it may be observed that many parents still hesitate to send girls to distant or coeducational institution and are averse to those in which there are no women teachers  while for the rural women education is considered unnecessary  for an urban women it is merely a value wager in the competitive marriage market  despite the fact that the system has the attitude the brother is encouraged to take up higher education at all cost  this is due to the influence of nonacademic factors related to social and familiar expectation as to what a girls basic role in life is to be a good bride intelligent companion but not an enquiring mind but a devoted mother and who may if she has time work at most as a teacher or as a clerk  it is also unfortunately true that even girls at large choose to believe that there can be no fulfilment in combining many roles or to compete in the male dominated area  interesting factors that the proportion of women to men at the post graduate level is higher than at the undergraduate level which shows that once women in certain areas are able to break the barriers of prejudice they proceed to acquire further degree and perhaps a job  not doubting their aptitude but have mental ability of her mind  indian woman today is caught up in the terrible cross current  on one hand she is a best by model handed down by our traditional society and on the other she is being communicated by various agencies negating these morals  woman therefore is responsible themselves partially as she does not take a stance even when she is badly pushed  those who have an opportunity to get higher education even as far as post graduation and doctorate are not able to decide for themselves to make a career as it would depend once again on the man her husband or in-laws to decide for her future after her marriage   there's no doubt state of women literacy is improving  yet as compared to that of male literacy is still low more so in rural areas  moreover even today educational institutions are not regarded as institutions for acquiring knowledge and for providing training for a good vocation but as respectable waiting rooms for girls who are to be married off  thus the function of education also will relatively be  different in case of girls and boys to date  the dilemma casued by the exposure to the external world  coupled with a need to keep in touch with the notion of female dependency is result by choosing well demarketed suitable areas or otherwise called the safe educational realms of study for girls and avoiding others  the major efforts of the libera liberal  forces to improve womens educational status by raising the age of marriage and emphasising education as an important means of emancipation cannot be denied  yet the liberal view of education as a liberating force  is however undermined or the limit to access to education posed by womens role in the family  for all the classes of women the content in role of education victory a deep ambivalence between womens role and individual growth  thus if education is to play a due role in translating  women's equality from the pages of the constitution to actual reality then education policy must introduce basic issues like as access or reduction and later elimination of gender disparity within the educational process which also reflects in employment socio-political participation opportunities for personal growth and competence which alone can build defences against degradation exploitation or oppression and lead to self confident individual  this requires educational system to take up the task of changing the attitude and values regarding womens role and rights in society  to one of the equal participation in all socio- economic and political processes and national and international development  for this the educational programme for female literacy needs to be re-evaluated and formulated a new in the light of experience of the bygone years  a general plan for education which is not taken into account  the specific problems faced by women fails to benefit them  thus a kind of grassroot input is necessary so that  the programmes planned at the ministerial level translate themselves into meaningful developmental input
