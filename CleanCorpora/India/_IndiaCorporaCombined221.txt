i think you know something about credit cards   the way in which a credit cards card   is issued to customer and the means in which you can use the credit card  basically a credit card is an unsecured loan  given by any bank or financial institution  when a bank is going to issue a credit card we say they have a strong certain capital base  we or bank's fundemental aspects behind which a  credit card company runs is the requirement of working capital  so banks can draft the fund from other departments and uh  that's how issuing this credit card  let me tell you about the proper method credit card  is issued  see basically as i told tell you it's an unsecured loan we don't require any uh what do you call as deposit or any advances against issue of credit card  all the customer has to do is to give some documents proving his income  and we have certain criteria for procurement of uh issuing that  credit cards   let's suppose it's a salaried customer  he had to have a minimum gross salary of fifty thousand per annum  and thirty-six thousand per month  so this is for master card and visa card  we also have another card called the diners club card   so the premium have a value card it's about uh if it is a salaried guy he had to have an income of fifty thousand that is the take home and the gross of ninety-six thousand  so these are basically two views one is the verification view  and other is judgemental view  who has taken unsecured loan we have to verify as to the genuinity of the customer  he might for all you know he might going to be your credit runner  so the person you have to pick is that that are really executives whether he is really capable of holding credit cards because the banks stake is involved in it  and we have cases of two words worth lakhs  of rupees  so the first thing that we require for that guy is to  fulfill our income criteria  if he fulfills that we have to fix some verification criteria so the first thing that we do is clear application  we have what you call as direct sales agent  so these guys go and get application from a major company  and uh big shop partnerships and all that  so as soon as they clear applications and get them signed with all the documents they are submitted to a certified public accountant he may call us metro city they submit all app or the application to the metro city  and the metro city gives them to uh c p i in madras, whom we call as a noddle certified public accountant and uh that noddle  certified public accountant verifies after the completing of the application whether they have fulfill the criteria manually and uh data enters them onto the computers which are in the system and at the end of the day he takes down them as a dbase file  and at the end of the day he transmit this through a modem to trivandrum  and everyday evening this transmission gets into progress and after this gets downloaded into citibank systems we have to convert it into our database and we have to issue the database upto work table  so we have to run certain programmes they are called odi programmes or what you call end of the programme  after all these programmes are run these database downloaded into our system  and next day morning they will be available for verification  so the datas here and the application will come in the next day morning  as soon as they come we have a process of what is called as moving an application to an approval stage  we have a different stage  suppose uh uh applicant doesn't given give  his date of birth  it is a mandatory field we have certain mandatory field suppose if he has not given his address  suppose if he has not given his date of birth  if you suppose if he has not given his income we have a mandatory field which are compulsory for any application  so everyday a programme is run  and uh the pointer looks up these certain fields and if these are not fulfilled it throws them into a certain station  okay and uh if this check is fulfilled it moves to another stage  where you call a credit scoring programme as such based on the age of the applicant on his financial status  on his uh assets worth on the type of vehicle he own  owns there were funny fundemental tid bits  and taking all these into account a certain score is assigned to a customer  suppose he fails to score he will never be given a card  and uh suppose he crosses that score he moves to another stage called a de-duplicative stage  so all you know a customer might apply once again he may be already having a card  and uh he might apply once again to get another card  and there might be a chance of fraud  so to rule out these cases cases of fraud we have certain programmes what is called as de-duplication programme  we have a database of around four lakh fifty thousand members  around two lakh members and one lakh  fifty thousand applicant plus some one lakh in our work table  so our database or or what you call uh members  addresses and all these are totally on birthday base  so let's say these data gets matched against any of these   let's say date of birth or address or anything it is it goes to a certain status and any officer concerned has to look into it why why is it that ? for all you know me and my friend could have a same date of birth but we are different persons  so we have to look uh this is same person  and suppose these are different he has to clearly  clear uhm de-duplication programme  and after they cleared it it goes to credit verification stage  okay and uh the credit verification stage is sometimes all about  the verification of the application towards its completeness  towards the income criteria and certain how it consist criterias   consists of criteria which i mean the credit card  man may subcribe  so we have to look for all these things and suppose if it is fulfilled we move to a different status  and then two parallel process go on  one is the fiscal reputaion criteria and the other one is the bank verification criteria  suppose uh for certain categories of applicant we have different categories of verification based on their deliquency and their past performance  we have a we have taken a from how these portfolio perform  and based on their performance of these portfolio we have induced a certain verification criteria  so suppose uh let's say if it is salaried person we have to perform our own verification  suppose if you contact in a public limited company here the credit runner is much less you know public limited company we have to check for the person has he really applied for a card  you see the person who has really applied for the card and certain checks over it we have to check about a few words  yeah he may cross that stage  and then suppose it is self employed we have to do a bank reference so this bank reference tell you all about the customer whether  he has any bounce cheques what is his nominal balance  so this will provide you valuable clues as to how he could perform on your account  so after this has proved being pushed the application get certain status and after all this is done we issue a card  as soon as the card is issued based on the source of accumulation the billing is done   the there are five different types of clause of acquisition  one is the direct sales agency  the other one has got a cross road application  suppose if he is already a diner clubs card number we sell him a  visa card or master card across the billing  or when he gets the bill he gets these kind of application he is into the cross road  the third one is take on take on and there customers have been short finale  so he all the customer has to do is come and pick up the application fill up all this and if he fulfills the criteria he is given the card  and there are two three other ways in which a card is issued so these are the different ways in which application is closed so based on the source of application the billing is different  so as soon as these are entered a card is endorsed at  on the third day as soon as application is approved so as soon as the card is approved it goes to the customer on a second day  lately by third day the card get endorsed  the next day the card reaches the customer  and if you want to withdraw cash from what do you call as the automatic teller-machine or anytime money a t m he has to get the card encoded  there is a certain uhm personal identification number which you give to a customer  only that customer holds that number and on then only he uses that number in the a t m he can withdraw money from that a t m  so he has to get the card encoded in the a t m and then you can use the car card for cash withdrawl  for purchases a customer need not get his card encoded he can just walk over to any shop which accepts our cards  those are called member establishment  so here he just walk over to a shop buy anything and then charge his card against it  we have what you call as charge list  suppose a customer goes and buys uh certain products okay and uh he has to submit the card  we have certain enrollment for every merchant establishment based on their performances and their deliquencies  so let's say a jewellery shop is a high risk area so every charge that is booked in a jewellery shop should be authorised by city bank  so every time a charge come to a jewellery shop the  member establishment has to call up city bank to take an authorisation code which is an online real time system  so certain fields are looked for and the card number is looked for so suppose the card number is data entered in that  it immediately looks for customers account its credit open to buy and how much is the credit line and how much has he utilised it  and there are certain checks towards it wh   whether he has any bounce cheques in his account  so it looks for very synthetic field and that either approves it or reject it  if it is a if it is approved or certain code is generated  and the the code is given to the member establishment he has to write it down on that stamp slip on his copy there are three copies atleast one to the card member one to the city bank and one to member  so he has to write the authorisation code on that card state bank submitted to city bank  i mean when there is an authorisation code the charge will be valid  only in case of flow limit higher than what a fixed deposit has given  in case he has charges below the flow limit accepted by city bank he will not take an authorisation  he can just give the charge to one word and  submit to city bank to get payment within two or three days  the main reason why uh charge required to be authorise is because of the delin deliquency of customer, let me suppose a customer has a credit line of only twenty-five thousand and he has applied sixty thousand and he hasn't paid us till now so we can't allow the customer to use the card and keep piling on the deliquency or the raise up raise debt getting accumulated  so we have to serve him certain point of time  so let us say a customer goes deliquent and his account is blocked here  when these customers their tendencies it's  normally to go and buy something above the flow limit  so when they go above the flow limit the merchant ordinarly takes the authorisation from the city bank  so let's if an authorisation is declined the one word of charges declined and in certain cases where there are more sensitive cases we pick up the card  and if the card is picked up from a merchant establishment the merchant gets a an award of thousand rupees or put on  it's depending on the value of the outstanding of the customer  so these merchants help about in uh quite a good way  and another way where we detect fraud is about uh another  sensitive areas where these customers go is to the a t m  so these customers go and try to withdraw money from the a t m  so what we do is we block his account to the a t m  and uh at the end of the day we transfer certain file  as soon as these files are tranfered to the a t m through a modem  any card that is black listed or hot listed in the a t m if it is inserted into a a t m counter the card gets wall out  you can never get the card back  the only way that you can get the card get back you should get reinstated or to get a new card  so these are some ways where fraud is being detected or is being controlled  and the money that we made is on discount that we get from member establishment  so let's say this is called the plastic money and everybody profess not to carry money and they prefer to carry only credit card  so we go negotiate with member establishment to accept our cards  what is the benefit for a member establishment ? he has a larger customer base  and what is the benefit for city bank ? we get a discount of two point three percent  uh let's say a customer goes and buys goods worth  rupees hundred rupees okay and suppose the member establishment submit the charge to us we pay him only the amount less the discount on which there it is agreed
