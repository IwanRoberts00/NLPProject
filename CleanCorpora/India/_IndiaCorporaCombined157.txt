 ( a) whether it is a fact that twenty-four odd doctors who had been on plague control duty at the indira gandhi international airport since october first nineteen ninety-four were on duty till twenty-ninth november nineteen ninety-four more than a month after the  world health organization declared that plague was no more a threat in the country and ( b)   if so the details and reason for retaining the team at the airport for such a long period  sir question number two zero two ( a) and ( b) i have check at the airport they were continue even after plague was fully contained to alliviate the apprehension of the other countries as per as the recommendation of world health organisation  uh next  it is good thing that the government has extended the stay of doctors at the international airport on the advice of the   world health organization  but the main point is why this dreadful disease or epidemic  has suddenly appeared in our country  whether the government have necessary impact of the origin and impact of the plague why it came suddenly ? and what steps government has taken in order to assess the  epidemic and uh the loss of life and property and also  what steps have been taken on the uh recommendations for uh  memorandum submitted by the municipal union of uh surat which said  in the wake of floods in tapti river and the wake of large amount of garbage piling up there they advised the municipal authorities and the government to appoint number of uh extra staff to clear the garbage  but the government did not take what steps the government had taken to review the causes for this disease and its eradication ? thank you honourable minister  sir as soon as we got the report of the plague occurance in the beed district of maharashtra and subsequently in surat sir the government of india has taken all possible help sending expert and medicine and all support to the uh respective state government to control plague sir  sir about the occurrence of plague in our country sir we have  appointed a committee under a renowned sci medical scientist dr ramaswamy lingam sir uh ra interruption ramalingam swamy and they they are requested to give their have a detailed study and give report report within six months sir about about the uh memorandum submitted by surat i i don't have any information about that sir at at present  second supplementary please  the main cause for the occurrence of plague and we recently we had recurrence of malaria also in some parts of the country  so the health of the country is going down like this and the government has not taken any steps but the main point i would like to ask the minister is  this piling up of garbage in municipality though it was cleared up in the first days after the occurrence of plague  but subsequently it was stopped  it is due to lack of financial resources with municipalities  and government has taken up evolved a plan to provide finances to clean up this garbage so that such diseases do not occur in future any plan of action is being contemplated by the government  sir the garbage problem all over the country specially the municipal corporation are all over the country sir and this municipal corporation administration come under the state governemnt sir we are in contact with the state government to take appropriate action to clean up clean up their keep clean their city sir and and that part we have informed the state government sir not only the plague there are ot  other it is a very unhealthy scene to have one word in any city or in any municipal uh uh area sir and and it is directly under the state government but we have uh uh told the state government to take appropriate action so that there should not be any one word but  it is upto the state government sir  mr das shri guru das gupta  sir the cause for plague is piling up garbage one of the causes  and there is piling of garbage everywhere  now the honourable minister says that it has advised the municipal corporations to clean the garbage  but the point is import important   point is they are all all the diseases are reappearing  plague malaria cholera they all reappeared  but right to health is a normal human right  without passing on the path i could i let me ask me  the honourable minister whether the government health ministry of union government shall make available additional funds for the use  of the municipalities to take emergency measures for cleaning of the garbage  of course political garbage cannot be cleaned  that is different but the other garbage is to be cleaned  and for this the honourable minister let him say whether he is in a position to make allocation for additional funds so that plague and malaria can be eradicated nowhere in the world it is coming up  but in india again we are getting what about the funds ? will you make available funds to the municipality  will you make available will you make available additional funds for this particular purpose to the municipalities and the state governments without just issuing a circular  uh mr chairman sir i can appreciate the honourable  member's concern for health to the people of this country  as the house is aware that the health is a state subject  the states have to provide necessary funds for the maintenance of the public health facilities in eradication of the diseases which affect the common man  now the question question two words put the question about providing funds to the municipalities on emergent basis  to help them to remove this garbage which is lying there  almost in all the municipalities of the country  sir as i said earlier we have been in constant touch with the state governments  we have requested the state chief secretary then the health ministers to take necessary steps in this regard  basically the municipalities or the local health authorities local self governments  they are the local authorities  they have their own powers they have their own funds  and it is necessary they have to make necessary provisions that but by saying that we will not avoid our responsibility to come into the aid of the maintenance of the health of people  the honourable member had said that its nowhere in the world but information in the house i can quote where plague is taking the toll of the people in the other country interruption   i don't think i don't think i will be able to pacify the honourable member but i am have given the information for the  benefit of the house  sir uh in other countries in africa madagascar  uganda zaire in south africa peru in united states of america in the united states of america i don't a few words  in united states of america interruption in asia turkistan mongolia myanmar and some other countries in the world have deliberately not shown that it has though there is plague  so it's not that only in india plague is there  interruption  please minister is answering completing his answer  sir there would not be any  please  there would not be any more permanent conclusion then the honourable member is a few words  sir interruption  please please please tell the answer the point so that i can go to another question sir but one thing which he has spoken about me personally  yeah i would like to inform the member not to the house in  a few words  yeah  that i won successively seven times parliament lok sabha elections noise on public one word  let him not teach me the lessons of integrity  a few words and it has caused much to all our concerns in a country  but what a havoc more is sir the publicity alone in publicity in one word improfessional magnitude  so that it caused havoc in the economy of the country  most of the foreigners refused to come to this country  because of that our tourism income has also come down  yes in so many ways the ma the process has caused  much the pre-media has caused much havoc to the economy of the country  under these conditions we should make the foreigners know that the actual epidemic is not in the magnitude which is published for that what has the government to do to contained the press to go publishing like uh this alarming magnitude and also in future also such thing should not happen for that what interruption you see the question is what steps the government has taken to contain the press and also in future to guard interruption  yeah thank you thank you sir  unfortunately the media overplayed the plague situation in the country  even when the world health authorities came here to certify that the quick actions and very effective actions have been taken by the government to control and contained this disease the media didn't support unfortunately   it's not that we have not done the job we have done the job one word world over we are being praised for effective control of this plague in very quick way mr swaminathan  recently i had occasion to meet the two words the world renowned  they had a conference in the india at about during the time of plague  and in that conference they have concluded it was not plague at all  the disease was not plague at all it was a disease just stimulating plague and originally because these people have found out and report to the press it was plague they have been consistently saying it is the plague he had also also given me a paper  for want of time i couldn't go through it completely  well the minister is aware that there is another idea that the disease is not a plague but a disease which has stimulated plague and because originally it was said by some authorities it was plague they have been consistently saying that is plague  sir uh it is confirmed by the n i c the national  uh our communicative diseases sir uh one word they said it is plague and it is clarified by the or supported by our scientist  medical scientist also have supported i k gujral  the honourable minister is right just a second just a second i am two words just after this in addition to what my colleague said sir yeah  the honourable member wants to know about the terms of reference of this committee i think a few words interruption yes yes yes   a few words financial matters will he look because not because primarily that is the agency to do something that is why i want that there is nothing like that in the sense of the interruption you can help sir uh i can repeat two words the house  that the terms of reference records is to elucidate factors responsible for the current outbreak of plague plague and infact perhaps it includes what it say interruption  i say will they will the committee whether whether whether it is for want of financial fund that also the committee can look into it alright then your you make it so clear and you write to the committee that you can go into it  i will be happy shree guj i k gujral sir uh the honourable minister has tried to  underplay the situation   it's not a question of propaganda  it's not a question whether it is so many cases more or less issue basically is and i hope my honourable friend knows that not once not twice not three times in last forty or fifty years  there are any number of reports available and you do not need one more expert to make it to tell you that that is no municipal committee in the country except the n d m c which is financially viable okay  now the point is sir if our you are going by the plan and if the planning is to be made obviously government i assume i hope is a is a corporate body works together   and therefore may i ask him , has he thought and approached , , the the planning commission or something , that the structure the municipality has to be increased no.(1) no.(2) sir, has the honourable one word thought in terms of improving the sanitation methodology and technology because it doesn't need a who report to tell us that our seat is updating it doesn't need any health organization that we see filth around they will first collect garbage on the road side and then we remove it and therefore all along disease is one word this incident of plague whatever dimension i am not discussing has brought up and despare at home may i ask him if he is believed to undertake apart from the committee one word to avoid the situation has the cabinet i wrote to cabinet myself the prime one word  wrote back to me that the one word and the ministry of urban development have the ministry of urban development and ministry of health set together to evolve the comprehensive scheme to see that our health and sanitation improves? swaminathan sir the honourable member is right one word what he said about the maintenance of sanitic conditions in the limits of municipality it doesd need atleast throught and a coordinative approach to solve this problem not only the health ministry this is by the ministry of urban development, local ministry, the state ministry and the local authorities concerned as far as the one word necessarily we have to find a way and in that direction we have to consult the the planning commission and for that one word suggestion one word
