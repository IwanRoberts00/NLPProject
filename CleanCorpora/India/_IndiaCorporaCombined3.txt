uhm hello ashokji i'm nice here because i'm  having nice time in your department   it's really a pleasure to me that i came from a distant place orissa   i'm really having uh the time which usually can't be recalled so easily uh when i go back to orissa  i had been to pandarpur cough last sunday and uh what i saw there is uh a temple of uh vithalji you know usually the people of maharashtra they call that uhm vithal vithal and rukmani   vithal pandurang  and one thing i'm surprised to find vithalji standing alone in such a way on a piece of uh brick yeah  that that reminds me of the beech you know they call it uh surely a brick uh uhm is thrown by the disciple maybe the maybe the person who was this vithal previously and they ordered vithal to stand on the brick  yeah  that is pundalik pundalik his devotee  pundalik  yes yes uh exactly  i don't know much about the legend yeah  but what uh is so surprising there in the temple is that i found rukmani standing alone  vithalji has never given any sort of uh importance to a woman called rukmani  no that's not the case what happened you know pundalik yeah that's  bhakta of vithala uhm or panduranga  uhm uhm  panduranga once visited pundali pundalika's house you know yes and pundalika was so engrossed and busy   ah ha serving his parents you know yeah yeah  and panduranga as he went there you know uhm  panduranga wanted pundalika to pay attention to him ah  but pundalika being a very obedient son uhm and very again we can say devoted to his uh parents you know he had no time  to pay attention to vithal vithal so he threw a piece of brick you know and made him stand or made him wait there until he finishes his service service to his parents  yeah   uhm   uhm uhm   yes   uhm   yeah yeah   uhm   ah   uhm   parents   vithal yeah   the work  so that's why that time rukmani  didn't accompany pundalika did not accompany panduranga  and so panduranga the vithal is shown to be alone over there  so faithful it seems   vithalji vithal yes  that is standing on the brick but in other parts of the temple you will find rukmani along with yeah vithal yes yes  but for this particular event ah particular episode you know vithala is alone over there because he alone visited   pundalika's house  yeah   yes yes   ah  but there i found you know uhm the feminine power is hot there when i'm being a female yeah i found uh vithal is selfish enough not to allow rukmani proper position  yeah  i found desciples making long line yeah to visit vithal whereas nobody was here before the temple of rukmani  so it shocked me really  uhm   yeah   yeah   yeah  no the same thing you know the same thing had happened in orissa also yeah   we've the jagannath temple in puri  shrikhetra yeah which usually call it   yeah   yeah puri   yeah  $a> and uh whenever jagannath which is brought there balabhadra comes out in the cart festival ah we found that uh both of them both the brothers they accompany uhm their sister subhadra uhm and on the other hand we find laxmi uhm stays alone inside the temple   ah   uhm  so really i found gods in general they become selfish when  uh they find uh the importance of the disciples must be given to the gods  but we've also temples called mahalaxmi temple   yeah in our sambalpuri yeah we've  samleshwari mandir and where usually we find godesses are worshipped   yeah   yeah  yeah now and uh what happens   haan if it happens to be a temple of panduranga mainly  yeah so it's very natural that focus is on panduranga when it's a temple of mahalaxmi uhm you find mahalaxmi only there not her husband that is in tirupati  and uh   haan   yeah   uhm  yeah tirupati is supposed to be her husband you know  yes but nowhere you find his shrine in the temple   uhm that is tirupati shrine in the temple  her husband   yes   uhm  uhm so it is not a kind of injustice or just subordinating the role of a woman or so  these gods and goddesses you know uhm so once it is a temple of mahalaxmi mahalaxmi has to be in focus  uhm  yes yes when it is temple of panduranga or the vithala vithala has to be in focus okay it depends upon the name name  it depends on  jagannath temple so jagannath they are no laxmi  jagannath  and in those days you know there was nothing like feminism yeah laughter of course you're right so if i bring in that kind of interpretation over here  laughs that's right  you've really i'm sorry in a very good way  you've convinced me and uh i found the climate of  maharashtra is very good people are nice soft spoken well behaved and uh  exactly like the oriya people  the dishes are also uh quite similar to the yeah  dishes of orissa and the system you know the culture the culture differs a little bit i think  yeah  oh it has to differ you know  but as you say that is uh dishes that is food staple food   uhm so staple food in oriya must be uh i mean different from the staple food we've in maharashtra  uhm  yeah yeah because in maharashtra normally we've a  chapati or  chapati then  bhakri we say  bhakri   jowari  yes yes  bhakri made up of jowari    made up of jowari  so we don't have that  we know certainly you don't have because   it is   so i found  actually i found much difficulty in swallowing jowari  that means that bhakri what you call bhakri   bhakri   bhakri because it's not a very crisp and uh yeah what you say delicate  delicate and very soft you know but when it is fresh  but when it is hot and fresh you know yeah you really relish it relish  yeah   delicate   but i like chapati   yeah  but chapatis you know it's a common food all over india even all over the world you know it's common  yeah yeah  you get wheat everywhere   yeah yeah   everywhere you can get it lekin chapati na it is sufficient to supply that much of energy to human body  and uh so far the department is concerned i found all the professors and teachers sounding of bells they are quite uh  you know serious about the teaching  yes sounding of bells in the university   yes in your your department you're the student of this department you know much better than myself cough but within this few one word days of my staying in  uh kolhapur in the hostel ladies hostel  kolhapur  i found uh that the coordinator is really uhm an an enthusiastic boss to encourage hostel life anything no basically all of them are first they all of them are  human and humane uhm both very kind soft spoken and you know that uh kind of hospitality that all of us share here   that's unique you might say haa because you never  uhm   naturally  naturally i was because hardly you know any outsider finds it difficult here to stay atleast on the campus you know yeah  because as far as possible because we've our limitations in a way uhm because office looks after  all these things you know  yeah   uhm   haan  so whatever office provides or offers ah  the same thing we extend to the participants also  but we see that not much inconvenience is done to the   participants so that's always there  ah   participants  or not only the professors or lecturers who are working here but uh office assistant also yeah along with the peons you know yeah and that mr chavan and uh mr bhonsle yeah all of them are quite cordial  yeah   yeah   yeah  yeah and uhm so far you two i've heard much about dr shastri from you since you were a very student of dr shastri  uhm but i haven't seen him with my eyes   uhm   no we we can do we can do one thing   yeah not today uhm but tomorrow or day after   uhm we can go to his place   yeah   uhm   uhm  oh it's uh because i just one mention i just mentioned once yesterday only yeah  because when after the session was over yes  yesterday i went to his place  i'm eagerly   yeah   yes  yes i would like to see him and your wife also specially because i'll take an interview of your wife laughs  so  why she chos she has chosen the life of a housewife oh i see because since i gave a paper on feminine power  yeah uh that i will i must reinvigorate her mind  yeah  but she does exert her power at home laughter  feminine power i mean that she does have   it's not sufficient you know   we're born to serve others yeah  not a single man a husband all family members all of us  have got some responsibility for the society   yeah   now i believe in i give you one example here uhm just one and a half months ago uhm i had my aunty with us uhm my aunty who is above seventy-five  uhm   uhm  yeah you're a maharashtrian no yeah uh and who's above seventy-five   uhm and some six or seven months back yeah  she uh got an attack of paralysis my god  she did just fell down in then in a one word  then she was rushed to the hospital near karad uhm  and then i got the message uhm as her uh condition is very serious or she is very serious  uhm   yeah   my god   then   uhm   uhm  then i uhm went to karad uhm thereafter next day i took my all the members  uhm of my family and we went there   uhm   uhm   uhm  she was there in the hospital for eight nine days  nine days thereafter she was discharged she was given discharge uh how is she now she is now is alright now i uh brought her here yeah  she stayed with us  yeah  ah in your house yes in my house she stayed with us for five months   uh ha  so we two together me and my wife  uh ha  now you're taking care of her now not only to care you no uhm she was it was impossible for her to walk to move everything but since  uhm   to move  so she is very much engaged your wife is yeah  very much engaged in the house-hold activities   yeah   yeah she is engaged  if she were working if my wife   uhm and then so much of attention you would not have taken yeah now she my aunty would not have been able to walk again uhm  she would not have been able to walk again   uhm   haan but uh so it is not a question of working outside uhm  it's a question of serving serve you say though yeah serving the old people  uhm   serve   yeah  yes yes don't think so that's where you know yes so what you gain by serving outside maybe you get returns in terms of say rupees or moneys you know   but this kind of achievement uhm is not possible outside  ah ha   uhm  uhm some satisfaction  no if somebody works outside ah somebody needs to be there yeah to look after the house maybe husband maybe children maybe that is there   ah   yeah   yeah some someone  someone must be there so your opinion i i do respect uhm but when   uhm  but i'm not talking in terms of money you know   i'm not talking in terms of money   not not money  but if you have somebody at home yes to  look after the you know house hold affairs you know  then you know it's very uh it's quite right   uhm that one should go out and work you know  yes   ah yes sure sure   uhm  but if there is nobody to look after in the house you know  uhm why  you should give the priorities uhm and you should  uhm   uhm  yes in fixing of one's priority   in fixing of priority and you should think that at what expense yeah you would work outside  yeah  uhm uhm but we modern women women are very much confused   yeah so far fixing the priorities are concerned   yeah   but at what expense  that's what i say you know  if you think that well she is uh ill i'll  she can't walk   i'll   she is old and say   let her let her occupy one corner  uh  let me do my other duties you know  uh   sure  ah so that's not humane  you're doing a very pious duty you know  don't think that it will be wasted yeah  you will get it returned  that's not human   yeah  yeah that's right in this hour something in your this in this life also you suffer so it is the priority yeah  what you value more  yeah  yeah human love affection   affection money but that one word is also doing the work of  humanism  money money  even the money is necessary uhm uhm it is  instrumental and secondary   uhm uhm  uhm  that's what i think  i've two children  these two children if my wife goes out and say teaches   uhm other children or if   uhm   other children they would be neglected they would be neglected so what is the use of your earning uh na  one thing is i can advise ashokji that you can engage your wife after the children become one word   that's fine because you know   efficient she has done m a in english  efficient  yeah she has done   it's nice she she has done  m a in english  she has done  yeah she has done her b ed and that too after we got married
