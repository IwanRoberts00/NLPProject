ah uhm uh thank you very much uh professor kohli  spoke so nice words about me uh i don't know how much i deserve them  uhm professor kohli requested me to talk on  national income uh accounts  uhm my purpose here was to make things very simple  uh maybe what my idea was this is a most of you are teachers and you know in a class when you go to a class  there are bright students there are mediocres there are bit dull students also  so teacher has a big problem of uh satisfying all the  students  so now comes the question what level he should go  it should benefit most of them so one has to be bit uh see that everybody follows  uh now we have that gathering i see most of you have put in some more than a decade of service  and most of you are uhm good good having good experience in teaching uhn  what i want to do here is only thing is some of you may not be having uh background about national income accounts  and other things  uh with that intention i want to give some idea about what  national income accounts is ? how it is useful ? and how it is computed ? and then in the second lecture i would give try to give you uhn the backgr the trends in india   indian economy  what is the per capita income of a india ? this thing and how it is computed ? what are its weaknesses this is for todays programme  uhm as i told in beginning this is li i would like to make it as simple as possible without ma uh this thing   i my main idea is that everybody should get something uh that is the thing they should feel it okay  others who are more interest in deeper questions can approach me again uh your all all the time you are welcome and  it's a great pleasure to have interaction with you  now uh if i ask anybody what is in  income ?  what is your income ? you may say some six thousand seven thousand or ten thousand  things  but it it looks to be very simple question  but if we go deeper it is not as simple as you think at the first time  uhm take uh this income somebody mainly we who are salaried person by income we meant whatever salary we are getting that monthly that is the salary or at the best you say okay whatever our take home salary is there  after deductions  okay we are having ten thousand salary or some two thousand is deducted eight thousand is our take home salary  this we take it as a income  this but if we go deeper this is not the only total income  for example some of us may have some own house  in that way we also get a a rent imputed rent  so our income consist not only of salary but also the rent of the house in which we are living because if we go for some other rented house we had to pay that rent for that house  now because it is our own house we are not paying so  indirectly it means that we are getting that much income we are not uh paying cash but because we are utilising that uh services of that residence resident it also means  it is uh rent  we are getting rent in this thing  our income also should include salary beside salary it should include the rent  some of us may have put some fixed deposit in the bank  f d  so annually we may get some interest  that also is a part of the our income  that thing interest that we get on our fixed deposit or saving accounts in our bank   my maybe it may be small amount but uh for uh  conceptual purpose it should be included maybe we may if we take in our bank account uh may be interest we may be getting hardly per annum some fifteen twenty  rupees or hundred rupees per annum because our savings may not be much but it is also a part of our income that interest that we get then we may have bought some shares or dividends  uh this is mostly the salaried persons buy the shares and this things  the dividends that we get on that uh shares also a part of our income  next component we may think we may have some people may have agriculture land they at their own native place  from agriculture they will be getting some either they may have leased out the land to some tenant and getting rent on it that is a rent from the land  or they may be having share cropping they may contribute something to the cultivation and for uh tenants cultivates and they get share cropping will be there  this also forms a part of our income  so uh in the beginning when you thought what is income  you took it as salary income means only salary for salaried persons but actually if we go deeper it includes many other components  which we generally uh don't take care of notice it  that it actually income is such a broad concept  when income is a for of a individual is so  difficult to compute or even assess uh what about the  country's income   country's income means income of all the people in the country   it's all the more difficult  what we mean by natio income of the nation or national income ? the national income means the value of the output which is  produced in the country the final goods value of the final goods produced in the country is taken as national income now here i use the concept final goods  why we should use final goods ? because if we don't take account of this we'll  have some problems called double counting  suppose wa if you want to if you don't  take care of this there is a problem of double counting  suppose you take the case of uh a simple example which is given is about the bread industry  so if you take the what all the total value of the bread produced in the country  total value of the wheat produced in the country  total value of the fertiliser produced in the country  there will be double counting or treble counting how ? when you take the value of the bread that value of the bread also consist contains the value of the wheat used in the  making of bread  so uh the and when you take the value of the total wheat again you are counting that portion of wheat which has gone into the making of bread also  whatever that all wheat produced in the country will not go to making bread but atleast some wheat is goes in making of bread so the wheat is counted twice  wheat is counted when you are taking the total value of bread  wheat is also counted when you are taking the total value of wheat and also think of fertiliser which is used in making of  this bread uh wheat   producing uh for producing wheat we make use of fertiliser  the value of the fertiliser is contained in the value of wheat  again it is also contained in the value of uh bread  so if you don't take care of only uh final goods  we'll be commiting this uh mistake of counting the same items more than once  so we should try to avoid this  now comes the question how to know which is final good  which is not the final good  so is bread the final good or is wheat the final good  is fertiliser final good  so because there is a difficulty in distinguishing which is final good and which is intermediary good we have another to overcome this problem we have a method called value added method  in that means uh in each industry how much value is added  by each industry  that we take into account not the total value of the output of  bread industry   we'll only take the how much bread industry has  added the value to the product  so baking bread baking so they have pro sold the bread at ten rupees and uh they have bought the input of say eight rupees worth of inputs for buying wheat and other things they have paper and packing other things  they have brought uh purchased the bread industry has purchased eight rupees worth of inputs and they have sold the bread for ten rupees  so now they how much value they have added to this bread they have added the value of ten two rupees  because eight rupees was the value of inputs which they have purchased ei ten rupees they have sold  so that to bread uh that final product which we  suppose we take it bread for that bread they have added uh uhm  value of two rupees  this is how we uh take it as uh value added  so one has to be while computing national income one has to be careful in avoiding this double counting or counting the same item more than once  then another thing we have to notice is this national income is in only money terms because we are hetregenous items are produced  iron is produced uh foodgrain is produced so many items are produced  so it is a it is expressed only in money terms  agriculture output could have been produced in uh mentioned in physical terms whereas national income has to be expressed in money terms this is another important thing to be noted  so we require some prices  what prices should we use is another difficult question uh to answer  then we have to notice that it is a flow concept  flow means how much output produced during a particular year or a particular month  instead what is the value of uh income means income per month or income per annum like that so flow means the period time period is important   it is a national income is a flow concept that means how much value has been produced from january first nineteen ninety-six to  december thirty-first nineteen ninety-six  in this aca calendar year how much is produced so it is a flow concept  uh these are the some of the important things to be noticed about a national income  now what is the use of national income if it consist  outside if uh ask this question at which national income is  used as a economic barometre  like what is the condition of the economy to know the condition of the economy  like a doctor if you go to a doctor before you ask any question he will put his thermometre into your mouth  and he wants to know the temperature uh things so a economist also if he wants to know the condition of any economy he says what is per national income of the country  so that means some uh weaknesses in this national income  but it broadly indicates the health of the economy how good how  sound is the health of the economy  so this is necessary national income is necessary to know  health of the economy  and also we can compare two economies which economy is stronger economically  for intercountry comparison is also it is useful  so how so america is rich you know how much in a  what is the per capita income in india what is the per capita in america say twenty times it is more than in india  or thirty times more than in india  so that shows how rich they are  so for in relative comparison also this uh  national income is useful  then within the country also we have so many different states and we want to compare uh which state is better which is doing well  so which is richer state uh like that so interstate comparison also to make interstate comparison also this uh na state income uh estimates are being made these days  then we know over a period of time how country is growing  to assess the performence of an economy also this pe  national income data is very useful  then you can also see uh that uh in the economy there are different sectors like household sector we have  we have corporate sector we have government sector  what is the interaction of these sectors that is how much  how much is government sector is taking away from the household sector how much government in the form of tax how much government sector is taking away from the corporate sector in the form of tax
