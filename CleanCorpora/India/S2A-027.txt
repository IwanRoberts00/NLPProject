""
""
i prepared it just  uh in case we need to  refer to
something  common which we have  in our hand 
""
uh  and  i'll  keep the  tone of this talk uh quite
informal 
""
so  in case you want to  sort of place some questions 
uhm   it's  better to postpone them till the end of the talk
""
but uh  in case you feel that uh  you have a very strong
impulse to ask something you can stop me you know  and you know sort of
uh  there is no problem 
""
well  i've  termed this  the the title of this as 
 language in poetry  
""
 it's  very  uh  very often we talk of language of
poetry  or the poetic language 
""
and uh  i think  there are two ways of looking at it 
""
one is the  what we call the  classical  traditional 
approach to  poetic language 
""
that there is a  special   specially marked  group of
words  which are  highly poetic in nature  the classical and the
neo- classical  way of writing poems 
""
uh  this is exemplified  in my first example  the notion
of poetic diction 
""
uh you must have heard of  banabhatt  the seventh century
 sanskrit writer  the writer of  the  piece  called
 kadambari   the first  formal narrative  uh
very elaborate narrative in sanskrit  in prose 
""
the  supreme example of  classical  prose style  cough
 in sanskrit 
""
 it's  also the supreme example of what an ornamental style
is like  ornamental prose style 
""
and it is said  what i want to illustrate  uh to this is 
you see  this work was  incomplete there is a myth about uh  this
work called  kadambari  
""
the work was incomplete when he was  about to die 
""
he called to one of his   shisyas   and also
 his  son was there 
""
uh just to test  who would  who  who would be able to
complete the work in case he is not able to complete  and then 
""
and he you know  he pointed to a withered tree  and uh 
asked  what is it  ?
""
and i have  given the two responses one of  bana's  
disciple  who said  shusko vrikshaha  tishthati agre  agre
 in front of us   agre  shuskai  dried up
withered   vriksha  is tree   tishathati 
is standing 
""
now  bana asked his son  what about you  what is that  ?
""
and he said   neeras  taruhu iha vilasati puratha
purataha  is again  uh uh  that's  almost the same as
 agre  
""
okay  but  uh it is  more poetic to say  
purataha  than to say  agre   
""
it  highly prosaic to say  agre  vilasati 
 instead of  tishathati   uh you have heard of the
word  vilas  where  you can you know   vilasati
 in that sense   taruhu  instead of 
vrikshaha  iha  is uh   neeras  instead of
 shuska   it is  neeras  
""
so these are some of the  dimension of  a  poetic 
diction 
""
modern poets and modern critic  uh particularly post nineteenth
century post symbolist  don't believe in this approach at all 
""
in fact modern poetry has revolted against  this kind of thing
in fact 
""
the the revolt began  with   in the west with the
nineteenth century romantic poets 
""
wordsworth  wanted to write  the language of men  okay
""
""
the  the common  commonly used language not  the specially
used  specially concocted  poetical diction  or poetic diction 
""
but  what it  it uh  does  perhaps this kind of an
approach is to draw your attention to  draw our attention to  the
element of choice involved in all  poetry 
""
the element of choice in diction  that is in vocabulary 
element of choice involved in structures  their arrangements  choice of
metre or non-metre everything is a matter of choice  and it is a choice
 in language
""
and that is why i say  it is  language in poetry 
""
you have to  uh uh  poetry happens in language 
""
see again the traditional view that  language is the  dress
 is the ornament  for content is the soul  is quite misleading 
""
even without taking the extreme organical stand that you know 
language and thought language and content are  organically related
""
even without going into  that kind of an extreme position we can
still say that poetry is something which happens  in language  cough
 which emerges  out of language you can't think of poetry  without
thinking of language 
""
you can't say that poetry  uh somehow exist somewhere outside
language 
""
this language which limits it as  wilkin cine  had said 
uh the limits of  our language are the limits of our experience 
""
in that sense the limits of our language are the limits of  uh
poetry which get written in that language  in a sense 
""
but it is only uh metaphor i am using because  those limits are
extendable those limits are  in fact being  uhm uh changed and shifted
 by the poets themselves  okay
""
so this is  uh my first point uh  that it  there is 
we need not think in terms of false dichotomies  like language  vs
literature most students and  teachers of literature are  uh tend to
look at it in uh  in that particular fashion
""
language vs literature i think  it's  a   it's 
absolutely a false dichotomy this is  it's  a false opposition 
popularized by those who were  uh well who who don't want to make the
necessary effort to you know  uh uhm  look at  the language of
poetry  carefully 
""
uh  so one of the most  fascinating aspects of reading and
studying  literature and poetry to explore its relation to language 
""
now  what i want to now look at is  see  in the
twentieth century  the swiss linguist  ferdinand sassuare  first
 gave us  this particular notion  that language is a system of
sign
""
the first  semiotic  motion  okay  which has shaken
the intellectual world  which has shaped it in a new way many many
different disciplines  including  anthropology including  sociology
including  psychology  structuralism and semiotics have  played 
a crucial role  in literature  in  language  certainly 
""
now what is it mean to say that language is a system of signs what
are the implications of this  okay 
""
 it's  a semiot to to give language as a semiotic system 
""
uh let me tell you that  sassuare  though he was the first
twentieth century linguist  in the west to look at language in this
particular fashion  language as a system   bu  and emphasis
the systemic  systemic aspect of language 
""
uh  this approach  in classical times  uh  goes back
to say  panini  okay 
""
the whole theory of sanskrit grammar  which panini developed
 has  it has been called structuralist it has been called generative
""
now  apart from those  terms i am not  going to elaborate
those terms but certainly language and its structure  have fascinated
people 
""
people have  had  a lot of  theories about it 
""
we shall selectively use  a part of that theory  in order to
see how  what happens to language in poetry 
""
just as we see  what happens  how poetry happens in language
""
""
i want to see  how  what happens to language in poetry 
""
and this can be seen at  four levels  four basic levels of
linguistic structuring  which linguists have identified 
""
language  for a linguist is essentially  spoken 
""
so  it is  cough  phonological  as they call 
phonological
""
phonology is the study of  the systems of sounds 
""
languages  select certain sounds  arbitraly  and start
 organizing them in certain systematic way 
""
there are infinite number of sounds which a human  vocal
organism can produce  in itself as you can see from a child babling 
""
all kinds of sounds  are produced 
""
but certain sounds are identified as functionally relevant sounds
 and  are structured 
""
so this is called the phonological level of structuring 
linguistic structure 
""
these sounds come together to form certain level  of  higher
abstractions that is  you can have a syllable  and you can have
certain clusters of consonants certain clusters of vowels
""
so vowels  consonants and  higher levels of organizations
into syllables 
""
this is  one level 
""
further  you develop into  the level of  word word which
is called morphology  word and formation of words 
""
a still higher level  of organization by higher i mean 
larger and larger units  of organization is the syntactic level 
""
and  through syntax you  communicate meaning the meanings
are also  structured in language
""
so sassuare was trying to  explore the nature of the linguistic
sign  which on the one hand relates  certain sounds  to certain
words  uh to certain meanings 
""
so sounds on the one hand  meanings on the other what sassuare
called  a relation between the signifier  and the signified  the
sounds and images  sounds and meanings  etcetera
""
and these four levels of structuring  what sassuare developed
 and what modern linguistics has developed is  a certain way of
describing  the structure of a language 
""
describing the norm which governs language behaviour  ordinary
 linguistic behaviour  ordinary speech behaviour 
""
what are the rules  ?
""
okay 
""
this is  what lead us to 
""
now obviously when you have a rule  there is also  a
possibility of breaking that rule  of deviating from the rule 
""
and  to begin with i would say that poetry  is some kind of
a purposeful deviation from the norm of usage  from the normal  usage
you deviate  purposefully 
""
now i don't want to bring in problems of intentionality and so on
 on the  poe   on the part of the poet
""
i don't want to go into the  poet's  psychy to ask the
questions  what did this poet actually mean when when he wrote this 
""
for me it is enough if we can  reconstruct some kind of a poet
within the poem 
""
 that's  enough for me i don't have to  go and verify
from the poet did you mean really this  or something else 
""
 that's  not   that's  not my approach  
that's  may be a relevant approach for a psycho-analyst  for a
biographer  but not for  say  a literary critic 
""
a literary critic would be interested in  the text  how text
 uh become  in the texuality of the text  okay 
""
how these text   makes   construct meaning  with
the help of whatever norm  if that is available with the help of  one
word 
""
so   that's  why i put in  norm and deviation 
""
 i'll  come to examples a little later 
""
let me go on to the third point in my  synopsis 
""
modern linguistics has not stop at the  consideration  of
 structure of language 
""
it has also to say something about  the functions of language
 particularly uh  the european school of  analysis
""
see the  after sassuare sassuare was a swiss linguist 
writing in french  around nineteen hundred and twelve  he delivered
between nineteen nine  and nineteen twelve  he delivered a series of
lectures which have  now come to the uh  come to be recognized as
revolutionary lectures in the form of a course 
""
they were published as  a book  uh sassuare never intended
to write it as a book but  uh lecture notes were  uh expanded and
published in the form of a book  course in general linguistics
 by students  and it has  shaped our notions of language 
""
uh though sassuare didn't write anything about literature  his
views of language have been  same as very crucial in our dealing with 
poetic language 
""
one  at the structural level  the american linguist  took
over  took   took off from that point and developed theories of
structure 
""
one whole school came into being called american structuralism lead
by leonard brumfield  uh culminated in the work of  charles hawkins
""
""
after that  there was again  a a reaction against that and
 uh from m i t chomsky has been developing his theory of generative
grammar  nineteen fifty-seven onwards 
""
so this has been the line of printing  the generative grammar
the structuralist grammar  in the field of  description of linguistic
structure 
""
the other line was followed by the european linguists 
particularly  linguists of the france school 
""
and there is one linguist who  who has remained the link
between language  literature  european tradition american tradition and
has sort of you know  uh has been able to combine the various  uh
traditions in the western world and something which can be called a western
tradition of linguistics  uh symbolized by roman jocobson  the work of
roman jacobson 
""
uh  who was part of the russian formalists  part of the
france school  part of the  uh american scene after the sixties 
""
and  the functions that i have enumerated  uh have been
proposed by jacobson  very simply 
""
again there is  a specially poetic function which he
identified but  these are not functions which are mutually exclusive 
every speech act  for the linguists of france school for  roman
jacobson  has  six different directions 
""
it can have these potentially it has the six different elements
and these  six different directions 
""
they are sort of orientations of the speech act 
""
one is  you can  you can say  i am very unhappy
 
""
this is  self-expression 
""
the speaker is attracting attention to himself or herself  and
trying to tell people  what is happening to him or her 
""
this is called the expressive function of language
""
please notice  that unlike  the romantic or the expressive
theories in the west jacobson does not equate  this kind of
self-expression with the poetic  language 
""
language of poetry is not language of self- expression 
""
second  you can orient it to the receiver of your message 
in a poetic act  you can say  please open the door 
""
i am not expressing  my feelings about it i am simply 
persuading you requesting you  trying to influence you to do something 
""
this can be called connotive  or  uh emotive persuasive 
use of language 
""
this is an orientation and please notice that  poetry  can
be expressive  but that is not its central function
""
poetry can be emotive  persuasive  for example take
patriotic poetry can be vey  highly emotive and persuasive but  that's
 not its function according to jacobson 
""
the third is i can straight refer to the environment because there
is a context to our  entire  uh speech act 
""
and i can say well uh    it's  rather hot today
  which  serves  to refer to an internal or external factor
in the communicative act
""
this can be called a referential function of language
""
 i'll  describe it 
""
referring to something specific  in the environment in the
context of the speech act  this is called the  uh referential
function or the    des    descriptive   function
of language 
""
this also is part of literary language part of poetic language
descriptive poetry 
""
for example in novels you get a lot of descriptions  you can
 you  have evocative language you have you have  expressive
language and so on  okay
