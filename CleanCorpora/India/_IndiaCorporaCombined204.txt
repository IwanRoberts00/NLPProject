good morning  uh this is a short paper called teaching classics in an unclassical situation  uh i didn't know what to do when i received a letter from uh professor vanikar uh asking me to participate in a lecture series  so i thought that i must write a lecture  but i didn't know that this is all this  but anyway i i hope you'll bear uh these peculiar things from a teacher who has been trying to teach something impossible  uh for several years  when the indira gandhi open university was launched some years ago somebody mentioned to me why an open university was needed then  most of the northern universities had to be closed for long spells of time owing to one agitation or the other  and they had been sealed closed  the only university that could be open then was the open one  which could not be closed  when i asked in a time honoured university a few years ago  where was the student ? the teacher said since attendance was voluntary the students were not around  this had shocked me then thoroughly  but when the same reason was given by another set of teachers  in another university equally respected just a few days ago i was not so much dismayed as amused  a university now was getting one word of becoming  a fossil  a discarded image and a discreditable model  we say the teacher you have to squeeze the university into museum and a teacher into a zoo now  when teaching itself has become a well-nigh lost art practised  before the modern stone age teaching a classic should be a gargantuan to an absurdity or a quixotic misadventure  but though the teaching of a classic really belong to the realm of such a dark and hopeless comedy my experience with both the classics and the teaching has been mercifully otherwise  i may be allowed to boast that even like the classics themselves i've survived as a teacher teaching classics  that too in an indian situation  at the movement i need not define a classic since everyone knows what it is since you have to know what a thing is even to reject it   i'll rather explain what an unclassical situation is apart from the unclassical situation in the west itself  which even milton feared in his own time whether he was writing his epic in an age too late in a cold climate my damp is intended flight  the indian situation for the western classics especially the ancient one is apparently precarious  homer or virgil dante or milton are not only not read in the schools or undergraduate classes here perhaps with exception of some milton but well are unheard of  there is no grounding or even interest in pagan mythology or christian thought of any real depth before the students join the post graduate classes  nor is there any serious attention to the history of ideas  or evolution of the western culture is greek or roman christian texture any knowledge of greek and latin or even a gentle fascination for them is anywhere in sight is nowhere in sight  again there is no knowledge or sense of the genuises rise evolution and decay of the stars of epic tragedies romance  allegory etcetera  nor is there a critical awareness or discuss   discussions or the matters involved in the study of the classics among the extremist either  in short as far the teaching of the classics is concerned you are working in a thorough vacuum  though your teacher's nature may abhor it  if you have to reach the students with your classics in your uh  ah in your hand you have to undertake the adventure of piercing through a silence of seven-fold or nine-fold or manifold ignorance  but should you despair and give up the sword of teaching then as a sheer wild goose chase   i've an emphatic no to say to this pessimism  it is possible to put those classics across to the students  indian students not because they are the one word or credilous  but because the classics have an intrensic power in themselves  on the one hand and students have an intrensic an instinctive responsiveness to them on the other  should a classic fail it's a pity  something must be wrong either with the teacher or with the student and between them they have missed an opportunity of a life-time it is a challenge for any teacher to steer an ancient classic through successfully in a class without being assisted by a cultivated response in it  but i think the solution to the problem should be divide another way  instead of being exasperated by a classical innocent class a teacher has to exploit the virgin field and convert innocence into an advantage  the basic wealth he should realize lies in the responsiveness of the class to any literature our literature british or one's own  once he's sure of the aesthetic or literary sensibility  so he can find a way for the classic into the imagination of his students when i say that a literary awareness is the most vital factor i do not employ that a classic should be reduced to an easily knowable text the teacher should have a complex economy at his command  he must know uh the right dosage of each element before he administers a classic to the open minded class students of the class  were one to teach for example homer's  illiad i i've taken just one example  one must know how much of the theory of the epic of growth or archeology he must give to his students  if you get lost in the theory of the oral or authentic epic you may not reach homer at all  on the contrary you may raise serious suspicion in the minds of the students whether a poet called homer ever existed at all  having introduced the term authentic oral epic you gently pass on to the homeric age or the heroic age not as a fossil of history but as a genuine milieu for the creation and sustenance of the kind of epic that illiad is  if the students know nothing of the heroic age achilles would cut an utterly sorry figure before them a spoiled child a wilful imbecile  personal honour then was supreme and dying for glory the consummation devastly wished by a hero was his name  the co-ordinates of the age co-ordinate coincide with the co-ordinates of the morality of the hero  the lords have donned a heroic society have to be  ac accepted in a spirit of willing suspension of disbelief or of a voluntary poetic accent  by this the epic is saved an enormous infancy of primitivity  with a select historisity in mind you go straight to the human condition  so that given differing historical co-ordinate  there is an unerring core of the human fate involved  once the right key note is struck the classic is preserved  similarly you have to introduce them to the rules of the epic game the conventions the invocation the catalogues of men and ships and so on  the strolling epic simile the ruthlessly delightful battlefields the feudal games the lamentations etcetera  and then the gods their politics their devious ways  their over-determinations of human affairs and man's constant negotiations with them  the supernatural frame-work not to be reduced to the supernatural machinery that they use one word but to be kept  as a mysterious divine environment in which man has to struggle rise afore  you have to identify and establish the force of gravity  that holds in tension the fears of men  all this has to be done not in a spirit of solemn scholarship  but as a matter of enlighten information to hinder the hindrances to enjoying such works  but this is only half the work  you have to get the work closer to the world of the students'  own experience or sensibility  i have been trying to do this task not by denuding homer of its specific but by gathering him to a vision of what i might describe as  poets' perennial  the perennial poetry which refuses to divide poetic experience or vision in a parochial way and reduce reduce it to a poets'  parochialist uh provincial poetry  explain the unknown homer in terms of the known of  the upanishadas the vedas the bhagwatgeetas the mahabharat and the ramayan and the bhagwat  do not tell me that our own works are less known to our students than the western classics  i have been doing in this way from long before the tv's  had serialised the mahabharat and  the ramayan  our work the culture that they are embodiments of our already embedded in the instinctive responses of our students  and they have to be carefully and convincingly evoked by the teacher  let me give just a couple of examples in a characteristically comprehensive homeric statement  in the thick of the battle dimades challenges glocus and glocus replies what does any lineage matter to you  men in the generations are like the leaves of the tree  the wind blows and one years leaves are scattered on the ground  but the tree is burst into buds and put on fresh ones when the spring comes round  in the same way one generation flourishes and the another nears its end  this inevitably reminded me of the statement from the  katho upanishad satya mevap madhya pakshatye sasya mev tasya mev ajayte punha  the muscle hyphens and ripens ends like corn and stalks up again like corn  the metaphor of the leaves in homer corresponds greatly with metaphor of the corn in the katho upanishad  and both bring out vividly and crystalize the phenomenon of mutability  the cycle of birth death and rebirth  the homeric metaphor as that of the upanishadic unites human experience so effectively that you cease to separate the west from the east and start inhabiting a common state of human faith  to cite another example from the illiad itself  here is andromache illiad book six trying to persuade her husband hector not to go to the fatal battlefield   so you hector are father and mother and brother to me as well as my beloved husband  have pity on me now stay here on the tar  put beside this a statement from the ramayana  made by seeta as a confession of rama's love for her  before anusuya  this is ayodhyakand one eighteen four uh  seetanurago dharmatma matrivat pitravat priyah  with this kind of a parallel so this is i think you will know this sanskrit i mean the student  seeta in love righteous dear like the father the mother  with the kind of a parallel in mind you do not wish to separate the two works the two culture and see them in isolation a bridge is flown across the two  and the one text reinforces and illuminates the other the phobia that a stranger one word is dissipated and an indian reader student teacher is gratified that a common humanity pervades text apparently separated by differing cultures and languages  when i say this i am not way laying the students into the phony field of the comparative literature as such but only knocking down walls or barriers that separates two literatures  it is a matter of of nativising alien an alien literature not by sipping it of its specifics but by opening a new channel of communication  so many problems of interpretation both literary and theological can be lightened by calling to aid works like the mahabharat ramayan bhagwat and pressing them to a service to to into service to gain and access into a pre-christian work like illiad which raises insoluble problems in the mind of western christian reader  i have tried to put across illiad without tearing off its roman roots to my students by a free use of material  from our ancient texts  the benefit has been double if not multiple  our students have freely enter the western classics with a native appreciation of them on the one hand and i've seen the relevance  and significance of our own work on the other  there was a time when the professor of english looked down upon our works in a bid to outer english to english  those days i wish to believe are behind us but that also implies a responsibility a need to emancipate oneself from bookishness into a heaven of genuine learning   i've been tackling works like the illiad  paradise lost the divine comedy with an amount of freedom to release the classics from the prison of impenetrability or mere tacit riven and make them speak to us as living works   i've also been trying to light up areas of darkness  in interpreting our own works like the mahabharat ramayan the bhagwat all these or the bhagwatgeeta  by a constant reference to the illiad the aeneid paradise lost or the divine comedy so that a new discourse is generated  by the free jostling together of great works  this has helped remove to a great extent the grimness  or the the gravity the solemnity that seem to weigh upon our own works  fallen on the trodden ways of orthodoxy  the use of the bible both the old and the new testament  the entire western mystical tradition uh has been of great benefit in the interpretation of our own works too  here again the walls of prejudice and wooden scholarship collapse  and the great work starts becoming parts of the same space the aesthetic and the ethical   i've also been getting appreciable success bringing together the greek and the shakespearian tragedies  understanding a greek phenomenon with a shakespearian example  or vice-versa  should i read more and be conversant with sanskrit drama i hope to understand the more by a kind of a cross irradiation  what i've uh been doing with the ancient classics  classics should be possible with the post- renaissance modern and post-modern works too  but one needs to be sailing the razor edge path of one if one were not to mess up things  this kind of activity needs a great expansion of mind an intellectual tolerance that makes holding many peaks of excellance or phenomenon of significance together simultaneously without reducing or abolishing the uniqueness of each  i also felt always that a teacher needs to be free from any obsession with one particular theory of literature or or criticism if you they want to save themselves from the dangers of distortion  at the same time he must be fully aware of the whole plethora of the theory so that he is able to make use of them freely  even as an electronics engineer uses a thousand of keys to produce a unified effect  i may however say that my key to the classics is only a key a key and i do not know of a master-key which can unlock uh the treasures of all literature  i do not exactly know where i stand as regard to theme of the lecture series creative writing and literature teaching interphase  but this much i can say that literature teaching is not  much less creative than creative writing itself  in fact you create as you teach  and a creative work unless it is creatively read remains just a close book it does not become a text to borrow a term from burke it is a teacher who stigmaties to teach a text can really transform it into what it really is a text which requires as burke would say an attempt to abolish or atleast to lessen the distance between writing and reading not by intensifying the readers  projection into the work but by linking the two together in a single signifying process  a teacher if he succeeds does reduce the distance between writing and reading  he rewrites the works and reincarnate the text everytime  he successfully performs in a class  thank you
