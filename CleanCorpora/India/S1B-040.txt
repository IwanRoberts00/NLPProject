another budget  another hike 
""
the railway budget for next year  has proposed a ten percent
increase  in both passenger fares and freight rate 
""
the railways of course  justify this increase on the ground 
that  their input cost in the last one year have gone up 
""
and despite the fact  and despite their efforts  to improve
their productivity over last year  they contend that  an increase has
become necessary 
""
and unless they do this  they will not be able to maintain their
 operations  as also provide resources  for fresh investment 
""
not many of course  would share this perception 
""
there would be usual criticism  that the great hike will be
inflationary 
""
the cost of production will go up 
""
there will be more burden on the consumer  as prices of essential
commodities will go up 
""
and of course  the rail traveller would have to shell out 
at least ten percent more  for travelling 
""
the budget of course  raises  a number of issues whether 
the hike is justified  ?
""
whether the railways can actually  reduce    the the
  that   prices in tariff  ?
""
can they accomodate by improving their effeciency  ?
""
are they using their resources efficiently  ?
""
are they deploying  deploying their funds  in the manner 
which  suits the  priorities of the railway  and the country at
large  ?
""
are the railways investing enough  to take care of the growing
needs of the economy  ?
""
these and  similar related issues  we will look at  in
this discussion today 
""
we have a distinguished panel 
""
and on my right  is  member traffic  of the railway board
 mr shrivasan  mr a n shukla  chairman railway board 
""
on   my  le    on my left    is 
mr k n thakur  former secretary planning commission  and  advisor
 a principal advisor to the planning commission  and mr p s anand 
who is the financial commission for the railways 
""
uh mr shukla   may i   may i   begin this
discussion with you 
""
 that  considering the fact  that  the rate of
inflation  in the last one year has gone down 
""
how do you actually justify  the increase in freight rate  ?
""
particularly freight rate because last year  when the rate of
price rise was much higher  you had increased  rate by seven point
five percent 
""
this year when the rate of inflation has come down  the freight
has gone up by ten percent 
""
surely your input cost   the  must have gone up by a
much lower percentage 
""
then how do you explain it  ?
""
""
mr bharati  the railway finances have traditionally 
been met  from  two basic sources 
""
one is  the budgetory support  which the railways have been
getting from the government 
""
and the other is internal resource generation 
""
over the last four or five years we have added a third force 
and that is  the uh  sail of bond  of the indian railway finance
corporation 
""
so basically these are the three sources that we have available to
us 
""
now you might be aware of the fact that the budgetory support 
in the fifth five year plan  was of the order of seventy-five percent
""
""
this slowly went down to about sixty percent  in the sixth plan
""
""
and it has been steadly diminishing 
""
we did come up with this  new source that is the railway bond
""
""
but unfortunately  because of the  you know the  the
unusual market conditions which have prevailed  over the last one year or
so 
""
it was not being possible to sell these bonds  although we have
increased the the  uh the interest rate of the bond from nine percent that
which we used to sell them earlier to ten and a half percent 
""
but there are just  one word  to this particular movement
""
""
therefore  when the budgetory support is diminishing  it was
uh thirty-four percent in ninety-two ninety-three 
""
and it is going to fall to just fourteen point seven percent in
ninety-three ninety-four 
""
we have no option 
""
but  to raise internal resources if we are going to provide the
necessary infrastructure  for transport  for the country  the
industry of the country as a whole to develop 
""
there are no soft option 
""
""
mr shukla you are you are suggesting that  uh indirectly
suggesting that  uh the increase in freight rate and passenger fares 
is more linked to the fact  that budgetory support has gone down 
rather  rather than to the fact that your input cost has gone up 
""
are you saying that there is no link between the cost of operations
and the rate in passenger fare increased  ?
""
""
no there is a direct link 
""
and  i'll  give you a very brief account  of how our
input cost have gone up  over the last one year 
""
that is in this this very financial year 
""
the  general increase in prices  for materials and fuel 
has been up  the other  for ten percent 
""
the electric tariff that  we've  been paying  has gone up
as much as sixteen percent 
""
and staff cost  that the da uh uh  the da component  of
the staff salary has gone up by twenty percent 
""
and of course we have to make the usual three percent provision for
increments 
""
now if you add all this together 
""
and add to it the fact that we are planning to  to increase 
the traffic output  both in terms of passengers as well as goods  by
something like six percent 
""
it would amount to an additional requirement of funds  of the
order of something like sixteen to seventeen percent really 
""
now if you give a look at the figures  last  this this 
year's  already working expenses  and the proposed ordinary working
expenses for ninety-three ninety-four   you'll  find that there is
just a thirteen percent increase 
""
which means that we have a short  some three to four percent
 of the additional cost  by higher productivity  by cost cutting
 and by various means
""
there is another efficiency factor which i would like to mention at
this very point of time  that is the operating issue 
""
the operating the issue of  the the input cost  divided by
the income 
""
in ninety ninety-one  this was ninety-two percent  and
ninety-one ninety-two it came down to eighty-nine point five percent 
""
in ninety-two ninety-three  we expect  to get eighty-seven
percent though we had budgeted for eighty-seven point seven percent 
""
and our planning for ninety-three ninety-four is going to be 
eighty-three percent 
""
so it is a combination of  cost cutting and resource
mobilization  whereby we intend to generate the funds that  we'll 
need  for investing into the  transport infrastructure 
""
""
   mm mm    mr thapar    would
you  do you  buy this argument that the railways have done enough to
 cut down their cost 
""
uh the economic survey   of   for   this year
 in fact mentioned  that labour productivity  in the railways is
very low 
""
and considering that  it accounts for over fifty percent of
their cost of operation 
""
do you think there is hope for making more improvements and
containing  the increase in trade and passenger hike 
""
""
i think mr bharati  the fundamental question is what mr
shukla was mentioning 
""
this particular  budget  to my perception marks a
water-shed  so far as the  role of the state is concerned in the
development of the infrastructure 
""
it also marks  a water-shed  so far as the pricing policy is
concerned 
""
it appears that the state has  forsaken its role  for the
development of  transport infrastructure  and that of the railways 
""
the figures which mr shukla mentioned  they tell  a story 
which is very important  and which gives a message  that hitherto 
what was funded by the state  will now   has   have 
 to be funded by an organization 
""
this raises the basic issue  whether the distortions in the
past  whether the railways as an instrument of the government  will be
able to absorb that  and at what cost 
""
""
  can we   can we   separate these two
issues 
""
i mean on the one hand you can emphasis the  let us say the
extra budgetary constraint on the railways  that is the role of the state
 and the link of the central budget  and the railway budget 
""
and  second the equally important point of efficiency 
""
""
now coming to the efficiency    uhm  uh  it
appears that the rate  that the transport output has been increasing 
but the productivity percent has not been increasing to mention it 
""
there is a scope for the improvement 
""
there is always the scope for the improvement in what manner it
will take place over there that is    one or two words  
""
""
 uhm  
""
""
 could you   could you give some specific
suggestion 
""
""
the railways have to make sure that the technological 
upgradation  the pace of upgradation has to be accelerated 
""
unfortunately  we have hithereto  all along concentrated on
 uh calling a particular path  and that is  we send around the
teams
""
we  we have a laborous process of uh acquisition of technology
""
""
now the technology cycle are shrinking all over the world 
""
by the time we wake up to  take up a particular equipment 
it's  quite likely it has become an  one word  
""
""
but  uh you know the fact that you are linking efficiency
with modernization  it actually poses a dilemma 
""
you cannot modernize unless you get more resources
""
the railways will turn around and say okay we have to raise the
passsenger price  and we have to raise freight price if we want us to
modernize 
""
""
 one word  i started at the begining mr bharti that
when i mentioned that the state seems to be  observing  its role 
of development of infrastructure
""
""
you mean the railway   should be  continu  
 should continue   to be subsidised by the central budget 
""
""
 it's  not a question of subsidise 
""
it is a question of state  participating in the developmental
activities 
""
after all the railways are there  to serve the national purpose
""
""
we also know that there are historical distortions for instance 
the uni gauge which  we're  talking of it is a multigauge of the past
 which was built over there 
""
we also know that the railway system was developed  basically in
the  uh uh pre-nineteen forty-seven period  for the export of the
goods by the britishers from the ports 
""
if you see the sweep of the railway net-hold it is largely oriented
towards the ports 
""
there are no connectors in between 
""
now  at the same time the railways have a dilemma they are
passing through a phase of technological change 
""
 you're  changing from steam to diesel diesel to electric
""
""
now  in this particular period  if the state  can 
say that they are withdrawing themselves  and leaving it  to the 
totally at the mercy of the organization itself to fend 
""
and  i'm  afraid it will be very short sighted policy 
""
and the important thing is  what will be the  one word 
effect of the  of this policy on the organization   that's  a
very important point
""
and i think we need  to  be able to talk about it the
impact of that 
""
""
what is the the railways point of view  ?
""
would they like to eliminate all this subsidies  ?
""
would they argue that  the  centre should bear all the
subsidies  ?
""
how is it affecting their cost of operation  ?
""
how is it hindering their ability to contain the increase in 
uh trade and passenger fare  ?
""
""
you see it is in this context  that uh  we have been
able to persue  the government  to agree to uh withdrawing subsidies
 on some of the commodities  on which we have been traditionally giving
subsidies for the last several years 
""
there were  there was  sixteen commodities in which the
subsidies were being given 
""
and this year we are withdrawing the subsidies on four such
commodities 
""
i think that as mr thapar just said  unless  various means
can be found  to centrally fund  the development of the railways 
we will have no option  but to resort  to reducing the subsidies 
and to plan to generating funds on our own 
""
of course it is very correctly said that our efficiency factors
have to be looked at very closely 
""
we are looking at them very firstly 
""
we are trying to improve the effiiciency
""
i will give you one example  our productivity  of man power
 in terms of  one word   which was at around two hundred and
forty-four traffic unit per employee in eighty eighty-one  today stands at
three hundred and sixty-seven  traffic units per employees
""
that is just one of the efficiency indicated and this is the
result  of continuous efforts  to upgrade the quality of the man power
 and   to to to   to   increase the proportion of the
output versus the input 
""
likewise that it is a fact that equipments arrears  have been a
major work  of our  not being able to achieve as much  as we would
have like to achieve 
""
and we are tackling this  on a on a i would say on a mission
basis 
""
""
could you could you tell our  viewers that what would be
the impact on the price of essentials  uh as a result of the withdrawl of
these subsidies  ?
""
because you have withdrawn subsidies  on uh essential items
like food grains pulses sugar  oil  uh what should be the price infact
""
""
it has these measures  it is it is not as
""
""
why should the common man have to pay more for these
""
""
i  i'll  give you a few examples 
""
for a litre of kerosene oil  for for a litre  he'll 
have to pay three point to seven paisa more per litre
""
that  that's  total impact 
""
for uh  cement  it is two  rupees  and
twelve  paisa  per sack of fifty kilogram pack 
""
for uh  coal  the increase is three  three point three
seven  paisa  per kilogram 
""
uh tea  eleven  paisa  per kilogram 
""
the the the heaviest impose has been  on sugar which is
twenty-one  paisa  per kilogram 
""
now that is the order of impact that this is going to have 
""
""
but isn't   twenty  one  paisa 
pretty substantial 
""
anything that rate should be a very more element per kilogram 
""
""
 on  
""
""
no but the fact is  that sugar has been very heavily
subsidised in terms of transport 
""
whereas i do not think that who is good as far as the total
compensation is concerned to the consumer 
""
and i do not think that the railway should be called upon  to
bear more than their share  of subsidising the product 
""
we have been bearing our share 
""
""
what is the  what is the  centre's  argument 
against uh compensating for these subsidies  ?
""
""
no in fact the centre  the centre is looking at it very
closely 
""
and  i'm  hoping that  that is the discussion which we
have had with the centre  there might be a certain amount of relief
forthcoming  for some of these essential commodities
""
but that we have to wait and see as to  what they are able to
do for us 
""
""
mr anand don't you think that 
""
you see we have  we have got caught in very vicious circle 
""
you increase frieght rates  that pushes up the price of steel
and coal  and petroleum 
""
and prices  when prices of these goods go up  you have 
you're  compel to increase uh your prices of weight 
""
and this keeps on happening year after year 
""
and we have actually witness them in last two  in last two
years  this inter linkage between  administered prices  that when
one price is increased everything else goes up  and a chain reaction
follow 
""
so don't you think by actually pushing up your freight rate by ten
percent  you are not harming the cause of the economy  ?
""
 that  could you not have made some effort to really
restrain these price increase  ?
""
""
actually the freight increase contribute very little to the
price rise
