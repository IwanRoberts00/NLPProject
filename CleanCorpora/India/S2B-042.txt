""
friends i believe  that the future  belongs to the young
""
""
the future of india  is in the youth of india 
""
i have great faith in the youth of india 
""
youth  which has ideals  which has vision  and which is
not being corrupted by the curse of consumerism  or the malady of
materialism 
""
preservation of democracy and democratic values  and protection
and promotion of human rights  are matters with which everyone of us not
merely lawyers and judges and journalists  everyone of us is or should be
concerned 
""
it is the legitimate pride of every indian  and i feel that
pride when i go abroad  and an uh  attend international conferences 
and conventions  that despite the trials  turmoils and tribulations
 which our nation has undergone  democracy  the rule of law 
and respect for human rights  by and large are preserved and respected in
our country 
""
and i think that is something about which every indian  should
feel proud of 
""
the topic of my address is  the role of lawyers and the
judiciary in upholding the constitution democracy and human rights 
""
""
now the problems  the perennial problem  of orderly
government were perceptively discerned about two centuries ago by madison
 who was one of the founding fathers of the american constitution 
""
he stated  in the federalist  and i quote   in
framing a government  which is to be administered by men over men 
the great difficulty lies in this  you must first enable the government
to control the governed  and in the next place oblige the government to
control itself  
""
over the years experiences demonstrated that governments are not
obliging  and do not control themselves 
""
the great difficulty mentioned by madison confronts our country in
a large measure  as we try to ensure fundamental freedoms and elementary
decencies to all persons  whilst respecting the rule of law  and the
independence of the judiciary 
""
despite the  law's  horrendous delays  and a multitude
of deficiencies which plague the indian legal system  it is curious 
but also heartening  that the public still retains confidence in the
judiciary 
""
it is to the judiciary that the citizens turn for protection from
legislative excesses  and executive abuses  and for vindication of his
or her rights against the state 
""
an independant judiciary is one of the pillars  of our
constitutional edifice  and is indispensible to a democracy 
""
it is a constitutional  and a moral imperative for the
protection of human rights of the citizens  for maintenance of the rule
of law  and for preservation of democratic values 
""
and the essence of independence of judges is  there is
adjudication of disputes between citizens  and between citizens and the
state  and the state is the biggest litigant today  judges must act
impartially  and be free from pressure  or influence of any kind 
emanating from any source 
""
what kind of persons did our founding fathers visualised  for
the high judicial office?
""
pandit nehru spoke for all of them when he said  and i quote
  judges should be not only first rate  but should be
acknowledged  to be first rate in the country  and of the highest
integrity 
""
and if necessary  people who can stand up against the executive
government  and whoever may come in their way  
""
now in order to ensure the independence of the  higher judiciary
 our constitution provides for security of tenure namely  sixty-two
years in the case of high court judge  and sixty-five years in the case
of a supreme court judge 
""
frankly i have not been able to understand this sixty-two and
sixty-five 
""
i don't think there is anything in the high court  wherby at
sixty-two the judge become  one word  and at sixty-five the supreme
court judges still go on  but  that's  another thing 
""
judges  as you know cannot be removed  at the pleasure of the
executive  but only by a procedure provided in the constitution which is
popularly known  or called the process of impeachment 
""
remuneration of the judges is guaranteed by the constitution cannot
be altered by the government of the day  except by constitutional
amendment 
""
so these are the main bulwarks  to insulate judges from
executive pressure  and to relieve them from being dependent on the
government 
""
but executive  influences operate in a variety of subtle ways
""
""
for example the prospect of appointment after retirement  to
some statutory body  or council  or commission  and sometimes the
prospect  of the office of the governor 
""
it is my view  that the supreme court  and high court
judges after retirement  should not be given any assignment  nor
appointed to any body or tribunal  which is subordinate to the high court
or the supreme court 
""
it is an unseemly sight  to witness legal challenges to the
orders of former supreme court judges  in the high court or in the supreme
court 
""
the proper course is to give full pension to judges on retirement
 and to avail of their services  today they don't even get full
pension  they get only half pension 
""
and to avail of their services in national interest  for
example heading a commission of enquiry  in a matter of vital national
importance  as and when the occasion arises 
""
it is also my view  that the present retirement age of the high
court and supreme court judges  needs to be increased  so that the
experience  and abilities of the serving judges may be utilised 
rather than lose them  at the early age of sixty-two and sixty-five 
""
in most countries following the common law tradition  the usual
retirement age is seventy years 
""
friends i do not desire to list  all the qualities a judge
should possess 
""
but the foremost quality required  in deciding constitutional
issues is  that the judge must be attuned  to the philosophy of our
 philosophy of our constitution  which is succinctly  and
admirably encapsulated in the preamble  and amplified in the chapter on
 fundamental rights and directive principles   which
taken together  constitute  the core and conscience of our constitution
""
""
we may and should  should seek lights  from judgements of
the courts in the united kingdom  in the united states  canada 
australia  new zealand  south africa  another developing country
""
""
it is important to have exposure  to judgements of national
courts of other country  as also the judgements of regional and
international tribunals  and understand their approach  to the
solution of problems  specially in the field of human rights 
""
but ultimately we have to work out our own constitutional salvation
in the light of our historical background  recording broken 
independence is  that the  judge must  judge must be independent
of himself or herself 
""
in other words in deciding cases the judges should consciously
avoid  being influenced by the preconceived notions 
""
it is a difficult task 
""
have judges maintained  the cold neutrality of an impartial
judge  as was edmund  burke's  perception? 
""
let us be realistic  judges like you and me are human beings
 cannot expect them overnight  to completely shed their predilections
and preconceptions 
""
the individual tone of the mind  the colour of past experience
 the character and variety of interests  the socio-economic
background of the judge  inevitably play a role  in the decision making
process 
""
our great chief justice patanjali shastri frankly acknowledged 
that  it is inevitable  that the so called social philosophy and
the scale of values of the judges  should play an important part 
""
""
at the same time he recognised  that  the constitution is
not meant only for the people  of their way of thinking  but for all
 
""
now there have been occasions  no doubts  when judges have
read their preferences into statutory and constitutional provision 
""
for example  the judgement of chief justice s. r. das 
declaring gambling as an immoral trade  beyond the pale of constitutional
protection 
""
justice  kapur's  view that certain advertisements for
sexual disorders were not protected by the fundamental rights of free speech
""
""
and justice  hidayatullah's  decision  i have never
understood that  that  lady  chatterley's  lover
 was obscene 
""
all reflects of social and moral philosophy of these judges 
""
strong views for the rights of labour certainly influenced the
decisions of justice gajendragadkar  in the field of industrial law 
""
justice d. a.  desa's  inveterate belief  that landlords
were a rapacious lots  and all tenants deserved the courts utmost
solicitude was transparent in his judgements 
""
but  it can be safely affirmed  that in the overwhelming
majority of cases  judges in india  have not acted as knight-errants
 on white chargers in quest of their individual notions of justice 
""
cases are decided as if the parties before them were anonymous 
and the issues are legal and constitutional 
""
judges as a rule  do not intentionally take a view against their
conscience or their oath  nor do they take any cue from the sentiments of
the ruling party 
""
by and large  judges do make a conscientious effort to
neutralise their personal beliefs  and predilections 
""
if a law prohibiting consumption of alcohol is challenged  the
court is not concerned with the wisdom of the policy underlying the
legislation 
""
and it cannot invalidate the law because in its opinion  the
evil of drink cannot be effectively tackled by legislation 
""
again when legislation involving nationalisation of road transport
 is challenged  in fact was challenged  the individual notions of
the justices over the policy of nationalisation are irrelevant  in
deciding whether there has been  breach of any constitutional provision
""
""
the decision of the supreme court in the bank nationalisation case
 is frequently cited as an instance  of the court striking down the
legislation because of its disapproval of the policy underlying it 
""
i am afraid what is overlooked is  in the criticism of this
much  maligned judgement  is that the supreme court rejected  the
basic and formidable argument  that nationalisation of banks was not in
the public interest 
""
they said it is not for the supreme court to go into that  they
upheld that  but  court ruled that certain provisions of the act 
did not provide compensation as required under the then  constitutional
provision 
""
consequence was  that these provisions were amended  and
nationalisation of banks was effectuated 
""
the general judicial attitude  is aptly and correctly summed up
 in the classic statement of justice vivian bose  in a case of
preventive detention of certain communists 
""
now mind you  he gave a dissenting judgement in which he 
quashed the orders of detention of the communists 
""
but the statement which i want to read in which i  which i would
like to read is this  and this was justice bose then   it is
perhaps ironical  that i should struggle to oppose this freedoms in
favour of a class of person  who if rumour is to be accredited  and if
the list of their activities furnished to us is a true guide  would be
the first to destroy them if they but had the power 
""
but i cannot allow  personal predilections  to sway my
judgement  of the constitution  
""
now let me come to another subject 
""
is there any antithesis between democracy  and an independent
judiciary? 
""
is judicial review-on undemocratic? 
""
does judicial invalidation of laws thwart the will of the people?
""
""
although it is necessary to remove certain view you hear this very
often 
""
i think  it's  necessary  to remove certain
misconception  about the role  of the judiciary in our constitutional
scheme 
""
one of the essential features of our constitution is division of
power  between different institutions namely the three wings of the state
""
""
the parliament and the state legislature  the executive and the
judiciary 
""
a central feature of our constitution  flowing from the division
of powers is  that of a limited government 
""
consequently no authority or branch of the state can have absolute
power 
""
moreover the limits of power cannot be determined by the limited
power itself 
""
since our constitution divides power between different organs 
and prescribes limitations of the powers of parliament the state legislature
and the executive  it is imperative that there should be an impartial
umpire  in the shape of an independent judiciary  to resolve the
inevitable disputes over the boundaries of the constitutional power  which
arise in the process of government 
""
and please remember  that our constitution has guaranteed
certain fundamental rights  and has expressly provided  that any law
or executive action which abridges any fundamental right is void 
""
the fundamental rights constitute a limitation  on the powers
of parliament and the state legislatures and the executive  and the
question whether any legislation  or executive action is violative of any
fundamental right  has to be decided by some independent body
