poona  uh uhn  then they had many so how many days did you stay there  i stayed there for ten days  how much did you study there   you'd been for study there yeah but then i didn't study much  as i kept falling sick didn't sit i didn't she has got to the trip for falling sick only so you had good health for eight days or so  ah uhm  so what did you do  kept waiting for you  ah  you must have done something useful you no i mean i've been to shirdi ah shirdi uhm so  i came back with the   at shirdi na it's uh uh shi saibaba's shrine   right  is there any other god other than saibaba no in shirdi no  this is shir di saibaba saibaba i've i've  heard that  you have heard about it very powerful no  actually he is a i think he's a m his religion is unknown uhm uhm  his uh  uhm uhm   what's his actual story  which story behind him he was just some saint moving around having uh alms and all uhm  and he used to help people poor people around once a he used to celebrate diwali at his place  too much uh with too much of lighting lighting of the lamps and all  uhm  uhm uhm  o once one year british government refused to give oil  uhm uhm  and he asked these cough people you  put water instead of oil  so people said ki water how will it burn  he put uhm they put water and then he he said okay now burn like that  so they light the lighting of the lamps with water uh  on diwali made him very much famous  uhm   uh  uhm i see that's how he's one word  and from them the lata mangeshkar is the person who has uh personally seen him uhm uhm one of my aunty who's personally seen him she is no more now she died last year i see   she's personally seen that fellow uhm uhm  they used to go to that saint  i see   uhm uhm  when did he first arrive  no in the nineteenth century only uhm i think  uhm  and uh uh this he had predicted about uh lata mangeshkar being too famous you know uh  in fact uh she is the prasad that uh god has given to you told his mother her mother actually  uhm got it  uh   uhm  this is the basic story about him and i think even my father experienced he never believes in many god but he believes in the saibaba  uhm  well he had to collect too much of funds in the office only he has put office only  the party that didn't seem to be giving money and all  we were passing through shirdi and he just said that if uh fair work is no more uhm  we have to accomplish the back uhm i will come to you  uhm   uhm  i see  and those party that party which never gave money   uhm gave shelled out money like that   uhm  shelled out  he came back and then he said two words  but actually my father never believes in  what about you you are a firm believ believer  firm believer i told you no after coming like  we've seen about this saibaba from one word  uhm  as you like do you know tamilians give more importance to this saibaba of their south indian gives importance to the bangalore saibaba uhm   you've heard about him na   uhm  yes i've heard of him uhm that but then we don't believe in ah  we believe in direct contact with god   ah  no does it seem  it's just like that so there are lot of followers in trivandrum specially saibaba's this but bangalore saibaba and that i've heard  i've heard many stories about his far and this thing you know  oh like  from his main devotees of course they have very good stories about him but from other people i have heard bad stories also about the saibaba  so anyway we uhm we prefer to remain neutral on this subject as such you know  no but uh even i have heard but i have heard only good events  uhm got it just like about rajneesh  ah rajneesh i know him   devout neg negative right right see even about him quite it is quite negative like  he is also using like something about his political powers and all that chandraswami then again  ah ha chandraswami  but then like we don't go to that sai you know please if you want to follow that's fair like yeah present   yeah   it's only that we don't interfere  but those people who've actually established themselves this uh at this saibaba uhm uhm  he said he is a one word because he never had money he never had power right that's the thing that's the thing we need then the moment he died uhm uhm  and when he died they were saying was hindus fought  that he was a hindu  mohammedans fought that he was a mohammedan and now what to do with that i see  when they came back to his grave   uhm uhm  they removed that cloth that cloth garment garment and uh saw  there was uh no body there was only flowers  so half flowers were taken in bunch uhm uhm  and half flowers were put in mazar that mazar  is made in like uh shirdi   uhm uhm  oh that's it  and now they have uh literally shown that uh uhm direct telecast uh everywhere in every corner of the temples you know   ah they are having uh t v   ah  oh yes  they've shown the whole pooja going on uhm in the temple  uhm they have arrangement about it carrying of the palanquin  uhm uhm nine fifteen to ten pm  i stayed uh by nine i had finished uhm so i thought  i will wait then i just couldn't wait because because i'll  miss the bus  uhm   uhm uhm   uhm  how many hours does it take to go there  twelve hours  twelve hours  near near if you have a vehicle you can uh reach within eight hours uhm uhm   eig not eight nine hours nine nine  over night journey  over night you'll manage  eight thirty you start from here uhm you'll  reach poona at four no yeah  then from poona you go to ahmednagar three hours journey   uhm uhm it's about four and a half hours  uhm   yeah   uhm uhm  ah do we get straight uh buses from here direct buses direct bus is eight thirty bus is here  evening evening bus morning morning eight thirty yeah night ten o'clock a bus is there but it is  inter- state bus  so very difficult to get that  but you can go by this uh bus also at nine uh eight eight thirty  go at eight thirty and uh reach by about eight  o'clock uhm and it's better you know and you get a chance to come back on very same day   uhm  yeah that's right because ten at ten o'clock there is a bus coming from uh kopargaon to hubli  right inter-state uhm and it's for five minutes stay there stand there so how long did you spend there  just one hour or two hours or so  ah one hour uhm uhm we caught we caught the next bus came  you got the bus and came back   it's because i was alone and i've got some company in shirdi uhm  they i can mean of coming in the morning na  so alone means  uhm   right  how this place is shirdi  uh in the sense  uh either like uh business other than that  other than being no its saibaba's place or it is developed or   business   no its  before it is saibaba's place it was too different too much now a five star hotel was there  it become developed  really they are making more arrangements not bad beautiful buildings now uhm uhm  and quite a lot changing you know uhm uhm the all office buisness people are business people  they loot out uhm too much  office   uhm  and other people  so it's a well developed place no yes it is  now it's well developed place before it was not to like it you know about that place through the saibaba only  hey you know i don't watch movies and others  right other than that i've never heard of this place at all  it is famous place  and there's one more place it's called  shaneshwar math form here  uhm that uh village got a speciality uh  and that is being tested my my father was in one word  and said  he was going on tour some driver told ki  here there is a place uhm  no robbers and no one came do robbering robbery  over that place  uh   uhm  vow  and if somebody robs or something uhm uhm  from this village uhm and after seventeen kilometer  circumference of that village uh he'll go blind  and until he replaces the thing he can't get his eyes   uhm uhm   uhm   uh  that is that day and uh many examples have been cited but uh i don't know whether it's true or not  only thing true is that my father went to the village   uh  he saw uh the house that was having just a door to keep the cats and uh dogs away from the house  no lock no house was having a lock  he went inside the house  old man he saw the old man and he got up saw him because he didn't recognise my father so he went to sleep back again   uhm  ahn uhm he he knows that nobody can take out anything  yes that's also world for this place to be invited uhm that's true  this uh same story i've heard is in trivandrum there is a temple uhm uhm goddess goddess temple it's  called a archaga devi temple  and there also we've heard stories like uh two men trying to get in   uhm  uhm  and uh these two robbers you know suddenly they got in the temple trying to steal the goddesses you know deity as such  and then suddenly they were blind and  and the main priest of this temple in his dream you know  like it it's as if goddess came to him and said see there are robbers in the temple go fast  he went he saw these two men you know and they were lying down blinded  they were you know motionless as he didn't know what to do  then immediately he called the police and they were caught see no robbery can take place uhm in that temple as such   uhm  so which is that temple   archagadevi temple   archagadevi  yeah it's very very powerful also  nei and we feel there is nothing like something like god but there's something some superpower  but there is you know there is there is  even in ajmer you know uhn what you go and tie a thread uhm  and you say what you want   uhn   uhm  uh you mean uh the one uh the temple where you can tie a thread around a tree or something like that  mean there're  uhm  i've seen that only in movies i told you know how these things  it's there it's there in ajmer you know it is  uh it is actually uh moinuddin chisti and ak ak  akbar made that uh mazar and a temple there   uh uh <,. masjid you call that you know uh  and that's too famous  you go uh you want you want to tie  and when it is full you turn back and fulfilled you come back   uh uh   uh   uh   tie  oh it's like that and people believe that it is like it is true  and even in vaishnavadevi uhm  north you know they say we hear in that all this no they say until and unless you are not called you can't go i see  cannot go if any body wants to go also you'll meet with an accident something will happen   uhm   i see   it's like that uhm i mean you just can't go why can't we still going on uhn i doesn't mean a few words  there also people say like  you can go only when the goddess wants you and there's  one more uh area called garbyodh  and even a fat person double fat uh anybody even that sumati  you've seen no  if uh she's pure bhakt  she wants to cross she will cross  and even if a slim person like you any slim lady you can take also even if you take jayshree for sake she goes she cannot go   there's a big or you can go go inside and  you've to come out  if you come out uhm if you go and come out  uhm that means uh you are a very pure person in heart like  uhm   uhm  pure person at heart means uhm you really haven't done anything bad and you just you've got a free free from this life but after that there'll be no life for you like no more births they speak of the deeds yeah yeah after this there's going to be no re  reincarnation ah i see
