now today we are going to start the new topic   the laws of return laws of return  now already you have studied regarding the consumption topic  there you have studied regarding the behaviour of a consumer  how a consumer is reacting towards the prices in the law of demand you have studied that when the price increases the quantity demanded decreases and when price fall the quantity demand is  increased  now here you have studied the behaviour of a consumer that how the consumer always tries to maximise his satisfaction  now under the laws of return we are going to study the behaviour of a producer  that how the producer is trying to find out the relationship between the input and output and how this input-output relationship is  useful for determining his cost of production  because his returns depends upon the cost of production  so under this now laws of return we have to study three different types of laws the law of increasing return diminishing return constant return and we have also to study the returns to state  but before we start with the law of increasing return  or law of variable proportion we have to be very clear regarding these certain concepts  so the first concept regarding which we have to be clear that is the production function production function  production function now you can write on this production function begins to dictate  according to professor lepski production function is  production function is a technological relation is a technological relation showing for given state of technology  showing for given state of technology cough  this explains cough how much can be produced  how much can be produced with given amount of input with  given amount of input   the functional relationship the functional relationship with the physical input and physical output  is known as production function is known as production function ends to dictate  it can be written in the form of equation it can be written in the form of equation as quantity is equal to f  a b c d quantity equal to f a b c d  here quantity b b work begin q means quantity  f means factors of production a b c d b b work end  different factors of production a b c d different factors of  production begins to dictates  this equation shows cough this equation shows  quantity produced depends on factors of production  respectively  this equation shows quantity produced depends on  factors of production respectively  production function production function expresses the relationship production function expresses the relationship  between quantity of output quantity of output and quantities of various inputs and quantities of various inputs ends to dictate written now in this production function what do you come to know  that what is production function ? it is a type of technological relationship which is existing between the input and output now do you know what is the meaning of input and what is the meaning of output ? what is the meaning of input ? yes ? yes answer me   it's alright it's a new topic but you must come forward  now for the production of commodity what do you need ? raw materials raw materials so all these raw materials are input  this factors of production as land labour capital raw materials all these are the input  now there supposingly there are two labourers and they are producing ten chairs  now what is the relationship between this ? raw material also they are using along with that now what you will say ? that making use of all these two labourers they are able to produce the ten chairs in a day so this is the production function that when we employ the two labourers they are producing ten chairs  when we employ the third labourer the production function will  change because they will be producing now more number of chairs  so what is production function ? it is simply a relationship between the inputs and outputs input is here the factors of production or the amount of the goods which we are using for the production of other commodities and output is the commodity which you are able to produce after making use of the input  and production function is giving you the relationship between the input and output  thereby having this much of factors of production how much commodity we can produce so to that we are calling it as a input and output relationship  begins to dictate  then further two things must be noted two things must be noted in respect of in respect of production function  first production must be considered with reference to a particular period of time production must be considered  with reference to particular period of time  written ? second  production technology should not change production technology should not change during that period  production technology should not change during that period  because when technology changes because when technology changes production function also gets changed when technology changes production function also gets changed  ends to dictate  now these are the two things which we have to keep in mind regarding the production function that it should be related to a particular period of time and during that period our technology should not be changed  because if the technology will change then our same production function relationship will not be there  why ? because with technology advancement when the technology changes  new input output relation come  so then our that production function cannot exist  so when we are studying it for a particular period of time during that period it is essential that the technology should not change as accordingly firstly the clothes are being produced with the help of handloom device  now production was less and after that some period new technology has come and now we may start producing the cloth with the help of powerloom you can say  so naturally input output relation will change and production function will also change  then begins to dictate in economic theory two types of production function are there  in economic theory two types of production function are there first when some input when some input are kept constant when some input are kept constant and other is changed and other are changed ends to dictate  written now this type of production function will be available in the short period  now i had explained to you already the concept of short period  market period and long period  from the adjustment of the supply point of view  now can you tell me now what is short period ? now again you have to go back  it's very bad  what is short period ? during the short period the supply can be input to the yes  short periods are that period in which we can ad  adjust the supply to a limited absence only by taking the variable factors of production  i told you there are two types of factors of production  fixed factors of production and variable factors of production so in the short period we are keeping the fixed factor as a  unchanged because now just now you have written that in this production function some inputs are kept constant and others are changed here fixed factors are kept constant and variable factors are changed during the short period and supply is at the dip at your limited extent and in the short period then a little laws of returns are applicable as the law of increasing return diminishing return and constant returns these laws will be applicable in the short period  why ? because in the short period you are not taking the fixed factor we are simply taking the variable factor and when you are taking the variable factor in the beginning  then the returns starts increasing  why they start increasing because earlier you are not making proper utilisation of the fixed factors of production now you want to increase the production and by employing the variable factor you are able to have the better utilisation of the fixed factors of production because of this your return have started increasing  but after some time your result return will start diminishing now why they will start diminishing ? why ? because now the variable factors as you are increasing the variable factors on that thing your variable factors are becoming more in proportion to the fixed factors and they are getting lesser and lesser shares from the fixed factors to work upon them and because of this their return starts diminishing  so you have to keep this thing in mind that this first type of production function is applicable in the short period  now second is there all the inputs can be changed  all the factors are changed all the factors are changed  so this is the second production function and it is applicable in the long run because long period you know is that period where all type of adjustments are possible  supply and demand can be adjustable to any extent and all the factors of production becomes variable  and under this production function you will be selling the returns to state  uh became one of the diff diff difference  coming between them  there in the short period laws of return here returns to state because in the second production function you are totaly changing the scale of the production and because of the change in the scale of production what is the change in the return ? that is studied under the returns to state  so this is regarding the first concept of the production function  then your next will be besides this you must have a idea regarding the tot meaning of total  product average product and marginal product  because if you are not clear regarding that also then also you cannot understand these laws of return  so first of all we will study the total product  so what that is ? product  now what is the meaning of total cost ? although it is not related to you this but still i want to connect this topic with that  total what is the total cost ?  a few words  i am asking you what is the meaning of total cost ?  a few words  don't study at home you one word  total cost is the cost of producing a commodity  whatever total money if a pruducer is spending on the productional value providing is known as the total cost  okay and it includes fixed and variable from both  then you have studied the total value cocept also  what is total value ? it is the money received which is being received by the producer  while selling up certain amount of commodity in the market  whatever money he is getting to that we are calling it as the total value  now similarly the total product is the amount of the goods  which are being produced by a certain number of producers labourers or input whatever we are using by making use of that whatever we are able to produce to that we are calling it as the total product  you can write down the meaning of total product  be regular otherwise it will be very difficult for you  begins to dictate  total product of a factor is total product of a factor  is the amount of the total output is the amount of the total output  produced by given amount of factors produced by given amount of factors given amount of factors  as the factors are increased total product also starts rising total product also  total product also start rising but the rate of increased value but the rate of increased value at different levels of output at different levels of output  in the beginning in the beginning total product rises  at a increasing rate after a point after a point total product starts rising total product start rising at diminishing rate as the employment of variable factors as the employment of variable factors increases as the employment of variable factors increases ends to dictate  written now you can take this how you can find out it is increasing  you you can take the number of labourers and total  product and total product from which you can come to know how it is  firstly increasing at an increasing rate then it is increasing at a diminishing rate  now accordingly then the zero first labourer is here the total product is n unit  the second labourer is employed the total product is eighteen units  the third labourer is employed it is twenty-five  the fourth it is thirty and fifth it is thirty-two  and fifth labourer it is thirty-two  now what did you come to know from this ? it is first of all it is increasing at a increasing rate or not  ? than it is increasing at a diminishing rate  than from the first labourer you have employed the second labourer the total product has increased from ten to eighteen there has been the increase of eight units  in the third case also it is not as if there is an increase of the  seven units now in fourth case you see there is the increase of only  five units so the rate of increase is decreasing  then in the fifth case you find there is increase of only the  two units  why it is happening this ? because now when the first labourer was there the fixed factors were more and they were not being fully utilised  when we start with second labourer there was a better utilisation of both factors of production and the production has increased when we employ the third then also it has increased  but after the fourth labourer we find when we have employed the fifth labourer the rate of increase in the total product is  diminishing it is diminishing because as the variable factors are increased  they are getting lesser and lesser shares  now these fixed factors you work upon them and because of this  their total products starts diminishing okay  is that okay
