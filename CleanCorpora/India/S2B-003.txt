gold has always been considered a status symbol in india 
""
in addition  people buy gold for security  and this keeps
them interested in its prices 
""
the abolition of the gold control act has resulted in a
fluctuation in gold prices 
""
we have this  report from our correspondent maya sharma 
""
""
gold in our country  is a precious symbol of wealth and
security 
""
but the gold market itself  does not glitter quite so much 
involving as it does  inflated prices and large scale smuggling 
""
the  government's  decision to abolish the gold control act
 was followed by an initial drop in the gold price  from pre-budget
level 
""
but the cost of gold in india continues to be much higher  than
in the international market 
""
the domestic demands of gold  is estimated at two hundred and
fifty tonnes every year 
""
less than two tonnes is produced by indian mines annually  and
about fifty tonnes is obtained from recycled gold 
""
the huge gap between supply and demand is filled to a large extent
by smuggled gold 
""
those in the trade believe the current blanket ban on gold import
 should be lifted  arguing that this should bring down the gold prices
 encourage export of jewellery  and also curb smuggling 
""
the government stand is that gold is not an essential item  to
justify expenditure of foreign exchange to import it 
""
whatever the  government's  decision  and regardless of
the price  the desire for gold is only likely to increase
