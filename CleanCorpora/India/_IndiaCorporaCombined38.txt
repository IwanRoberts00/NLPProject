yes  so  just two of you you tell me what you want to talk about  laughter    i  can we talk something about the situation in these days    yeah  actually you say something what do you think like uhm actually why the real fighting is going on between naga and kuki i don't know the reason yet  you don't know ? uhm  they are different uh people different people they have different reas uh versions about it uhm  the way i know it is that uh now these kukis are nomads uhm  and they don't have a particular territorial area uhm and what's happened is in in the manipur area of  uh these naga people the tamkuls the kuki people have come and settled  and now they they are in encroaching in the into the naga areas  uhm and so the nagas are defend defending their place    so we'll deal  no we've started   started    you started uh  yeah  so anyway you can just sit and uh laughter    you can do this  so like i've just i don't know what happened between uh i mean in our place the situation right now so i am asking her to ex one word explain i was trying to explain atleast my idea of what i feel is going on   that's one reason okay like uh this kukis are encroaching on the tamkul land so the tamkuls are retaliating  that that is defending themselves  then another one is that uhm this anasian people were taking taxes from the kukis  oh  and now the kukis they refused to uh pay any more  and so they are moving against them  uhm  like that    for that only  yeah mainly and that is how it all started because they said that we won't pay anymore   but this tamkul no they are naga  they are nagas     that's what  now what's happened is that the the nagas before  there was no nagaland  they said it's only in the last uh nineteen sixty-two or three that the nagaland was formed  so each naga group just lived in in their within each naga group has got the particular territorial area and we live like that so like the aungs we have our place the  angami's have their place like that tamkuls they have their place uhm  and when statehood was given to us then uh they did not uh put all the places together but uh like much of the naga tribes are now in manipur there are some tribes in arunachal pradesh  some in assam like that  and so now one of the demands of this uh the nationalists groups that are coming up is that the greater nagaland  greater nagaland means all this should be integrated uhm  and when it happens then large a large chunk of uh  manipur also will come to nagaland oh  and this was passed in the assembly uh two months back  that nagaland government also will try to do this and manipur government has started noise so uh tamkuls uh the mar mar  marams announce like that    two words  yeah they are nagas in manipur  this was like the fighting is going on in for a month ha  they used to means people used to think that it's  happening in nagaland because always naga and kuki naga and kuki yeah that's true  uh then actually the fighting is going on in imphal over yeah    it's not in in nagaland  nagaland it is   it means between this kuki and nagas  yeah so far the clashes are going on means this killing and all are going on only in that place not  yeah  in the hill areas of manipur     in that respect nagaland  it doesn't affect nagaland much yeah    ah ah so it affects only manipur   right for example  when they say naga means we think that some angami   aau or some people of eastern parts or uh one word   so far no one is in the one word only tamkul   like two words   that's why i was wondering why uhm but  the after effect of course in nagaland is where many of the kukis in nagaland are being uh quite a number have been actually killed oh  so one tamkul one shot one director uhm  and then uh one kuki i a s officer was also shot uhm  and uh just before i came and after i came also two kukis were shot like that  but it's a spill over from manipur    kukis they stay in nagaland itself  they are spread all over the place     all over it  so they are recognised as one of the tribes in uh nagaland but they don't have a specific area in nagaland means they don't have a motherland  they don't have a particualr area like we do  so they are there in manipur they are there in uh mizoram  and uh in nagaland and also in assam half long area  laughter  any more questions  so   one word what do you want to talk about now  laughs  how is your further politics ? laughter    i know nothing about politics i never bother to  recording broken  tibya now uh in the final year isn't this ?   yeah  so what are you doing ? what are your subjects that you are doing ?   i am doing my civil  uhm ha   engineering  most like it's mostly concerned about structures   structures what structures ?   like dams and all  uhm    dams and canals and all those things  uhm  so  so when you go back to uh shillong do you think you'll  be able to apply your these ideas ?   yeah actually my plan is to work in public health engineering department  uhm uhm    mostly concerned for dams and all  uhm    so and there is one branch in uh mafna that's  about one hour from shillong  uhm uhm    and that's a very good one  uhm    maybe if possible i will try to work there now they are constructing a new dam out there  where in mafna ?   yeah mafna  uh ha     it's a beautiful place  uh    so that's my uh let's see that will work or no laughter  you think you will easily get a job there in that department ?   not that difficult to get a job there  uhm   p w d is very difficult uhm but not p h e ?  uhm  why ?   because uh p w d most of the students no they  usually go for traffic engineering  uhm so   but these days but that's not my aim i don't like traffic engineering i think i mean highway engineering  uhm why is that many they just go for traffic ?    it's quite easy you know laughter  because of that laughter  yeah     that's it maybe i don't know why  uhm    but in p w d now it's fully packed  uhm    so it's very difficult to get a job  uhm    but p h e there is a chance  so thats what you are plannigg to do or any other things you are planning to do ? now you are doing project no ? so what under what topic you are doing that project ?   environmental impact on uh all the water resources project no how it affects the structures and all  how do environment affects structure  you have started working on laughter    no yeah laughter  no yeah     two words laughter  you told me this one a few words it's  about your one word studies laughter  i think she will have exhaust  keri can tell us what she has been doing ? laughter    ha yes keri can tell us laughter  okay then after getting your job like what is what is your next plan ?   after getting my job ?  yeah laughter  she will enjoy   no  she will enjoy   how do you know that ?  make out laughter  so you are so sure of getting job    i am not so sure yaar  but you can try laughs    but i don't mind if i don't get a job   laughter   you'll two words more like that   yeah  okay then what about keri ? i really don't have any idea about my job laughs  but as far as my subject is concerned i think i prefer working outside outside our place and ah ha   yeah but that's  outside uh so what one word   now in our place there is no electronics department now uhm so like i will try to pick up all those uh competitive exams no and all i will keep on trying laughter  till you get one laughter  till i have one job from outside laughter  so what are the different uh things that you are trying for right now ? right now like i am not trying for any exam like uhm uhm after finishing my this b e only i will prepare for those exams uhm  so you have any idea what you are going to uh apply for ? see like i may write gates also  uhm uhm and i don't know whether g r e is there in guwahati or not  perhaps not sure  if it is there i will try the one word  or    i think it is there  so you will try from guwahati mainly ? yeah means i don't want to come back here to just like uh  i will just get those materials and i'll prepare for more and i like guwahati laughs  yeah guwahati atleast is quite close enough  but i am not sure whether it's guwahati is the centre or not uhm  i don't think yaar    calcutta  but gates is there uh  gates is there    yeah gates gates is there  both    uhm  but you better try g r e also  means ? uh like if i prepare for gates it's only same g r e both are uh like the syllabus and all   in fact gates is tougher than g r e  yeah    so  oh gates is tougher   uhm  then what about uh plans to go abroad toefl and all these  laughs  hey which two words was doing yeah it was not so    but if you are writing gre of course   yeah gre also is same but uhm  mainly i think i'll prefer gates only  uhm  uhm so you are not interested in going abroad ?  laughter  of course it's intrested but it's a bit  difficult for me laughter    for me going abroad uh i think   it's your dream   going for enjoyment only not for studies laughter  not for studies or a job uhn   yes i think rose and all   it's rose why why actually rose laughter   i must be a fan of one word  but of course if uh if i get a job in our place i prefer that one what i feel is that i don't think uhm because there is no department also    but of course   one word i will try in my place in naga in nagaland yeah so will you take uh which one would you prefer uh  lower job in nagaland or a higer paid job outside of nagaland  uhm it depends but suppose like uhn if the salary is at at around uh three thousand in nagaland uhm uhm and may be there is ten thousand in outside uhm i will prefer the three thousand in nagaland    yeah laughter  yeah because  yeah that's laughter  uhm but as far as this status is concerned  uhm uhm of course high one also even though it's outside doesn't matter much laughter   uhm uhm  but first preference is on nagaland uhn laughter    yeah that's right  uhm    as if you have laughter  i think economic so that i can always try laughter   you must always have hope na  yeah they did it's not that we are going to be  one word just hoping and dreaming know laughter  yeah nothing nothing wrong with that  what about the empty zones say the upsc exams neither of you are interested   no  not very much also but    i am not interested in any exam laughter  who knows who might get again we might change change our mind also to laughter    yeah may be after going home  after going home yeah you might get inspired   but right now i don't have any plans  uhm i knew you seem to be quite sure what you want to do both of you laughter  no this is just laughter recording broken  laughter okay uhm did you have a very unique kind of system isn't that among the khasis where marriage is concerned   uhm  so can you uh tell us something about uh how  what kind of uh what rituals or formalities that you observe and all this    you mean after marriage ?  no before uh uh how they get married laughter  that way you can just tell us how they get married  laughter     oh how to get married   ho how you get married ? after marriage i don't think you need to do laughter excellent one laughter    uh actually we don't believe in uh arranged marriage and all those things  uhm uhm   so it's always always love marriage in our place  and then uh  you have the matriarchal system na like where do your the woman is the more dominant in the family
