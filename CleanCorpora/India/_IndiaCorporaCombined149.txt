hello viewers  nearly all aspects of journalism have been undergoing a metamorphisis in recent times  wide ranging changes have gripped the media some for the better some for the worse  the glossies as they are called have come to stay  and even seem to be thriving  uh there has been a wave of investigative journalism uh which has brought along controversies of its own today we have with us mr dileep padgaonkar the editor of  the times of india who will speak to us on the modern trends in journalism today  mr padgaonkar has a ph d in philosophy from sourgone  paris  he has been a correspondent of the times of india  in paris and has worked in several capacities  with the unesco  uh today he'll dwell on the principal influences  a acting on journalism  uh diplomacy in diplomatic actions and the polarisating within the media itself  mr padgaonkar apart from the technological advancements in what way does present day journalism differ from that in the immediate post independence period  there have been differences i think at three levels  clearing his throat  the first is that the market for the built medium has become very much more competitive than it was in the years immediately after independence yes and this is has brought into its wake coughs several trends some encouraging some not so  among encouraging trends i think is the much greater  emphasis on the professionalism on presentation on packaging so on so forth clears his throat  the discouraging trend is of course that the very competition has given rise to a great deal of uh one word journalism sensationlism and i refer in particular to film journalism though it is not restricted merely to film journalism you find much of uh this kind of personality bashing even in poliltical journalism and lately imperative journalism  so this is the the first uh change that i i can see the other change has been brought about by technology itself i think the uh revolution has been witnessed in the field of  uh print technology in particular the question of gathering data storing it retrieving it processing it and so on has made uh it possible for news papers now to have a cleaner look of brighter look to meet their deadlines of course there are  teething problem as everywhere else  but this is the second factor which has uh gone long way i think to bring about several changes in journalism thirdly clears his throat it has uh also brought into play a degree of specialisation which you did not have in the immediate uh uhm years after independence today you have uh journals specialised in sports in motoring in yatching uh in architecture and so on so forth and what this is meant that is a greater degree of  uh pluralism  discipline-wise uh in the one word fashion and these three trends taken together is meant that today's  journalism is uh quite unlike anything that was witnessed by our parents and our grandparents   uh  what about the editorial content which which is  they had this identity ferver then you know but today they are tended to go towards through profit oriented  you know i'm not one of those who believes that what the parents and grandparents did evident flo   flows from idealism and what is happening today is entirely  uh gripped by mercantilents  i think mercantilents were present then  they are present today  those idealisms then and there is considerable idealism today i say this because i i deal with a great many uh then  journalists  i take an active interest in the training of journalism in my own newspaper  and uh then i feel that atleast in the initial years they aren't corroded by cynicism which you find among those who have  been in the business for ten or twelve years  uh but where you are probably right is that the manner in which market forces are shaping uh the field today   it's something which is which the older generation  is not really accustomed to  this is happening everywhere in all countries where you have  the free market and a free press but in our country it's relatively new  the fact that uh today newspaper editors are supposed to be conversant atleast with what market trends are being yet what the trends are and the area of production in the area of circulation and so on so forth it means that uh you cannot the pictures will have of the editor who sits in his close cabin and concentrates all day and produces his handling editorials that picture i think is part of the myth of which is uh  now dead and gone  uh these days we've seen you've seen uh  a peculiar phenomenon  uh industrial houses have taken a keen interest in starting a newspaper of their own you know  uh what do you feel of it yes there again you know you should take a look at the major uh newspapers uh in the english language your faculty were always controlled by industrial houses but what happens   but you had something to do with journalism they were not purely industrial houses as such no you had certain newspapers clears his throat which were  those only whose own sole interest was in the field of publication of magazines and newspapers you see if you take a look at the clears his throat   anand bazar patrika group in calcutta or the hindu group in madras clears his throat  you always had some of them whose sole business was this  what you're probably trying to hint at is that  uh industrialists with interests in several industries are adding  newspapers to their clears his throat uh to their table sources uh and then your coyright  with there are two reasons for it  it might not really be for money that is i can tell you that newspapers though form of uh profitable today then they ever were  some of them atleast clears his throat   it's still not the most profitable among the business ventures uhm in the country  uh probably many of them want to gain political clout  by starting newspapers clears his throat  i have my own reservations for this so the powers can be misused you say so the powers can be used but i i had my own doubts about how much clout a newspaper must be really enjoying i mean you know being addressed to by the your first name by the power of the woman if that is clouting may be this  but if you see the manner in which the official media are handled my own feeling is that the shrewdest among the political lot  gear up doubles for what the print media writes so even this business of clout write is some what exaggerated but then this is in contradiction to the what happens to to  an industrialist recently he had to give up his shares in a particular newspaper of course it does  but much depends also on how much that particular industry  industrialist is able to uh stands  stand off a pressure on him i know another industrialist who has been uh facing the wrath of government for the greater part of the past ten ten years and uh while the scoop of the particular industrialist  doesn't have other interests anymore clears his throat  the fact is he's short of the great deal of grit and comes to me in in defending these matters i think it's part of you know periodically  there're fashions in the in the medium and media as there's  fashion elsewhere and the current fad is that let's me let me have a magazine let me have a daily newspaper and so on so forth my own view is this will this too record will fade away fast to what do you attribute the plori plorify plori  proliferation of a glossy magazines as they call and uh the they're quite successful at that  even though they are very few and less at times no they are successful because no editing i think ten percent now and on packaging on presentation use of uh colour  uh this is all a part of growing competitive environment  and uh today you have a supplement on blazed paper  uh you even have suppliments on art paper and i won`t be surprised if you in due course you have supplements uh with perfume in them uhu and may be even a musical note  uhu  you mean to say a readers can be carried away by its  one word   i think readers are in one word  certainly that that one little difference uh which makes it possible for attractive packaging to to get rid of this  this is of other areas if you see what happens for detergents or soaps or uh shampoos  you see that it's a really aggressive form of marketing the advertising uh the packaging this is really what  what sets  so newspaper has become like any other product i think generally you ca  you can say that more and more people own newspapers regard newspapers uh in terms of products then in terms of the public service  uh that's things you sh should change naturally it is exactly but you know it's not something to be romantic it has to come sooner or later  if you feel that people are putting in their money investing  naturally and so on uh uhm for purely idealistic uh reasons then i think uh one is really not up to the mark increasing you'll find that with massive investments  uh they there will have to be a closer interaction between the editorial side of a newspaper and the managing sides of newspaper yes  uh in recent times newspapers some of them uh major  one's atleast are being one word that either belonging to the opposition or which are very pro-government what do you have to say? i think the observation is especially in the objectivity point of view yes you your observation is is at once true and sad  because i think some newspapers have taken it upon themselves  to play politics through journals  like some others have sought to use newspapers for their  economic or business for example  uh the polarisation you talk of is radio reflection of polarisation on the national field  and to that extend it is inevitable  but do newspapers contribute to the polarisation i feel yes alas they do  whereas uh the functions of a newspapers i've seen are ready to take a stand issue by issue  partly because ideological has come between we no longer have  the certainties of this or that ideology things are from there  and in its place in that vacuum that has been created what you have clears his throat is not another ideology but self interest and self interest understood in an absolutely mundane  petty vulgar sort of it so that extend i think you are right there is a polarisation i deplore it  uh i try to resist it but unless the country itself becomes less polarised  and until the country learns to accept that there is no  not one truth with the capital t but many truths which have to one word  uh it is then that you can see their involvement  and then the involvement of the of the journalists and the newspapers uh i deplore the fact for example the news columns are used more and more for partisans interests  i think uh the reporters ought to be allowed to write  exactly what they feel like and such comment as you want to make should be confined to the  editorials   that's a  editorials  but uh there has been uh as you see among  theorists mass media theorist say that especially in a country like in india which is still in a developing stage  there has ought to be some agency which takes which moulds public opinion or which guides people  and at times peoples might have to take the role of the opposition  because as you know our opposition is pretty weak in the country  but some people don't agree to this what is what is your opinion ? no no  the that you see it is it is true that you know because institutions have tumbleded whether it is parliament whether it is judiciary uh and much of their business is now readily been given to the press  uh it's a daunting task and it doesn't  happen in in developed countries  and once you do that you got to be the saviour of the institutions  you've got to be promoting causes  you've got be doing things which earlier you  didn't  for example even ten years ago i think that the press reported the going on in the parliament  today it's going from the parliament are determined by what it is the press  and it's a complete switch over and it's a dangerous switch over because the press is accountable of course  but certainly it is not as accountable or as immediately accountable or as determinately accountable as the elected representatives of people  and to try and substitute yourself in the press for them  can lead to all kinds of problems  so do you think that certain code of conduct should be  the immediate code of conduct because now we have a very loose i don't think either a rigid code or a flexible codes could work because partly as you rightly point out there is this polarisation  so on what basis can you have uh a two words  my feeling is there is very little concensus in the newspaper world for what newspaper ought to be  uh all of us stood together when the definition bill was brought together we managed to beat that back  we also stood together when recently the jammu and kashmir government brought a fresh bill  but this kind of solidarity remains very fragile  uh otherwise there is uh uh clear polarisation in the newspaper world and i don't think it dissolved very easily  for a code of conduct even a flexible one you need a measure of consensus and that consensus mind you does not exist at the moment
