""
""
hi chitra 
""
""
fine thank you 
""
""
when did you come from amrawati
""
""
on sixth of november 
""
""
how are you liking kolhapur 
""
""
now i am adjusting to it 
""
""
why you didn't like it initially
""
""
no 
""
""
no 
""
why you don't like the  uhm climate here 
""
""
climate is okay the people are not uh 
""
""
people are very nice 
""
""
yeah 
""
""
climate is not nice because we are accustomed to the coastal
climate 
""
so  we don't like this dry climate 
""
i don't feel  familiar at all 
""
i like  straight  and perspiration then only i feel at home
otherwise no  laughter  
""
""
but uh  i like  uh the climate here 
""
 it's  nice and cool 
""
and uh  though the people are slightly  uh from the 
bhosle family or the shahu family and
""
""
they are royal people   all are royal people 
""
""
  one or two words   
""
""
they talk and uh  behave that way uhn 
""
""
yeah
""
""
courteous behaviour
""
""
having the arrogance of the  aristocrat
""
""
aren't they soft spoken  like the nagpur people   
no  full of courtesy
""
""
 no  
""
""
in nagpur uh  nagpur uh population is very much affected by
 the non-marathi i think
""
""
yeah 
""
""
that is why  uhm their  behaviour has slightly undergone
some change
""
""
uh changed means that  nazakat  of hindi
language   that's  in your
""
""
that way of speaking 
""
and uh specially the business community is affected by punjabis and
sindhis
""
""
 accha 
""
""
so they are naturally more polite 
""
but here the  business community is dominated by  either
brahmins or  perhaps  marathas
""
""
local kolhapuris
""
""
local kolhapuri 
""
so they  are very arrogront in their uh  one word 
""
""
only tone  sort of arrogance but  inwardly they are
 very uhm
""
""
no  we have had bad uh
""
""
is it so
""
""
experience
""
""
 haan  very bad experience 
""
they are very i mean uh  to make friends they take a lot of
time i don't know why
""
""
yeah  are they so choosy
""
""
 haan    laughter 
""
""
no even an ordinary  uh  rickshawallah  or a
shopkeeper
""
""
 accha 
""
""
will uh  won't talk to you  in a very polite manner
like  he is not bothered whether his  product is  sold or not 
""
he is more bothered that  if he   like you  want to
bargain  he says just keep it down and get lost  laughter 
""
""
 tells you  
""
""
and bargaining on  our side is very  normal sort of a
thing    yeah yeah  these days
""
""
 yeah yeah  
""
""
every where in the cities bargaining will go on 
""
""
so also our hostel uh  staff who are working  including
the warden the  bai 
""
""
she breaks over very
""
""
sweeper everybody are horribly arrogant 
""
they just want to  do what is their    alloted job 
""
""
 according to   the rule
""
""
alloted work   that's  all 
""
""
might be for years together they have been doing the same job
fed up with this steoro type of that job earning from 
""
""
but uh  in our area people are ready to earn a  extra
buck 
""
""
 accha  
""
""
here even if you are ready to pay them  they will not uh
""
""
""
maybe they have a lot of self-respecting personality
""
""
yeah  and ego is 
""
""
  egoism is there at a very high rate 
""
""
 and there is too much awareness yeah  
""
""
too much awareness about their working hours
""
""
 haan 
""
""
their right time is over okay  no work 
""
in uh nagpur
""
""
and one  fine thing we found in kolhapur is that people are
i think so not too much addicted you see  drinks  or  paan
 or something of that sort
""
""
yeah   these two things  are common in my town
""
""
 because that is very less  
""
""
in our side you see  vidarbha region
""
""
 paan  do you say about  paan 
""
""
ah yeah vidarbha side  we  see  less  paan
 shops here   anywhere addicted and all  drunkards and all
""
""
 yeah the spots of uh  
""
""
that means many  paan  shops  are there in
 one word 
""
""
you see in amrawati you will find people lying you know 
 drunk  heavily   drunked   drunk    lot and
lots of people know specially those  rickshaw puller  i mean lower
strata public
""
""
 is it so
""
i had totally different ideas about amravati  
""
""
yeah 
""
""
i mean from the lower strata
""
""
 ekka  we call that sort of rickshaw
""
""
 haan  no    cycle rickshaw 
""
""
 cycle rickshaw  
""
""
cycle rickshaw and all 
""
""
so all of   them are heavily drunk 
""
""
 cycle rickshaws are there  
""
that population is the largest in working
""
""
even the auto people
""
""
 one word  cycle rickshaw
""
""
even the auto  pe 
""
""
don't you think  it's   inhuman rather
""
""
no no   it's  the cheapest form of transports still
""
""
and the buses are very few
""
""
even these auto rickshaw  wallah  people are
all drunk  mostly 
""
and they  it's  very terrifying
""
here that way  it's  quite safe
""
""
till you get down you don't   have any guarantee 
""
""
 ah here  it's  very   secure  they are
arrogant they are all you see 
""
""
no safe driving you know
""
""
no good mannered also or rather we can say character wise
also  having a very clean spotless character maybe that may be the
influence of tarabai
""
""
and most of the rickshaw persons they are graduate
""
""
 haan 
""
""
just now i came know he was b com person
""
""
 haan 
""
""
so now-a-days they don't get job  and instead of 
hunting   the job  they prefer that
""
""
 maybe  
""
""
that may be the reason one of the reasons
""
""
these two things are really good in them  alcoholism is
less   paan  eating is less  and honesty is there 
 still there 
""
""
 compartively   in our area  paan 
eating is uh 
""
""
still less 
""
""
yeah still less 
""
""
ha ha  here i think that uh  paan  eating
is more    no no  so that compared to your region
""
""
 no no  
""
""
no there are few  paan  and all they don't
very less
""
""
very less i feel see  otherwise kolhapur and  paan
 closely associated
""
""
there even our college students you know they take that
 tambaku 
""
""
is it so  oh
""
""
 that's  it
""
""
so they are your  gurus   laughter 
""
""
and here
""
""
and smoking is also very great among the students there in
vidarbha region 
""
and here   we don't find the students smoking this smoking
and all 
""
""
 now americans and westerners   they know the
evils of smoking as here they pick it up as a style you know
""
""
ha only statuatory warning is there   but  it's 
a sign of manhood for them actually smoking 
""
""
 but i think that that also gone for   picking up
on style nothing else
""
""
reduced now  because it is this tv influence in every
thing
""
""
yeah yeah yeah
""
""
but here it is becoming lesser
""
""
 that's  what i feel
""
""
and we know actually this no
""
""
ha
""
""
but some people you know they read the statutory warning
laugh and they start smoking
""
""
uhm start smoking and  that's  true
""
""
once you get into a habit  nothing can stop you  not
even alcohol
""
""
as your blood turns alcoholic and then you will get addict to
cigarette smoking 
""
""
maybe to keep the company these students force  na
  the friends
""
""
yeah
""
""
and in order to
""
""
you can't oppose  when you are in minority and they are in
majority you can't oppose otherwise  they'll  laugh at me
""
""
that is why uhn
""
""
it happens sometimes
""
""
that fear  of public opinion compulsory to  take
""
""
otherwise you feel rather afraid to stay down and shout of
 one word  in their company they will laugh at you
""
""
it happens you know  someone is uh rather behaving
decently  then other people they laugh at them and he feels   very
guilty about them yeah 
""
""
  it's  the style of  one word    if
you see a gentleman like that way  to smoke 
""
""
and  i'm  really impressed with this university and
its uh    maintenance 
""
""
 maintenace  
""
""
yeah
""
""
and   especially 
""
""
 especially   these you know library   is
very good 
""
""
 these department   people i like so much you know
""
""
no our director is a very nice person i have never come
across
""
""
yeah yeah yeah
""
""
such a nice person   occupying such a high  post
 very friendly and we are not afraid also to 
""
""
 soft spoken gentle and  
""
""
he is a scholarly person but he
""
""
 ha ha  have   a   an   informal
talk with him
""
""
 he's  not a barrier between
""
""
ha no
""
""
we are  one word 
""
""
very great person and grand person
""
""
and uh 
""
""
then he will he will be remaining in our memory for ever
""
""
yeah yeah it is true
""
""
in   nagpur university 
""
""
  one or two words    in his place  but
still 
""
""
he has nothing he is a very    unassuming  type
of
""
""
 unassuming   yeah really i wanted to use the same
word and uh 
""
""
very few persons are like that 
""
but in our university we can almost   feel the  
levels of corruption  which you can't feel here
""
""
 feel that  
""
""
very high level
""
""
everywhere it is
""
""
no here here you see there is less corrupt
""
""
you can't bribe them you see
""
""
it is there or  it's  not there we are not going to
judge but
""
""
actually we don't see these
""
""
no no we saw them bribing those ladies you know  to sweep
and all 
""
they were not ready to sweep
""
there is no it doesn't come in our duty 
""
so  it's  not easy to bribe them 
""
they have that  self-decency or  self-honesty as shubha said
 they have maintained it 
""
or may be that royal blood still  frozen their vein
""
""
in our university  no one bothers to do anything
""
""
yeah
""
""
you just give them anything 
""
now  it  more dominates on the  class one 
""
""
ours is also  worst it is 
""
they won't accept  and they won't move
""
""
no but if  there if you give any extra money  anything
can be done
""
""
anything can be done
""
""
but here  it is the other way round
""
""
even take marklist  one word   laughter  at
twelfth standarad level board amarawati board is
""
""
hazard of thinking
""
""
yeah 
""
""
so we should thank 
""
""
dr shastri  and professor karande and now we should
conclude  for what he has  
""
""
""
when when is you paper reading 
""
when is your paper reading
""
""
i don't know it was actually on twenty-sixth    but
uh jahagirdar said   put anywhere now
""
""
 you got chances no  
""
""
any where
""
""
yeah
""
""
so you have to be prepared anyday
""
""
yeah yeah   i'am  already prepared  with my
casette on 
""
i am going to   show it through the cassette 
""
""
 well how did you  
""
""
how did you shoot the cassette like with who was the
cameraman 
""
""
yeah  ganesh  one word  he is a professional and
 he's  my cameraman and he is a student of shrikant madhushri  from
j j school of arts
""
and he has got his own studio in ratnagiri 
""
and he is our friend  so  straightway  we can say 
ganesh company and we can just drop it
""
""
but how did you get this idea that uh  you should make a
video and
""
""
actually in the class you know i make free use of 
cassettes  for my kids 
""
so we show them one 
""
but this was for the first time  otherwise that  shooting
job my husband used to do for me  or ganesh  but uh  sometimes i
felt i should learn atleast samething of it
""
i cannot handle the camera  so video camera so confidently 
but i am comparatively good at outdoors 
""
indoors and closeups i had to take help of my husband and ganesh
""
""
but then  editing  commentary writing  dubbing  then
introducing the third scene of santoor  everything i have done  only
ganesh was there  he used to give me occasional instructions like that 
""
and camera handling actually outdoor  landscaping  that
landscape shot  i have taken and actually the close ups  and some parts
of your  architectural shots of that building  ganesh took my husband
took  and close ups of the faces my husband and ganesh took
""
""
but uh uhm  like how did you  uhm how do you use your
video for  uh teaching every day teaching
""
""
everyday teaching means not in the class 
""
""
not in the class
""
""
in the class  uh there is questions and answers session
""
""
after the lecture
""
""
group discussion class uh
""
""
your which classes do you teach 
""
""
uh right from f y b a to m a two
""
""
what is f y b a 
""
""
  f y is  the first year
""
""
 first year  
""
""
uhn
""
""
b a to m a  part one and m a part two 
""
so after my working hours you know i am having about free periods
""
""
even my kids they have got free periods they come to me sometimes
""
 i'll  take them to  we have got such  sound proof ac
room 
""
 it's  actually computer room we have got ten computers 
but is just like a hall remaining part is  unoccupied you know and there
are chairs semicircular monitor is there
""
so straight away we can take  facility of that room  and our
principal  cabin it has got one set t v set monitor  uh video is there
 and even that is sound proof and ac 
""
so only five or six students are there
""
sometime  they come in group for  explanation and asking
their doubts and difficulties
""
so i can  take them to the  principal's  cabin  that
way  he's  very generous
