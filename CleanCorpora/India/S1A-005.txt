""
uh  hello basu 
""
how are you
""
""
uhm  hello 
""
chakraborti how are you
""
""
 i'm  fine
""
uh you for the last uh  ten to fifteen days  for the last ten
fifteen days  we are going to have a  uh new political  uh  the
transformation  both in the state and  the centre
""
what is your opinion
""
what you think about it 
""
""
actually mm  what i think is uhm  that uh  i was
reading a newspaper today  in the morning  and uh  i found that uh
 some  uh some foreigners commented  that  it is  uh why the
people of india are crying uh  or crying about the  possibility 
of the  future democratic
""
it is  that means it is why they are  crying so much about
the  about the  uh existence of democracy in india 
""
this is this is their comment and i think that uh  okay if it
happens like that  uh and uh  this uh formation of government  which
 because it is a democracy so so many parties are there 
""
so  if it is uh  uhm  most of the  uh  parties
they if they join together i think the country will run  well 
""
""
 don't  you think basu  in your home in japan in 
israel even in  uh sri lanka  in these countries  uh  there are
many governments which are formed  uh by many parties 
""
single party  uh is ruling the country like india
""
this type of thing is very rare particularly in this decade  and
if that be so  if japan can have a government formed by  man  by
many parties say three or four parties
""
israel has got a government recently and that government  is
formed by three parties
""
france in europe france  france has  uh got uh uh so in the
government  fre fre  french government you find that a communists or
socialists have have joined 
""
mitterand has got one  uh  ca  cabinet colleague  who
belongs to the radical party or that communist party
""
naturally if mitterand president mitterand can run his government
for a period of ten years  uh why  in  india cannot have a
government  consisting of  some  uh party uh national party national
party representing the national capital or some progressive elements  uh
uh in some some political parties like congress-i congress-s  or even
janata dal  with  some  uh radical members belonging to  uh
communist party or socialist party 
""
why we  ca  we can have a very beautiful government very
viable government very feasible government in our country
""
uh  and the government and the  and the composition of that
government can be  uh say uh some members belong to congress-i some
members belong to c pi-m some members belong to janata dal but all these
elements should be progressive 
""
so in that way we can form a government
""
what is your opinion
""
""
i as i think  uh that uh  the people of india are not
very used to this this kind of situation because uh  in the in the past
they had not uh  this kind of  i mean the  long past 
""
only  only one party  uh uh ruled the  our country 
one party 
""
but now it is the something different 
""
it is different means uh  because that is why i i say that 
because of we are not used to that  because  we are traditionally 
and  we think that  uh only if there is only one party then  uh
this  uh our country  will progress and if so many parties come
together  uh there is a ideological differences 
""
so naturally there will be clash and uhm  our democracy 
would wouldn't be able to survive
""
this is the this is the fear  this is the fear
""
i  i'm  not very much  uhm  i'm  not very much
 sure whether  uh this government is going to  survive   
uhm 
""
but uh  let us see  that is 
""
""
 uhm  
""
""
okay basu 
""
just think what i what i want to say 
""
first of all  the people of india  of the sixtees  or the
seventees  were not adequately exposed to  the west 
""
one of the reasons of indian  people's  exposure to the west
is undoubtedly television  and  the proximity between indian people and
the western people  uh which has been made through different types of
exchange
""
political exchange  uh tourist exchange tourist  exchange or
scholars exchange of scholars  or  ex  exchange of technocrats
""
so west is not  at present times  totally alien to us 
""
i think  there is a kind of close proximity between the  west
and the east 
""
naturally if the governments in those countries are viable 
first of all  if that  gover  if those governments in europe and
japan  and in  is  israel even in sri lanka  if those
governments are viable or can run smoothly  uh we also can have a
government of that type
""
when  the so called national party congress-i has disintegrated
 uh itself into different segments 
""
first of all congress-i has no power  of of what do you think
""
do you think that india is  basically has got one culture
""
or do you believe that india  has got an unity in diversity 
""
or if you  don't  believe it  don't  you think that
this is a concept which has been imposed by the british upon the indians 
""
india in the ancient past was not together 
""
india in the  even in the muslim period india is not  was not
 one was not a one country 
""
india became one  and united during this time of the british 
""
naturally british united india for the sake of the smooth
administration 
""
now we are running after the same  cultural  uh identity 
""
we are running after that that uh that same cultural identity
""
i i i  don't  say that india should be disintegrated
""
no not that
""
but cultural  uh i mean uh india has got a a heterogeneous
culture 
""
heterogeneous national entity  and for the sake of the interest
of all the communities belonging to different cultures  should  all
the communities should live together peacefully 
""
i mean it is a mutual interest  and congress-i cannot offer us
at present a  a a a cannot  ca  cannot present us a viable
government with the help of which it can  rule the whole of the country
""
""
what is your opinion  about the cultural entity of  our
nation 
""
 what's  your opinion what do you say
""
""
uhm now now see chakraborti  it is uh  the proverb goes
like that that uhm   too many cooks spoil the broth  
""
uh this is a  proverb and i think that  in  the present
situation  uh this  proverb uh  can go well 
""
but still  uhm though i  don't  stick to this kind of
proverb  because uh  yes i do agree with you 
""
sometimes  uhm the people  uh sorry people  of india
 they are  they belong to different communities  and they have
their separate cultures 
""
naturally  every nation has as india has a particular culture
japan has a particular culture british has a particular culture uh america
has got a american people have got their own culture
""
so  there is there is a cultural dissimilarity 
""
yeah yes  uh a separate culture means  uh within the country
 not so vast  uh the variations  the variety
""
 i'm  talking about the variety 
""
variety in indian culture is something  uh something which you
 don't  find in uh the western countries 
""
uh particularly in european
""
""
in what sense do you think that
""
""
 let's  suppose our we are bengalis  and uh  some
 there are some other states  where  some other  uh communities
live and there is a there is a cultural difference 
""
""
 don't  you think that it is the religion which can
unite  all the people belonging to different cultures 
""
""
no i  don't  think that  uhm because  religion
is something  uhm something which  uh should  uhm ennoble  the
mind of a person 
""
it it it goes like that but  you see in our india  religion
is something  which is  uh  manipulated in some  in order to
gain something 
""
you are putting some aspersions on religion  or those religious
 reli  religious leaders  who  uh uh who try  to use their
religion 
""
""
actually frankly speaking i  don't  believe in the 
in any kind of religion because  religion only  means when i say that i
am  a hindu and you are a muslim or he is a  uh buddhist like that that
 separates us us  that creates a wall between us 
""
only the  religion is uh the humanism 
""
humanism is our religion 
""
humanity  so  uh i think that only this should exist 
""
nothing else 
""
""
so  so you have come to the same point again that india is
a country in which  peoples of different cultures  people of uh
divergent  states  are living together should live together in the
years to come atleast in the  thousand years to come  for the interest
of all 
""
so how can you expect  that one particular political party say
congress-i should rule  or can rule  such a big country with vast 
uh number of   pa pa  i mean with a vast population  belonging
to different cultural entities
""
how can you think
""
i can't make out this thing
""
how can you think a political party like congress-i should rule 
for our country  because he is a single cook  and you  don't 
allow other cooks to work together 
""
i think if all the cooks are invited  and the taste will be
miscellaneous divergent  and as the pople  in india are of divergent
qualities  divergent traits and characters  these dishes  which will
be prepared by different cooks  will be palatable to all 
""
so you must  you too at  if i accept your  one word 
then also we can arrive at a conclusion that  we should have different
cooks in new delhi 
""
 what's  your opinion 
""
""
yes that is uh okay 
""
that is very right
""
that  uh in the present situation we  don't  have any
other alternative 
""
we must have to invite  uh so many cooks  uh so that uh our
country will  so that our country survives  and uh  it can prosper
""
""
uh it can prosper  uh otherwise uh our country is  uh you
know that it is going through a very  uh critical  time  and uh in
order to survive that we must join our our hands together 
""
otherwise uh we are going to face a bit difficult situation in
future  so
""
""
what type of difficult situation you anticipate
""
if this government fails in the months  to come say two or two
three months
""
after two months if this government or or say after three months if
this government fails  what type of  uh  what type of apprehensions
 what type of misgivings  you think  you anticipate 
""
""
i think that uh  in different parts of india  uh you
know that  uh about punjab and  uh assam 
""
""
oh it was also during that uh punjab problem was very much 
uh the living   dur  even during the time of  mrs indira gandhi
""
""
uh assam problem of assam  was also a very  burning problem
""
burning one during the time of mrs indira gandhi 
""
so  these problems are new to us  almost due due to
mishandling of some political leaders  uh these handlings  these
problems have transformed themselves into something ethnic problem 
""
so these problems are not new 
""
these problems are very common to us we are habituated
""
we are accustomed to these problems 
""
""
yes we are accustomed but uh see that if  uh uh punjab was
the first  then assam came 
""
and we know that uh there are uh suppressed  uh supressed 
anger  in uh different parts of india
""
we know that 
""
so that exact due to the  uh is the is that due to the lopsided
growth or uneven growth  of  uh uneven growth of particular regions at
the cost of others 
""
do you think so
""
""
i think uh that is very much true that sometimes  uh uh
that government  uh  just intentionally  they say that bihar is a
very  uh backward because the people of bihar are  very uh idle 
and uh very  uh  they  don't  work at all 
""
and so they uhm they uhm they uh  this state will not 
develop 
""
and if it happens like that  uh in the allocation of money
 if it happens like that then naturally the people of bihar  is going
to revolt against this type of uh  uh behaviour
""
""
so you think that mismanagement financial mismanagement
management financial mismanagement of the central government is one of their
important reasons  for  uh this lopsided uneven growth economic growth
in our country and one region is  uh being developed at the cost of other
regions
""
naturally the region which is lagging behind the regions  uh
like eastern regions
""
uh people living in the eastern regions  are lagging behind and
they are harbouring a kind of discontentment resulting in a kind of political
or ethnic crisis or  sometimes  in secessionist movements
