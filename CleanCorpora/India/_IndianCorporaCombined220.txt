as uh my guru is here i can breath more freely uhm  and he is going to record my talk also  well i selected this topic e l l english language learning uhm we have read and heard so much about e l t now  perhaps you may find it interesting and this is the last period uhm so i don't want you to be bored  so this is a new topic uhm e l l uhn not quite new  you know that second language learning and first language learning first language learning is at takes place uhm early in childhood and it is acquired you know  and second language learning takes place when we are adult so it is learned uhm so acquisition and learning while this cough uh  differentiation you know acquisition and learning  but here i'm putting before you a new outlook even second language learning is acquisition like first language acquisition because to acquire second language is  to take an additional language after having acquired one language  after having fully acquired one language  so that's why we call it second language  now what the difference between the two learner l one learner and l two learner ? now if we observe l one learner we can very easily see  that even their proficiency is at very low level  well they never hesitate using their first language for you can observe children uh you can observe uh around you so many you see persons even those persons who never go to school uhm especially children  now if we observe l two learner second language learner they are mostly adult because if they are not adults and if first language and second language uhm if a child acquires then even that second language is like first language uhm if the child acquire simultaneously  and as we are adult we are more cognitively mature  second language learners are more cognitively mature  they are have more metalinguistic awareness well this is word this is sentence this is phrase know metalinguistic awareness second language learner  and they have more word knowledge say this is the difference between uh l one learners and l two learners  now in learning l two we observe two psychological processes now one is simplification and another is over generalisation  now l two learner shall have this tendency of simplification well he while learning target language or second language  well he tries to simplify  well at all linguistic level like lexical level morphological level  even at syntactic level  and there are many jokes also  now here is one example uhm from morphological level   two chicken many bird  well plural form plural form well is missing here  many bird many birds you know  but many bird two chicken now this occurs at the morphological level simplification  well there is no need of birds because there is many birds is not needed because there is many  then uh you may take even the language of telegram  language of telegram now this is simplification at the syntactic level  well refresher course ends tomorrow i i don't know when ends you know laughter  but you may telegram send a telegram   refresher course ends tomorrow uhm home sunday or monday or  uhm whatever day it is  now here uh say articles are missing prepositions are missing well this is the example of simplification at the syntactic level then well there are many examples of over generalisation  uhn l two learners uhm uh over generalise it at all linguistic levels again  say instead of using specific verbs like fly  run well he uses the nuclear verb like go   now go is a nuclear verb you know it is cover term you see instead of using specific verbs like run fly travel  etcetera he uses go  well this is one example of over generalisation you see at the lexical level  now where the morphological level i think you know  wh when you assess you see uh the writing of your students you may come across many of them instead of went gone instead of you now went gone  instead of children child instead of  children you know child  so this occurs at the morphological level uhm over generalisation  so first thing we observe in this l two learning is l two learning is not linear or cumulative  we do not go on adding the structures one by one or we do not learn them all at a time  you see this l two learning is uh neither linear nor cumulative  but this is somewhat u shaped you know u shape learning now i will explain this uh unfortunately i don't have a piece of chalk and duster you know but uh i will try to explain  well in the beginning when learning is almost  mechanic mechanical say the right use of the  right use of plural suffix s or es   l two learner you see catches it  and in terms of accuracy in terms of accuracy well he  must be given hundred percent mark that is the beginning  but this learning is mechanic this learning is  mechanic mechanical he is accurate he learns mechanically as we say know parrot learning  so and then his level of accuracy falls down well he he begins to commit error  he begins to commit error  his level of accuracy falls down  and then again it rises this level rises so that's  why you know i said u shaped  u shape learning l two learning is u shape and even first language learning is also u shape  so first there is high level of accuracy and then low level then again high level of accuracy  there are three stages first stage high level second stage low level third stage again high level  here this u shaped learning strategy u shape learning strategy that l two learner uses while learning second language is worth considering seriously  unless we know how our students learn second language  no methods will be useful  we will never be successful  we will never be successful uhm let me tell you once again  well we should know them how they learn ? what strategies they use ? uh what are the processes that take place while learning l two ? and this is very important process uhm u shaped learning  now there are three stages let me repeat again first stage mechanical learning when we go on adding the structure  second stage second stage when accuracy falls down  now this takes place because once a structure is mechanically learn once a structure is mechanically learnt the whole system is again restructured  the whole system is again refined  uhm whatever language proficiency the second language learner has it is again disturbed when new information is added when new structure is learned  now the whole structure is you see renewed again  now this is the second stage that's why the learner  you see makes many mistakes  he commits many error  now third stage after restructuring the system again his accuracy level rises  he makes no mistakes  well he well his proficiency level also rises  so this u shape development is very important process in second language learning because it deals with the error that the learner makes  yes if we consider these errors then we can know our students or second language learner  but we teacher pay very little attention to our to our student to the error that they commit to the mistakes you know that they make while learning  now it is part of their on going process of learning second language  well making you see mistakes or committing error well it is part of the process of learning second language  and that's why we should take it very serious we as teacher and try to analyse the the error that they make and then judge or decide the level of proficiency uhm they they have achieved  now there are two kinds of error they make or two sets of errors they make  now first is interlingua error b b writing  interlingual error well they are interfrance error b b writing  and second intralingual intralingual error b b writing they are developmental error b b writing  now these errors interlingual error are mostly interfrance error our see first language interfrance interferes with the second language learning and uh we we find our student  transfering you see the the features of their first language to their second language  this we can identify very easily  now intralingual error these are the developmental error  they are part of the development of you see the student or the learner in second language  so here you know i say it is one word b b writing  it is part of the process of learning second language  now interlingual error are error because of our attitude you know behaviourist or what you call see even  structural i call bahaviourist b b writing or product  oriented b b writing  and this is process oriented  well here i have in my mind the teacher versus the researcher  now for me teacher is more important  now researcher may level it anything but we must be able to identify it among our student among the learner that they come to us  so we must be able to identify you see these interlingual error uhm which are the product of our view to language learning  our view uhm towards language learning if our view is product oriented we find these errors but if our view is process oriented  if we think that learning second language is a process you see then  the errors are intralingual error  so this i leave to the teacher  now here one important thing must be noted at every stage of learning the second language learner at every stage of learning the second language learner has his own language which is called interlanguage b b writing interlanguage  and this interlanguage lies somewhere between first language and second language  but it is the learners language  it is the learners language at every stage the learner you see arrives at his own language and that is his interlanguage  it is always under fluctuation changing because it is  part of the process it is part of the process  now this interlanguage theory you see developed in about nineteen sixty-nine well is very important  now it is nothing but an interium grammar it is nothing but an interium grammar that the second language learner develops or l two learner develops on his way to target language on his way to when going towards on his way to target language it is an interium grammar  now it is in itself a system distinct from l one and l two first language and second language  and this is the language that we as teachers first understand  if we succeed in understanding this interlanguage of the learner  yes we will be a success well in what you say teaching the language and they will be success in learning the language   ou our own strategy of presenting our material asking them to do some task you see our way of guiding them will depend upon our knowledge of this interlanguage of the second language learner  now here i don't say we fail we i don't say we fail  but well we we ignore to to some extent well we we take liberty to to some extent and here you see what i say we go away from our student  if we are language teacher we must make our best to identify this interlanguage  at what stage the process of learning the second language learning is now you see if a teacher knows this he knows his student  he knows the process  he will be able to guide and he is the best teacher  uhm well in in my opinion a teacher knowing all the methods of teaching is not a good teacher laughter uh uh the teacher one who knows his student well one who knows his learners well is the good teacher  then only you will be able to guide  if now there are uh many level given to this  interlanguage uhm i don't you see waste your time on it  but interlanguage is very curious you see how a a learner reaches that stage of interlanguage uhm is very interesting to know  well this process takes place in a certain sequence in a certain order and this sequence this order well you may call acquisition order language acquisition order or you may say developmental sequence b b writing developmental sequence  well this is psychological process and only researcher can know this uhm how how it takes place  well we we teacher can judge it only by the results that we get from the student uhm but a good researcher uhm knows very well  how this process takes place process of forming ones own interlanguage  but this is not uhm formed by mechanical learning  now this is formed by following this acquisition order  or developmental sequence  you see developmental sequence now uh i will mention two  well uh project you see undertaken and also completed  one was on interrogative and another was on negative
