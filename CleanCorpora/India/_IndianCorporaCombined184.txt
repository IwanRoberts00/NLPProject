maharashtra  shanti kumar now  looses out  to suresh kumar  but a tightly packed maharashtra defence  is quite strong in that department  everesto cardoz the captain playing in the defence today this is how kerala progressed to the final  in the quarter-final league they drew madhya-pradesh zero-zero  then beat uttar-pradesh four-zero  then beat the bengal three-one andhra_pradesh three-zero  and in the semi-final they got past goa by four goals to three  vijayan now in possession for kerala  jarcinto there allowed the ball to run over the sidelines teams yet to settle down here  trying to find openings   here's jarcinto de silva to akeel ansari  arif ansari now  to shanti kumar who doesn't trap it neatly  santosh now for kerala  that is back-heel there  taken by the maharashtra player  manoj bhatt  to godfrey pereira  pereira cutting in on the right flank  being tackled and brought down  a good spot smarting up a women's spectator  here in the stadium this afternoon  and uh a free-kick for maharashtra  manoj bhatt the linkman to take the kick  four players maharashtra players inside the box  the ball deflecting off vijayan and going out  for a   it's going to be another free-kick  or rather a kick being awarded to kerala  these teams have met nine times earlier in this  championship and it's been kerala who have won five times the other matches ending in draws  some excitement at the kerala half   that's a shot at the kerala bench  their coach k k gopalakrishnan was a member of the kerala team  played in 1966  kerala with the ball now  rasheed  long ball to hashim  santosh now in possession  maharashtra defence regrouping very well a good ball here for harshan  inside the penalty area  but there're two defenders there to take care of harshan everesto cardoz and jarcinto de silva  and uh this is the progress chart of maharashtra to the final in the quarter-final league they drew karnataka one-all beat punjab one-zero then beat assam four-one and in the final quarter-final league beat goa one-zero  in the semi-final they got past a fancied bengal by one goal to nil a goal scored by shanti kumar  rasheed now for kerala  chip into the penalty area there headed out by everesto cardoz  and after about uh fifteen minutes of play come in baldev sachdeva  so the play about to resume now after a slight hold-up  goalkeeper mohammad kadir and everesto cardoz going for that ball  and in the clash cardoz had fallen down and now the  game resumes again  kerala now building up an attack through the right flank  harshan going for that ball  but doesn't control it well it goes off a defender  ashok nair and it's going to be a corner-kick for kerala about two thirty-two minutes of play gone in the first half  neither team have scored yet  kerala is better as far as attacks are concerned  that uh kick hitting ashok nair and it's  going to be a free-kick for kerala  a good chance here for kerala to open the score  that was a good intelligent kick taken there by jiju jacob but equally well deflected by manoj bhatt for a corner  yet another one for kerala  the goalkeeper kadir doesn't gathered that one  but maharashtra keep possession akeel ansari  santosh now for kerala  trying to put through vijayan there  ball running loose  to sabu  he tries a left-footer from around thirty yards a rather weak shot  nothing much here for the crowd to enthuse  only mild flutter was provided by hashim in the eighteenth minute  a good ball put through by jiju which found him  with only the goalkeeper to beat and he shot wide  now here's a chance for maharashtra godfrey pereira  centring that one  but way over the goalline  kerala entering the final of the santosh trophy for the forth consecutive time  three times runners-up from nineteen eighty-eight onwards  and the crowd here are hoping that it would be forth time lucky for kerala  kerala in possession now  ball there for vijayan  harshan in control here  good chance and he puts it over the goal  both the maharashtra defenders everesto cardoz and jarcinto  didn't mark him there and harshan there you see him jersey number eleven  had a good chance  a snap move by kerala there harshan all by himself  with the defenders trying to regroup  he tackled the ball well but then his left-footer sailing over the bar  so yet another chance going abegging as far as kerala is concerned  they have done most of this attacking in this match so far  now everesto cardoz the maharashtra captain who played for india in the nehru gold cup giving it to shanti kumar  ball taken away by vijayan  jarcinto de silva now for maharashtra  to manoj bhatt  to arif ansari good ball down the right flank  and the kerala defence quite tight there  marking the maharashtra player and uh  they earn a free-kick  hamid the stopper-back  looking for an unmarked player  headed out by jarcinto  harshan being put through on the right flank  ball again deflecting off the maharashtra wall  suresh kumar now for kerala  hashim tightly marked  cardoz with a clearance  arif ansari  trying to put through godfrey pereira there   there's jiju jacob  tall kerala defender who also played the last  year's final of the santosh trophy against goa  the lone victory for kerala in the santosh trophy came in nineteen seventy-three one word home turf in ernakulam  when they beat railways three-two in the final  maharashtra on the other hand twice winners of the santosh trophy in nineteen fifty-four and nineteen sixty-three  throw-in for kerala  hashim there being tightly marked   that's another throw-in  jiju jacob  now shanti kumar  ball coming to sabu  vijayan there trying to put through hashim  but his chip there a little too long for hashim  and kadir in possession for maharashtra  everesto cardoz  trying to inspire his forward line  done very little today  again a rather aimless pass   we've seen very few attacks by the maharashtra forwards today  they haven't combined well  and there have been very little understanding between the half line and the forward line  vijayan now  with fallen back  trying to put through harshan there's the tall everesto with a header  ball coming to jiju jacob  the pace of the game considerably slackened here   it's a quite hot afternoon  temperature in the mid-thirties  and it certainly would be energy sapping here for the  players  the first half slowly coming to an end  neither team have scored yet  kerala now trying to build up a move through the right flank  suresh kumar there up  ball cleared  again a mispass comes to shanti kumar   who'll be switching over from mahindras to mohun bagan next season  akeel ansari now being dispossessed  santosh  to rasheed  trying to find hashim on the right flank  very few passes here finding the intended player  shanti kumar for maharashtra  to everesto cardoz  vijayan tackling him there from behind  free-kick for maharashtra  godfrey pereira  trying to wield his way through  to shanti kumar  manoj bhatt  cleared out by the kerala defence  crowd here certainly gone quiet  and that's a throw-in none of the maharashtra forwards there   it's going to be a goal-kick for kerala  the first half coming to a close  neither team have scored yet  with less than five minutes of play left  rasheed  ball for harshan  and that improper charge there  the free-kick for maharashtra  jarcinto de de silva the stopper-back  vijay thapa has takes a tumble there  comes to joseph  the kerala left wing back  hamid now  harshan  to jiju jacob  the overlapping defender for kerala  and his pass there misdirected  another kerala move comes to nought  a quick counterattack here from maharashtra  arif ansari  but keeps hold of the ball a little too long there  akeel ansari now  cardoz again an aimless pass  kerala gained possession  suresh kumar  ball again running loose here  comes to the goalkeeper  rasheed for kerala  a long ball trying to find hashim   there's jarcinto with that header  harshan now with the ball  good chance for vijayan  takes a shot from just outside the penalty box a left-footer which goes out  vijayan the captain of the kerala team also member of the kerala police team which won the federation cup this year  and a wayward kick taken there by goalkeeper kadir sends it  over the sideline  kerala keep possession  hamid  long ball there for santosh   there's jarcinto handling that situation very well comes to godfrey pereira  and maharashtra earn a free-kick  crowd has come here with banners and drums  quite a boisterous crowd  referee samil awarding that free-kick to maharashtra  just inside the kerala half  vijay thapa the vice-captain to take the kick  jiju the taller player there getting the better of that duel kerala in possession jiju jacob overlapping  cutting in there very well  and a good ball there for hashim a good chance for kerala  and hashim putting it over the net he had only to beat the goalkeeper there  very intelligent play there by jiju jacob  cut in very well
