no it's quite far it is like these things and all they suburb suburb  suburb  but they are connected  yeah buses of course we have a lot of bus  transport is a one word  but here mysore is also okay but hyderabad is bad in madras you have buses for ladies and  yeah we have ladies bus separate yeah we don't have buses for male who travels in these  only ladies only ladies usually you have   only the driver and conductor laughter  and they enjoy laughter specially in college specials and all no yeah these conductors they have kind of  uh competition who will go for the ladies  yeah  only college and they have a special organisation also no   a few words  yeah yeah college students students yeah we have they organise   yeah we have  like these buses are regular or very regular very regular i know ever since like when i was studying we had this specials at eight o'clock and at one forty they stand wait outside our college to pick us up almost like a college bus special bus for us  that is according to the college times they  college time  during exams also they will have like that yeah suppose exams but they have the other buses also no yeah  then  yeah  that you have  madras is known for that you know yeah yeah  ttb service very best service they have  yeah yeah  and every year in the beginning of the year we invite all the the crew no yeah like uh outside one forty when college gets over around thirteen to fourteen buses to different parts of the city  uhm will be standing outside the college  yeah   uhm  specially our college girl are we give uh a very good reason to this people i mean we give them a party and we one or two words  in your college also  even in our college  it is just  oh the wcc they had a one word drivers and the  pbc crew and the principal so that service is not regular that it has once one or two i think  but yeah there are so many bus standing outside and then you know it is fun  sometimes the bus are almost empty no like yeah  the one word  and like that one we had a bus in adiyar we have a bus   yeah  and it is not necessary no you can have the same bus which passes through adiyar to tirvani but we have to see almost empty   same bus  but anyway it is very comfortable oh yeah  and also in buses here in mysore also  we have the first half for men and the second half for women hyderabad also it is like that  oh yeah   even in hyderabad  now they have uh introduced before it wasn't like that  uhm uhm and still there is a problem people means they come and sit on the ladies seat and they won't they get up  get up  we have a lot of quarrel  uhm uhm   get up  that they won't do never they will do in madras you know  even if they sit they'll get up yeah and when they now they have but one thing we have got used to it i think only then recently some two months back i think  uhm uhm and in madras suppose the men are sitting in the ladies seat ladies have to go stand next to them they will get up  they'll get up but the ladies who are sitting in the men's seat and they won't get up they won't get up laughter  so the men must be standing but these people they  they get irritated you know they get irritated the other seats are only for men then yeah this half for women this half for men oh that's  uhm what about children ?  laughter  it is as if very big bus no no but then where will they sit  anywhere anywhere they can sit anywhere  but this system is better no one half of course yes that is yeah because then the in madras what happens standing uh   that place is common   it's there but it's common no  so  it's not there  uhm yes that really is a problem  the buses will be crowded  yeah very crowded full we can't in a crowded  how do you like mysore ?
