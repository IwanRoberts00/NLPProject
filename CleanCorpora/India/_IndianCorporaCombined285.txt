 recording broken  the journey was by itself not attracting much attention seem to take longer than usual at last i was at the door step and on entering the house first thing that i learnt was that my cousins had not arrived  suddenly the journey that i had just completed appeared to be much more troublesome than what it actually was  every part of my body began complaining loud and clear not being much interested in the delicious food prepared my by by my aunt i slept hoping that this brother of mine would wake would wake me up in the morning  the dawn passed and so did the noon and the sun had  began begun to set the phone bell rang having grown tired of waiting and having cursed him for what would be enough for a life time to bear i was convinced that the phone carried a message saying we would be arriving on twenty-sixth  but no my spirits were once again reaching sky high when i heard that raju had rung from the pu pune  railway station itself and in no more than half an hour there we were all beholding this great man  he was indeed given a rousing welcome under my leadership  after having sufficiently aroused the emotion of other family members i was not much surprised to note that his knowledge about this whole affair  was not as much compared to mine  trying to defend ourselves of this adventure or misadventure  that was to follow bearing the brunt of all the criticism which was whole heartedly poured on us we realised that it was just a couple of  hours before the departure of the jhelum  jhelum did depart sharp at five thirty from pune as scheduled  and the two of us sitting facing each other deeply  engaged in studying the railway time table where we were to go and how the train sped fast and this was one of my first journey  in a vestibule train which had an attached pantry car and the sun  was preparing to make way for the bright star of the night  we decided to have our dinner courtesy indian railway  hardly a few hours passed we thought of stroll through the compartment and believe me what a sight it was with the new considerations to our ages there was enough happenings around that made us a little uneasy  for a moment there seem to be a variety of different cinemas  being screened all around when the noise of food being served made us rush back to our seat  the food was interesting not delicious as such  my cousin had never ventured to call anything edible bad  sleep thrust in with a mixed feelings having decided to make all the purchases that were to be done at pune we reached delhi  the train was to halt there for three hours  the experience in travelling in a vestibule train with an attached pantry car the unknown destination and happiness or hardship that were to be part of the journey  both my cousin and myself are always used to sound sleep  in the night immaterial of the time place etcetera  when the dawn broke we were amidst what was known as the heart of india  we were travelling through the terrain of chambal valley  the numerous hillocks with tricky passages in between we believed were the most apt for hideout  admittedly many had discovered this fact much before us  the vast expanse of such similar pattern did indeed put up a scenery quite unforgettable  suddenly this gave a an instinct to my  cousin's mind why not plan the return journey  we were to reach delhi by eight p m and the train was to halt there for full three hours  if the journey through central india is so beautiful how would it be to return along the west coast  brilliant idea indeed and the railway time table was once again searched  before all this was completed we reached jhansi station  on the adjacent platform there was something really extraordinary  a beautiful blue and yellow colour train the engine shaped like an aeroplane   o yes it was indeed the two thousand one up  shatabdi express the fastest train in india  and as though to remind us all about the journey we had a glimpse of the derailed bogies of the unfortunate karnataka express little further  all this time the pantry car had kept us happy and satisfied  as if to prove the station master right when he writes below the time table in station trains are liable to gain or lose time  jhelum express screeched into the new delhi station only three and half hours late  off we were hunting for the reservation counter only to be enlightened by the vendor that the counter in the station closed by five thirty p m  all our hopes were dashed  we had expected a twenty-four hour booking counter at new delhi station  we were to do a lot of purchases and this was now hampered and transferred to jammu tavi  we had not opted for the pantry car dinner in anticipation of the food at new delhi  midnight vendor and some fruitwalas made our appetite full  the halt was cut down by an hour and a half  and by one in the morning we started advancing further north  the crowd in the train was gradually growing less in number  with large group detraining at various stops  the last of our companions got down at jallandhar leaving only two of us from the original pack  the pantry car too was disconnected at delhi and when we woke up in the morning my goodness what a sight it was with green lustrious inviting plains of punjab   far as far as the eyes could see spread over from one horizon to the other the vast stretch of land as though somebody had levelled it totally green thick with vegetation with a lot of streams running in between  oh what a place it was  as the arrival time at the jammu tavi station neared we were both anticipating to watch the foot hills of himalaya  after chhole parathe at pathankot the train did come to a halt on a platform which borne the name jammu tavi   but where were the hills ? sense dawned that they were to begin further north  trapped by a local commission agent we were about to reside in a lodge when yet another person showed us a bus standing right in front of us which was bound to shrinagar  it has the name board in urdu  thanking the second one heartedly we were in the bus and the final leg of the journey had begun  in sheer contrast to all that we had seen till now this part was unique the hills for which we had been longing for so long were right in front of us  and our bus began its quest towards shrinagar about two hundred and forty-eight kilometres drive roughly five hours by our calculation the bus began to turn right left right and i lost count at the number of turns  there was a range of mountains in front of us and slowly the bus began to scale its height and just as the last curve took us to the upper most point of it and there was yet another range of mountains taller than that  of the previous one  at the end of it again there was yet another range it was as if the himalayas were unfolding themselves layer by layer and you never knew what was beyond that curve  there was no let up and we kept on climbing the mountain that were seeming sky high now began appearing reasonable and as night approached we reached baltal  just as we were lamenting that we would be deprived of the sight of remaining journey in darkness the driver announced that the bus was to halt overnight at baltal and begin the quest early next morning  we were all the more overjoyed and slept in the hotel  the next morning as the mountains continued to show their great might and energy with roaring of streams in the valley getting louder around each curve and streams themselves becoming smaller in size the bus then was halted in a queue and a curious stroll gave us the glimpse of the one of the great engineering marvels of our nation the jawaharlal nehru tunnel the longest of its kind and appropriately it was insc it was inscribed   may your life be as long as this tunnel  photography was prohibited and the journey through this twenty-six kilometre long tunnel brought us out in front of another amazing array of mountains each of them trying to make the other appear smaller  the clouds were almost with us now and we did still keep climbing higher and higher  it was almost began to seem endless  i had in my school days seen ooty but by now we must have travelled the road to ooty say about ten times  almost every inch of these mountains had tall trees trying to out do the mountains in reaching the sky  following this was again a long stretch of plain road  impossible we had thought that there being such a long stretch of plain land after this climb but then it was the kashmir valley  admiring beautiful nature we never realised that our bus by now was standing in the compound of the tourist reception centre at shrinagar oh god what a journey it had been not a bit of this kind had ever occurred to us  no not even in the wildest of our dreams  from there we proceeded straight to the youth hostel camping grounds  thus if you look into the journey itself a lot of things do happen that teach us lessons in the philosophy practicability etcetera only it needs a willful learner
