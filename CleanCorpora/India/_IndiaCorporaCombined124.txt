this is all india radio  taking sides in our national programme tonight we bring you a discussion on media attitudes in the context of privatisation of the electronic media  since only the very rich can afford these private channels will the content of their programme reflect their bias and the bias of the advertisers  the programmes be aimed only at those who can afford them  all those who run these channels be persuaded to aim them at the poor and the backward  we view the electronic media as an instrument of social and economic upliftment  in short will the social attitude and economic compulsions of the fourth estate force them as it has in the past to take sides taking part in the discussion are kuldeep nayyar the emminent  coloumnist madhu trehan executive producer news track p c chatterji former director general all india radio and b g verghese  the noted columnist who also moderates the discussion  we are discussing this evening uh social attitudes on the part of the media uh broadcast print and the other  but the very main point to start with the is the discussion that has been initiated uh rising out of the congress manifesto which suggest the need for privatisation uh broadcasting or atleast some competitive challenge through public  co-operation  will this really change broadcasting ? will the content of programmes undergo any change ? and will the viewers and listeners get something more  different from what they get now ? uh madhu what do you think ?  first first of all i think the government has to make its position clear  nothing has been clarified by the minister about what exactly they are planning to do  uh there is a lot of confusion and if this is any indication for what the new channel is going to be like i don't think there will be much opening up  first of all they have to take a de  decision on whether they are going to clear doordarshan  because if they do open up a second channel as it should be  as one one word a free channel then who would watch  doordarshan  so they have to take a very gutsy decision  we are two words doordarshan to open up a channel i don't know if any government do have the guts to do that in india today i a few words suggestion that the government channel state channel existing channel be extinguished   prasar bharati will take over that will be there will be a transformation as far as all india radio and doordarshan are concerned  and then the other will be a private or competitive channel or channels  but who will watch it ? who will watch uh doordarshan when you have a private channel to compete ? well let's ask kuldeep and then they will have to improve  actually the analysis is if doordarshan is just like what it is today nobody will switch it on  but uh if there is a private uh channel which is producing a better programme naturally doordarshan will have to  produce better or not to see it  but george i don't know my feeling is ki  this whole thing is being confused purposely  i think the government does not want to impliment any  prasar bharati bill  and the whole thing  a few words   i'm sorry i'm sorry it's a mess now  so it the whole thing has been introduced just to delay  postpone things i don't think the government is serious about giving  control of this media in the hands of independent people uh though government control still states but state government is not willing to  part ways with that kind of authority well let us presume that the idea is to go ahead  with the prasar bharati act though it's been very slow  uh in the circumstances then how should we proceed  now as a former director general of all india radio or broadcasting what would you say  well the first thing that government has to do is to invite legislation to set up its body an independent body which is going to assign frequently   it's not the government that has it in a in few countries it is an independent body that does it  the next thing is to draw up the sort of priorities that you want of the alternative programmes that you think to   of continuing  yes it is  if the only alternative that you can think of is commercial  then probably uh uhm there may be trouble but i think it's  a mistake to suppose madhu as you as i think you were making  mainly that if uh a private channel comes or a commercial channel nobody will watch doordarshan  one word or listen to all india radio  fact is that people thought that would happen to the b b c it didn't the b b c still does mm control a vast section of the audience so what's the loss  but they still do and we are still setting the standard for  for what ought to be insat doing  now the question is on what basis do we allot channels ? but the the basic question is why count and change ? what do you want broadcasting to do in terms of what it is now and what it might be ? and what is the kind of change that you would envy in terms of the new order  yes which we are thinking of uh a second channel  again in the hands of the people who are going to compete uh who are going to attract more listeners and viewers on the basis of  showing may be some films or programmes which is is really in that consumerism  now my feeling is ke the purpose is partly lost  consumerism would be end of what middle classes you say yes definitely for example the ho how do we ensure in this country that uh this vast country where the people have certain other kind of ethos  how do we appeal to them ? because if this second channel comes and it is competitive  as it should be  and if it is in the hands of some people who can afford it  then there aim would be to one word   that's right  they're not very who are going to be worried about uh you can do it do it some programmes for the uplift of the people i think they may need more than two channels  maybe third channel or may be fourth channel  some channel given to the university some ch   channel given to the people  because the purpose i have in view is of course one view is  of course entertainment one word  but other way i think is we must do something for the uplift of the people  use the tv use the whatever this medium is for uh fighting some prejudices  right like that well let's ask madhu here well i think what kind of content would you have if you were to have  this opportunity ? i think uh i disaggre with ku  kuldeep in that but i don't think there is a hard line between uh social purpose uplift of the people and entertainment  i think that had been the problem with doordarshan   that it catagorised so strictly that either it's cheap vulgar entertainment or it is boring programmes for education which is so boring that nobody in the right mind can watch  i think that what has to be done is that there has to be a merger of the two an infertainment  and up uplift of people will come from people who want to watch programmes which is so interesting that they don't know whether they are being educated and their prejudices are being broken down  things like that like uh uh the tragedy that took place in sindhu recently where lower caste people have been uh butchered and put in gunny bags  i don't think that kind of film would be possible if an emotional beautiful film was made which made the higher caste people aware of the feelings and made the the lower caste mess anonymous to them i think the large part of it is the anonimity  so i think that all this i think that just making money making revenues is looked down upon  i don't think that so i think that making re   revenue should be uh tied-up with the fact that you know that you can make money by doing things that will move people right but we hear uh you are really talking about uh news  and uh daily affairs current affairs  what about extention education other things that are not really marketable ? where would the money come from and what would it cost to put up such a channel such a network ? because there is no scope in just of the metro or the larger cities or the country as a whole and we talk of people which are these people that we are talking about ? where do they live ? what is their level of understanding ? what language do they understand ?  is it is it english or is it all our fourteen schedule languages and numerous other unscheduled and tribal languages  then don't you know that it is a major issue because what you are talking about the languages  if there is any say four or five privatisation is concerned if  they  again time and again we have dealt with this problem and   uhm and on radio i think you've you have got to do it  uhm  but you have also to be interested in going outside the framework of all india radio and and doordarshan how would you address this problem which people what caste  how do you one word  you see uh a programme to uh not very well up and what the cost would be on television but i know that there would be some thing like ten times  uh atleast ten times if not for uh for uh a one word  worth in capital and then the exenditure but take a small thing like one word radio  that is people are they are interested in each other they have common problem they come and participate they discuss their problem  then they go ahead and try to do something better  now uh i mean the question is where does the money come from ? well i think we really have to go out into the market to see where the money is and where it comes from  this opposition that people are not interested in uh a in anything but making money  uh i think it's a mistake  there are any number of trust they're running hospitals   they're doing various other things  if the said uh uh potential in radio and television  i'm sure they will come forward now you told us about look up station video or radio  even otherwise   we're talking about four five six crores  not more than that  but you know i'm talking of national hook-ups  when we're talking of hundreds of crores   kuldeep where do you think uh uh our options lie ? because broadcasting has been very much talked down in the sense  we've national broadcasting then regional broadcasting local broadcasting in the sense is yet to come the communities  now if you think of starting from the bottom then it becomes managable as you have said you have a hospital or you have a school or university people want to spend that because the career teaching is that it needs it and  it's useful  our teacher talking about current affairs talk  talking about you know since it is a very high level  then one is really talking about films that may be a of of  of uh interest to high guard people to well educated people and to very weak  otherwise we're talking to farmers simple people in their language  how would they manage this ? this is the question i'll ask to ask to kuldeep and madhu you also because this is really were the boiling butter comes in  i think the idea of a local station is a very good idea i think it's been tried abroad  uh and uh i think while madhu was commenting on my uh  vocation that i one word counter view i one word i think mr madhu was missing one side of it and that is what i want to answer  and it is take for example the mandal commission  report  how many people really explained what it meant  of course our tv picked up the stories that little boys were killed the boys were that but this look here this is wrong with the hindu society  that here is a society which has not treated human beings as human being for thousands of years  maybe this was the wrong idea to be the way it was done but was it exploited if these now stations are there  maybe these were like small kinds of uh outlets  maybe these are the places where we can drop again this thing because these are the people from below  these are the people at the grass roots and help them to overcome their prejudices kuldeep i wanted to button there if i may and also doing one or two words what madhu was speaking in a programme of that kind what is happening to people in different parts of india i think uh the important thing is not that you tell people who know about themselves but you tell others in different parts of the country that look this is how people are living in a certain part the network would be important and i think uh madhu where i very much agree with you  there is enormous interest of people in other people  we know next to nothing but so many extremely interesting groups in our country and i think television could and radio could help the broadcast but can we do that ? unless there is some kind of a right unless there is some kind of break up unless there is some vague one word nothing alse can work  in that way kuldeep is one thing that nobody can disagree with the regional station i think that is the way that that india should go because with that many languages i think it'll be crucial if we give uh local stations atleast a certain amount of  hours before the before the national hook-up   one or to words  i think we're talking about explaining to people about why something like mandal took place about the vote bank  i think that's their patronising  i think that i don't think we have to explain  i think what we have to do is to bring whatever is happening  to them and deal and and show that this is not this a channel  this is a person this is human being this is what's  happening  and i think i trust our people one word indians  wherever we live in india that they will respond that they will feel that yes this is the child who had been hurt and this is the woman that had been raped this is the man that has suffered injustice  and i think people will really respond when we when we remove the anonimity that we have of each other instead of the formality and the distances  which is something that our electronic media has done and when we see constantly you see on programmes people are fake they are artificial nobody talks like that they normally do in their life even the language is is not colloquial
