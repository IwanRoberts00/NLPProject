so today we do a lesson about mahatma gandhi who was a humanitarian okay  mahatma gandhi the father of the nation was the first great leader who not only fired the consciousness of the masses for independence but also boldly let the struggle for freedom against the british in india  and we know that mahatma gandhi's weapon for freedom was ahimsa   ahimsa  okay  he provided a moral foundation to indian politics and laid great stress on the spirit of fearlessness  his autobiography the story of my experiment with truth is a classic of our time  so he book he wrote many books  one of them was the story of my experiment with truth   and the chapter which we are doing today is from the last chapter of this autobiography of his  in this extract we see the firm faith of mahatma gandhi in truth and ahimsa  to realise them one must have self-purification in mind  word and deed  the style is simple and direct and sets the readers thinking  noise  it is not without a range that i have to take leave of the reader and why does he say he has to take leave of the reader ? because it is the last chapter okay don't answer chorus because it is the last last chapter of his autobiography okay  last  so he says that it causes great pain to him that he is taking leave of the reader  i had set a high value on my experiment and i do not know whether i've been able to do justice to them  i can only say that i have spared no pains to give a faithful narrative  so he says that he has i have set high value to my experiment he has attached great importance   great importance  he has attached great ipmortance to his experiments with   truth okay  truth  and he is not sure whether he is able to do  justice to those experiments with truth okay   justice to  treat them with fullness and clarity justice  to treat them with fullness and clarity  so that every one who reads the book will understand what he is  writing about  i can say that i have spared no pains to give a faithful narrative  that he's done all that he can do to give  the account of truth that appeared to him in the right way as it appeared to him  to describe truth as it has appeared to me and in the exact manner in which i have arrived at has been his ceaseless effort  so what has been a ceaseless effort ? to speak out the truth and come on yes ? to describe truth as as it has appeared to him and in the exact manner in which he has arrived at his conclusion okay so his ceaseless effort was to ar to describe truth as it appeared to him and in which way he arrived at truth okay  this exercise has given me inaffable mental peace because it has been my fond hope that it might bring faith in truth and  ahimsa to the waverers  and he says this exercise of reproducing truth as he  felt about it as he arrived at truth has given him inaffable mental peace undescribable mental peace  and why does he say ? he says it has given him inaffable mental peace because he has always cherished he has always hope that those who work against  ahimsa would follow the path of ahimsa  once they read the book  okay  so it has it was always his desire his cherished desire that what was his cherished desire ? yes ? after reading the book uh or a everything which is  the one who were  the one who were waverers and they don't know about truth and ahimsa haan that uh  it might bring the waverers uh to that  haan  in the principle of ahimsa  those who were doubtful about the principle of ahimsa  will start following it  my uniform experience convinces me that there is no other god  than truth  so he says that there is only one god and that is  truth   truth  and he does not vary in that  okay he is definite about it that there is only one god and that is  truth   truth  and if every page of this chapter does not proclaim to the reader that the only means for the realisation of truth is ahimsa  i shall deem all my labour in writing these chapters to have been in vain  so he says that first of all he is convinced that there is only one god and that is truth   truth  and another thing he says that in every chapter of the book which book please ? my experiment with truth his experiment with truth okay  in every chapter of his book he has tried to explain that if you want to realise truth if you want to reach to the goal of truth you have to follow the path of ahimsa     ahimsa  okay  i shall deem all my labour in writing these chapters have been  in vain and he says that in every chapter he has tried to explain  that the only means of realisation of truth is ahimsa    ahimsa  and if people do not understand it then his writing  that book and explaining about the principle of ahimsa  is all in vain is futile is useless   in vain  okay  so what is gandhiji's uniform experience convince him ?  gandhiji's uniform experience convinced him that there is only one god and that is truth okay  and how uh what does he say that the only means to realise truth is what ?  ahimsa   ahimsa  the only means to realise truth is ahimsa   ahimsa  okay  and even though my efforts in this belief may prove fruitless let the leader re readers know that the vehicle and not the great principle is at fault  so he says that i he wants to make himself very clear that even after reading the chapters of the book if people still have doubt about the great principle of ahimsa  then they are wrong  it is he who is writing the book may be he is not very clear in his writing and that is why people have the doubt about ahimsa   so he that is the vehicle he himself who is writing the book  he himself is wrong somewhere and not the principle of   ahimsa   ahimsa  after all however sincere my strivings after  ahimsa may have been they have been imperfect and  inadequate and why he says may be he is wrong ? why does he say that may be he is not exactly correct in explaining about ahimsa and writing about ahimsa  ? yes ? because his principle of ahimsa is very  uh complex and it can not be described in uh simple words yes  it is very difficult to describe such a great principle as   ahimsa  and he says that whatever he has seen may not be fully the full of ahimsa  everything of ahimsa  so he said he has tried his level best to describe   ahimsa  the fleeting glimpses therefore that i've been able to have of truth can hardly convey an idea of the indescribable lustre of truth a million times more intense than that of the sun we daily see with our eyes  and what does he say that he only has fleeting glimpses that is vanishing views  okay something which passes off within a minute okay  and he says that it is very difficult to explain  truth whose radiance is million times more than that of the   sun okay   sun  so the brightness of truth is much more than the brightness of the sun   sun  in fact what i have caught is only the plain faintest glimmer of the mighty efflugence  and he says that the radiance the lustre of truth is so  great is so wide that he has only caught the faintest glimmer   faintest glimmer  the dim fading light of truth he's got  and it passes off   but this but this much i can say with assurance as a result of all my experiment that a perfect vision of truth can only follow a complete realisation of ahimsa  so one more thing he says is that if you want to realise truth to the fullest if you want to see truth at its very best then you have to follow the path of ahimsa   ahimsa  know what ahimsa is ? okay follow the principle of ahimsa  only then you can have the full perfect vision of  truth okay   truth  so how can you have a complete vision or perfect vision of truth ? yes pinky ? we can have perfect vision of truth by realising of  ahimsa  only if you realise ahimsa you can have the perfect vision of truth and how what is the power of truth he has described ? how has gandhiji described truth ? yes ketan ? like an one word  say it in complete  power of truth is  haan the power of truth  it is very powerful it is very powerful it is uh said that it is ? million times more than that of the sun million times more than that of the sun  okay the radiance of truth is million times more than that of the sun   sun  to see the universal and all pervading spirit of truth face to face one must be able to love the meanest of creation as oneself and if gandhiji says that if you want to practice  ahimsa practice ahimsa which is found everywhere the to practice truth which is there uh you have to practice ahimsa  if you want to realise truth you have to practice  ahimsa and the most important thing is you have to love  all living creatures and the lowlest uh   the lowest of creation you should love as you love   yourself okay   creatures   yourself  so to see the universal and all pervading spirit of truth face to face one must be able to love the meanest of creation as oneself  so one first of all one has to identify oneself with all  living creatures and love the lowest of god's creation and a man who aspires after that and a man who  speak truth okay who speak truth cannot afford to keep out of any field of life   one word  so a man who is a seeker of truth has to be attached to any field of life in which he is involved  that is why my devotion of truth has drawn me into the field of politics and i can say without the slightest hesitation and yet in all humility that those who say that religion has nothing to do with politics do not know what religion means  okay so he says that his devotion to truth he was a seeker of truth always in life  and because he was a seeker of truth he was drawn to the field of politics  he wanted to make politics free from violence and that is why he entered politics  okay so he says politics also should be free from violence because a seeker of truth he has to follow the path of ahimsa  ahimsa   ahimsa  correct a seeker of truth has to follow the path of ahimsa    ahimsa  and so he says that is why he had enter politics   cough  identification with eveything that live is impossible  without self-purification  and he says first of all he says that you have to identify yourself with all living creatures  all creation of god god   god  you have to identify yourself amongst all creations of   god   god  and he says if you want to identify yourself with all creations of god then you have to be self- purified   self-purified  you have to be self-purified cough  without self-purification the observance of the law of  ahimsa must remain an empty dream  okay and what is this self-purification ? yes ? self-purification means purification in mind word and deed purification of mind word and deed  your thought speech and action   word and deed   speech and action  okay  so without self-purification he says you cannot follow the path of ahimsa  and if you don't follow the path of ahimsa you cannot realise truth which is god  according to gandhiji   truth   god   mahtma gandhiji  okay  god can never be realised by one who is not pure at heart so the first important thing of self-purification you have to be pure at heart good in your deed good in your  thoughts action   heart  god can never be realised by one who is not pure at heart  self-purification therefore must mean purification in all walks of life   life  and this is very important because if you are self- purified  you are good in thought speech and action   speech and action  if you are good you can make others good  okay   others good  so he says that if you are self-purified you will naturally see that your surroundings are also purified  it is also good  and purification being highly infectious purification of oneself necessarily leads to the purification of one's   surroundings   surroundings  so what does purification of oneself lead to ? come on yes uh you ? purification of oneself means purification of the surroundings of one's surroundings   surroundings  whereever he is in any walk of life he will see that  everything else is also purified is good okay   purified  but the path of self-purification is hard and steep  to attain perfect purity one has to become absolutely passion-free in thought speech and action to rise above the opposing currents of love and hatred attachment and repulsion  so he says that we are talking on self- purification but it is not very easy to be self-purified because if you want to be self-purified you should be absolutely passion-free  emotion-free in thought speech and action   passion-free   thought speech and action
