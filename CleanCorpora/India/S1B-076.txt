uh  i must initially  say that i am really grateful to
 saraswati  for having accepted this invitation  and uh agreed to
visit our  department 
""
i think she is first uh  let's  say  who has come from
such a long distance   cough 
""
saraswati from madras 
""
uh  she is a distinguished scholar  and  i'm  happy
that she is  here with us  this afternoon 
""
now  according to the  official speaking the requirements of
the open defence  the candidate has to sum up  the argument of his
thesis  in about twenty minutes about  whether it should be convenient
""
""
officially you can take an hour  laughs  but  i'm
 sure you won't like  him    laughter 
""
""
so for about twenty minutes  you speak and  sum up 
the main arguments of  thesis and  findings  accentuating the
findings 
""
so i request him  uh to summarise it 
""
and then after that  uh when he receives uh  sir then after
that 
""
""
questions
""
""
questions  from  from the external  experts 
other than the referees  these questions should be treated  two words
  and then questions  raised by the referees  both the referees
  cough  and then if necessary those who are present here they will
also  raise their questions if required sometime  from the candidate
""
""
so i now request uh  mr karande to sum up his  thesis 
""
""
thank you sir 
""
the studying  two words  uh some features of  educated
indian english speech  an  one word  study  uh has five chapters
besides introduction 
""
in the introduction  uh some  background has been explained
 as what led me  to pick up the study 
""
so  some small work that i  did in a partial fulfillment of
 m phil degree  so that led me to uh  switch on to these topics 
""
even though  the focus of  the  one word  study was
 uh an  articulate  in phonetics 
""
but here  the focus is shifted to   one word 
phonetics 
""
so  again  two things  one is uh  collection of data
 that is  elicited data  and corpus data 
""
so elicited data  has been  rather you know not paid much
attention for one or two reasons 
""
and corpus data has been uh  preferred over here 
""
for two reasons mainly  and the one reason is  in elicited
data  if the data happens to be  the words are  word-strings or
sentences  then this sentences  and words you know  most of the time
they are   cough  isolated from the context 
""
and so they are likely to  loose some phonetic features 
""
and so corpus data  which is uh a continous speech may be  or
discussion or news  particularly here the news reading 
""
so it being a connected speech plus rapid speech you know 
""
so all the required  features that is  one word  features
 of  the strings and words required  they were all intact  or
they were  got  all intact in this data 
""
and so this corpus data it was preferred to the  elicited data
 cough 
""
so the  the limiting why this  uh chapter or why this area
 was chosen  that is uh media news  that is news broadcast on t v
and uh  radio 
""
so one reason  uh main reason for  choosing this area was 
uh that now-a-days  the media in particular t v it has been a common
feature over 
""
so for collecting data  or choosing news  or the news readers
 or the news that we get  atleast  thrice a day  so it has been
invariably permanent feature on t v and  this uh radio 
""
plus  the news reader chosen  uh to read news  either on t
v or on radio you know  they  normally represent all the linguistic
communities  uh that exist in india 
""
and so this representation  of the linguistic communities 
they have been  rather you know collected over years
""
so these are  the two reasons 
""
so one more reason  behind choosing this area and the topic is
""
""
so normally we look up to  this media news  as a kind of
english  that might be followed by the listeners  of t v and radio so
 sometime you know it is  regarded as norm  from the listeners point
of view 
""
and uh  standard from  uh say t v or  radio point of view
""
""
so for these  reasons you know this area was chosen  by me
 here  over here   interruption 
""
chapter number three is about uh  spectrography 
""
so spectrography    i    it   has been
given a due importance in the study only because  without 
spectrographic analysis  or the  one word  analysis the study would
have been  uh simply impossible 
""
so this sophisticated device  or this gadget you know it has all
the  uh facilities you know that gives  uh over here the visual
representation of all the  one word  features 
""
so once we feed  a sound or any sound segment to the machine it
gives us  uh the visual  impression of the sound on the monitor 
""
and that monitor  gives us  that sound in a  one word 
feature 
""
so it records uh  frequency  it records amplitude  it
records    du    duration    it records 
one word   it records  a  one word  you know 
""
so all this features  they decide  what sound is produced or
what sound is pronounced by  a speaker over here 
""
and so this again you know place of the articulation of a sound
segment  or the manner  of the articulation  of a particular segment
you know that can be  to a great extent  is decided by  looking at
or studying or interpreting these spectrographs
""
and so spectograph  has its own place in linguistic study 
""
the next chapter  is analysis of the data 
""
in analysis of the data  these three areas chosen for the study
""
""
so the first is the duration  and the four pairs  of uh 
pure vowels  particularly long and short pairs 
""
these four pairs have been chosen  so the purpose behind
choosing  this four pairs was because it has been assumed  or it has
been  uh talked of  much by the scholars 
""
all the people in this area  that is indian speakers of english
 that is educated indian speakers of english   cough  they
hardly maintain  the short long distinction in their speech you know 
""
and so  for these reasons  these four pairs  they were
selected  or these were  they were chosen as one of the topics over
here 
""
so  here while  deciding the boundaries  of the vocalic
 segments over here some  difficulties were there  but to get over
the difficulties  certain strategies were to be thought out 
""
and here the strategy is  uh spectrograph machine  or this
device came to  uh my assistance here  because here the spectrograph
 spectrograph machine it  shows you  which is a vowel  and which
is  a consonant 
""
so these features  or the certain features on the basis of those
features  it was possible  to catch or it was possible to decide the
segment boundaries 
""
so with the help of this segment boundaries  this pure vowels or
the vocalic  segments they were  detected or they were located and
their duration it was  ultimately again you know decided upon 
""
so in this  uh chapter or in this analysis  it has been found
out  that is  the distinction between short and long  even though it
is not very clear at the level of section but it is still there 
""
there is uh some other reason  why it is not that clear 
""
but the distinction  a short and long  it is there in the
speech of educated indian english 
""
of course you know if we compare  uh this phenomenon  with
the english spoken by the native speaker of english  then it is very clear
 that is length  of any    voc    uh vocalic 
  item or the length of any vocalic  uh segment you know is not as
much as  the length of  the particular or the same vocalic segment
pronounced by  the native speaker 
""
and there is obvious reason 
""
but within the system  used by any educated indian english 
uh speaker you know  he does maintain  a particular kind of  uh
relationship  or does maintain a particular kind of system 
""
and where he distinguishes  a short counterpart from its 
long one 
""
so this is one finding over there
""
the second  area or the second topic chosen  so it is  a
dipthong 
""
so  on the dipthong  three dipthongs
""
again you know even  uh professor bansal  so he treats just
 one dipthong that is a  or ou  which is there he says in  uh
educated indian  uh english  speaker  and others too which  i
deal with over here
""
so they are a  and another is ae  so these two  so my
findings  in this study they are very much confirmed  with uh  dr
 bansal's  and uh  that  bansal's  conclusions  or his
findings and findings by  uh may be professor kachru  and nihalani 
 two words  these people also
""
but here it was an attempt  to verify it with the help of uh 
 one word  study of  one word  means over here
""
so  one thing  uh the one way to verify  dipthongs  it
was  a spectrograph 
""
so in spectrograph  one  one word  feature  that is a
 one word   and these  one word  were decided whether a
particular vowel  uh pronounced by a speaker  was a pure vowel or 
a dipthong 
""
there was a second  one word   or the f two  what we
say or the hub theory 
""
so these hub theory or the f two  second  one word  it
gives a clear cut picture  of the dipthong as well as of  a pure vowel
""
""
if it happens to be a pure vowel then  f two or the second 
one word  it is  straight
""
it is  in a straight position  and when it is a dipthong 
then there is uh  uh frequency shift  or there is a f two transition
""
""
and these f two transition it is in terms of  frequency over
there
""
so it can be seen  very clearly  with the help of  a
spectrogram  which sound or which vocalic sound is a pure vowel and which
is not or which is a dipthong 
""
so the finding are these  that is most of  the indian
educated indian speakers you know  so some of them you know  there are
certain news readers  that is educated indian  uh speakers you know 
of english  that who do maintain  this dipthongs who do pronounce a
dipthong but the second element is not as stressed  it is as boldly
pronounced as it should have been
""
and so  the shift or the transition shift or f two shift  f
two transition  it is not very much bold over there
""
and so at the level of perception  uh even though there is a
transition shift  even though there is f two transition  that f two
transition is not very much felt by the listeners 
""
the third topic  or the third area chosen for the study  it
is stress 
""
even in case of stress  uh it is said  uh that indian
speakers of english  educated indian speakers of english  they do not
confirm with  the native speakers of english  as far as stress is
concerned 
""
but there is a some pattern 
""
but which pattern in the present study it has been found out 
""
i particularly neglected  monosyllabic  disyllabic and even
trisyllabic words which form  again  the great part of  anybodys
speech 
""
so  multisyllabic words  that is words with more than three
syllables 
""
so they are called the multisyllable in the present study 
""
and these words you know they have been studied  uh for the
purpose of stress 
""
over here it is found  there is a word with prefixes  and
words without prefixes 
""
so words without prefixes  as far as stress pattern is concerned
 they give a very chaotic picture 
""
there is no pattern as such emerges  when these words are
studied  but the word with prefixes you know they  uh they maintain a
kind of uh stress pattern you know 
""
of course there are  three divisions  under this 
""
the first division  in the first division  uh the prefix
doesn't receive any stress as such 
""
but the remaining syllable  one of them does receive a primary
stress 
""
the second category or the second division of words  that is
multi  syllabic words with prefixes  there  uh  this prefixes
receive  primary stress  and secondary stress  falls on some other
 uh syllable 
""
and the third division is  uh where  the prefix receive the
secondary stress 
""
and the primary stress again falls on some other syllable you know
""
""
so the third type  there is a variant  the prefix receive
the primary stress you know  it emerges as a pattern  in the speech of
educated indian english speech  a speakers you know 
""
and here this pattern  it comes out or it can be regarded as 
or the particular stress pattern used by educated indian  english speakers
""
""
so this is the analysis  so  naturally the conclusions drawn
 conclusions reached at  so as far as duration is concerned 
""
so  the study says  uh this distinction between  short
and long  it is there 
""
the one reason why it is not very dominant  or dominantly 
one word  at the level of  again we can say  listening 
""
and the one reason is  it is uh due to  the mother tongue or
it is due to  uh the way we speak english  because whenever the speech
tempo  goes up or it increases  so our habit  that is the marathi
speakers or even indians you know  they pronounced most of the words
equally bold 
""
and because of this you know when the  tempo increases or goes
up  all the segments  including  vocalic and again we can say
consonants they get compressed 
""
and because of this  this vocalic parts or the vocalic segments
you know and their duration it is not  felt very much 
""
but in other languages where  weak form  feature exists 
over there when  uh this tempo increases  or it again we can say 
the speaker speeds up himself  then he counters these weak forms 
""
but he does not  uh or his vocalic  uh parts of the vocalic
segments  and particularly stress  are stretched  stressed uh 
you see vowels  they are not affected to that extent 
""
and so their duration remains  uh rather unaffected you know
""
""
on the other hand  these vowels  that receive primary stress
 they are affected as far as  duration is concerned 
""
uh the next is  uh a dipthong  this area and here the
conclusions 
""
the problem dipthong  taken up for the study  so it is said
that it is true  that these  all the three dipthongs  most of the
time they are pronounced as  pure vowels  and not as dipthongs 
""
there are  news reader  or some news reader  who do
pronounce  dipthongs as dipthongs
""
but their number is very low 
""
and since it is very low you know  and again the f two
transition that is not very much felt 
""
so this percentage which is upto fifteen percent or twenty percent
you know  so it can't have  the central place in the conclusion 
""
and the third is the stress 
""
so according to me the stress  the secondary stress  or the
primary stress and the tertiary stress 
""
the tertiary stress  this feature is not at all found in 
educated indian english speech 
""
and the secondary stress and the primary stress  there is  a
  again  a  kind of confusion  but some pattern does emerge
 whenever it is a multisyllabic word  and that too again you know 
 which a  which is   which has the prefix 
""
so another category of words  which is not multisyllable 
most of the time  but which has the functional stress in it 
""
so the words with a functional stress  so the same word 
with a same  one word  shape which is used either or not  or a verb
you know  so they receive  a stress at different places  when they
change their grammatical categories 
""
so over here  all the news reader  that is educated indian
english speakers you know  they very well maintained  this distinction
such as  now  two words  and so on 
""
here you know they emerges  again we can say very successful
speakers of educated indian english speech
