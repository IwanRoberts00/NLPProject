  recording broken 
""
he was born to a wealthy landlord 
""
he got good education  and got well-paid cosy job with the
planning commission 
""
but he soon realised that the fruits of planning and development did
not really reach the needy 
""
he was disillusioned 
""
his restless soul drove him to the solitary solitude of the
himalayas 
""
but even the life of  sanyasi  disillusioned him 
""
so he decided to go back to andhra pradesh to write a book on the
tribals 
""
but what he saw shocked him 
""
he saw woman being yoked instead of oxen 
""
enough was enough he decided 
""
he gave up the idea of writing the book  and decided to work for
the welfare of the tribals 
""
he became their liberator 
""
he is p k s madhavan 
""
 let's  meet him 
""
 let's  hear more about him  his experience and the
voluntary organisation he set up from him 
""
mr madhavan could you tell us about this volantary organisation
 aware   which you set up  ?
""
""
in nineteen seventy-five  when i moved into andhra pradesh
 with the interest of writing a book on tribals 
""
i did a small research in one block where about five thousand
tribals  were given about ten million  rupees   in a
government programme 
""
and once our former prime minister was telling only twelve percent
of the money reached people 
""
my research in that particular block  i found only two percent
reached people 
""
and ten years we made all efforts to see that these people come up
""
""
but i found that why this is happening  ?
""
millions of  rupees  were put in 
""
why people are not responding  ?
""
and i discovered  people are not part of planning  not part
of implementation  not part of  evaluation 
""
so i thought writing a book is an intellectual exploitation 
""
i get my name  i get my  doctorate but people are not going
to benefit out of it 
""
so i said  i'm  not going to write a book 
""
 i'll  create awareness among the people  so that they
will decide their future 
""
so with that intention i started this organisation  aware
""
""
""
how did you realise that only two percent of the planning and
development really reached the people  ?
""
""
you see when i  tracked the money where it has gone  i
found out sixty-two percent has gone to maintain the administration
bureaucracy and other things 
""
and about thirty percent of the money has gone  by middle man
 corruption  and commission etcetera 
""
seven percent of this money reached poor people 
""
so i felt atleast seven percent reached 
""
when i investigated five percent of this money was  misused by
the people themselves 
""
so only two percent reached people 
""
so this is the fate of our planning and implementation 
""
then what will happen to our country  ?
""
so i said why this is happening  ?
""
people must be able to know what they wanted  ?
""
where they live  ?
""
what their future  ?
""
so  people's  participation is a fundamental necessity 
for any development
""
""
how did you make people participate in your ventures  ?
""
how did you draw out the meek tribals into your  work ?
""
""
in the beginning people did not trust me
""
because  i'm  a new person  and  i'm  talking a
different language  and they  did not believe me at all
""
in some place there was an opposition 
""
people   thrown   threw   stone at me 
""
in one village they   want   wanted   to shoot
at me  as  with the arrows 
""
but persuasion continuous meeting  and explaining them  and
motivation has helped me  after six months eight months  to people to
understand there is a man who is talking about them  and trying to help
them 
""
so that is how i just  tempted  and also i used telling the
stories to the children meeting the women  talking to the  elderly
people 
""
slowly i became friend of them  and they started accepting 
""
""
how do you communicate with the tribals  ?
""
""
in the beginning i was talking   a a   with the
  help of a interpreter  a local man 
""
normally a vested interest their opinion maker 
""
slowly slowly when i was able to observe  the  their
problems  i started directly talking to them 
""
childrens were first my media 
""
when elderly people  i used to talk to them  
ramayana    i used to talk to  
mahabharata  
""
some of the stories of  tribal culture
""
that is how i became friend with them 
""
and i never expected anything from them 
""
i never asked them to do anything 
""
simply discussing  becoming friend 
""
so slowly they took me as a friend  and then they started
telling their problems 
""
""
what was your first impression of tribals when you really met
them in nineteen seventy-five  and what is your impression of them now  ?
""
""
you see my  expe  my  assessment of this poverty in
our country is  poverty is a conspiracy 
""
and always people think by giving money  poverty can be removed
""
it is not true 
""
to remove the poverty what we need is courage  psychological
make up  people must prepare themselves 
""
and among the tribals they are meek  they are afraid of the new
people  they don't understand what exactly happening  and they are very
traditional  they are away from the communication 
""
and even the small communicators were exploiters 
""
so as a result they did not respond to the real development of our
country
""
""
and what is their state now  ?
""
""
now after fifteen years  of my entry  and my  one
word  work  perhaps what i can say is that  what we have done is to
explain to the people what government is doing for them 
""
what government infrastructure 
""
infact in the whole of the world  our country has got an
excellent legislation 
""
always in favour of poor 
""
our constitution our legislations always in favour of poor 
""
but this has to be translated into action 
""
and we have an excellent infrastructure meant for the poor 
""
but it has to be implemented 
""
so may be the   aware's   role is  to
explain to the people  to utilise the infrastructure  to make use of
the law  for their own social transformation and economic betterment 
""
""
do you mean to say that the infrastructure that the government
has created  for the welfare of the backwards and the tribals  your
organisation plays a  key role into passing the benefits to the  
tribals  and backwards ?
""
""
 yeah  
""
""
the motivation  explanation bringing the people near to the
government infrastructure  asking them to fight for their rights 
asking them to utilise the existing infrastructure 
""
i will give an example  there is a rural back  in a village
""
""
and uh  government has got four percent differential rate of
interest 
""
nowhere in the world   we've  got such a infrastructure
""
""
but people   goes   go   to a landlord  and
take money for six and forty percent interest 
""
why institution is there  why people are not able to utilise it
""
""
because people must know  that institution is meant for them 
they have right to utilise that institution 
""
i ask these people  i organise them to the bank  educated
them 
""
asked the bank to help them  and i brought bank and people
together 
""
landlord or the moneylender disappeared 
""
""
what can be the role of a voluntary organisation vis-a- vis
the government institutions  ?
""
""
see nobody should ever come to a conclusion that voluntary
organisation is going to replace government
""
it is  it is meaningless 
""
the voluntary organisations are always the forerunners  the
pilots 
""
who can experiment  who build innovative programmes 
""
we can bring the people and government together 
""
so the role of voluntary organisation is a complementary and
supplimentary  efforts of the government welfare programmes 
""
that should be the  spirit of voluntary organisations 
""
educate the people  create awareness  ask to utilise
government infrastructure 
""
ask the government also to understand people 
""
so they must be catalyst between the people  and government 
""
""
your organisation  aware   in how 
many  states do you operate and how many villages are you covering ?
""
""
  we were work    we started our work 
 in andhra pradesh 
""
so we are now in  covering about two thousand three hundred
villages  in andra pradesh 
""
about eight hundred villages   in  the neighbouring
orissa
""
these are the two  uh states where  aware 
is concentrating 
""
but  we've  got pilot projects in kerala  tamil nadu 
karnataka  and uttar pradesh 
""
may be shortly next year we may be starting our programme in
manipur also 
""
""
but how do you decide that which village  needs your
attention and where do you need to go to help the people ?
""
""
in the present area   we're  working in a
particular area 
""
so  we're  expanding  literally like this  because
 now  aware  is a known organisation
""
hundreds of villages are coming  asking us to adopt 
""
but we don't work in an area more than eight years 
""
we withdraw  make people themselves be free  and indepenent
of  aware  
""
they have their own future
""
they  must've  their own plan  and they should not
depend upon  aware  
""
once we withdraw from thousand villages we expand to another
thousand villages 
""
like that  we're  spreading 
""
in a place like kerala and  tamil nadu and other places 
where there are tribals  because my organisation is  working  for
the tribal welfare  and we are also including  harijans 
also   harijans  and tribals are two  communities whom
with whom  we're  working 
""
so wherever there is such people  like in uttar pradesh 
there is a lot of child labour  bounded labour 
""
 mirjapur  district where we are working 
""
similarly in vainad in  in kerala  where tribals are there
""
""
so wherever the tribals are there where there condition is very
bad  our organisation is trying to set up a project there 
""
""
which one has been your singular achievement  ?
""
when were you really touched by the  apathy shown towards the
tribals  and  which you feel has been your achievement in the last
fifteen years  ?
""
""
in nineteen seventy-five i have seen  tribals are 
yoked to the  tribals are tied to the tree and beaten black and blue 
""
and no law enforcing agency has  two words  
""
one thing which i cannot forget is once when i was going  
i've  seen two women  yoked like a oxen  and made to draw the water
from the well 
""
and i reach landlord and asked them why this is happening  ?
""
 it's  a cultural oppression  he didn't had any feeling
for it 
""
he said  yes  
""
and that among them one is a pregnant woman 
""
i thought if it is my mother and it is my sister what would have
 been  happened  ?
""
if  landlord's  mother and sister can he  yoke like that
 ?
""
so that was a a very disturbing fact in my life 
""
then i said no  this cannot continue
""
this is our independent india  and  i  what i thought is
 the poor people loss their dignity  they are meek 
""
there is a conspiracy to keep them always poor  by giving the
alcohol  and other things 
""
so now let them  discover their dignity 
""
let them feel that they are equal citizens in this country 
""
that is where my motivation  awareness creation  training
camps  mahasabhas   all those thinkers made them to realise
 they are equal citizens of this country 
""
today  a tribal  fifteen years ago a tribal used to run away
when he   see   saw   me  today he can reach the
gates of the chief minister  and knock his door  and ask him to hear
his problems
""
 that's  the greatest satisfaction for me
""
""
do you feel a sense of pride when you realise that you have
been   you've   been able to give them this kind of sense of
dignity
""
""
i i do not say pride but i feel so happy  so content in my
life  perhaps i would have never achieved anything more than this 
""
today a bonded labour  who was beaten in my presence  is the
president of  mandal praja parishad   what more i  
wanted   want    ?
""
""
for two years you led the life of a  sanyasi 
 why did you give that up  ?
""
""
see i thought i must find out some meaning in my life 
""
i thought spiritualism is one of the main 
""
so i became a monk and i was  uh with monks 
""
i met a number of great people  great  mahatmas 
""
""
but what i found is  they do not have any solution for poverty
and sufferings of the poor people 
""
they have some solutions which for your next life nobody has seen
it 
""
and i also thought many of these people are expression of
capitalist system 
""
the rich peoples agents 
""
i said no  my precious life should not be wasted  in these
debates
""
i must do something action 
""
that action must remove the suffering of the people 
""
that is what swami vivekananda said  it  
""
perhaps what swami vivekananda did  i said  i tried to
translate in action 
""
""
uh what role what is the role of women  when uh uh 
they are the receiving and when they are trying to get the fruits of
development  ?
""
""
see always in the in the development  woman was kept as a
second rate citizen 
""
 it's  very unfortunate 
""
but i learnt many things from the women themselves in my own
project area 
""
to be very frank in  aware   women are the
 leaders of programme 
""
 i'll  give one example 
""
always government is giving some money 
""
 aware  is also giving some money 
""
banks are giving some money 
""
so i spoke to  uh a few women  i told how long you are going
to recieve the money  can't you create money among yourselves 
""
the discussion went on for two hours 
""
and they came out with a small programme which was very very
encouraging 
""
they call it as  chitanya  nidhi's  
programme 
""
each one of them pay five  rupees  in a week 
and fifteen must become one unit 
""
and then  two hundred and fifty they collect  i give two
fifty
""
out of five hundred  rupees  four fifty is given to
one woman as a loan  which she pay back next week 
""
like that in  thirty seven weeks  the so called poor woman
 could collect one  crore  forty seven lakhs  rupees
 
""
so you can see the poor  is only our term 
""
poor is potential  and they could keep such a money  and
then it is revolved among them 
""
thirty-seven five hundred women are beneficiary of this programme
today 
""
""
india is rich in human resources 
""
 we've  so much of talent amongst ourselves 
""
now having worked for fifteen years what do you think should be
done so that more and more villages are drawn into this kind of 
development process
""
""
it is my emotional  feeling always  india cannot be a
poor country 
""
with eight hundred and twenty million people we must be richest
people 
""
what is happening is  the human resource is not planned 
developed and utilised 
""
we are always thinking of the economics money  material 
matter 
""
but this so called rich  resource  we've  got  has to
be utilised
""
so perhaps my next  to  ten years work is   i'm 
going to plan in one block or one  samiti   where all human
resource will be planned  utilised and developed so that  that block
must be self-sufficient 
""
so  budgeting human resource is one of the important thing
""
we must take  uh into notice in  the  our planning 
""
""
if somebody wants to join your voluntary organisation  how
does one do that  ?
""
""
welcome 
""
we we always like people
""
there are a number of people who support  aware
 
""
friends of  aware  members of  aware
 
""
and  we've  an ideology like this where  through
awareness  development is brought  and unless development is a 
people's  movement  development has no relevance 
""
or if the development is meant for the people  or poor  and
poor must be the captains of the development 
""
these are all our expectations 
""
in another thing in  aware   uh we always
think this alcohol is a conspiracy to keep the poor people always poor
""
""
what is the full meaning of  aware   ?
""
""
 aware  stands for action for welfare and
awakening in rural environment 
""
""
do you want to confine yourself only to the rural areas or
work for the poor in the urban areas as well ?
""
""
for last fifteen years we worked only in rural areas 
""
now we thought it is also necessary to get solidarity of the urban
poor  to support
""
you see today our country is passing through a transition 
""
 the  already for last twenty years  ten percent of the
rural population migrated to the urban areas 
""
and urban areas is not our culture 
""
rural civilisation is our culture 
""
so in order to prevent urbanisation  slums and other problems
 we want to take care of the people in urban area itself  developing
the rural people
""
so  next year we may perhaps move  into  little bit into
urban area  where poor people comes and migrates  and struggle for
their life 
""
""
what is your dream regarding these people what do they 
you really want them to become  ?
""
what do you want to see  ?
""
""
in my life i would like to see  the whole of this caste
system  which is conspiring to the   society's  underdevelopment
to be removed 
""
where a tribal  a  harijan   or a 
brahmin  or anybody are equal  equally share the responsibility of
governance of this country 
""
and my dream is mahatma  gandhi's   dream  a 
gram swaraj  
""
village that stands on its own  leg and its own self-
sufficiency 
""
i believe in  mahatma's     per   
perfect   theory  of making a village  a  gram swaraj
  that was my dream
""
""
well mr  madhavan's  dream is also that of a 
gram swaraj  the same as mahatma  gandhi's  
""
we wish him all luck in his endeavours 
""
thank you for being with us
""
""
thank you
