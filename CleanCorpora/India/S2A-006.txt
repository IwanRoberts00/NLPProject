""
 it's  uh  time now  to begin the last journey
 from  teen murti   where he has been lying still 
""
twenty second afternoon 
""
and here   shakti sthal   ten kilometres 
the banks of the yamuna  next to his mother 
""
on the night of this twenty first may  the laugh of her life
 was brutely snatched away  making a reality of a worst tragedy 
""
most often she was by his side   whether rain or shine 
 but not too strong 
""
this time   noise  life at  teen murti 
and around the country fly half mast 
""
grief stricken people  have been queing for hours and through the
night  since that fateful night of the twenty first  to pay homage
 to a young and vigorous leader  with a boyish smile and a jaunty
step  that endeared him to so many 
""
still and silent now 
""
swollen crowds  wear a mute testimony  to the closing chapter
""
""
he leaves his wife and two children bereft  and the nation
plunged in destiny 
""
the scene of twenty years of his life 
""
 teen murti  has recorded the joys and trivia 
his ecstasies  and the agonies  of three generations of his time 
""
a large number  almost forty  of visiting dignitories from
around the world attending today  pay tribute to this young leader 
who was a charming and versatile diplomat  a loving father  a good
friend  of his country 
""
the state funeral with full military honour  begins in a short
while from now 
""
the gun carriage  the guest and  slouch   carries to
the scene  for a  one word  
""
rajiv gandhi the son of  indira gandhi and grandson of
jawaharlal nehru  bore the mantle of political responsibility  easily
 if with a certain reluctance 
""
once he did so  he threw himself heart and soul into the role
""
""
he was in a hurry for change and progress 
""
a driving force  into the twenty-first century  which 
he will now  never see 
""
priyanka  consoling her mother 
""
priyanka  consoling her mother 
""
losing a husband  losing a father  a loving friend whose
smile could charm a heart of stone 
""
for them  he was not a leader or prime minister or politician
""
""
he was papa 
""
the funeral procession will be led by major general s c kashyap
 general officer commanding delhi area 
""
two platoons of the army one of the navy and two of the airforce
 accompany the gun carriage 
""
immediately behind the gun carriage  comes a firing party 
which will be followed by the chief mourners 
""
the mourners in uniform  and those not in uniform 
""
forty officers of the three services  of the rank of major
general or brigadier  have maintained continuous vigil  from two 
o'clock   on the twenty second  till now 
""
 teen murti  is  at the moment  a novice of
the quite  with the chanting people outside the world  and stretching
 the heart  right down the route  of the  shakti sthal
 
""
prime minister chandra shekhar   shouting in the background
""
""
and for us the people of india  we have many bleeding hearts to
heal 
""
we have yet another scar  on the fabric of our country 
""
a  one word  of another assassination 
""
we have to struggle once again  for that political maturity
 that will allow the voice of democracy  to be heard unhindered 
""
when leaders  do not have to fall  at the altar of our
insecurity 
""
from around the world  international leaders have expressed
their shock  grief  hurt  indignation  and today many of them
have come or sent their representatives  to pay their last respects 
""
i never thought i would have to witness this scene again 
within a span of six and a half years 
""
a day of tragedy  a day of shame 
""
he played the game in a stupendous drive of energy and committment
""
""
he went from state to state  knowing the people with a tireless
drive 
""
now  a martyr to democracy 
""
and why  ?
""
why the best reluctant politician  who sacrificed  his
professional flying career to join his mother after his  brother's 
death  ?
""
why that this dynamic young man  who took success and defeat in
a stride have to be struck down  when he was playing the game according
to the rule  ?
""
now still  silent  shattered  forever suspended  in
a tragedy  in a nightmarish act that defies all norms of justice and
fairplay 
""
the childhood years of rajiv gandhi were spent here  happy
years 
""
where now his body lies in  one word   cold  and
still 
""
fate  and assassin  have claimed the lives  of the
mother  and her two sons  in a span  of a little over one decade
  shouting in the background 
""
too young to die  too young to be a martyr  too full of
life and plans for the future  to be struck down so brutally 
""
apart from close friends and relatives  the main three pall
bearers  will be the chiefs of the army  navy and airforce 
""
general s f rodrigues  admiral l ramdas  and airchief
marshall s k mehra 
""
helicopter patrolling the sky  security 
""
as they lift him  from what was home for twenty years  to
bring him out to the gun carriage 
""
till eleven  o'clock  this morning the crowds were here 
paying their last respects  and then  there were moments of privacy
""
""
the helicopter showering petals  as the body is brought out
""
""
as the helicopter showers petals  on the gun carriage  he
is now  handed over  to the people 
""
moments to be  recorded in history  memories to be engraved
on our hearts 
""
they called him  one of the brightest and bravest sons of india
""
""
they called it  a blow to indian politics 
""
they called out  a shock nation 
""
  now  in slow march  the procession begins 
""
and so he leaves   teen murti   for the last
march  to the banks of the yamuna 
""
we capture it on film 
""
we give him the ceremony  but there are no words  to
express  the heinousness  of this crime 
""
too young to die 
""
""
 now  
""
""
our next live telecast  will be when the gun carriage 
and the procession arrives at cannaught circle 
""
in between  recorded excerpts from supporting camera crew 
will be brought to you from vijay chowk and india gate 
""
we now return you from  teen murti   to the
studios of  doordarshan  
""
 i'm  now speaking to you from the studios of 
doordarshan  
""
these are the scenes captured by our supporting camera crew  as
the funeral procession  moves towards vijay chowk 
""
it is now moving on towards cannaught circle 
""
the people have been waiting at vijay chowk  from noon 
unmindful of the scorching heat  just to catch  a final glimpse 
of their beloved leader 
""
perhaps  summer afternoon with the temperature in  there 
forty  the crowds braving the may heat  waiting along the routes 
to catch final glimpse 
""
the funeral procession winding its way  at snail pace 
towards  shakti sthal   on the banks of the yamuna 
""
the route is long  ten kilometres  from  teen murti
  to  shakti sthal  
""
mortal remains of the ex-prime minister  move slowly down 
to its final destination 
""
people rushing breaking the cordon to have a last glimpse 
""
with full  military honours  the tunes of the army  the
navy  and the airforce  precede  the gun carriage 
""
the funeral procession is lead by the general officer commanding
delhi area  major general s c kashyap 
""
braving the scorching heat  they give vent  to their grief
  shouting in the background 
""
and now down  rajpath  
""
the procession had left  teen murti  around one 
thirty  and is making very slow progress  as the people  impede
 the route   shouting in the background 
""
we have recorded these scenes because it is not possible to have a
continuous microwave  uplink  at all spots along the route 
""
so the next live  telecast will be from cannaught circle 
""
honours for a young leader  cut down in his prime 
""
leaders around the world had expressed  their indignation 
""
 we are filled with indignation  over the appaling and
heinous crime 
""
he was a personal friend of ours   mr gorbachov 
""
the long route to eternity  showered with petals  
chanting of  mantras  at the background 
""
""
 we're  now waiting for the funeral procession to
arrive 
""
the funeral cortege carrying the mortal remains of mr rajiv gandhi
on route to this place  has been passing through the streets and avenues
of delhi with surging crowds thronging the routes  bidding farewell to a
beloved leader with tears and emotions  in memory to someone who  we've
 tragically  lost forever 
""
and  it's  a sad and depressive moment as we await the
arrival of the mortal remains of mr rajiv gandhi  here at a spot close to
 shakti sthal  where they will be confined to flames 
""
close by this spot where our former prime minister mrs indira
gandhi  mr rajiv  gandhi's  mother was cremated less then seven
years ago 
""
mrs gandhi had fallen to the assassins bullets at her residence one
safdarjang road new delhi 
""
today as we await the arrival of the mortal remains of rajiv gandhi
 it still seems impossible to come to terms with the enormity of this
ghastly and unbelievable tragedy 
""
a bad despicable moment  a bad night when rajiv gandhi was
brutally killed 
""
our hearts are filled with anguish and sadness 
""
perhaps the hundreds of millions that make up this vast and
vibrant country it is a moment for us to hang our heads in utter shame 
""
there is toll of gloom only broken by the recital of devotional
songs 
""
the atmosphere steep in this sorrow of the appaling tragedy that
left behind pain and grief  and inspeakable faith after this abolutely
shameful and dasterdly crime 
""
as many of here saint says and eyes brimming with tears and 
many left numb by the senseless tragedy 
""
we have many world leaders here represented in large numbers 
at mr rajiv  gandhi's  funeral  with over sixty delegations from
the world over   who've  been coming in since yesterday to pay
their last respect to the  departed leader 
""
large crowds have gathered here today outside the cordons area
oblivious of the heat and the dust and scortching winds 
""
all here to mourn the loss of our former prime minister whom they
loved and cheered 
""
a leader whom they showered their love on and who in turn returned
their affection and warmth in his untiring attempt  to keep the interests
of the common man  closest to his heart 
""
today the spot where mr rajiv  gandhi's  life last rites
are to be performed  was chosen by his daughter priyanka who visited the
site day before yesterday and then a couple of times thereafter to see how
the arrangements were progressing 
""
not too far away are the spots where mrs indira gandhi and mr
sanjay gandhi were cremated 
""
and today the mortal remains of  rajiv gandhi are consigned to
the flames
""
it will be  a time  that'll  echo as the last few days
have  some of the bleakest darkest and most depressing moments of our
history 
""
in a span of eleven years three members of the gandhi family 
victims of  violence  tragic and untimely end
