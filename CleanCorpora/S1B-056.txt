Question number one forty-three  Chitto
""
""
( a) Whether exports are expected to register a twenty percent
""
""
""
""
""
""
during the current year in comparison to the corresponding period for the
""
""
( d) The reasons for poor growth rate of exports 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
 uh
""
""
Sir it was  in
""
""
""
""
 some fundamentally
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
growth in the 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
the figure of ninety-two ninety-three and this ninety-three  recording
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Two twenty-nine percent plans 
""
""
""
""
""
available to them we replaced it  because the GATT subsidy which they
wish to  international
""
""
So it had some impact and 
""
""
""
competitive
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Therefore 
there could be two  if I take the average of the first
""
""
""
""
some adverse impact  but from the figure of September October it indicates
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
has decided to slash down the export target for the year 
""
""
 whether it is
also a fact  uh the tariff was on other forms of
resistances 
""
""
If that is so how does the government propose to remedy that and
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
ninety-two ninety-three our performance was little more than eighteen billion
""
""
""
""
""
Therefore informally I suggested that if we could reach  a
""
ninety-four ninety-five
""
Perhaps  with fifteen twenty percent step up we may reach the
""
billion 
""
""
""
""
export of some of the Indian products to 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Question number one forty-four 
""
( a)  The number of proposals received and cleared during
""
""
""
""
""
export earnings  the anticipated export earnings from
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
nineteen ninety-one 
""
( c) and ( d) sir yes sir  however the date on amount of export
""
""
""
""
specifically 
""
""
the industrial policy of nineteen ninety-one 
""
""
""
""
""
But at the  it
""
""
""
""
""
itself  have increased from eight
""
""
""
""
""
On the one hand 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
 growth
""
""
So what is the incentive being given to them 
""
""
""
""
statement of July nineteen ninety-one  government had explicitly stated
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
That certainly has put pressure on land prices 
""
I think there is a  way to deal with that
""
""
""
""
""
growth of Bombay as one of the 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
maintained 
""
My specific query was because  there is a general apprehension
""
looking  that's
 uh the
""
""
""
""
""
""
 in their industry
""
""
""
""
""
 mentioned in the annexe three of the industrial policy statement of July
""
""
These  chemical
""
 machinery
""
So the  investment is
going to consumer goods  is simply not correct
""
""
""
have 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
the foreign 
""
I preside over the empowered committee 
""
""
are  you will see the
""
""
Even in terms  here of course I am
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
And when these projects are completed there would be  a minimum
""
""
""
""
""
In fact they are going to add to the  amount of employment in
""
""
""
""
""
This is a very important question  and according to government
new industrial policy one thousand six hundred and fifty  uh proposal have
""
""
Sir may I know from the honourable minister  minister has
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
This is uh  just two
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
states 
""
""
governments to create the requisite  climate in which investments will
""
""
""
""
""
""
Today I think West Bengal is aggressively seeking foreign
""
""
""
""
""
he was asked the questions about the new industrial policy  he had stated
""
""
""
Mr Finance Minister  your
""
a few words 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
fifty proposals 
""
But sir I complaint  that very few projects have started
""
""
The foreign investors are complaining that there is still  too
""
""
""
""
""
""
Sir  the honourable member is right there have been gap in
""
secretariat of industrial approval in the ministry  will
""
""
""
which  in the last three and a half years
""
""
""
""
implemented 
""
""
approval  considering
""
""
