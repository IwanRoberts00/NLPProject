Question number one forty-three  Chitto
Basu 
""
( a) Whether exports are expected to register a twenty percent
growth rate during the current year  ?
""
( b) Whether exports growth rate has declined below the targeted
growth rate during the current financial year  ?
""
( c) If so the details of monthly growth legal rates of export
during the current year in comparison to the corresponding period for the
last year 
""
( d) The reasons for poor growth rate of exports 
the steps taken to remedy the situation 
""
""
Sir question one four three  the statement is laid on the
table of the house 
""
""
Sir  uh that there
has been wide  in the percentage growth rate of exports
 uh
August ninety-four 
""
Sir it was  in
August  and the next
month it shoot up or it rose to twenty-four point six percent 
""
Sir  this phenomenon seems to be unusual
 some fundamentally
wrong  in the effort of the
governemnt to 
""
May I know from the honourable minister  what are those
fundamentally wrong and defective  ?
""
Uh if those systems have been  if those
wrong fundamentally wrong defects have been identified  and if identified
growth in the 
""
April it was twelve percent 
""
May June July these three months it was single digit 
""
And thereafter it has started picking up  August September and
October  twenty-seven
percent  with
the figure of ninety-two ninety-three and this ninety-three  recording
broken 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Two twenty-nine percent plans 
""
Therefore sometimes it happens 
""
One of the reason why it happen during this time  mainly
because the  incentive scheme was
available to them we replaced it  because the GATT subsidy which they
wish to  international
price and domestic price that was withdrawn from first of April 
""
So it had some impact and 
goods to the overall market is about twelve percent 
""
Because of  less
competitive
""
So the agricultural product particularly rice  uh
rice export came down 
""
Because of shortage of cotton we had to  reduce the exports of
cotton 
""
Therefore there has been some reasons  analysis we
are making 
""
But 
""
Therefore 
there could be two  if I take the average of the first
seven months 
""
But in this range  and
one good point  that impact of plague which was thought that it would have
some adverse impact  but from the figure of September October it indicates
that 
""
So if this trend continues then we may end with  eighteen
nineteen percent growth
""
But there is nothing  wrong in the
system
""
""
Sir may I know from the honourable minister 
one or two words  that the government of late
has decided to slash down the export target for the year 
""
May I also further know from the honourable minister  uh if not
 whether it is
also a fact  uh the tariff was on other forms of
resistances 
particularly in the United States of America 
""
If that is so how does the government propose to remedy that and
attain the target for the current year  ?
""
""
Sir so far the target is concerned it is  for the period of
the full five years that is 
""
""
From ninety-two ninety-seven the target was fixed in terms of
percentage  enhancement
of export in volume terms in US dollar terms it should be around fifteen to
twenty percent 
""
And in absolute terms at the end of the terminal year  our
exports should be thirty-three point five billion US dollar  at the price
level of ninety-one ninety-two 
""
In order to achieve that target first year we could not reach 
ninety-two ninety-three our performance was little more than eighteen billion
US dollars 
""
Ninety-three ninety-four it is about  twenty-two billion US
dollars 
""
Therefore informally I suggested that if we could reach  a
target of twenty-five twenty-six billion  in the year
ninety-four ninety-five
""
Perhaps  with fifteen twenty percent step up we may reach the
target at the  terminal year of the 8th plan thirty-three point five
billion 
""
That is the target we have
""
In regard to the question of  uh restrictions of
export of some of the Indian products to 
one word 
""
They have raised some  but in
the first five months  of our exports to USA is
encouraging
""
There has been  share of US market in our
total exports upto April to 
""
""
Question number one forty-four 
""
( a)  The number of proposals received and cleared during
nineteen ninety-three ninety-four for direct foreign investment in India
""
( b) The terms and conditions for the foreign investment 
""
( c) Whether foreign investment proposals have the potential of
export earnings  the anticipated export earnings from
foreign investment during the current five year plan 
""
""
( a) and ( b) during the calender year nineteen ninety-three
and the first ten months of nineteen ninety-four upto October  one
thousand six hundred and fifty proposals for foreign direct investment have
been received and cleared  and receiving foreign direct investment of
""
three six 
""
Proposals are cleared in terms of the new industrial policy
nineteen ninety-one 
""
( c) and ( d) sir yes sir  however the date on amount of export
earnings anticipated from these projects is not centrally maintained 
""
""
Mr Speaker sir 
specifically 
""
The minister has given  that there are for
the industrial policy of nineteen ninety-one 
""
Speaker sir  twenty
thousand  in one
year 
""
But at the  it
appears that there are  this
industry  to cluster around
""
""
And  Bombay
itself  have increased from eight
hundred  per
square feet because of foreign investors and foreign people coming
""
It is for their executives 
""
On the one hand 
""
""
""
""
 ?
""
""
Sir I would like to know from the honourable minister 
whether this foreign investors are being encouraged are being asked  to
 growth
centres 
""
So what is the incentive being given to them 
is  ?
""
""
Mr Speaker sir 
statement of July nineteen ninety-one  government had explicitly stated
 protection measures will be taken to ensure
that there is no concentration of industries  in the metropolitan cities
""
""
And that 
""
So I cannot agree with this opposition  uh
suffering because too much of  foreign direct investment
is coming it is certainly true  attractiveness as a
financial centre has increased
""
That certainly has put pressure on land prices 
""
I think there is a  way to deal with that
""
We have existing  uh on land transactions
which in my view  I think are having bad adverse effects
""
Well the answer to that is not that we should  uh prevent the
growth of Bombay as one of the 
""
""
Mr Speaker sir  about the quantum of
 after the full
investement 
""
But it has been answered  is not being
maintained 
""
My specific query was because  there is a general apprehension
""
looking  that's
 uh the
industrial goods of the 
investors 
""
That is the apprehension and  what measures
are being taken I would like to know  uh keeping this foreign
investors  to export certain
 in their industry
""
""
Sir  eighty percents of the approvals of foreign direct
investment  the introduction of the new policy uptil October
nineteen ninety-four  which are
 mentioned in the annexe three of the industrial policy statement of July
""
""
These  chemical
and food processing  industrial
 machinery
""
So the  investment is
going to consumer goods  is simply not correct
""
""
Even where in certain cases 
have 
""
We have ensured  that there will be an obligation on the part of
those investors 
the dividends outflow for the period of 
""
Also  it is not
possible to 
the foreign 
""
I preside over the empowered committee 
""
My own feeling is  very large part of proposals
are  you will see the
beneficial effects of this on the countries exports
""
Even in terms  here of course I am
mentioning all the industrial enterpreneurs memoranda 
""
This includes the foreign investors and domestic investors 
filed with the secretariat of industrial approvals uptil August nineteen 
uh uptil 
""
They show that the total planned investment is 
lakhs  crores
""
""
And when these projects are completed there would be  a minimum
addition of over three million jobs  to the manufacturing sector
""
So the assumption that these  investments are going to take away
jobs is not correct
""
In fact they are going to add to the  amount of employment in
""
""
""
Sir I am grateful to you because you have allowed me sir
""
This is a very important question  and according to government
new industrial policy one thousand six hundred and fifty  uh proposal have
been received and cleared directly 
""
Sir may I know from the honourable minister  minister has
admitted that there are some regional 
""
Sir specially for the Eastern region sir the Bihar Orissa West
Bengal and other parts of the country  where the foreign investment flow
is very poor 
""
Will the minister see the matter seriously so that  the N R I
can ivest more and more money
""
""
This is uh  just two
minutes back
""
""
""
""
""
Sir  sir Bihar Orrissa and West Bengal whether the minister
will take up the matter with the  State government and the foreign
investors so that they can invest more and more money  and specially I
will ask for the Agro-based industry sir 
""
""
Yes  one word
""
""
""
Sir I interact  with the honourable chief ministers of many
states 
""
I find today  uh there is much greater awareness among the State
governments to create the requisite  climate in which investments will
flow  uh take the case of the West Bengal
 itself
""
West Bengal has put out an industrial policy statement which I
think is a forward looking documents
""
Today I think West Bengal is aggressively seeking foreign
investment
""
Honourable Somnath Chatterjee is not here
""
He had been to Australia  and when
he was asked the questions about the new industrial policy  he had stated
this is a 
""
""
Mr Finance Minister  your
praise of his 
a few words 
""
Yes Mr Chavan 
""
""
""
""
""
Mr Speaker sir
""
""
""
""
""
The foreign investors commercial board has cleared sixteen
fifty proposals 
""
But sir I complaint  that very few projects have started
functioning and there are no ground taking ceremonies 
""
The foreign investors are complaining that there is still  too
much of red tape 
""
I would like to ask the minister if there is a  machinery
within the government 
""
""
Sir  the honourable member is right there have been gap in
monitoring  we have ensured that the
secretariat of industrial approval in the ministry  will
monitor 
""
With regards to the actual in flow 
which  in the last three and a half years
the actual  crores
""
""
So it is not entirely correct  that these proposals are being
implemented 
""
Total amount of disbursement as of now  as a proportion of
approval  considering
that this policy has been in operations  only for nearly three years
""
""
Question hour is over
