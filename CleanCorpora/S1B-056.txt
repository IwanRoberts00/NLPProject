Question number one forty-three Shri Chitto
Basu 
( a) Whether exports are expected to register a twenty percent
growth rate during the current year ?
( b) Whether exports growth rate has declined below the targeted
growth rate during the current financial year ?
( c) If so the details of monthly growth legal rates of export
during the current year in comparison to the corresponding period for the
last year 
( d) The reasons for poor growth rate of exports and ( e) 
the steps taken to remedy the situation 
Sir question one four three the statement is laid on the
table of the house 
Sir uh from the statement it appears uh that there
has been wide fluctuations in the percentage growth rate of exports
 uh during the months April ninety-four to August ninety uh
August ninety-four 
Sir it was uh sometimes it declined to six percent in
August uh not in July it declined to six percent and the next
month it shoot up or it rose to twenty-four point six percent 
Sir it to me this phenomenon seems to be unusual
 and that also indicates that there has been some fundamentally
wrong and defective method in in this uh in the effort of the
governemnt to step up the exports 
May I know from the honourable minister what are those
fundamentally wrong and defective uh uh defects in the system ?
Uh if those systems have been id uh this if those
wrong fundamentally wrong defects have been identified and if identified
growth in the export in the month of April 
April it was twelve percent uhn 
May June July these three months it was single digit 
And thereafter it has started picking up August September and
October it has been more than twenty-four twenty-five twenty-seven
percent one or two words if you compare with
the figure of ninety-two ninety-three and this ninety-three recording
broken 
 Uhn 
 One or two words 
Two twenty-nine percent plans 
Therefore sometimes it happens 
One of the reason why it happen during this time mainly
because the engineering exports where one incentive scheme was
available to them we replaced it because the GATT subsidy which they
wish to have to meet the differences between the international
price and domestic price that was withdrawn from first of April 
So it had some impact and the contribution of engineering 
goods to the overall market is about twelve percent 
Because of local levy our rice became less
competitive
So the agricultural product particularly rice that also uh
rice export came down 
Because of shortage of cotton we had to reduce the exports of
cotton 
Therefore there has been some reasons one word analysis we
are making 
But corn case also it happened like that 
Therefore I do hope that at the end of the year 
there could be two one word if I take the average of the first
seven months the exports goods may not be fourteen fifteen percent 
But in this range from the August onwards it continues and
one good point that impact of plague which was thought that it would have
some adverse impact but from the figure of September October it indicates
that it is not so 
So if this trend continues then we may end with eighteen
nineteen percent growth
But there is nothing basically fundamentally wrong in the
system
Sir may I know from the honourable minister whether 
one or two words whether it is a fact that the government of late
has decided to slash down the export target for the year 
May I also further know from the honourable minister uh if not
 what is the target for the current year and uh whether it is
also a fact that uh the uh the tariff was on other forms of
resistances are being increased in our tradition of export market 
particularly in the United States of America 
If that is so how does the government propose to remedy that and
attain the target for the current year ?
Sir so far the target is concerned it is for the period of
the full five years that is to co-terminate with the one word 
From ninety-two ninety-seven the target was fixed in terms of
percentage that thirteen point six percent should be the enhancement
of export in volume terms in US dollar terms it should be around fifteen to
twenty percent 
And in absolute terms at the end of the terminal year our
exports should be thirty-three point five billion US dollar at the price
level of ninety-one ninety-two 
In order to achieve that target first year we could not reach 
ninety-two ninety-three our performance was little more than eighteen billion
US dollars 
Ninety-three ninety-four it is about twenty-two billion US
dollars 
Therefore informally I suggested that if we could reach a
target of twenty-five twenty-six billion US dollars in the year
ninety-four ninety-five
Perhaps with fifteen twenty percent step up we may reach the
target at the terminal year of the 8th plan thirty-three point five
billion 
That is the target we have
In regard to the question of having some uh restrictions of
export of some of the Indian products to US market one item is 
one word 
They have raised some issues which we are contesting but in
the first five months the overall trade of our exports to USA is
encouraging
There has been of the total share of US market in our
total exports upto April to October is about twenty-two percent 
Question number one forty-four 
( a) The number of proposals received and cleared during
nineteen ninety-three ninety-four for direct foreign investment in India
( b) The terms and conditions for the foreign investment 
( c) Whether foreign investment proposals have the potential of
export earnings and ( d) If so the anticipated export earnings from
foreign investment during the current five year plan 
( a) and ( b) during the calender year nineteen ninety-three
and the first ten months of nineteen ninety-four upto October one
thousand six hundred and fifty proposals for foreign direct investment have
been received and cleared and receiving foreign direct investment of
 rupees nineteen thousand six hundred and four point 
three six crores 
Proposals are cleared in terms of the new industrial policy
nineteen ninety-one 
( c) and ( d) sir yes sir however the date on amount of export
earnings anticipated from these projects is not centrally maintained 
Mr Speaker sir I have specica 
specifically asked for the terms and conditions 
The minister has given a short reply that there are for
the industrial policy of nineteen ninety-one 
Speaker sir it is good sign that about twenty
thousand crores of foreign investment is coming in one
year 
But at the si same time it
appears that there are bad side effects also because this
industry this investment there is a tendency to cluster around
 the metropolitan cities 
And because of that if we take the example of Bombay
itself the prices of local flats have increased from eight
hundred per square feet to five thousand rupees per
square feet because of foreign investors and foreign people coming
It is for their executives 
On the one hand and on the other hand because of lot 
 of lot of labour employment there will be growth of uh 
 zhuggis 
 What is your question Mr ?
Sir I would like to know from the honourable minister 
whether this foreign investors are being encouraged are being asked to
 set up their industries in the newly uh decided growth
centres of countries which are in remote areas 
So what is the incentive being given to them and what 
is are the guidelines for that ?
Mr Speaker sir in one word industrial policy 
statement of July nineteen ninety-one government had explicitly stated
 that environmental protection measures will be taken to ensure
that there is no concentration of industries in the metropolitan cities
And that Act is kept in view while sanctioning approval 
So I cannot agree with this opposition that Bombay is uh
suffering because too much of invest foreign direct investment
is coming it is certainly true that Bombay's attractiveness as a
financial centre has increased
That certainly has put pressure on land prices 
I think there is a way to deal with that
We have existing uh restrictions uh on land transactions
which in my view I think are having bad adverse effects
Well the answer to that is not that we should uh prevent the
growth of Bombay as one of the worlds' leading financial centre 
Mr Speaker sir I had also asked about the quantum of
 export earnings that may be obtained after the full
investement 
But it has been answered that such data is not being
maintained 
My specific query was because there is a general apprehension
 that the foreign investors are coming to invest in India 
looking mainly towards the local domestic market and that's
 why after the domestic market is flooded with uh the
industrial goods of the for foreign 
investors the local industries will also suffer 
That is the apprehension and that's why what measures
are being taken I would like to know for uh keeping this foreign
investors in line with others and for asking them to export certain
 quota of goods produced in their industry
Sir eighty percents of the approvals of foreign direct
investment since the introduction of the new policy uptil October
nineteen ninety-four have been in the priority sector which are
 mentioned in the annexe three of the industrial policy statement of July
 ninety-one 
These apparel oil refineries electronics chemical
and food processing telecommunication transportation industrial
 machinery
So the assumption that large segment of this investment is
going to consumer goods or nonessential goods is simply not correct
Even where in certain cases we ha 
have allowed uh foreign investement in consumer goods 
We have ensured that there will be an obligation on the part of
those investors to ensure that their export earnings will match 
the dividends outflow for the period of one word 
Also I would uh further like to mention it is not
possible to uh mention or to calculate at this stage what will be 
the foreign ex foreign exchange earnings 
I preside over the empowered committee 
My own feeling is that is very large part of proposals
are directly export oriented and in years to come you will see the
beneficial effects of this on the countries exports
Even in terms of employment uh here of course I am
mentioning all the industrial enterpreneurs memoranda 
This includes the foreign investors and domestic investors 
filed with the secretariat of industrial approvals uptil August nineteen 
uh uptil Sep October nineteen ninety-four 
They show that the total planned investment is three 
lakhs twenty-five thousand five hundred eighty crores
 
And when these projects are completed there would be a minimum
addition of over three million jobs to the manufacturing sector
So the assumption that these investments are going to take away
jobs is not correct
In fact they are going to add to the amount of employment in
 Indias' manufacturing sector 
Sir I am grateful to you because you have allowed me sir
This is a very important question and according to government
new industrial policy one thousand six hundred and fifty uh proposal have
been received and cleared directly from the Central government 
Sir may I know from the honourable minister minister has
admitted that there are some regional imbalances 
Sir specially for the Eastern region sir the Bihar Orissa West
Bengal and other parts of the country where the foreign investment flow
is very poor 
Will the minister see the matter seriously so that the N R I
can ivest more and more money
This is uh this is replied to sir just two
minutes back
 Sir 
Sir sir Bihar Orrissa and West Bengal whether the minister
will take up the matter with the State government and the foreign
investors so that they can invest more and more money and specially I
will ask for the Agro-based industry sir 
Yes will you persuade the State government one word
 
Sir I interact with the honourable chief ministers of many
states 
I find today uh there is much greater awareness among the State
governments to create the requisite climate in which investments will
flow and I believe for examples uh take the case of the West Bengal
 itself
West Bengal has put out an industrial policy statement which I
think is a forward looking documents
Today I think West Bengal is aggressively seeking foreign
investment
Honourable Somnath Chatterjee is not here
He had been to Australia he had been to Singapore and when
he was asked the questions about the new industrial policy he had stated
this is a a few words noise 
Mr Finance Minister Mr finance minister your your
praise of his should not create problem for this house noise 
a few words 
Yes Mr Chavan 
 Aap sunlein to pata chal jata hai 
Mr Speaker sir
 Is ka jawab mil gaya 
The foreign investors commercial board has cleared sixteen
fifty proposals with twenty thousands co-investments 
But sir I complaint that very few projects have started
functioning and there are no ground taking ceremonies 
The foreign investors are complaining that there is still too
much of red tape 
I would like to ask the minister if there is a machinery
within the government to monitor the progress of these units 
Sir the honourable member is right there have been gap in
monitoring but in the last few months we have ensured that the
secretariat of industrial approval in the ministry of industry will
monitor these proposals 
With regards to the actual in flow as against the approval 
which my colleague had mentioned in the last three and a half years
the actual disbursement has exceeded five thousand crores
So it is not entirely correct that these proposals are being
implemented 
Total amount of disbursement as of now as a proportion of
approval are about twenty-three percent which is not bad considering
that this policy has been in operations only for nearly three years
Question hour is over
