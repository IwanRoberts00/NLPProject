A few weeks ago 
""
Now 
""
We don't know whether  or going to
vanish 
""
What I learnt  that
this was eradicated in nineteen fifty-six  but it has resurfaced after
twenty-eight years 
""
 of my generation
today think 
at the end of the last century  and over twelve point five million people
had died 
""
But now it is again here
""
There is total confusion
""
""
""
There is panic 
""
 eminent doctors here today to
discuss  and the cure
""
To know whether it is going to 
""
Now let me introduce the panel to you 
""
To the extreme left 
""
He is medical suprintendent of the Safdar Jung hospital here 
""
Next to him  from the All India Institute
of Medical Sciences  Director of
the National Institute of Communicable Diseases 
""
Now 
this disease  how it
has come back  ?
""
""
Actually  known to
be associated uh with uh  two word
""
""
So the plague means epidemic 
""
""
It is not true that uh  been able to eradicate plague
""
in India is nineteen 
""
But what  told that you know after nineteen fifty-six
we  I mean confirmed evidence of human plague
""
""
But  rodent inflicting
disease 
""
To know that the 
""
Now one of the importance  which covered safety
""
because 
""
Another important focus is Maharashtra  one word
""
""
You know we had focus site in in Madhya Pradesh  uhm uhm and
some other areas 
""
But basically 
""
It continues to live in India 
""
And plague is known to come 
""
And how  period what
is there you know it could be in decade 
""
And nobody knows exactly 
""
And not only it resurfaced in India it has resurfaced in many other
countries also 
""
As  even in nineteen ninety-two was
this organisation has reported plague  human plague from nine countries
""
""
So is it here to  stay now ?
""
""
 say ?
""
""
 because the
human plague uh would be definitely brought under control 
""
And uh  occurred
 it was sympton that there is a need for a continous monitoring of the
situation 
""
We know that  uh a plague surveillance in the
National Institute of Communicable Disease at Bangalore  which insisted
there is some  I don't know if they control measure for
plague 
""
We had another even if they uh uhm  a few words
""
""
Uh but as that ceased to function after nineteen eighty-seven 
""
Though uh  from the National Institute of Communicable Disease
we can see the focal point for uh 
""
 told them that
the that the plague control is continue to policy of the power in India 
""
It was also recomended  uh inter-state
co-ordination committee meeting which was held in nineteen ninety-three
""
""
I strongly remember  when it was sell that the plague
 because
if you said  what is happening in the
""
""
Because uh we don't have any picture  uh uh what is happening uh
""
""
But did we know that uh it has  it can occur in India ?
""
""
Yes 
""
As  been
""
""
No because you see  that
was on September fourteenth
""
And four plague cases were detected in Beed 
""
It was dismissed 
""
In the respective states government said it is not 
""
Even N I C D said there was nothing 
""
And all of a sudden some four five days later  we heard from
Surat 
""
People are running away 
""
""
 not true
""
 communicable disease actually
""
""
Confirmed to the 
""
Actually the  the first uh the the reported thing of of the
clinical  that
was on twenty-sixth of August 
""
Then  you know the delegates of this planning of
Beed district  then they approached the local medical college
""
They came  they saw even most of the doctors have not seen a
case of plague 
""
They saw the cases
""
They collected some critical material 
""
They collected uh some rat also which was sent to the Haffkin
institute 
""
And and the local medical college 
not a case of plague 
""
But thesis continue to to 
""
And not only that the rat fall also continued to occur 
""
Then uh  then they actually I got a
telephonic message from from uhm uhm from  two
words  one
assistant in where in understanding the problem
""
""
And that they detected as early as September 
""
""
So second September immedietly I requested them you send the
 collected
""
They suspected four cases 
""
They collected four set of samples  and has been
""
""
Uh uh how did that 
""
""
So that I kept the 
""
We told them that the uh it is uh you send uh 
""
We informed them that there is positive for plague on sixth 
""
And immediately they started distributing the contraband 
""
But in the Beed  what has happened they took very
good anti-plague measure  exchange house
to house salvage
""
So the situation was coming under control 
""
But unfortunately  there is something you know which occured you
know first confirmation it came to us  it was on twentieth of September
""
 some couple of cases and I
""
""
Excuse me Dr Dutta
""
""
Yeah 
""
""
Can I ask you one question
""
""
Yeah 
""
""
Have you has the 
because it has occured about the earthquake 
""
Can you explain it 
""
""
""
Actually you know when the last earthquake when this
earthquake occured in Latur  not it
was only one team
""
Our team went there
""
We can held the 
""
And we made  forecast
""
That forecast in the sense that we told them  that because this
particular their case is is unknown of  focal
""
There may be focal  there
""
Idea struck like focus was there  and now because of the
earthquake because of echo disturbence  one
word 
""
So keep a watch on this
""
And I would  not be surprised that we gain certainly
""
But that is not there is rodant uh uh  plague and infections how
could in  domestic area and human being affected
""
We made them 
""
Not only we told them in our report  we also published in in the
science section 
""
""
""
""
""
Should I try to put it in 
""
""
""
""
""
See uhm 
""
And it is transmitted from rodant to  another rodant through
fleece 
""
Man is not required for 
""
And uh in the world you would find that fossil of plague are
present  and they
are present in other country 
""
And uh  present in India
""
So  man is not required for the
transmission 
""
 which is carried
from one rodant to another rodant through the fleece 
been there are some disturbances  like
uh the milk boiling over  that the plague infects a man
""
""
 matlab jo khet
ka chuha hai  ke
aadmi aadmi se 
""
What is it that we talk about  plague ?
""
""
So  tell
about the
""
""
""
""
""
Yeah Dr Rattan
""
""
So what 
""
It is basically 
""
Man is an incidental 
""
But suppose a variety of  disease have all
other  type of
plague 
develop 
and it has develop demand  into
the  because by near about the drop in infection
""
Becomes rather sick  as a
support which it nearly get
""
It is the beginning
""
""
 matlab aapke kahne ka matlab hai ke agar
chuhe ke hi  se jo ke khet ka chuha hai aam chuha nahi
""
what 
worst 
""
Can  can we prevent it ?
""
""
Yeah
""
You see what happens is 
wild rodant they travel to liven rodant 
""
Rodant which are nearer to domestic 
""
So as uh Dr Dutta was mentioning about 
 from the wild to liven rodant
which come in contact with human being 
""
And from domestic rodant 
""
Once it starts it could 
""
That means  there are
swelling 
""
And uh 
""
In about five to ten percent of cases  it goes on to the blood
""
So it becomes ceptic in 
""
While only in about five percent of cases it becomes neumonic
""
It goes to the lungs 
""
Then it is infectious to man 
""
Then it becomes a very dangerous plague  and it is infectious
from man to man
""
""
 khe khet wale se aam chuhe ko
hota hai
""
Aam chuha jo kat ta hai ya use jo  jo safed
hote hai woh jo kat te hain nabbe pratishat  mei woh
niche wale hisse mei rah jate hai
""
Aur agar woh paanch pratishat uske baad agar woh chadta hai khoon
mei ajata hai aur baki jo 
neumonic plague  Dilli mei bhi hai jaise
 main woh
 matlab
baatcheet karne mei ya usme phailta hai woh 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Before we go into that  was the
clinical presentation of 
that's 
""
""
""
""
""
So that will  as he has
already told  it is it is this fleece which
bites a rodant  one or two word
""
""
So that when  they were when lies on the
""
""
So it was dependent area 
""
So it is found that  from there
it infection grows  period is there
""
If there were two two 
""
""
Okay 
""
""
If  so the base
uh 
 one word
 group
""
""
What is the is do you come to know when the fleece bites you
 ?
""
""
 not very much noticed
about it because it is 
""
And uh  we'll
 find about it
""
The neumonic  generally
when the first of the rodant it comes with a fleece of band 
""
Generally it comes with the neumonic type of because whenever it
it is  one
word 
leaning drip  they gone
 we've
""
""
""
""
""
""
Any worst  and the
patient generally feels disordered belly  within very short time
within twenty-four hours 
enlarge  with all sign
 one word
""
""
""
What what are the other symptons  through which a common
can come to know of it because
""
""
Generally  a fever which
 fever is very high rate of temperature and the patient
becomes an extremly frustrated and  and often there is a
""
 that he doesn't
want to move  and this whole area about the gland is inflate red
 a few
