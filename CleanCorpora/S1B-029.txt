A few weeks ago we didn't know about plague 
Now it's here 
We don't know whether it's here to stay or going to
vanish 
What I learnt and most of us here today learnt that
this was eradicated in nineteen fifty-six but it has resurfaced after
twenty-eight years 
 Most of most people of my generation
today think that it had just occured way back in 
at the end of the last century and over twelve point five million people
had died 
But now it is again here
There is total confusion
 It's spreading 
There is panic 
 We've a panel of eminent doctors here today to
discuss the cause and the cure
To know whether it is going to stay or be controlled 
Now let me introduce the panel to you 
To the extreme left is Dr B Chakravarty 
He is medical suprintendent of the Safdar Jung hospital here 
Next to him is Dr Ashok Rattan from the All India Institute
of Medical Sciences and just next to me is Dr K K Dutta Director of
the National Institute of Communicable Diseases 
Now we'll like to know from Dr Dutta that 
this disease we everybody thought that it has been eradicated how it
has come back ?
Actually plague is is known to
be associated uh with uh epidemic not only epidemic two word
So the plague means epidemic plague means one word 
It is not true that uh we've been able to eradicate plague
 uh though the last human case of plague is in nineteen 
in India is nineteen fifty-six 
But what we've told that you know after nineteen fifty-six
we we don't have a evidence I mean confirmed evidence of human plague
But we've uh the evidence of uh rodent inflicting
disease 
To know that the rats were a few words 
Now one of the importance one word which covered safety
 in Andhra Pradesh Tamil Nadu and Karnataka a few words 
because two words see adjoining areas anymore 
Another important focus is Maharashtra another one word
 Himachal Pradesh 
You know we had focus site in in Madhya Pradesh uhm uhm and
some other areas 
But basically a few words is existing in India 
It continues to live in India 
And plague is known to come inside 
And how what is the e one word period what
is there you know it could be in decade it could be few years 
And nobody knows exactly 
And not only it resurfaced in India it has resurfaced in many other
countries also 
As I'm one word even in nineteen ninety-two was
this organisation has reported plague human plague from nine countries
So is it here to stay now ?
 What do you what do the N I C 
 say ?
 I'll not say that it is going to stay because the
human plague uh would be definitely brought under control 
And uh once the human plague is in district occurred
 it was sympton that there is a need for a continous monitoring of the
situation 
We know that we've uh a plague surveillance in the
National Institute of Communicable Disease at Bangalore which insisted
there is some violence I don't know if they control measure for
plague in the in the adjoining cities 
We had another even if they uh uhm I mean uhm I a few words
 one unit was working in Maharashtra 
Uh but as that ceased to function after nineteen eighty-seven 
Though uh from the National Institute of Communicable Disease
we can see the focal point for uh plague uh monitoring 
 We've warned actually we've told them that
the that the plague control is continue to policy of the power in India 
It was also recomended the last uh inter-state
co-ordination committee meeting which was held in nineteen ninety-three
I strongly remember sell when it was sell that the plague
 contrareversal contra repulsion of the a few words because
if you said a few words we do not know what is happening in the
 in the one word 
Because uh we don't have any picture uh uh what is happening uh
But did we know that uh it has it can occur in India ?
Yes because the plague is known to occur in cycle 
As we've been
No because you see when we first heard from date that
was on September fourteenth
And four plague cases were detected in Beed 
It was dismissed 
In the respective states government said it is not 
Even N I C D said there was nothing 
And all of a sudden some four five days later we heard from
Surat that people are dying there 
People are running away 
 That's not true
 That's not one word communicable disease actually
Confirmed to the the organisation of plague in Beed 
Actually the the first uh the the reported thing of of the
clinical one word which occurred in one word that
was on twenty-sixth of August 
Then they've you know the delegates of this planning of
Beed district then they approached the local medical college
They came they saw even most of the doctors have not seen a
case of plague 
They saw the cases
They collected some critical material a few words 
They collected uh some rat also which was sent to the Haffkin
institute 
And and the local medical college they declared it's 
not a case of plague 
But thesis continue to to uh to occur 
And not only that the rat fall also continued to occur 
Then uh uhm they asked our help then they actually I got a
telephonic message from from uhm uhm from joined director of two
words on second of September that uh they want uh one
assistant in where in understanding the problem
And that they detected as early as September 
So second September immedietly I requested them you send the
 some of sample which you've collected
They suspected four cases 
They collected four set of samples and has been
Uh uh how did that one word 
So that I kept the two words 
We told them that the uh it is uh you send uh 
We informed them that there is positive for plague on sixth 
And immediately they started distributing the contraband 
But in the Beed one word what has happened they took very
good anti-plague measure then uh then one word exchange house
to house salvage
So the situation was coming under control 
But unfortunately there is something you know which occured you
know first confirmation it came to us it was on twentieth of September
 We've some couple of cases and I
Excuse me Dr Dutta
Yeah 
Can I ask you one question
Yeah 
Have you has the frequent relation with an earthquake 
because it has occured about the earthquake 
Can you explain it whe whe whether 
 it has one or two words 
Actually you know when the last earthquake when this
earthquake occured in Latur our investigative team that's not it
was only one team
Our team went there
We can held the one word 
And we made the a a forecast
That forecast in the sense that we told them that because this
particular their case is is unknown of one word focal
There may be focal one word there
Idea struck like focus was there and now because of the
earthquake because of echo disturbence that've occured this one
word will start migrating in different directions 
So keep a watch on this
And I would we'll not be surprised that we gain certainly
But that is not there is rodant uh uh plague and infections how
could in few word domestic area and human being affected
We made them 
Not only we told them in our report we also published in in the
science section 
 Accha 
Should I try to put it in one word 
 Yeah doctor 
See uhm plague is a disease of the rodant 
And it is transmitted from rodant to another rodant through
fleece 
Man is not required for it's transmission 
And uh in the world you would find that fossil of plague are
present uh in America and they are present in U S S R and they
are present in other country 
And uh it's also present in India
So it's there that man is not required for the
transmission 
 It's uh a disease of the rodant which is carried
from one rodant to another rodant through the fleece and it's 
been there are some disturbances when they fell over it's like
uh the milk boiling over that the plague infects a man
 To aap ke kahne ka matlab hai ke matlab jo khet
ka chuha hai woh usse phailta hai it's not ke
aadmi aadmi se plague phailta hai 
What is it that we talk about bubonic plague ?
So that's what I would like to tell
about the
 One or two words 
Yeah Dr Rattan
So what Dr has told about is very correct 
It is basically a disease of rodant 
Man is an incidental bit 
But suppose a variety of well uh this uh disease have all
other one word a plague suppose a bubonic type of
plague where the all the plague has occured uh which is uh 
develop one word uh there is a fact it has larva 
and it has develop demand at this time man can one word into
the one word because by near about the drop in infection
Becomes rather sick so the bacteria are being stored as a
support which it nearly get
It is the beginning
 Matlab matlab aapke kahne ka matlab hai ke agar
chuhe ke hi state se jo ke khet ka chuha hai aam chuha nahi
 agar usi ke state se use rok diya jaye to 
what we're facing today the bubonic plague which is the 
worst among the three plagues we hear about 
Can can we prevent it ?
Yeah
You see what happens is that from uh from the rodant 
wild rodant they travel to liven rodant 
Rodant which are nearer to domestic 
So as uh Dr Dutta was mentioning about one word plate 
 one word plate is in the wild uh from the wild to liven rodant
which come in contact with human being domestic rodant gets infection 
And from domestic rodant we get infection 
Once it starts it could stop only at debonic plague 
That means we would in the envinal region there are
swelling or in the one word they are swelling 
And uh it stops there in ninety percent of cases 
In about five to ten percent of cases it goes on to the blood
So it becomes ceptic in it's one word 
While only in about five percent of cases it becomes neumonic
It goes to the lungs 
Then it is infectious to man 
Then it becomes a very dangerous plague and it is infectious
from man to man
 Matlab jab chuha khe khet wale se aam chuhe ko
hota hai
Aam chuha jo kat ta hai ya use jo fleece jo safed
hote hai woh jo kat te hain nabbe pratishat cases mei woh
niche wale hisse mei rah jate hai
Aur agar woh paanch pratishat uske baad agar woh chadta hai khoon
mei ajata hai aur baki jo worst cases hai jo 
neumonic plague hum kahte hain jo aaj kal Dilli mei bhi hai jaise
 cases jo do huve hain kuch cases main woh
 lungs mei chala jata hai aur hum thook se matlab
baatcheet karne mei ya usme phailta hai woh 
 A few words I would just tell 
 A few words 
Before we go into that we'll observe how was the
clinical presentation of yeah doctor how does it produce 
that's very important thing 
 Yeah doctor 
So that will we've to do one word as he has
already told that uh actually it is it is this fleece which
bites a rodant and that in this fleece have got the one or two word
 out what and what to do a few words 
So that when they'll bite they were when lies on the
 uh ground or while walking in the leg area 
So it was dependent area 
So it is found that cough if fleece bite from there
it infection grows and the one word period is there
If there were two two one word 
Okay 
If there're two two cases so the base
uh whenever the first thing that this fleece sort of one word 
 and other thing and they doesn't doesn't divide your one word
 group
What is the is do you come to know when the fleece bites you
 ?
 It's well it's not very much noticed
about it because it is uh it goes unnoticed 
And uh one word three types of presentation we'll
 find about it
The neumonic neumonic one word but generally
when the first of the rodant it comes with a fleece of band 
Generally it comes with the neumonic type of because whenever it
it is bi biting and then by one
word emphatic and the the lean note which is 
leaning drip note that gives you even by the delayed they gone
 lean note gone in the sense uhm uhm while we've
 the a few words regular affected 
 Uhm uhm 
Any worst one word so this is the way and the
patient generally feels disordered belly hence within very short time
within twenty-four hours he feels pain and the gland is swollen 
enlarge and he becomes excruciating painful about it with all sign
 about improvision and other signs also particularly one word
 other things around it 
What what are the other symptons through which a common
can come to know of it because
Generally it's the it's a fever which
 one word fever is very high rate of temperature and the patient
becomes an extremly frustrated and one word and often there is a
 one or two word dead I'm telling of neumonic death 
 one word becomes very tender acuted this much so that he doesn't
want to move to a and this whole area about the gland is inflate red
 and there is vegetal harmones also some sort of uh a few
words
