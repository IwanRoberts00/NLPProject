I think you know something about credit cards
 
The way in which a credit cards card 
 is issued to customer and the means in which you can use
the credit card 
Basically a credit card is an unsecured loan
 given by any bank or financial institution 
When a bank is going to issue a credit card we
say they have a strong certain capital base 
We or bank's fundemental aspects behind which a 
credit card company runs is the requirement of working
capital 
So banks can draft the fund from other departments and uh
 that's how issuing this credit card 
Let me tell you about the proper method credit card
 is issued 
See basically as I told tell you it's an unsecured loan
We don't require any uh what do you call as deposit or any
advances against issue of credit card 
All the customer has to do is to give some documents proving
his income 
And we have certain criteria for procurement of uh issuing that
 credit cards 
 Let's suppose it's a salaried customer 
he had to have a minimum gross salary of fifty thousand per annum
 and thirty-six thousand per month 
So this is for master card and visa
card 
We also have another card called the diners club card
 
So the premium have a value card it's about uh if
it is a salaried guy he had to have an income of fifty thousand that
is the take home and the gross of ninety-six thousand 
So these are basically two views one is the verification view
 and other is judgemental view 
Who has taken unsecured loan we have to verify as to the genuinity
of the customer 
He might for all you know he might going to be your
credit runner 
So the person you have to pick is that that are really
executives whether he is really capable of holding credit
cards because the banks stake is involved in it 
And we have cases of two words worth lakhs
 of rupees 
So the first thing that we require for that guy is to 
fulfill our income criteria 
If he fulfills that we have to fix some verification criteria
So the first thing that we do is clear application 
We have what you call as direct sales agent 
So these guys go and get application from a major company 
and uh big shop partnerships and all that 
So as soon as they clear applications and get them signed with
all the documents they are submitted to a certified public accountant
He may call us metro city
They submit all app or the application to the metro city 
And the metro city gives them to uh C P I in Madras, whom we
call as a noddle certified public accountant and uh that noddle 
certified public accountant verifies after the completing of the
application whether they have fulfill the criteria manually and uh
data enters them onto the computers which are in the system and at the
end of the day he takes down them as a dbase file 
And at the end of the day he transmit this through a modem to
Trivandrum 
And everyday evening this transmission gets into progress
And after this gets downloaded into citibank systems we have to
convert it into our database and we have to issue the database upto work
table 
So we have to run certain programmes they are called odi
programmes or what you call end of the programme 
After all these programmes are run these database downloaded
into our system 
And next day morning they will be available for verification 
So the datas here and the application will come in the
next day morning 
As soon as they come we have a process of what is called as
moving an application to an approval stage 
We have a different stage 
Suppose uh uh applicant doesn't given give
 his date of birth 
It is a mandatory field
We have certain mandatory field
Suppose if he has not given his address 
Suppose if he has not given his date of birth 
If you suppose if he has not given his income we have a mandatory
field which are compulsory for any application 
So everyday a programme is run 
And uh the pointer looks up these certain fields and if these are
not fulfilled it throws them into a certain station 
Okay
And uh if this check is fulfilled it moves to another stage
 where you call a credit scoring programme as such
Based on the age of the applicant on his financial status 
on his uh assets worth on the type of vehicle he own 
owns there were funny fundemental tid bits 
And taking all these into account a certain score is assigned
to a customer 
Suppose he fails to score he will never be given a card 
And uh suppose he crosses that score he moves to another stage
called a de-duplicative stage 
So all you know a customer might apply once again he may be
already having a card 
And uh he might apply once again to get another card 
And there might be a chance of fraud 
So to rule out these cases cases of fraud we have certain
programmes what is called as de-duplication programme 
We have a database of around four lakh fifty
thousand members 
Around two lakh members and one lakh
 fifty thousand applicant plus some one lakh in
our work table 
So our database or or what you call uh members
 addresses and all these are totally on birthday base 
So let's say these data gets matched against any of
these 
 Let's say date of birth or address or anything it
is it goes to a certain status and any officer concerned has to
look into it why why is it that ?
For all you know me and my friend could have a same date of
birth but we are different persons 
So we have to look uh this is same person 
And suppose these are different he has to clearly 
clear uhm de-duplication programme 
And after they cleared it it goes to credit verification stage 
Okay and uh the credit verification stage is sometimes all about
 the verification of the application towards its completeness 
towards the income criteria and certain how it consist criterias 
 consists of criteria which I mean the credit card
 man may subcribe 
So we have to look for all these things and suppose if it
is fulfilled we move to a different status 
And then two parallel process go on 
One is the fiscal reputaion criteria and the other one is the
bank verification criteria 
Suppose uh for certain categories of applicant we have
different categories of verification based on their deliquency and
their past performance 
We have a we have taken a from how these portfolio
perform 
And based on their performance of these portfolio we have
induced a certain verification criteria 
So suppose uh let's say if it is salaried person we
have to perform our own verification 
Suppose if you contact in a public limited company here the
credit runner is much less you know public limited company
We have to check for the person has he really applied for a
card 
You see the person who has really applied for the card and
certain checks over it
We have to check about a few words 
Yeah he may cross that stage 
And then suppose it is self employed we have to do a bank reference
So this bank reference tell you all about the customer whether 
he has any bounce cheques what is his nominal balance 
So this will provide you valuable clues as to how he could perform
on your account 
So after this has proved being pushed the application get
certain status and after all this is done we issue a card 
As soon as the card is issued based on the source of
accumulation the billing is done 
 The there are five different types of clause of
acquisition 
One is the direct sales agency 
The other one has got a cross road application 
Suppose if he is already a diner clubs card number we sell him a
 visa card or master card across the billing 
Or when he gets the bill he gets these kind of application he
is into the cross road 
The third one is take on take on and there customers have
been short finale 
So he all the customer has to do is come and pick up the
application fill up all this and if he fulfills the criteria he is
given the card 
And there are two three other ways in which a card is issued
So these are the different ways in which application is closed
So based on the source of application the billing is different 
So as soon as these are entered a card is endorsed at
 on the third day as soon as application is approved
So as soon as the card is approved it goes to the customer on
a second day 
Lately by third day the card get endorsed 
The next day the card reaches the customer 
And if you want to withdraw cash from what do you call as the
automatic teller-machine or anytime money A T M he has to get the card
encoded 
There is a certain uhm personal identification number
which you give to a customer 
Only that customer holds that number and on then only he
uses that number in the A T M he can withdraw money from that A T M 
So he has to get the card encoded in the A T M and then
you can use the car card for cash
withdrawl 
For purchases a customer need not get his card encoded he
can just walk over to any shop which accepts our cards 
Those are called member establishment 
So here he just walk over to a shop buy anything and then
charge his card against it 
We have what you call as charge list 
Suppose a customer goes and buys uh certain products okay
And uh he has to submit the card 
We have certain enrollment for every merchant establishment based
on their performances and their deliquencies 
So let's say a jewellery shop is a high risk area
So every charge that is booked in a jewellery shop should
be authorised by city bank 
So every time a charge come to a jewellery shop the 
member establishment has to call up city bank to take an authorisation code
which is an online real time system 
So certain fields are looked for and the card number is looked for
So suppose the card number is data entered in that 
It immediately looks for customers account its credit open to
buy and how much is the credit line and how much has he utilised it 
And there are certain checks towards it wh 
 whether he has any bounce cheques in his account 
So it looks for very synthetic field and that either approves
it or reject it 
If it is a if it is approved or certain code is
generated 
And the the code is given to the member establishment
He has to write it down on that stamp slip on his copy
There are three copies atleast one to the card member one to the
city bank and one to member 
So he has to write the authorisation code on that card
state bank submitted to city bank 
I mean when there is an authorisation code the charge will be
valid 
Only in case of flow limit higher than what a fixed deposit
has given 
In case he has charges below the flow limit accepted by city bank
he will not take an authorisation 
He can just give the charge to one word and 
submit to city bank to get payment within two or three days 
The main reason why uh charge required to be authorise is
because of the delin deliquency of
customer,
Let me suppose a customer has a credit line of only twenty-five
thousand and he has applied sixty thousand and he hasn't paid us till
now so we can't allow the customer to use the card and keep piling on
the deliquency or the raise up raise debt getting accumulated 
So we have to serve him certain point of time 
So let us say a customer goes deliquent and his account is blocked
here 
When these customers their tendencies it's 
normally to go and buy something above the flow limit 
So when they go above the flow limit the merchant ordinarly
takes the authorisation from the city bank 
So let's if an authorisation is declined the one
word of charges declined and in certain cases where there are more
sensitive cases we pick up the card 
And if the card is picked up from a merchant establishment the
merchant gets a an award of thousand rupees or put on
 it's depending on the value of the outstanding of the customer 
So these merchants help about in uh quite a good way 
And another way where we detect fraud is about uh another
 sensitive areas where these customers go is to the A T M 
So these customers go and try to withdraw money from the A T M 
So what we do is we block his account to the A T M 
And uh at the end of the day we transfer certain file 
As soon as these files are tranfered to the A T M through a modem
 any card that is black listed or hot listed in the A T M if it
is inserted into a A T M counter the card gets wall out 
You can never get the card back 
The only way that you can get the card get back you should get
reinstated or to get a new card 
So these are some ways where fraud is being detected or
is being controlled 
And the money that we made is on discount that we get from
member establishment 
So let's say this is called the plastic money and
everybody profess not to carry money and they prefer to carry only
credit card 
So we go negotiate with member establishment to accept
our cards 
What is the benefit for a member establishment ?
He has a larger customer base 
And what is the benefit for city bank ?
We get a discount of two point three percent 
Uh let's say a customer goes and buys goods worth
 rupees hundred rupees okay
And suppose the member establishment submit the charge to
us we pay him only the amount less the discount on
which there it is agreed
