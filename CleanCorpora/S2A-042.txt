I think you know something about  credit cards
""
""
The way in which a 
 and the means in which you can use
the 
""
Basically a  is an unsecured loan
""
""
When a bank is going to issue a  we
say they have a strong 
""
We or 
credit card  is the requirement of working
capital 
""
So  and uh
""
""
""
Let me tell you about the proper method  credit card
""
""
See basically  an unsecured loan
""
""
We don't require any  or any
advances against issue of 
""
All the customer has to do is to give some documents  proving
his income 
""
And we have certain criteria for procurement of uh  issuing that
""
""
""
he had to have a minimum  per annum
""
""
So this is for  visa
card 
""
We also have another card called the  diners club card
""
""
So the premium have a value card  if
it is a salaried guy  that
is the take home and the gross of ninety-six thousand 
""
So these are  basically two views one is the verification view
""
""
Who has taken unsecured loan we have to verify as to the genuinity
of the customer 
""
He might  be your
credit runner 
""
So the person you have to pick is that  that are really
executives  credit
cards 
""
And we have cases of  lakhs
""
""
So the first thing that we require for that guy 
fulfill our income criteria 
""
If he fulfills that  we have to fix some verification criteria
""
""
So 
""
We have what you call as direct sales agent 
""
So these guys go and get application 
and uh big shop partnerships and all that 
""
So as soon as they  clear applications and get them signed with
all the documents  certified public accountant
""
""
He may call us metro city
""
They submit all app 
""
And the metro city gives them to  uh C P I in Madras, whom we
call as a noddle certified public accountant 
certified public accountant  verifies after the completing of the
application  and uh
data enters them onto the computers which are in the system  and at the
end of the day 
""
And at the end of the day he transmit this through a modem  to
Trivandrum 
""
And everyday evening  into progress
""
And after this gets downloaded into citibank systems  we have to
convert it into our database  and we have to issue the database upto work
table 
""
So we have to run certain programmes  they are called odi
programmes or what you call end of the programme 
""
After all these programmes are run  these database downloaded
into our system 
""
And next day morning they will be available for verification 
""
So the datas here  the
next day morning 
""
As soon as they come  we have a process of what is called as
moving an application to an approval stage 
""
We have a different stage 
""
Suppose uh  give
""
""
It is a mandatory field
""
We have certain mandatory field
""
Suppose if he has not given his address 
""
Suppose if he has not given his date of birth 
""
If you suppose if he has not given his income we have a mandatory
field which are compulsory for any application 
""
So everyday a programme is run 
""
And uh the pointer looks up these certain fields and if these are
not fulfilled 
""
Okay
""
And uh  check is fulfilled it moves to another stage
 where you call a credit scoring programme as such
""
Based on the age of the applicant 
on his uh 
owns 
""
And taking  all these into account a certain score is assigned
to a customer 
""
Suppose he fails to score he will never be given a card 
""
And uh suppose he crosses that score he moves to another  stage
called a de-duplicative stage 
""
So all you know  a customer might apply once again he may be
already having a card 
""
And uh 
""
And there might be a chance of fraud 
""
So to rule out these  cases of fraud we have certain
programmes what is called as de-duplication programme 
""
We have a database of around four  fifty
thousand members 
""
Around two  lakh
 in
our work table 
""
So our  members
""
""
So  gets matched against any of
these 
""
 it
is  and any officer concerned has to
look into it  ?
""
For all you know  me and my friend could have a same date of
birth 
""
So we have to look uh this is same person 
""
And suppose these are different he has to 
clear 
""
And after they cleared it it goes to credit verification stage 
""
Okay and uh the credit verification stage is sometimes all about
""
towards the income criteria and certain how it 
 credit card
""
""
So we have to look for all these  and suppose if it
is fulfilled we move to a different status 
""
And then two parallel process go on 
""
One is the fiscal reputaion criteria  and the other one is the
bank verification criteria 
""
Suppose uh  categories of applicant we have
different categories of  deliquency and
their past performance 
""
We have a  portfolio
perform 
""
And based on their performance of these portfolio  we have
induced a certain verification criteria 
""
So suppose  say if it is salaried person we
have to perform our own verification 
""
Suppose  here the
credit runner is much less you know public limited company
""
We have to  has he really applied for a
card 
""
You see the person who has really applied for the card  and
certain checks over it
""
We have to check about 
""
Yeah he may cross that stage 
""
And then suppose it is self employed we have to do a bank reference
""
""
So this bank reference tell you all about the customer whether 
he has any bounce cheques 
""
So this will provide you valuable clues as to how he could perform
on your account 
""
So after this has proved  being pushed the application get
certain status 
""
As soon as the card is issued  based on the source of
accumulation the billing is done 
""
 five different types of clause of
acquisition 
""
One is the direct sales agency 
""
The other one has got a 
""
Suppose if he is already a diner clubs card number we sell him a
""
""
Or when he gets the bill he gets these kind of application  he
is into the 
""
The third one is take on  and there customers have
been short finale 
""
So he all  the customer has to do is come and pick up the
application  and if he fulfills the criteria he is
given the card 
""
And there are two three other ways in which a card is issued
""
So these are the  different ways in which application is closed
""
""
So based on the source of application the billing is different 
""
So as soon as these are entered  at
 as soon as application is approved
""
""
So  as soon as the card is approved it goes to the customer on
a second day 
""
Lately by third day the card get endorsed 
""
The next day 
""
And if you want to withdraw cash from what do you call as the
automatic teller-machine or anytime money A T M  he has to get the card
encoded 
""
There is a certain  identification number
which you give to a customer 
""
Only that customer holds that number and  then only he
uses that number in the A T M he can withdraw money from that A T M 
""
So  and then
you can use the  for cash
withdrawl 
""
For purchases  he
can just walk over to any shop which accepts our cards 
""
Those are called member establishment 
""
So here he just walk over to a shop  buy anything and then
charge his card against it 
""
We have what you call as charge list 
""
Suppose a customer goes and buys uh certain products  okay
""
And uh 
""
We have certain enrollment for every merchant establishment based
on their performances and their deliquencies 
""
So  a jewellery shop is a high risk area
""
""
So every  should
be authorised by city bank 
""
So every time a charge come to a jewellery shop 
member establishment has to call up city bank to take an authorisation code
which is an online real time system 
""
So certain fields are looked for and the card number is looked for
""
""
So suppose the card number is data entered in that 
""
It immediately looks for customers account  its credit open to
buy 
""
And there are certain checks towards it 
""
""
So it looks for very synthetic field  and that either approves
it 
""
If it is a  or certain code is
generated 
""
And the the code is given to the member establishment
""
He has to write it down on that stamp slip  on his copy
""
There are three copies atleast one to the card member one to the
city bank and one to member 
""
So  authorisation code on that card
state bank submitted to city bank 
""
I mean when there is an authorisation code the charge will be
valid 
""
Only in case of flow limit higher than  what a fixed deposit
has given 
""
In case he has charges below the flow limit accepted by city bank
he will not take an authorisation 
""
He can just 
submit to city bank to get payment within two or three days 
""
The main reason why  uh charge required to be authorise is
because of the  of
customer,
""
Let me suppose a customer has a credit line of only twenty-five
thousand  and he hasn't paid us till
now  so we can't allow the customer to use the card and keep piling on
the 
""
So we have to serve him certain point of time 
""
So let us say a customer goes deliquent and his account is blocked
here 
""
When 
normally to go and buy something above the flow limit 
""
So when they go above the flow limit the merchant  ordinarly
takes the 
""
So  one
word  and in certain cases where there are more
sensitive cases we pick up the card 
""
And if the card is picked up from a merchant establishment the
merchant gets a  or put on
""
""
So these merchants help about in uh 
""
And another way where we detect fraud is  about uh another
""
""
So these customers go and try to withdraw money from the A T M 
""
So what we do is we block his account to the A T M 
""
And uh at the end of the day we transfer certain file 
""
As soon as these files are tranfered to the A T M through a modem
 if it
is inserted into a A T M counter 
""
You can never get the card back 
""
The only way that you can get the card get back you should get
reinstated 
""
So these are some ways where  or
is being controlled 
""
And the money that we made is on  discount that we get from
member establishment 
""
So  this is called the plastic money and
everybody profess  and they prefer to carry only
credit card 
""
So we  negotiate with member establishment to accept
our cards 
""
What is the benefit for a member establishment  ?
""
He has a larger customer base 
""
And what is the benefit for city bank  ?
""
We get a discount of two point three percent 
""
Uh  goods worth
 okay
""
And  member establishment submit the charge to
us  less the discount on
which there
