I think you know something about  credit cards
""
""
The way in which a 
""
the 
""
""
""
""
When a bank is going to issue a  we
""
""
We or 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
his income 
""
""
""
""
""
he had to have a minimum  per annum
""
""
So this is for  visa
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Who has taken unsecured loan we have to verify as to the genuinity
of the customer 
""
""
credit runner 
""
So the person you have to pick is that  that are really
executives  credit
""
""
""
""
""
So the first thing that we require for that guy 
""
""
If he fulfills that  we have to fix some verification criteria
""
""
""
""
We have what you call as direct sales agent 
""
""
""
""
""
all the documents  certified public accountant
""
""
He may call us metro city
""
""
""
And the metro city gives them to  uh C P I in Madras, whom we
""
certified public accountant  verifies after the completing of the
""
""
end of the day 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
programmes or what you call end of the programme 
""
""
into our system 
""
And next day morning they will be available for verification 
""
So the datas here  the
next day morning 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
We have certain mandatory field
""
""
""
""
""
If you suppose if he has not given his income we have a mandatory
""
""
""
""
""
not fulfilled 
""
Okay
""
And uh  check is fulfilled it moves to another stage
""
""
Based on the age of the applicant 
""
owns 
""
And taking  all these into account a certain score is assigned
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
And uh 
""
And there might be a chance of fraud 
""
""
""
""
""
thousand members 
""
""
 in
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
 it
""
look into it  ?
""
""
birth 
""
So we have to look uh this is same person 
""
""
clear 
""
""
""
""
""
towards the income criteria and certain how it 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Suppose uh  categories of applicant we have
different categories of  deliquency and
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
So suppose  say if it is salaried person we
""
""
Suppose  here the
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
So this bank reference tell you all about the customer whether 
he has any bounce cheques 
""
So this will provide you valuable clues as to how he could perform
""
""
""
""
""
As soon as the card is issued  based on the source of
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
The other one has got a 
""
Suppose if he is already a diner clubs card number we sell him a
""
""
Or when he gets the bill he gets these kind of application  he
""
""
""
""
""
""
application  and if he fulfills the criteria he is
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
So based on the source of application the billing is different 
""
""
 as soon as application is approved
""
""
So  as soon as the card is approved it goes to the customer on
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
which you give to a customer 
""
Only that customer holds that number and  then only he
uses that number in the A T M he can withdraw money from that A T M 
""
So  and then
""
withdrawl 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
We have what you call as charge list 
""
Suppose a customer goes and buys uh certain products  okay
""
And uh 
""
""
on their performances and their deliquencies 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
So every time a charge come to a jewellery shop 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
it 
""
""
generated 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
So  authorisation code on that card
""
""
""
valid 
""
""
has given 
""
""
he will not take an authorisation 
""
""
""
""
""
because of the  of
""
""
""
thousand  and he hasn't paid us till
""
the 
""
So we have to serve him certain point of time 
""
So let us say a customer goes deliquent and his account is blocked
here 
""
When 
normally to go and buy something above the flow limit 
""
""
takes the 
""
So  one
""
""
""
And if the card is picked up from a merchant establishment the
""
""
""
So these merchants help about in uh 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
 if it
""
""
""
""
""
reinstated 
""
""
is being controlled 
""
""
member establishment 
""
So  this is called the plastic money and
""
""
""
""
our cards 
""
""
""
""
""
And what is the benefit for city bank  ?
""
""
""
""
""
""
And  member establishment submit the charge to
""
""
