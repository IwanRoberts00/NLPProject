""
My  be
""
""
I have divided that according to my learned friend  the case in
two parts 
""
One is scene 
""
Same 
""
I have uh 
""
Now Sir  Your
Honour  has read the evidence
and 
""
Yes Sir I will be I will be giving a written statement argument also
""
""
Yes Sir 
""
Yes Sir 
""
No no Sir  no no it is ready Sir
""
""
It is in my 
""
Size Sir 
""
No no Sir your 
""
My handwriting uh my my my handwriting is very clear Sir 
""
Alright Sir 
""
""
""
Doesn't matter Sir 
""
""
""
On the same point 
""
Your Honour may 
interruption 
""
Yes Yes Sir 
when I am commenting on his  then Your
Honour will take 
""
Because at present I am arguing from my own 
I'm 
""
Now Sir as as my learned friend has put it  for three hundred
and two 
""
The first eye witness is  Iyengar Pandu
""
""
And the 
""
The second is 
""
Third is  Nasreem
""
""
These are the four persons
""
Now 
""
""
son of the deceased 
""
My submission is Sir  is out to help the
Prosecution being 
as well as 
""
So as his 
""
These are interested witness Sir 
""
But Sir 
""
I I 
interruption 
""
Yes Sir 
""
I  Sir few
things I will have to admit Sir 
""
One 
has been assaulted 
""
""
We don't dispute that 
""
""
There is also no dispute 
""
""
Who assaulted
""
""
Who assaulted 
""
 accused number six one part accused number
""
""
Yes Sir
""
So 
""
Yes Sir  whether
these witnesses 
trustworthy witnesses 
accused number two and three 
""
This is 
""
Now the first thing is Sir 
""
Because Sir  uh it is
on their evidence  and his mother
 they also
followed 
""
So in that case  on
three four eighty-eight Sir 
""
As my learned friend has pointed out that officer were very alert
enough 
""
But  this
P W seven 
 hospital
Sir 
""
 and available to
them in hospital  alert enough to examine all the
eye witnesses 
 police station but same
day 
""
I am talking of the same day 
""
But though Your Honour will assign that the statement of 
Santosh 
""
Why 
""
My submission is Sir 
""
Time is not given 
""
On on  not
mentioned Sir 
""
But date is date is four four 
""
""
""
The date is four four 
""
Time not mentioned Sir 
""
I sent to the return services there Sir  but I have seen it and
uh 
""
Yes Sir 
""
Anyway Sir 
""
Now why this why this delay of one day Sir 
""
My submission is Sir  when they
recorded the statement  Arif
 they recorded
the statement of these P W  and
""
""
In their statements  they had not emphatically
""
Iyengar 
""
Their names were not given 
""
Therefore  give the names
of these 
""
Further these 
assailants 
""
They were known  and P W
three 
""
Because  in that labour camp locality
 they want to put
 number two and three in the in the mouth
""
""
And therefore my submission is Sir 
who being a blood relation is one thing  he is out to uh uh say that this
uh  and another thing is is that he is under the
thumb of the these 
""
I specially name number two and three 
""
And therefore this delay as I 
""
Yes beg your pardon Sir 
""
So he has he has named it 
""
Because Sir they wanted to  involve
 statement has
been 
""
Yes Sir 
""
Now Sir let us see  evidence
""
""
What type of evidence on record has been 
""
Now he has 
assaulted my father by knife  uh Sir
it is uh  line eighteen to twenty Your Honour
""
""
Seventy-five Sir 
""
Ha  with knife
""
was assaulted by 
""
So 
""
Now Sir if if he  then he should
tell Sir on which part 
""
As Sir 
that accused number one 
 hands and
legs 
""
So 
""
In his case if he had really seen it Sir  my submission is Sir
that  part
""
But he does not give Sir
""
He said I don't recollect 
""
But recollection I mean uh 
for  these are
the only two  we
have to 
""
Now this this also Sir 
 uh in the
""
""
It is one ninety-seven Sir 
""
One ninety-seven 
""
Page one ninety-seven Your Honour 
""
No  sorry sorry is this this uh contradiction is not
proved 
""
This contradiction was not proved 
""
""
""
Then Sir further up  uh at page seventy-five only Sir line
twenty 
""
He says Sir 
""
 nobody from
 to help
""
the uh members of the public  that they will kill them
""
""
This implement is is proved but 
""
At page one ninety-seven  from below
""
""
One ninety-seven line three from below Sir 
""
Uh uh P W seven did not disclose 
before  that
accused  two
absconding accused threaten 
""
""
Public 
""
""
""
Because it is not mentioned there 
""
Yes Sir 
""
Sir this this contradiction has been has been proved 
""
That he has not said 
""
Sir this this is  a
before this honourable court Sir 
""
Yes Sir 
""
Then further Sir 
""
I I narrated the the incident to them 
""
This is this is at uh page seventy-six Your Honour 
""
I narrated the incident to the to them  that my father was
assaulted 
""
However I did not utter the names of the assailants 
""
Now Sir  of the assailants
 and
tells this I mean part uh uh 
""
So he has seen the incident
""
If he had seen the incident 
""
My submission is Sir  if he has not given the
names that means  or he has seen some
persons whose names he did not know 
""
This this this can be only two possibilities 
""
Then Sir  to
nineteen eighteen and nineteen Your Honour 
""
Yes Your  lines were drawn on the ground by
chalk 
""
Yes 
""
Yes 
""
So  and now Your Honour will see will see Sir that all other
witnesses 
 who has
produced that 
""
It was cardboard 
""
Everybody says that it was a cardboard  and uh specially this
""
""
And therefore Sir  when this man says Sir that
knife is gone on the on on the ground 
""
That means this also shows Sir  Sir he was
not present at the 
""
Because 
""
Now about  Sir he has he has stated before
""
""
For playing the game  line
seven eleven  Kadu
""
""
 eight
 small stones and cardboard are are required
""
""
The above  uh above mentioned material which are
required for playing the game 
""
He has stated 
""
So actually it was a cardboard  request
states  ground
""
That means he has not 
""
He was not at the scene of offence Sir 
""
Then further up Sir 
""
Then I come to the the the uh another eye witness P W eight Sir
""
""
""
He is a 
mechanic 
""
He admits that he does not have any 
regular 
""
He only learnt from his brother  who is a who is a radiator
mechanic 
""
He is carrying on his business  on pavement at Karnaik Bandar
Sir
""
That is there in the evidence Sir 
""
He he does not  for his
 business
""
That is at page 
""
""
Now Sir  that too
on on the path pavement  he must have at least a some
some place  to carry on business because it it can't be carried out on on
just on the road Sir 
""
This is the in make making uh  repairy
""
""
If he if he has got a shop or a place then he must have a licence
for that
""
He doesn't possess anything 
""
He has stated Sir 
""
He said I was he was carrying on the business on on  he was
carrying on the business on pavement 
""
Sir pavement also doesn't doesn't mean that he shouldn't have any
licence Sir 
""
He says carrying on the business Sir carrying on the 
any business Sir anywhere 
""
Licence is required B M C licence is required  interruption
""
""
Offence 
""
Oh yes Sir
""
 charged him
""
""
Without licence 
""
On didn't say 
""
So  Sir this
man doesn't produce any evidence to show that he has he is carrying 
interruption 
""
He is carrying on the business 
""
Yes 
""
He doesn't possess any document 
""
Therefore whether really he is carrying on such a business  is
not proved Sir 
""
Now Sir  wa
 that he hasn't got any any uh
uh regard for the truth Sir 
version 
""
For that  take Your
Honour 
""
He yes uh at page eighty-three Your Honour  line
nineteen 
""
""
per 
""
He said this 
""
Then Sir 
""
Of 
""
Now I said  that
two other 
N H S 
""
So he make changes in this Sir 
""
Yes Sir
""
Then then oh 
then there is no necessity to change Sir 
""
I understand Sir why it is changed 
""
""
Because Sir  uh
audience  that you have you have
""
""
So they must have put extra fingers instead of three 
""
So he said two persons 
""
Why why he why he doesn't say in the same second line only 
interruption 
""
That is my argument
""
He is you take it or or leave it 
""
Then Sir  the
version  in in
yesterday day it doesn't effect  refused to
open the gate gate
""
This is at page uh ninety-three Your Honour 
""
The version narrated by me in 
to the effect that after  I'd
""
Yogendra 
""
He is 
""
He is incorrect 
""
He is not correct 
""
So he admits Sir  was was not
correct 
""
Therefore I want I am just pointing out Sir  uh what regard he
has for the truth truth Sir
""
He himself admits that yesterday the uh whatever I stated  was
not correct 
""
So my submission is Sir that evidence of such a man Sir  who
hasn't got any  uh with
pinch of 
""
Yes Sir 
""
Then Sir 
""
""
Point is Sir 
interruption 
""
You are saying Sir 
""
I I I am reading  I saw
""
""
Line is like like this Sir when I was standing there I saw 
Kadu  was
being brought 
""
So uh I just wanted to uh show these two lines only  that he
was brought on stretcher by by by members of the public  then two lines
below thereafter Sir I had a talk with
