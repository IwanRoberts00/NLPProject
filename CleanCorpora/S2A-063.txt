My my line of argument will be Sir that I'll be
 dealing with a case against me 
I have divided that according to my learned friend the case in
two parts 
One is scene two and one scene seven 
Same uh witnesses 
I have uh I have divided 
Now Sir according to I need not tell Your Honour Your
Honour is well aware Your Honour is uh has read the evidence
and well aware of the the prosecution interruption 
Yes Sir I will be I will be giving a written statement argument also
 interruption

It is in my interruption 
Size Sir it wil be Sir I interruption 
No no Sir your 
My handwriting uh my my my handwriting is very clear Sir 
Alright Sir I'll I'll get it typed 
 I'll get it typed I'll get it typed Sir 
Doesn't matter Sir I'll get it interruption 
 I'll argue orally orally also 
On the same point interruption 
Your Honour may at present Your Honour may not take 
interruption 
Yes Yes Sir at present Your Honour may not take when I 
when I am commenting on his argument from the note then Your
Honour will take 
Because at present I am arguing from my own note which 
I'm going to present to Your Honour Yes interruption 
Now Sir as as my learned friend has put it for three hundred
and two four wi eye witnesses are there Sir 
The first eye witness is Santosh Iyengar Pandu
 who is the son of deceased 
And the the rest three are there Sir 
The second is Arif Jauhar 
Third is Kadu Timothy and fourth is Nasreem
 Shafi 
These are the four persons
Now I'll I will take one by one 
 I'll take uh uh P W seven Santosh 
son of the deceased Iyengar Sir 
My submission is Sir that this witness is out to help the
Prosecution being the blood relation of uh Iyengar 
as well as Kadu Achari 
So as his sister's son interruption 
These are interested witness Sir interruption 
But Sir unfortunately unfortunately yes Sir 
I I I'm not I am interruption yes Sir 
interruption 
Yes Sir 
I I'm not saying I I I am I am alluding Sir few
things I will have to admit Sir 
One one of these is the one the the uh Iyengar 
has been assaulted and his death has been caused 
We don't dispute that 
There is also no dispute interruption 
Who assaulted
Who assaulted yes interruption 
 Haan accused number six one part accused number
 interruption 
Yes Sir
So wha interruption 
Yes Sir what and we have taken and whether whether
these witnesses who have who have come here and deposed are 
trustworthy witnesses in favour of accused number against 
accused number two and three 
This is way I'm I'm going to start 
Now the first thing is Sir why he insisted witness 
Because Sir they all are uh being close rela uh it is
on their evidence that this uh Santosh and his mother
 after Iyengar was removed to the hospital they also
followed and went to the hospital 
So in that case Santosh was in the hospital on
three four eighty-eight Sir 
As my learned friend has pointed out that officer were very alert
enough they have examined the eye witnesses on that same day 
But Your Honour will see Sir that the evidence of this
P W seven has not been re recorded 
 on on three four though he was available and present in hospital
Sir interruption 
 Santosh though he was present and available to
them in hospital and they were very alert enough to examine all the
eye witnesses on the same day if not if uh in the hospital Sir 
 in in in in the in the police station but same
day 
I am talking of the same day 
But though Your Honour will assign that the statement of 
Santosh has been recorded on four four eighty-eight next day Sir 
Why why this this uh has been postponed Sir 
My submission is Sir interruption 
Time is not given 
On on I have seen that the original time is not not
mentioned Sir 
But date is date is four four interruption 
 santosh Sir in Marathi 
The date is four four eighty-eight 
Time not mentioned Sir 
I sent to the return services there Sir but I have seen it and
uh I didn't find it 
Yes Sir 
Anyway Sir 
Now why this why this delay of one day Sir interruption 
My submission is Sir that the officers when they
recorded the statement of eye witnesses specially this Arif
 Kadu and such interruption when they recorded
the statement of these P W Arif Jauhar Kadu Timothy and
 Nasreen 
In their statements they were not they had not emphatically
 said about the assault on seven two and three on 
Iyengar 
Their names were not given 
Therefore they wanted somebody to give the names
of these two assailants 
Further these these two assai 
assailants there according to the prosecution 
They were known to Kadu uh Achari and P W
three Kadamma 
Because they have seen them in that labour camp locality
 and they were knowing the names and therefore they want to put
 put these names of names of number two and three in the in the mouth
 of P W seven and therefore this delay of one day Sir 
And therefore my submission is Sir that he he is a witness 
who being a blood relation is one thing he is out to uh uh say that this
uh both these persons and another thing is is that he is under the
thumb of the these these two police to say what they want to say 
I specially name number two and three 
And therefore this delay as I I have already told 
Yes beg your pardon Sir interruption 
So he has he has named it three persons only Sir 
Because Sir they wanted to in involve
 these persons and therefore uh his uh statement has
been delayed interruption 
Yes Sir recorder is underneath 
Now Sir let us see the e ev evidence
 on record Sir 
What type of evidence on record has been recorded Sir 
Now he has he has stated Sir that the Big Umesh 
assaulted my father by knife I do not recollect on which uh Sir
it is uh page page seventy-five line eighteen to twenty Your Honour
 interruption 
Seventy-five Sir 
Ha Big Umesh assaulted my father with knife
 I do not recollect on which portion of the body of my father 
was assaulted by Big Umesh 
So I 
Now Sir if if he if he has seen the assault then he should
tell Sir on which part 
As Sir Your Honour will will see Sir here he has given 
that accused number one assaulted Iy 
 Iyengar on chest stomach chest hands and
legs 
So he'd he'd given given definite part 
In his case if he had really seen it Sir my submission is Sir
that he he he should have given the part
But he does not give Sir
He said I don't recollect 
But recollection I mean uh that that can't be any reason 
for whether whether he has seen it or not seen it that is these are
the only two que questions we can we
have to answer Sir 
Now this this also Sir uh uh is an imp 
 improvement and uh omission has been proved uh in the
 in in the statement uh Your Honour I will tell one minute 
It is one ninety-seven Sir 
One ninety-seven 
Page one ninety-seven Your Honour 
No I'm sorry sorry is this this uh contradiction is not
proved 
This contradiction was not proved 
 I'm sorry 
Then Sir further up uh at page seventy-five only Sir line
twenty twenty to twenty-two Sir 
He says Sir 
 Even my father was crying for help nobody from
 from the neighbour aaa neighbouring area came forward to help
 as N H uh N H S and his associates were threatening 
the uh members of the public by saying that that they will kill them
 they will kill them 
This implement is is proved but yet I'm sorry Sir 
At page one ninety-seven line three Sir from below
One ninety-seven line three from below Sir 
Uh uh P W seven did not disclose be be 
before me that when when his statement was recorded that
accused num uh that and that uh that the two
absconding accused threaten the members of the pu 
 public while interruption 
Public that's all interruption 
 Haan by that time Sir 
Because it is not mentioned there interruption 
Yes Sir 
Sir this this contradiction has been has been proved 
That he has not said stated so 
Sir this this is this is definitely a improvement a
before this honourable court Sir interruption 
Yes Sir 
Then further Sir 
I I narrated the the incident to them 
This is this is at uh page seventy-six Your Honour 
I narrated the incident to the to them that my father was
assaulted 
However I did not utter the names of the assailants 
Now Sir if he has not given the names of the assailants
 then immediately after the assault he goes to the mother and and
tells this I mean part uh uh tells this information 
So he has seen the incident
If he had seen the incident he could have given the names 
My submission is Sir that time if he has not given the
names that means either he has not seen them Sir or he has seen some
persons whose names he did not know 
This this this can be only two possibilities 
Then Sir page seventy-eight line eighteen to
nineteen eighteen and nineteen Your Honour interruption 
Yes Your Hon uh lines were drawn on the ground by
chalk 
Yes yes Sir interruption 
Yes 
So and now Your Honour will see will see Sir that all other
witnesses specially Ka Kadu 
 P W nine Sir Because he is the person who has who has
produced that Challa game board 
It was cardboard 
Everybody says that it was a cardboard and uh specially this
 Kadu he has produced that cardboard 
And therefore Sir this man when this man says Sir that
knife is gone on the on on the ground and then in the square 
That means this also shows Sir that he has not Sir he was
not present at the at the scene of offence 
Because what is the fact he does not know Sir 
Now about Kadu Timothy Sir he has he has stated before
 the this honourable court Sir 
For playing the game the the that is at ninety-seven line
seven eleven seven to eleven Sir in the in the statement of Kadu
 Sir 
 For playing the game of Challa eight
 kaudis small stones and cardboard are are required
The above mat uh above mentioned material which are
required for playing the game were produced by me 
He has stated 
So actually it was a cardboard when this request
states that lines were drawn on the ground
That means he has not seen the 
He was not at the scene of offence Sir 
Then further up Sir 
Then I come to the the the uh another eye witness P W eight Sir
 Ar Arif Jauhar 
He is a ra ra ra radiator 
mechanic ra ready to repairer Sir 
He admits that he does not have any re 
regular training in radiator repairing 
He only learnt from his brother who is a who is a radiator
mechanic 
He is carrying on his business on pavement at Karnaik Bandar
Sir
That is there in the evidence Sir 
He he does not he he does not possess any licence for his
 business
That is at page eigh eighty-nine 
 Your Honour 
Now Sir if a person is carrying a business that too
on on the path pavement then he must he must have at least a some
some place to carry on business because it it can't be carried out on on
just on the road Sir 
This is the in make making uh radiator radiator repairy
If he if he has got a shop or a place then he must have a licence
for that
He doesn't possess anything any document 
He has stated Sir I will just point out interruption 
He said I was he was carrying on the business on on he was
carrying on the business on pavement interruption pavement 
Sir pavement also doesn't doesn't mean that he shouldn't have any
licence Sir interruption 
He says carrying on the business Sir carrying on the bus 
any business Sir anywhere that is licence is required 
Licence is required B M C licence is required interruption
Offence 
Oh yes Sir
 po po po policeman charged him
 for not not not carrying the interruption 
Without licence interruption 
On didn't say Sir 
So therefo therefore Sir this
man doesn't produce any evidence to show that he has he is carrying 
interruption 
He is carrying on the business 
Yes 
He doesn't possess any document 
Therefore whether really he is carrying on such a business is
not proved Sir 
Now Sir another thing about this witness I I wa
 I want to say Sir that he hasn't got any any uh
uh regard for the truth Sir because he changes the mat 
version in just in a second or or sentence for 
For that I'll I'll point I'll take Your
Honour 
He yes uh at page eighty-three Your Honour uh at uh line
nineteen and twenty-two Sir 
 Iyengar was was also assaulted by three more 
per associates of N H S 
He said this 
Then Sir interruption 
Of N H uh N H S interruption 
Now I said that then in the next he said now I say that
two other re remaining associates of 
N H S a a a also assaulted Iyengar 
So he make changes in this Sir interruption 
Yes Sir
Then then oh if he has he has seen a certain incident 
then there is no necessity to change Sir 
I understand Sir why it is changed I'll I'll 
 I'll tell Your Honour 
Because Sir he must have got some some help or some uh
audience and note carefully Sir who just that you have you have
 doing something wrong 
So they must have put extra fingers instead of three 
So he said two persons 
Why why he why he doesn't say in the same second line only 
interruption 
That is my argument
He is you take it or or leave it interruption 
Then Sir a question was put to him Sir that the
version na narrated by me in in
yesterday day it doesn't effect that after after gateman refused to
open the gate gate
This is at page uh ninety-three Your Honour 
The version narrated by me in yesterday's evidence 
to the effect that after gateman refused to open the gate I'd
 got down from the motor taxi and went to the shop of 
Yogendra 
He is haan Yogendra 
He is incorrect 
He is not correct 
So he admits Sir what he has stated yesterday was was not
correct 
Therefore I want I am just pointing out Sir uh what regard he
has for the truth truth Sir
He himself admits that yesterday the uh whatever I stated was
not correct 
So my submission is Sir that evidence of such a man Sir who
hasn't got any any regard for the truth should be taken with uh with
pinch of 
Yes Sir 
Then Sir the about the inj about injuries to 
 Kadu Achari Sir P W one 
Point is Sir about the injuries he has mentioned 
interruption 
You are saying Sir 
I I I am reading when when I was standing there I I saw
 ka interruption 
Line is like like this Sir when I was standing there I saw 
Kadu Kadappa Achari Kadu Kadappa was
being brought there on stretcher 
So uh I just wanted to uh show these two lines only that he
was brought on stretcher by by by members of the public then two lines
below thereafter Sir I had a talk with Kadu Achari
