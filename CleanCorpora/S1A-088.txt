<I>
Uh let me try with myself 
 I'm Dr Mrs Parekar
I am working here as lecturer from five years in the department
of History
And let me her introduce herself
Myself Dr Padmaja Patil 
Uh working in the department of History from uh eight to
nine years
Uh sometimes as a research assistant and afterwards that is from
from four years
 I'm working as a lecturer in the department of history 
She is very close friend of mine sir uh
And here is different uh in our to the opinion no opinion
but if she says sir that is she is uh all they are living in the 
one word 
And I'm living in the Dhule area so laughter 
No if give different in friendship sir
 No no 
It is not making but it is uh uh giving some uh
alternate shape to thinking
I think so no ?
Uh because there are so many problems in uh villages
That I'm same we are working in same place
 
 That's very good oh 
But there are so many different problems and so many different
thinking 
Uh in that different categories and different social views sir 
And she will talk about something no ?
No apart from that we are good friends na 
 Nai that's not a problem
 And no she came from different background I came
from another background uh 
But still on some problem specially women problem 
 haan this is the very current and controversial issue in
this country uhm we know
But considering that point our views are equal our views are
similar I think uhm 
So uh 
Let us talk on anything because we are friends in that context 
 uh 
So uh for let us start from this department uhm
Here uh you are teaching so many papers no ?
So out of that which paper do you like to teach more ?
 Uh 
 Haan 
 Uhm 
 Uhm 
 Uh 
 Uhm 
I want to like because uh my specialisation in Modern India
Uhm
And I want to study it and I want to dis discover
out some research work on the Modern Indian History uhm 
mainly on the uh problems of women
And recently there was some uh women problems and there is uh women
policy uh that is uh declared by government of Maharashtra
And there are so many problems related to the village woman
particularly
And these women uh village women are not knowing anything about
it
Now because of it
 Uhm 
Just just a minute
Uhm
Uh I'm interested to know whether in your
syllabus the paper which you are teaching uhm Modern Indian
History is there any topic which has been uh recommended 
 uhm by the committee specially based on women problems ?
 Uhm 
 Uhm 
Yes
There are a all in all Indian history from Ancient to
Modern yes there are one topic uhm in
every paper
In Ancient Indian History in Medieval Indian History in the uh
Peshwa period or we can say in Maratha period yes yes and
also in the uh Modern Indian History
But in modern Indian history specially it was concentrated that is
their development and social movement in nineteen century women problem in
Maharashtra all over India
In Bengal movement and there was Young one word movement
coming from England
And the Rajaram Mohan Roy it's progress
And then he was discussing thinking his views on that
And that uh topic is here in the Modern Indian History
 Yes 
 Uhm 
 Yes yes 
Okay it means you think that as the topic has been included
here 
So our students they will learn
They will come to know about the problems of women in India 
 uh 
But do you think that these uh problem of Indian women
especially uh 
It has its roots right from ancient period because I'm 
teaching Ancient Indian History
And I'm interested in it
So when we start from the age of Vedas uhm or
more than that if we uh goes back to much earlier period no doubt 
Indian history goes back to much earlier period 
But right from the age of Ri Rigveda I have ample
truth that the status of women or the position of women uh it has been
fixed uh
 Manhje though the people say that in the age
of Rigveda we don't get secondary status of women or like that but I
don't agree with them 
 Manhje though there are references to 
Gadgi and Maitreyi and 
So many women those who are uh tho 
those uh got the opportunity to learn
But apart from that in uh considering with Vedic sacrifices and
all other things I feel that status of women was secondary
And Vedic age was a base manhje when we come
to modern Indian history or modern civi uh how
complex is history
 Uh 
 Uh 
 Uhm 
 Maitri yeah 
 Women's status 
 No that was uh 
Medieval Indian history also
Yeah
Because of the invasion of the Moghals
No I know very little about Medieval period 
 During that time also there was also supression
of woman because of the that that is the invasion of Moghals in
India and that was mainly on in north India because they invaded
south Afghanistan and two words because that impact was on north
India mainly
That was not in south India
So there was so many other societies which were women apart
from other field
No doubt there are some impact on all religions on caste and on
this religion
They were started the purdah system 
uhm not giving exhibition to the women and during that in the home only
not giving outside them permission to go outside
That was the same thing in Medieval period
And when there was started Modern Indian History and then new ideas
came from West 
Therefore some impact in the thinking of our individual that who
were taken the modern Indian education that is not English education
And because of there was something strange in nineteen century
And that was concentrated in our syllabus only
Okay in this way we have added all these things in our
syllabus uhm that our student manhje 
 uhm our syllabus had been constructed in this manner
That right from ancient period to modern period the students
should have a link link manhje 
 Uhm 
 Uhm 
 Link 
What is the development of one's 
 Haan when we talk on once
 Haan 
When we talk on or linking between the development of
women from ancient to modern till now 
And they have concentrated
They have to work on that research or anything
Or thinking because uh historian or any man living in this
time thinking about the ancient period and he is linking the scene between
the things happened on the human behaviour
Or the development of human behaviour 
That is most important thing also 
 Yeah yeah 
No considering uhm this syllabus we are 
 uhm uhm quite satisfied uhm but uh have
you seen recently the various types of advertisements on the T V and
 Uhm 
 Uhm 
 Uhm 
 There are so many advertisements
 Haan but considering that I feel that
 uh we are deliberately making haan 
 the status of women secondary
 Haan 
 Women 
 Haan 
Means how the standard of uh women has been exposed
there I don't like this
That is the commercial purpose no ?
In commercial purpose every company or every advertising expose a
bit thinking only benefit of their product
 Manhje for every
And because of that because of they are doing and we are
permitting them always because one lady has even that uh photo copies
no ?
Yeah manhje 
That is why our main impulsion we are giving we
are also contributing them
 That is very recently that 
Madhu Sapre is that
 Indirectly 
Madhu Sapre is one of the representative of us 
No doubt she is a model
No after all laughs 
But she is representing us no 
Although expressing 
 We can't change yeah we can't
change her views though she afterward thinking about that I'm 
not doing it purposefully and that is 
But that is purpose commercial she wants to acquire money by that
way 
 Yeah 
Look commercial purpose is okay I can understand it
But on one side you say that women lib when we talk of women
liberation and secondary status of women and on other side we are
allowing them ah yes to express to expose
 Ah yes 
 Nai nai women is permitting them gents
Yeah
Even well they are taking such a poses and such photos if she
denies it 
How they were able to take it 
Because if you will look at all the ac actresses 
 uhm mainly Marathi actresses they are that Mamta Kulkarni and
Shilpa Shirodkar 
 Uhm 
 Always there is a rule
It is a shameful thing I think manhje 
It is shameful laughs thing but it is
Yeah
Being men focussed by men but ladies also giving 
pro protection by girls also that is they want so uh become
something hero 
And because of that they exposing even they themselves only 
Uhm no but uh what is your experience about your uh
village ladies and village girls specially
Uh village girls
Those who are taking education now a days
No what is the problem
Women
Only then one uh thinking going on in the mothers of
that girl that there are so many uh one word 
changes no not changes and because of that my son will marry with educated
person
 Changes 
Okay
And so she will take the education
That is not another thing because educated uh b 
bridegroom want the educated girl because they mostly live in city
And there is a a natural feeling in the all girls and also their
mother and family members in their mind that there was a well
behaved educated and there must be well man must be working in the city
level not in the villages because there are so many problems in villages
There are so many they send that girl in the farm 
They don't want no ?
Because of that each have a feeling going on that uh girls
must be given some higher education till their marriage not for
there one word that is wrong that is not 
Because she must marry with doctors so they are permitting
them to go into medical college for D H M H or B A M A only that one 
They are not giving development to their career that is my
point 
No but you feel that all these new ideas and this
modernisation in every aspect uhm manhje 
not only considering pressure uhm because village girls
they are more modern they are making quite modern now a days 
 uhm 
Not like but uh this modernisation of thinking in that context
I am talking 
So whether they uhm they are well acquainted with these ideas
 because all women are like this
 Uhm 
 Uhm 
 They are 
 Uhm 
Never never because there is a lack of one word
 lack of rea reading there are no never they a book 
though they are uh matriculate 
They never read any paper any book any magazine
Only they sometime go into the meetings that is the uh
some uh festival 
 Ahm they have T Vs and 
 No uh no but I think the impact of television
 on a village woman 
 Television that is quite high 
 Manhje at every evening that
after completion of their 
 That is not changing in the thinking ability it
is changing in the only their uh entertainment
 
Yeah 
They want entertainment
 Haan 
 Not actually one word 
 They just want these movies and when the news
will start they will just stop 
 Will stop haan 
They will stop the T V
And they will go for their work in the house
 
Yes 
They
Only they will see movies and dancing programmes and
other programmes like this some uh good family programme 
 Programme 
They also thinking about their
They are inte interested only with this 
 That is not emotional feeling that is
emotional feeling only 
 
Reading habits must help because of the feeling
isn't yes what do you think 
 Ah haan 
 Yes 
Yes uh uhm that is why if anyone that
is a 
 Uhm 
 
 Uh 
 Easily stopped na not in this
context nobody is reading now a days 
That is not the case with village girls or village women 
in cities also you know I feel uh this uh problem mainly with my
son 
Now he is in in uh third standard 
But uh just from seven or seven-thirty he used to sit 
uh with the T V and used to see the programme every programme upto
eleven pm 
In our village also we have started uh one uh personality
development class for some a ten year students uh in the village but
never the students went there because he wants only T V 
They never goes there 
In any one word or any social or even they not in this
for playing also 
They are their interests are also 
So this is a common problem
Common problem or 
 Manhje impact of T V in this aspect that
is it
Uh
If it is a good impact then ah then we would not
have talked like this 
Yeah
And there are so many English programmes and English movies
and all these things are very nice on the T V after ten 
But uh they never uh because they want to go
in the farm tomorrow morning and so they were 
 are going to sleep at eight O'clock laughter 
After completing the Marathi and other uh that is a 
provincial movies and all the things 
 
 They don't they don't go 
 
 Yeah 
But nobody is well acquainted uhm with the
 current problem of the women again this is my opinion
because uh day by day when we look at the newspaper and when we look
at the number of this dowry cases all these oh yes 
burning down the girls and burnings of the women so that's
 number is increasing on one side and on another side
 that attraction 
 Uhm 
 Problem 
 
 Oh yes 
 And they 
 And here 
Not only cities but in villages also there are every
mother wants that she will give more and more to her daughter in
comparison with others 
That is their thinking and because of that they demanding that
uh from husband that we want to one word we have to give it 
because it is our duty 
We have we must have satisfaction to our uh daughter we must
satisfy our daughter 
And daughter is also demanding there is not feeling that my
mother is fa father is not he he's giving it is not
enough but they are demanding
