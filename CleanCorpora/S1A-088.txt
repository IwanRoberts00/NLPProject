<I>
""
""
Uh let me try with myself 
""
 Dr Mrs Parekar
""
I am working here as lecturer from five years  in the department
of History
""
And  introduce herself
""
""
Myself Dr Padmaja Patil 
""
Uh working in the department of History  uh eight to
nine years
""
Uh sometimes as a research assistant and afterwards that is from
from  four years
""
""
""
""
She is very close friend of mine sir  uh
""
""
And here is different uh in our  to the opinion no opinion
but if she says sir 
one word 
""
And 
""
""
No if  in friendship sir
""
""
""
""
""
It is not making but it is  uh
alternate shape to thinking
""
I think so  no ?
""
Uh because there are so many problems in  uh villages
""
That  same we are working in same place
""
""
""
""
""
But there are so many different problems and so many different
thinking 
""
Uh in that different categories and different social views sir 
""
And  she will talk about something no ?
""
""
No apart from that we are good friends 
""
""
 not a problem
""
""
""
 from different background I came
from another background 
""
But still on some problem specially women problem 
 this is the very current and controversial issue in
this country  we know
""
But considering that point our views are equal our views are
similar I think 
""
So uh 
""
Let us talk on anything because we are friends in that context 
""
""
So  uhm
""
""
Here uh  you are teaching so many papers no ?
""
So out of that which paper do you like to teach more ?
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
I want to like because uh my specialisation in Modern India
""
""
Uhm
""
""
And I want to  discover
out some research work 
mainly on the  uh problems of women
""
And recently there was some uh women problems and there is uh women
policy  uh that is uh declared by government of Maharashtra
""
And there are so many problems related to the village woman
particularly
""
And these women  uh village women are not knowing anything about
it
""
Now because of it
""
""
""
""
""
Just just a minute
""
""
Uhm
""
""
Uh  interested to know whether in your
syllabus the paper which you are teaching  Modern Indian
History 
 specially based on women problems ?
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Yes
""
There are  all in all Indian history from Ancient to
Modern  in
every paper
""
In Ancient Indian History in Medieval Indian History in the  uh
Peshwa period or we can say in Maratha period  and
also in the  uh Modern Indian History
""
But in modern Indian history specially it was concentrated that is
their development and social movement in nineteen century women problem in
Maharashtra all over India
""
In Bengal movement and there was Young  movement
coming from England
""
And the Rajaram Mohan Roy  progress
""
And then he was discussing  on that
""
And that  topic is here in the Modern Indian History
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Okay it means you think that as the topic has been included
here 
""
So our students they will learn
""
They will come to know about the problems of women in India 
""
""
But do you think that these  uh problem of Indian women
especially 
""
It has its roots right from ancient period because 
teaching Ancient Indian History
""
And  interested in it
""
So when we start from the age of Vedas  or
more than that if we 
Indian history goes back to much earlier period 
""
But right from the age of  I have ample
truth that the status of women or the position of women  uh it has been
fixed  uh
""
 that in the age
of Rigveda we don't get secondary status of  but I
don't agree with them 
""
""
Gadgi 
""
So many women 
those  uh got the opportunity to learn
""
But apart from that  in uh considering with Vedic sacrifices and
all other things I feel that status of women was secondary
""
And Vedic age was  when we come
to modern Indian history or modern  how
complex is history
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Medieval Indian history also
""
""
Yeah
""
""
Because of the invasion of the Moghals
""
""
No I know very little about 
""
""
 also there was also supression
of woman because of the that  in
India and that was mainly on in north India  they invaded
south Afghanistan and  because that impact was on north
India mainly
""
That was not in south India
""
So there was  apart
from other field
""
No doubt there are some impact on all religions on caste and on
this religion
""
They 
uhm not giving exhibition to the women  and during that in the home only
not giving outside them permission  to go outside
""
That was the same thing in Medieval period
""
And when there was started Modern Indian History and then new ideas
came from 
""
Therefore some impact in the thinking of our individual that who
were taken the modern Indian education  that is not English education
""
And because of there was something strange in nineteen century
""
And that was concentrated in our syllabus only
""
""
Okay in this way  we have added all these things in our
syllabus 
 our syllabus had been constructed in this manner
""
That right from ancient period  to modern period the students
should have a link 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
What is the development of 
""
""
 when we talk on once
""
""
""
""
When we talk on or linking between the development  of
women 
""
And they have concentrated
""
They have to work on that research or anything
""
Or thinking because  or any man living in this
time thinking about the ancient period and he is linking the scene between
the  things happened on the human behaviour
""
Or the development of human behaviour 
""
That is most important thing also 
""
""
""
""
""
No considering 
 uh have
you seen recently the various types of advertisements on the T V  and
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
 are so many advertisements
""
""
 I feel that
""
 women secondary
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Means how the  uh women has been exposed
there  I don't like this
""
""
That is the commercial purpose no ?
""
In commercial purpose every company or every advertising expose a
bit thinking only benefit of their  product
""
""
 for every
""
""
And because of that because of they are doing and  we are
permitting them always  uh photo copies
no ?
""
""
Yeah 
""
""
That is  we are giving we
are also contributing them
""
""
""
""
""
Madhu  is that
""
""
""
""
""
Madhu Sapre is one of the representative of us 
""
No doubt she is a model
""
""
No after all 
""
""
But she is representing us no 
""
""
Although 
""
""
 we can't
change her views 
not doing it purposefully and that is 
""
But that is purpose commercial she wants to acquire money by that
way 
""
""
""
""
""
Look commercial purpose is okay I can understand it
""
But on one side you say  that women lib when we talk of women
liberation and secondary status of women  and on other side we are
allowing them  to express to expose
""
""
""
""
""
 women is permitting them gents
""
""
Yeah
""
""
Even well they are taking such a poses and such photos if she
denies it 
""
How they were able to take it 
""
""
Because if you will look at all the 
 mainly Marathi actresses they are that Mamta Kulkarni and
Shilpa 
""
""
""
""
""
 is a rule
""
""
It is a shameful thing I think 
""
""
It is shameful  thing but it is
""
""
Yeah
""
""
Being 
pro  that is they want so uh become
something 
""
And because of that they exposing even they themselves only 
""
""
Uhm no but  uh
village ladies and village girls  specially
""
""
Uh village girls
""
""
Those who are taking education now a days
""
""
No what is the problem
""
""
Women
""
""
Only then one  mothers of
that girl 
changes no not changes and because of that my son will marry with educated
person
""
""
""
""
""
Okay
""
""
And so she  will take the education
""
That is not another thing because educated 
bridegroom want the educated girl because they mostly live in city
""
And there is a a natural feeling in the all girls and also their
mother and family members  well
behaved educated and there must be  well man must be working in the city
level not in the villages because there are so many problems in villages
""
There are so many they 
""
They don't want no ?
""
Because of that each have a feeling going on that  uh girls
must be  not for
there 
""
Because  she must marry with doctors so they are permitting
them to go into medical college 
""
They are not giving development to their career  that is my
point 
""
""
No but you feel that all these new ideas and this
modernisation in every aspect 
not only considering pressure  because village girls
they are 
""
""
Not like but  uh this modernisation of thinking in that context
I am talking 
""
So whether they  uhm they are well acquainted with these ideas
 because all women are like this
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Never never  one word
""
though they are 
""
They never read any paper any book any magazine
""
Only they sometime go into the meetings  uh
some uh 
""
""
""
""
""
 I think the impact of television
""
""
""
""
""
""
 that
after completion of their 
""
""
 thinking ability it
is changing in the only their uh entertainment
""
""
Yeah 
""
""
They want entertainment
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
 and when the news
will start they 
""
""
""
""
""
They will stop the T V
""
""
And they will go for their work in the house
""
""
Yes 
""
""
They
""
""
Only they will see movies  and
other programmes like this some 
""
""
""
""
""
They also thinking about their
""
""
They are 
""
""
 that is
emotional feeling only 
""
""
Reading habits must  because of the feeling
isn't 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Yes uh  that
is a 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
 not in this
context nobody is reading now a days 
""
""
That is not the case with village girls or village women 
in cities also you know  uh problem mainly with my
son 
""
Now he is in in uh third standard 
""
But 
uh with the T V  upto
eleven pm 
""
In our village also we have started  personality
development class for some a ten year students  uh in the village but
never the students went there 
""
They never goes there 
""
In any  or any social or even they not in this
for playing also 
""
They are their interests are also 
""
""
So this is a common problem
""
""
Common problem or 
""
""
 aspect that
is it
""
""
Uh
""
""
If it is a good impact  ah then we would not
have talked like this 
""
""
Yeah
""
And there are so many  English programmes and English movies
and all these things are very nice on the T V after ten 
""
But  because they want to go
in the farm 
""
""
After completing the Marathi and other 
provincial movies and all the things 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
But nobody is well acquainted  with the
 of the women again this is my opinion
because  and when we look
at the number 
burning down the girls and burnings of the  that's
 on another side
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Not only cities but in villages also there are  every
mother wants that she will give more and more to her daughter  in
comparison with others 
""
That is their thinking and because of that they demanding  that
uh from husband that we want to 
because it is our duty 
""
We have we must have satisfaction to our  uh daughter we must
satisfy our daughter 
""
And daughter  is also demanding there is not feeling that my
mother is  giving it is not
enough
