their development and social movement in nineteen century women problem in
""
""
""
""
""
And the Rajaram Mohan Roy  progress
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
here 
""
So our students they will learn
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
teaching Ancient Indian History
""
""
""
""
""
Indian history goes back to much earlier period 
""
""
""
""
""
 that in the age
of Rigveda we don't get secondary status of  but I
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
But apart from that  in uh considering with Vedic sacrifices and
""
""
And Vedic age was  when we come
""
complex is history
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
 also there was also supression
""
India and that was mainly on in north India  they invaded
south Afghanistan and  because that impact was on north
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
not giving outside them permission  to go outside
""
That was the same thing in Medieval period
""
""
came from 
""
Therefore some impact in the thinking of our individual that who
were taken the modern Indian education  that is not English education
""
And because of there was something strange in nineteen century
""
And that was concentrated in our syllabus only
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
should have a link 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
women 
""
""
""
They have to work on that research or anything
""
""
time thinking about the ancient period and he is linking the scene between
""
""
Or the development of human behaviour 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
bit thinking only benefit of their  product
""
""
""
""
""
And because of that because of they are doing and  we are
""
no ?
""
""
Yeah 
""
""
""
are also contributing them
""
""
""
""
""
Madhu  is that
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
But she is representing us no 
""
""
""
""
""
 we can't
""
not doing it purposefully and that is 
""
""
way 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
But on one side you say  that women lib when we talk of women
""
allowing them  to express to expose
""
""
""
""
""
 women is permitting them gents
""
""
Yeah
""
""
Even well they are taking such a poses and such photos if she
denies it 
""
""
""
""
""
 mainly Marathi actresses they are that Mamta Kulkarni and
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
pro  that is they want so uh become
something 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Those who are taking education now a days
""
""
No what is the problem
""
""
Women
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
That is not another thing because educated 
bridegroom want the educated girl because they mostly live in city
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
They don't want no ?
""
Because of that each have a feeling going on that  uh girls
must be  not for
""
""
Because  she must marry with doctors so they are permitting
""
""
They are not giving development to their career  that is my
""
""
""
No but you feel that all these new ideas and this
""
""
""
""
""
Not like but  uh this modernisation of thinking in that context
I am talking 
""
""
 because all women are like this
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
They never read any paper any book any magazine
""
Only they sometime go into the meetings  uh
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
 that
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
 and when the news
""
""
""
""
""
""
They will stop the T V
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
They
""
""
Only they will see movies  and
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
context nobody is reading now a days 
""
""
""
""
son 
""
""
""
But 
""
""
""
In our village also we have started  personality
development class for some a ten year students  uh in the village but
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
So this is a common problem
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
have talked like this 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
in the farm 
""
""
After completing the Marathi and other 
provincial movies and all the things 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
But nobody is well acquainted  with the
""
because  and when we look
""
""
 on another side
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
