Familiar incidents do not usually excite our curiosity 
We look at them and we take them for granted 
We do not ask what makes them happen ?
How they are connected with the rest of the universe ?
It was one of these mundane incidents which excited the
curiosity of Issac Newton 
He saw an apple fall from a tree 
It made him wonder whether the law of nature that made the
apple fall would also make the moon fall towards the earth 
He was taking a great intellectual leap from the apple to the
moon 
He was not content with having seen this event with his physical
eyes alone 
He was trying to see a hidden connection behind the phenomenon
 with his intellect the third eye 
What is the connection that Newton saw betweeen the apple
and the moon ?
Let us look at the moon 
If the earth did not attract the moon the moon would have
travelled in a straight line and escaped to infinity 
The earth's attraction provides the centripidal force 
that bends the moon's projectory continuously from its
linear projectory 
One can therefore say that the moon is continuously falling
towards the earth's centre 
It is exactly analogous to the case of the spacecraft that we
talked about in an earlier episode
Now if the earth's gravity extends upto the orbit
of the moon and this force decreases as the square of the distance
from the earth's centre 
It is easy to calculate the acceleration of the moon as it falls
 from a knowledge of the acceleration of the apple 
Since the moon is sixty times as far from the centre of the
earth as the apple its acceleration should be sixty multiplied by sixty
that is three thousand six hundred times smaller than the apple's
 acceleration 
The remarkable thing is that this gives the right answer for
the moon to go once round the earth in twenty-eight days exactly as
observed 
This was Newton's famous moon test 
In fact in the beginning he used a slightly wrong value for the
distance of the moon from the centre of the earth and therefore got a
slightly wrong value for the lunar month that made him wonder for a
while as to whether there was something other than gravity which
affected the moon's motion 
He therefore didn't publish his results until much later 
The primitive concept of forces arises from our experience of
 pushes and pulls 
Newton made a tremendous intellectual leap from such a concept
of contact forces to the concept of forces such as gravitation 
which act over a distance through empty space 
This is how he made the leap 
Consider the uniform inertial motion of a body in a straight
line covering equal distances AB BC CD DE and so on in
equal times 
Let the points A B C D E etcetera be
joined by a straight line to the point P not on the line of motion
Then the successive triangles all have equal bases AB
 BC CD DE etcetera and the same height H from the
base 
Therefore they all have the same area 
Since these equal areas are swept out in equal times this is
clear that inertial motion traces out equal areas in equal times 
Now Newton supposed that the body received a succession of
blows at regular intervals 
All directed towards a common point P 
Then the direction of motion would change at every blow and the
body would coast along inertially in a straight line between these blows
The linear path would thus be converted into a polygon whose
sides would still determine consecutive triangles of equal areas with
respect to the point P 
Now says Newton let the time between successive blows become
smaller and smaller then the number of blows and triangles would increase
 and the width would decrease 
In the limit of arbitrarily small intervals of time the
projectory would be a continuous curve 
This is the crucial point 
It lies at the very heart of calculus 
This limiting procedure enabled Newton to make a transition 
from a succession of discrete blows to the concept of a continually
acting force directed towards a common point a central or centripidal
force causing curvilinear motion 
And he discovered that bodies moving under the action of such a
force would trace out equal areas in equal times 
This is Keplar's second law of planetary motion 
Notice that Newton arrived at the concept of an attractive force
acting over a distance as a mathematical limit of a succession of direct
impact 
He wrote what I call attraction may be performed
by impulse or by some other means unknown to me 
I use these words here to signify in general any force by
which bodies tend towards one another whatsoever be the cause
 
He didn't pretend to know the cause of gravity 
Could it be due to a shower of ethereal particles or was
it is as Descartes had imagined ?
Newton was curious but he couldn't decide 
He left the question open 
But what is important is that he didn't stop there 
He simply assumed the existance of gravity and proceeded to
work out its consequences 
This pragmatic approach was essential for the progress of
science in his time but it was completely misunderstood by many of
his eminent contemporaries 
It led to a lot of unnecessary and bitter controversy 
Having shown that a centripidal force acting continually would make
a body move in a curve that traced out equal areas in equal times he
also proved the converse namely that this area law employed a motion in a
central force speed 
Since the area law held for planets it became clear to Newton
that the force acting between the sun and the planets must be a central force
He had earlier deduced from Keplar's third law of
planetary motion that a circular orbit employed a force that
decreased as the square of the distance from the centre 
Armed with the discovery of calculus he was now able to show 
that under a central force that decreased at the square of the distance a
planet would describe an elliptic orbit 
In other words he derived Keplar's first law of
planetary motion from causal principles 
Now this derivation of Keplar's empirical laws 
held only for an imagined system a hypothetical point particle moving
around a centre of force in a perfect vacuum 
The real world is of course much more complex 
Newton therefore didn't publish his results 
In the mean time Robert Hook quite independently hit upon the
idea that the attraction between the sun and the planets fell off at
the square of their distances 
However he couldn't work out what the orbits would be under
such an attractive force 
He tried to get Newton interested in the problem and wrote to
him in January sixteen hundred and eighty 
But Newton didn't reply as an earlier controversy with Hook
about the nature of light had offended him 
In London there were two other men who were also
working on Hook's problem 
Christopher Wren the famous architect of Saint Paul's 
Cathedral and Edmund Halley 
In August sixteen eighty-four Halley who was younger than
Hook and more tactful went to Cambridge on horseback to find out if
Newton could help 
A contemporary account states without mentioning either his
own speculations or those of Hook or Wren he at once indicated the
object of his visit by asking Newton what would be the curve described by
the planets on the supposition that gravity diminished at the square
of the distance 
Newton immediately answered an ellips 
Struck with joy and amazement Halley asked him how he knew it
 ?
Why replied he I have calculated it and being asked for
the calculation he could not find it but promised to send it to
him 
This was the beginning of the writing of Newton's 
Principia 
Perhaps the greatest book on physical science ever written 
It took him nearly three years of incredible labour 
He submitted it to the Royal Society on twenty-eighth April
sixteen eighty-six 
One of the greatest days in the history of science 
It was finally accepted by Samuel Peeps the president of the
Royal Society and published in sixteen eithty-seven 
It would not have seen the light of day had it not been for the
constant coaxing and persuasion by Halley who even paid for its
publication 
It consisted of three books written in Latin in which 
Newton developed a full dynamical theory encapsulated in his three laws
of motion 
The third law is the most original of his three laws and
appears for the first time in the Principia 
Newton generalised the experience of direct collisions of
bodies like billiard balls acting mutually on one another to the case
 of four types of forces including attraction 
The third law is not however applicable to every case 
Nowadays we believe that all signals or forces have a finite
velocity of propagation 
It is therefore not applicable to them because it talks
about forces of action and reaction being equal as measured at the
same time 
We therefore don't expect it to be very good say in the case of
atomic category 
It is however perfectly applicable to the collisions of
billiard balls cars and so on 
As I have said earlier Newton's derivation of 
Kepler's empirical laws held only for an imagined system a
hypothetical point particle moving around the centre of force in a
perfect vacuum 
A physically impressed force must be directed towards a real
physical body 
So Newton next introduced a second body in place of the
mathematical centre of force to simulate the sun and a single planet
And he assumed that they were both spherical in shape and
attracted each other with equal and opposite forces 
After much effort lasting over a number of years Newton
obtained the remarkable mathematical result that a gravitational
attraction of a homogeneous spherical body or shell on a mass point
outside it was the same as though its whole mass was concentrated at
its centre provided gravity fell off at the square of the distance
This justified his earlier treatment of the sun and the planets as
 point like objects 
He next showed that in such a system each body would move in an
orbit around the common centre of mass 
If one of the bodies were much more massive than the other as
is the case with the sun and most of the planets the centre of mass would
practically coincide with the more massive body 
Since nearly the entire mass of the solar system was concentrated
in the sun the planet would really move around the sun which would
remain practically stationary 
A dynamical justification of the Copernican system that Galileo
was unable to provide 
The final feature was the introduction of other mutually
interacting bodies to produce a system like the sun and all its planets
Here his third law about the equality of action and reaction
played a crucial role 
The discovery of this new important principle almost
inevitably led to universal gravitation 
Newton systematically showed that the same force of gravity
that acted between the earth and the moon also acted between Jupiter
and its satellites between the sun and all the planets and
between every pair of planets and that every action was mutual by the
third law of motion 
He was thus led to the concept of universal gravitation a
force that acts mutually between any two samples of matter anywhere
in the universe 
Newton applied his powerful theory to show that the tides on
the high seas were caused by the gravitational pull of the moon and the
sun 
He argued that the gravitational force exerted by the moon 
on the ocean waters on the moonlit side of the earth was stronger 
than the pull on the moonless side because gravity decreases the distance
As a result of this the ocean waters assume an elixoidal shape
 with two bulges one on the moonlit side and the other on the opposite
side 
The sun has a similar effect on the oceans but being much
farther away its effect is weaker than the moon's 
Also the solar and lunar tides do not always coincide 
The sun and the moon act in the same direction whenever the
moon is either new or full and then we have exceptionally high tides 
At other times the total effect is much diminished 
With the powerful tool of calculus at his command to give shape to
his daring imagination Newton demonstrated convincingly that 
gravity held sway over the entire solar system 
In one sweeping stroke he unified celestial and terrestrial
motion under a single concept 
The great Irish philosopher George Bernard Shaw once made 
the following mischievous remark about Newton Copernicus
proved that Ptolemy was wrong Kepler proved that Copernicus was
wrong Galileo proved that Aristotle was wrong but at that point
 the sequence broke down because science then came up for the
first time against that incalculable natural phenomenon and Englishman
To explain why all the lines in his rectilinear universe were bent
 he invented a force called gravitation and thus erected a complete
 British universe and established it as a religion which was devoutly
believed in for three hundred years 
That was George Bernard Shaw 
But the famous English poet Alexander Pope wrote 
 Nature and nature's laws lay hidden in night God
said let Newton be and all was light
