Familiar incidents

We look at them

We do not ask  ?
""
How they are connected with the rest  ?
""
It was  which excited the
curiosity 
""
He saw 
""
It made him wonder  whether the law of nature that made the
apple fall 
""
He was taking a great intellectual leap from the apple  to the
moon 
""
He was not content  with having seen this event with his physical
eyes alone 
""
He was trying  to see a hidden connection behind the phenomenon
""
""
What is the connection  betweeen the apple
and the moon  ?
""
Let us look at the moon 
""
If the earth  the moon would have
travelled in a straight line and escaped to infinity 
""
The 
that bends the  from its
linear projectory 
""
One can therefore say  that the moon is continuously falling
towards the 
""
It is exactly analogous to the case of the spacecraft  that we
talked about in an earlier episode
""
Now  upto the orbit
of the moon  as the square of the distance
from the 
""
It is easy to calculate the acceleration of the moon as it falls
""
""
Since the moon is sixty times  as far from the centre of the
earth as the apple  its acceleration should be sixty multiplied by sixty
that is  apple's
""
""
The remarkable thing is  that this gives the right answer for
the moon to go  exactly as
observed 
""
This was 
""
In fact in the beginning  he used a slightly wrong value for the
distance of the moon from the centre of the earth  a
slightly wrong value for the lunar month  that made him wonder for a
while as to whether  which
affected the 
""
He therefore didn't publish his results until much later 
""
The primitive concept of forces  arises from our experience of
""
""
Newton made a tremendous intellectual leap  from such a concept
of contact forces 
which act over a distance through empty space 
""
This is how he made 
""
Consider the uniform inertial motion of a body  in a straight
line  in
equal times 
""
Let the points  be
joined by a straight line  not on the line of motion
""
""
Then  AB
 from the
base 
""
Therefore 
""
Since these equal areas are swept out in equal times  this is
clear that inertial motion 
""
Now Newton supposed  that the body received a succession of
blows 
""
All directed towards a common point 
""
Then the direction of motion would change at every blow  and the
body would coast along inertially in a straight line  between these blows
""
""
The linear path would thus be converted into a polygon  whose
sides would still determine consecutive triangles of equal areas  with
respect to the point P 
""
Now says Newton  let the time between successive blows become
smaller and smaller  then the number of blows and triangles would increase
""
""
In the limit of arbitrarily small intervals of time  the
projectory would be a continuous curve 
""
This is the crucial point 
""
It lies at the very heart of calculus 
""
This limiting procedure enabled Newton to make a transition 
from a succession of discrete blows  to the concept of a continually
acting force  a central or centripidal
force causing curvilinear motion 
""
And he discovered  that bodies moving under the action of such a
force would trace out equal areas in equal times 
""
This is 
""
Notice that Newton arrived at the concept of an attractive force
acting over a distance  as a mathematical limit of a succession of direct
impact 
""
He wrote  may be performed
by impulse 
""
I use these words here to signify in general  by
which bodies  whatsoever be the cause
""
""
He didn't pretend to know the cause of gravity 
""
Could it be due to  or was
it is as Descartes had imagined  ?
""
Newton was curious 
""
He left the question 
""
But what is important is that he didn't stop there 
""
He simply assumed the existance of gravity  and proceeded to
work out its consequences 
""
This pragmatic approach  essential for the progress of
science in his time  by many of
his eminent contemporaries 
""
It led to 
""
Having shown that a centripidal force acting continually would make
a body move in a curve  he
also proved the converse  namely that this area law employed a motion in a
central force speed 
""
Since the area law held for planets  it became clear to Newton
that the force acting between the sun and the planets must be a central force
""
""
He had earlier deduced from  third law of
planetary motion  that
decreased as the square of the distance from the centre 
""
Armed with the discovery of calculus he was now able to show 
that under a central force that decreased at the square of the distance  a
planet would describe 
""
In other words  first law of
planetary motion 
""
Now 
held only for an imagined system  moving
around a centre of force 
""
The real world is of course much more complex 
""
Newton therefore didn't publish his results 
""
In the mean time  Robert Hook quite independently hit upon the
idea  fell off at
the square of their distances 
""
However  what the orbits would be under
such an attractive force 
""
He tried to get Newton interested in the problem  and wrote to
him in January sixteen hundred and eighty 
""
But Newton didn't reply  as an earlier controversy with Hook
about the nature of light 
""
In London  also
working on 
""
Christopher Wren 
Cathedral 
""
In August sixteen eighty-four  who was younger than
Hook and more tactful  to find out if
Newton could help 
""
A contemporary account  without mentioning either his
own speculations  he at once indicated the
object of his visit by asking Newton  what would be the curve described by
the planets on the supposition  diminished at the square
of the distance 
""
Newton immediately answered 
""
Struck with joy and amazement  Halley asked him how he knew it
 ?
""
Why replied he  and being asked for
the calculation  promised to send it to
him 
""
This was the beginning 
Principia 
""
Perhaps the greatest book on physical science 
""
It took him nearly 
""
He submitted it to the Royal Society on twenty-eighth April
sixteen eighty-six 
""
One of the greatest days in the history of science 
""
It was finally accepted by Samuel Peeps  the president of the
Royal Society 
""
It would not have seen the light of day  had it not been for the
constant coaxing and persuasion by Halley  who even paid for its
publication 
""
It consisted of three books 
Newton developed a full dynamical theory  encapsulated in his three laws
of motion 
""
The third law is the most original  and
appears for the first time in the Principia 
""
Newton  direct collisions of
bodies like  to the case
""
""
The third law 
""
Nowadays we believe  that all signals or forces have a finite
velocity of propagation 
""
It is therefore not applicable to them  it talks
about  as measured at the
same time 
""
We therefore don't expect it to be very good  say in the case of
atomic category 
""
It is however perfectly applicable  to the collisions of
billiard balls 
""
As I have said earlier 
Kepler's  a
hypothetical point particle moving around the centre of force  in a
perfect vacuum 
""
A physically impressed force  must be directed towards a real
physical body 
""
So Newton next introduced a second body in place of the
mathematical centre of force  and a single planet
""
""
And he assumed  and
attracted each other with equal and opposite forces 
""
After much effort lasting over a number of years  Newton
obtained the remarkable mathematical result  that a gravitational
attraction  on a mass point
outside it  was concentrated at
its centre  gravity fell off at the square of the distance
""
""
This justified his earlier treatment of the sun and the planets as
""
""
He next showed that in such a system  each body would move in an
orbit around the common centre of mass 
""
If one of the bodies were much more massive than the other  as
is the case with the sun and most of the planets  the centre of mass would
practically coincide 
""
Since nearly the entire mass of the solar system was concentrated
in the sun  which would
remain practically stationary 
""
A dynamical justification of the Copernican system  that Galileo
was unable to provide 
""
The final feature was the introduction of other mutually
interacting bodies to produce a system like the sun  and all its planets
""
""
Here  his third law about the equality of action and reaction
played a crucial role 
""
The discovery of this new important principle  almost
inevitably led to universal gravitation 
""
Newton systematically showed  that the same force of gravity
that acted between the earth and the moon  Jupiter
and its satellites  and
between every pair of planets  by the
third law of motion 
""
He was thus led to the concept of  a
force  anywhere
in the universe 
""
Newton applied his powerful theory to show  that the tides on
the high seas were caused by the gravitational pull  of the moon and the
sun 
""
He argued 
on the ocean waters on the moonlit side of the earth 
than the pull on the moonless side  because gravity decreases the distance
""
""
As a result of this  the ocean waters assume an elixoidal shape
 one on the moonlit side and the other on the opposite
side 
""
The sun has a similar effect on the oceans  but being much
farther away its effect is weaker than the 
""
Also the solar and lunar tides 
""
The sun and the moon  act in the same direction whenever the
moon is either new or full 
""
At other times 
""
With the powerful tool of calculus at his command to give shape to
his daring imagination 
gravity held sway 
""
In one sweeping stroke  he unified celestial and terrestrial
motion under a single concept 
""
The great Irish philosopher 
the following  Copernicus
proved  that Copernicus was
wrong  but at that point
 science then came up for the
first time against that incalculable natural phenomenon  and Englishman
""
""
To explain why all the lines in his rectilinear universe were bent
 and thus erected a complete
 which was devoutly
believed in for three hundred years 
""
That was 
""
But the famous English poet
