One can therefore say  that the moon is continuously falling

It is exactly analogous to the case of the spacecraft  that we

The primitive concept of forces  arises from our experience of

of contact forces 
which act over a distance through empty space

Since these equal areas are swept out in equal times  this is

The linear path would thus be converted into a polygon  whose

Now says Newton  let the time between successive blows become
smaller and smaller  then the number of blows and triangles would increase

He didn't pretend to know the cause of gravity

Could it be due to  or was

Newton was curious

He left the question

But what is important is that he didn't stop there

It led to

Having shown that a centripidal force acting continually would make

that the force acting between the sun and the planets must be a central force

It was finally accepted by Samuel Peeps  the president of the

its centre  gravity fell off at the square of the distance

This justified his earlier treatment of the sun and the planets as

A dynamical justification of the Copernican system  that Galileo

Here  his third law about the equality of action and reaction
played a crucial role

inevitably led to universal gravitation

that acted between the earth and the moon  Jupiter
and its satellites  and
