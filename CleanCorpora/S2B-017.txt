Doctors in New Delhi yesterday performed the rare open heart
surgery on one month old baby 
Dr I M Rao and Dr K S Aiyyar of the All India Institute of Medical
Sciences said the surgery had to be performed otherwise the boy
Jisukh would have died 
After seven gruelling hours of surgery Jisukh is fine and
he is under observation at the Intensive Care Unit of the hospital 
Our correspondent Hemant Kumar has more details 
This child had a serious heart disease 
Two of his major arteries in the heart were cross linked 
The human heart has four chambers 
The right artium the right ventricle and the left artium
and the left ventricle 
The right artium and the right ventricle receive impure and used
blood from all over the body 
A blood vessel called the pulmonary artery carries the impure
blood into the lungs for purification 
The pure oxyginated blood then enters the left artium and travels
to the left ventricle the pump house of the heart 
From the left ventricle the artery aorta carries the pure blood to
the rest of the body 
In the case of this child however the two blood vessels 
pulmonary artery and the aorta were wrongly connected 
The pulmonary artery was connected to the left ventricle and
the aorta to the right ventricle so that all the impure blood was
returning to the body via the pulmonary artery and the purified blood
was flowing back to the lungs through the aorta 
The baby was turning blue for lack of oxygen and could have died
had the surgery not been performed 
What Dr I M Rao and Dr K S Aiyyar of the Institute did was in
several stages 
First the child was anaesthetize a very difficult task to
perform on an infant 
Then his rib cage or the thorax was cut open and the
frantically throbbing heart was exposed 
His heart was then by passed 
All the impure blood was rooted to an apparatus called the
heartlung machine 
It purifies the blood and returns it to the body totalling
bypassing the heart
So that it does not beat 
The heart was then cut open and the arteries exposed 
Then the arteries were switched 
The Aorta was removed from the right ventricle and sewn to the
left ventricle its natural place 
The pulmonary artery was removed from the left ventricle and
placed at the right ventricle 
The entire operation took seven hours 
And Dr Rao says it was only as risky as any other open heart
surgery 
But normally it has very high success rate

Bharat Pura one of the major rivers flowing from the Western
 Ghats is facing the grim possibility of fading into
oblivion 
The river which was a kilometre broad gush of deep blue water 
is now just a sand bed 
A report from a Trivandrum correspondent John Ulanand 
Bharat Pura is Kerala's longest river flowing from
the Western Ghats into the Arabian sea 
Legends surrounding the river go back to the epics 
It has not only been the key to the prosperity of northern Kerala
 but also an integral part of the people and their culture for
centuries 
But today the entire course of the river has dried down to
mere sand bed 
The ground water level has gone down to about ten metres below the
bed 
Reasons for the river's fate are many 
The indiscriminate exploitation of the water resources 
deforestation in the catchment areas and collection of the sand from the
bed are a few of them 
The people of Prithala one of the river side town recently got
together to discuss the need to revive Bharat Pura 
The solution they suggested is to save the water that flows into
the Arabian sea during the monsoon month 
They requested the government to build a check dam to regulate the
flow of the river 
A group of environmentalist also have launched a campaign to save
the river
