Doctors in New Delhi yesterday performed the rare open heart
surgery on one month old baby 
""
Dr I M Rao and Dr K S Aiyyar of the All India Institute of Medical
Sciences  otherwise the boy
Jisukh would have died 
""
After seven gruelling hours of surgery  and
he is under observation 
""
Our correspondent Hemant Kumar has more details 
""
""
This child had a serious heart disease 
""
Two of his major arteries in the heart 
""
The human heart has four chambers 
""
The right artium  and the left artium
and the left ventricle 
""
The right artium and the right ventricle receive impure and used
blood 
""
A blood vessel  called the pulmonary artery carries the impure
blood into the lungs for purification 
""
The pure oxyginated blood then enters the left artium and travels
to the left ventricle 
""
From the left ventricle the artery aorta carries the pure blood to
the rest of the body 
""
In the case of this child however the two blood vessels 
pulmonary artery and the aorta were wrongly connected 
""
The pulmonary artery was connected to the left ventricle  and
the aorta to the right ventricle  so that all the impure blood was
returning to the body  and the purified blood
was flowing back to the lungs 
""
The baby was turning blue for lack of oxygen and could have died
had the surgery not been performed 
""
What Dr I M Rao and Dr K S Aiyyar of the Institute did was in
several stages 
""
First the child was anaesthetize  a very difficult task to
perform on an infant 
""
Then his rib cage or the thorax  was cut open and the
frantically throbbing heart was exposed 
""
His heart was then by passed 
""
All the impure blood was rooted to an apparatus called the
heartlung machine 
""
It purifies the blood and returns it to the body  totalling
bypassing the heart
""
So that it does not beat 
""
The heart was then cut open and the arteries exposed 
""
Then the arteries were switched 
""
The Aorta was removed from the right ventricle and sewn to the
left ventricle its natural place 
""
The pulmonary artery was removed from the left ventricle and
placed at the right ventricle 
""
The entire operation took seven hours 
""
And Dr Rao says it was only as risky as any other open heart
surgery 
""
But normally it has very high
