Hello  I deserve as a
direct student of Gujral 
""
That is why it has that philosophical 
""
And uhm  lot of
modern critical theory  they
based their 
""
The idea of subjectivity we all  talk
about  subjectivity
""
""
You know 
idea  you
always come across  the idea of subjectivity how the subject is
constituted 
""
Woman as a subject 
""
Uhm it is a cultural  not a
biological construction like someone who would say  the woman was
not born she was made 
""
I am not a 
""
So the idea of subjectivity is not a very simple idea 
very  of the idea of the
subjectivity  emphasise the idea of subjectivity
""
""
And subsequently it became a problematical idea 
the notion of the subject  the constitution of the subject how the
subject is constituted 
it's 
""
And the relationship between the subject and the object  who is
the subject who is the object  ?
""
Uh sometimes you feel  that the object perhaps is the subject
you know  and
phenomenology I repeat it  of subjectivity
""
""
Whose subjectivity you can ask  ?
""
The readers  there is also narrator involved
in the process of  the
reader is a subject  the character who
narrates is a subject 
""
So whose subjectivity  and how one subjectivity is imbricated
with another  philosophical
problems  you come
across 
of 
""
And  why you know subjectivity
""
Objectivity is a very  according
to these  there is nothing called objectivity you cannot be objective
""
""
You assume that the whole world can be reduced into some kind of
""
""
Is it possible to do that  ?
""
The world also  by your
consciousness  if individual response to the world in his own particular
way  where to get the sense of objectivity
""
How is it that you want to be objective  ?
""
What is the basis of objectivity  ?
""
And who actually makes the basis  ?
""
The very fact that you 
implicated into  which is your personal
definition 
""
That is why  a very very false notion the idea of
objectivity 
""
One is relatively  know
like subjectivity and objectivity  or subjectivity refers to the subject
objectivity 
""
And the  of your
consciousness  ?
""
How does the object get 
perceive 
""
When you come into the room  glances at
something  and the same eye of another person
doesn't glance 
""
So there is all like all I say 
had already reduced things  into some kind of selectional it has already
selected  from vision
from perception 
""
So the act of perception itself is a selective art  and when
the process of selection has already taken place  uh
you know when when it is in a mental process  that the idea of
objectivity is lost
""
You don't see the whole world 
""
You see piecemeal 
""
And the very fact that you will be selective  uh whether you
like it or not you are selective in your glance  that
actually negates the very idea of objectivity 
""
How do you then make sense of the world  ?
""
If the world is such a vast thing which you can't see  at a
time everything  ?
""
Can you really objectively say that the world is like this  ?
""
You know  and uh western
philosophers particularly  as an
idea 
exterior exists  sense it and
the very idea of intuition  perhaps negates the idea of objectivity that
you have some  in
your think in your perception 
uh objectivity
""
So  it's
 and everything perception is personal subjective
""
""
You see things the way you want to see them  sometimes you
refuse to see 
""
Deliberately you  do not like to see things because you don't
like to see them 
""
But  it
always selects things  you
 because
perhaps 
""
""
So you select something that confirms to  your line of thinking
and so on and so forth 
""
So basically  is a subjective response
""
""
That is a case which phenomenology makes 
""
You read a text 
""
""
Sir  experience at
subjective level
""
""
Yes
""
""
But uh  like
uh  feminist
criticism or even black literature and 
there  phenomenology applies to a sort of group
volunteers
""
""
Yes  it is a group concept I think
""
""
So how this  various or even the idea of new colonisation
example literary criticism or  so all this
interpretation  can be traced back to the idea of phenomenology
only 
""
""
You can do that you can say that 
""
If there is some  and
the collective response to something  like you have mentioned the
feminists or the blacks  there have been
""
""
From the third world
""
""
Any way  if
you look at the individual  that
is why I say that  and it varies from group to group it varies from
person to person and within group there are lot of divergences  and you
can take note of that 
""
If we account for all those  the
commonality  imposed upon those
desperate tendencies  in individual perception
""
""
In fact every individuals movements  breaks down before it
""
""
""
 naturally
""
""
Nature of the very idea of phenomenology
""
""
Naturally  of human perception
 you
""
""
 they were talking about their
Commonwealth  now they say
""
""
Yeah  but you know
commonwealth of course is a very hetrogeneous concept
""
There is no Commonwealth response
""
""
""
""
""
Yes
""
""
You can say there may  world reference
""
""
""
""
""
But they didn't talked about it to start with
""
""
See they talked about it but you see  how can you then say
the Australian response is similar to Indian response or the Canadian
response  Commonwealth within Commonwealth if they belong to the first
world
""
""
But still they didn't talked about it
""
""
See this is as I say it is a desperate ideas  yoked in
violence you know  and that also is a
very debatable idea 
""
Is there any communality of  this kind of political term which
unites  a
Canadian response certainly is closer to the American response than  uh uh
an Indian response
""
And you can't  uh uh say that a first world country like Canada
 as a third world country
""
So there is a lot of variations  but uh phenomenology doesn't
talk of course of a group response kind of thing
""
They talk of individual  and they don't really like the idea of
this collective  and if they name
it some we will talk about that later on a slightly  when we talk about to
reader response criticism 
""
But the collective response idea also  is self contradictory
""
""
Response cannot be collective  because two people two persons
do not think alike 
""
And you group them together and say you think alike  and you
can't control human thinking it is so spontaneous 
""
Your own response is so spontaneous  you can only politically
manipulate the whole  even to suit your convenience
""
""
It is a political manipulation  of human mind can be controlled
technologically you know  tries to
evade 
""
Spirit could not be technologised in way you want them  want it
to be  there
is nothing called collective response 
""
Blacks certainly think in their own way there is communality of
interest 
""
There is certainly when it comes to  question of
white domination  about
the notion of domination ideology power and so on and so forth  and that
is the kind of
""
But it is not perception these people deal with more intensely deal
more intensely  how things get realised
in your consciousness get realised in your perception  how things take
shape in your mind  so it is the the the kind of ideatic according to
Ferrel 
ideatic reflection or ideatic uh uh  ideatic reduction or
reflection 
perceptual you know 
""
And a concept  of
her idea  then you
conceptualise
""
First  and
that perceptuality of every 
through your perceptuality your perception 
""
There is no object until  in your mental eyes
""
 uh as
you know is a very is a mental perception 
""
You perceive the object  and suddenly the object take shape in
your mind  you conceptualise about it
""
Conceptualisation is a  that takes place
only after  has taken
place 
""
This is the way  modes
""
""
As I say that it has some complicity with the plutonic  idea of
essence  in a very
miniature way
""
In a miniature way the the visible world that you see  is a
miniature copy of the idea  it has
that kind of traditional  of the visible and
the invisible axis 
""
What you see visible  is only a manifestation of the invisible
perception 
""
The mind works  and makes things possible
""
""
So the object gets realised to a mental process  it
becomes manifested through  which is a
manifestation 
""
This is the idea of the ideatic reduction 
everything is bracketed between you and the others
""
So you 
relationship between the object 
""
So the objectivity is not uh 
there is nothing called objectivity per se 
""
Objectivity is a realisation  of the higher mode of
subjectivity 
""
Objectivity  objectivity is the
whole idea the objectiveness  uh the
objectiveness the object  objectness
""
""
So the objectness  the very
quality of the object  is manifested through your subjective perception
""
""
That is why 
uh without you know some subjectivity 
""
Subjectivity makes the objectness possible  objectivity is
possible 
""
So the object and subject come together  in a very mystical
way  is the consciousness of an object
""
""
You cannot have subjectivity without objectivity 
""
You cannot have objectivity without subjectivity 
""
This is the subject object relationship  the whole
world  is possible
 because of this relationship between the subject
and the object 
""
Am I clear  ?
""
Okay  and as you know
 that this is the fundamental
 that you see around you
""
""
The world comes 
already mental process  in
your own perception
