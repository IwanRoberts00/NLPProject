Hello you know his importance I deserve as a
direct student of Gujral and the influence is very much there 
That is why it has that philosophical basis 
And uhm if you do not understand phenomenology lot of
modern critical theory will not be understood because you know they
based their idea on phenomenology 
The idea of subjectivity we all these days we talk
about subjectivity and phenomenology emphasises subjectivity
You know how the subject is constituted interesting 
idea and as a feminist literature feminist theory you
always come across the idea of subjectivity how the subject is
constituted 
Woman as a subject how it is constituted 
Uhm it is a cultural construction it's not a
biological construction like someone who would say the woman was
not born she was made 
I am not a bo I am not a born woman I was made a woman 
So the idea of subjectivity is not a very simple idea it's 
very you know the historical construction of the idea of the
subjectivity and phenomenology emphasise the idea of subjectivity
And subsequently it became a problematical idea that uh 
the notion of the subject the constitution of the subject how the
subject is constituted is not an easy thing to say you know 
it's not something that is result uh taken for granted 
And the relationship between the subject and the object who is
the subject who is the object ?
Uh sometimes you feel that the object perhaps is the subject
you know so subject object axis is very complex and
phenomenology I repeat it emphasise that notion of subjectivity
 that's why it is called subjective criticism 
Whose subjectivity you can ask ?
The readers the writers there is also narrator involved
in the process of narrative the all subjects the
reader is a subject the writer is a subject the character who
narrates is a subject 
So whose subjectivity and how one subjectivity is imbricated
with another you know these are all complex say philosophical
problems particularly when you deal with the narrativity you come
across these kind of interesting uh I would say that colonical 
of very interesting notions about subjectivity 
And that's why you know subjectivity
Objectivity is a very is a false notion according
to these there is nothing called objectivity you cannot be objective
 objective 
You assume that the whole world can be reduced into some kind of
 immense neutrality which is a kind of objectivity 
Is it possible to do that ?
The world also as a subject is constituted by your
consciousness if individual response to the world in his own particular
way where to get the sense of objectivity
How is it that you want to be objective ?
What is the basis of objectivity ?
And who actually makes the basis ?
The very fact that you define objectivity you are already 
implicated into the very definition which is your personal
definition 
That is why it's a very very false notion the idea of
objectivity there is nothing called objectivity 
One is relatively uh you can say uh relatively know
like subjectivity and objectivity or subjectivity refers to the subject
objectivity refers to the object 
And the does the object exist independently of your
consciousness ?
How does the object get a realised do you 
perceive a thing all of you in a same way 
When you come into the room your eyes you know glances at
something not the entire thing and the same eye of another person
doesn't glance at the same thing 
So there is all like all I say you the sense of perception 
had already reduced things into some kind of selectional it has already
selected which thing to see and which thing to exclude from vision
from perception 
So the act of perception itself is a selective art and when
the process of selection has already taken place in in a mental uh
you know when when it is in a mental process that the idea of
objectivity is lost
You don't see the whole world together at a time 
You see piecemeal and it comes to you through fragments 
And the very fact that you will be selective uh whether you
like it or not you are selective in your glance in your vision that
actually negates the very idea of objectivity 
How do you then make sense of the world ?
If the world is such a vast thing which you can't see at a
time everything how do you then make sense of the world ?
Can you really objectively say that the world is like this ?
You know so these are all illusions and uh western
philosophers particularly created the notion of objectivity as an
idea it's a kind of platonic fallacy you can say something 
exterior exists and we intuitively realise it's sense it and
the very idea of intuition perhaps negates the idea of objectivity that
you have some intui intuition in
your think in your perception that negates the idea of subjectivity 
uh objectivity
So phenomenology says that objectivity is nothing it's
 just an illusion and everything perception is personal subjective
You see things the way you want to see them sometimes you
refuse to see 
Deliberately you do not like to see things because you don't
like to see them 
But your vision is always selective in its own way it
always selects things from a mass of events mass of things that you
 uh are scattered around you you select a few because
perhaps in a very i i interesting 
 way logical way become some to your uh thinking 
So you select something that confirms to your line of thinking
and so on and so forth 
So basically any kind of response is a subjective response
That is a case which phenomenology makes 
You read a text you like it or you don't like it yes 
Sir phenomenology is the operate experience at
subjective level
Yes
But uh at its various uh student criticism like
uh as you referred to rather the guidance of these landmarks feminist
criticism or even black literature and so forth and so on cough 
there since phenolism phenomenology applies to a sort of group
volunteers
Yes it is a group concept I think
So how this various or even the idea of new colonisation
example literary criticism or literary creation so all this
interpretation are can be traced back to the idea of phenomenology
only in a way 
You can do that you can say that 
If there is some if there is a kind of group response and
the collective response to something like you have mentioned the
feminists or the blacks there have been
From the third world
Any way cough but if there are variations if
you look at the individual but there is something called and I that
is why I say that and it varies from group to group it varies from
person to person and within group there are lot of divergences and you
can take note of that 
If we account for all those divergences within the
commonality which is a kind of one word imposed upon those
desperate tendencies in individual perception
In fact every individuals movements breaks down before it
 takes off 
 Naturally naturally
Nature of the very idea of phenomenology
Naturally so it is the very basis of human perception
 you
 A few words they were talking about their
Commonwealth now they say
Yeah about these this whole idea but you know
commonwealth of course is a very hetrogeneous concept
There is no Commonwealth response
 A few words 
Yes
You can say there may be a third world reference
 But they didn't 
But they didn't talked about it to start with
See they talked about it but you see how can you then say
the Australian response is similar to Indian response or the Canadian
response Commonwealth within Commonwealth if they belong to the first
world
But still they didn't talked about it
See this is as I say it is a desperate ideas yoked in
violence you know it's kind of hetrogenity and that also is a
very debatable idea 
Is there any communality of this kind of political term which
unites the erstwhile colonies but the response of a
Canadian response certainly is closer to the American response than uh uh
an Indian response
And you can't uh uh say that a first world country like Canada
 uh response this in the same way as a third world country
So there is a lot of variations but uh phenomenology doesn't
talk of course of a group response kind of thing
They talk of individual and they don't really like the idea of
this collective response is like collective action and if they name
it some we will talk about that later on a slightly when we talk about to
reader response criticism 
But the collective response idea also is self contradictory
Response cannot be collective because two people two persons
do not think alike 
And you group them together and say you think alike and you
can't control human thinking it is so spontaneous 
Your own response is so spontaneous you can only politically
manipulate the whole thinking process even to suit your convenience
It is a political manipulation of human mind can be controlled
technologically you know but human response certainly tries to
evade this kind of technologing of the spirit 
Spirit could not be technologised in way you want them want it
to be technologised but you can't even say you can't say there
is nothing called collective response 
Blacks certainly think in their own way there is communality of
interest 
There is certainly when it comes to the the question of
white domination they certainly respond in very general way about
the notion of domination ideology power and so on and so forth and that
is the kind of
But it is not perception these people deal with more intensely deal
more intensely with how you percieve things how things get realised
in your consciousness get realised in your perception how things take
shape in your mind so it is the the the kind of ideatic according to
Ferrel you refer you induce it to some kind of ideatic 
ideatic reflection or ideatic uh uh reduction ideatic reduction or
reflection idea if now reduced to that level of perception 
perceptual you know 
And a concept arises out of the innate perceptuality of
her idea so that innate perception you perceive then you
conceptualise
First is perceive you perceive in your mental eye and
that perceptuality of every ob the object gets realised 
through your perceptuality your perception 
There is no object until you see it in your mental eyes
 It's not just a visual perception but is a very uh as
you know is a very is a mental perception 
You perceive the object and suddenly the object take shape in
your mind then you conceptualise about it
Conceptualisation is a cerebral process that takes place
only after the mental perception takes place has taken
place 
This is the way all visible objects are reduced to modes
 by which you perceive an inner reality 
As I say that it has some complicity with the plutonic idea of
essence that the whole world is reduced to the object in a very
miniature way
In a miniature way the the visible world that you see is a
miniature copy of the idea the essence which has occured it has
that kind of traditional plutonic kind of notions of the visible and
the invisible axis 
What you see visible is only a manifestation of the invisible
perception 
The mind works in its own way and makes things possible
So the object gets realised to a mental process and then it
becomes manifested through the phenomenology of the object which is a
manifestation is possible because of the mental perception 
This is the idea of the ideatic reduction bracketing 
everything is bracketed between you and the others
So you operate at a very higher level of uh uhm 
relationship between the object 
So the objectivity is not uh nothing is objective per se 
there is nothing called objectivity per se you know 
Objectivity is a realisation of the higher mode of
subjectivity 
Objectivity the id object objectivity is the
whole idea the objectiveness objectivity the object uh the
objectiveness the object the objectness objectivity is objectness
So the objectness which you call objectivity the very
quality of the object is manifested through your subjective perception
That is why where do you get the idea of objectivity 
uh without you know some subjectivity 
Subjectivity makes the objectness possible objectivity is
possible 
So the object and subject come together in a very mystical
way and that is why consciousness is the consciousness of an object
You cannot have subjectivity without objectivity 
You cannot have objectivity without subjectivity 
This is the subject object relationship and uh the whole
world the whole perception of the perceptual world is possible
 because of this axis because of this relationship between the subject
and the object 
Am I clear on this ?
Okay this is the basis of phenomenology and as you know
 as you know already rightly pointed out that this is the fundamental
 uh way by which you realise the object that you see around you
The world comes becomes visible because of the mental 
already mental process which was on and you create the object in
your own perception
