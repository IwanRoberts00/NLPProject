Hello  I deserve as a
""
""
That is why it has that philosophical 
""
And uhm  lot of
""
""
""
""
about  subjectivity
""
""
You know 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
So the idea of subjectivity is not a very simple idea 
""
""
""
""
And subsequently it became a problematical idea 
""
""
it's 
""
""
the subject who is the object  ?
""
""
you know  and
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
narrates is a subject 
""
So whose subjectivity  and how one subjectivity is imbricated
""
problems  you come
across 
""
""
And  why you know subjectivity
""
Objectivity is a very  according
to these  there is nothing called objectivity you cannot be objective
""
""
""
""
""
Is it possible to do that  ?
""
The world also  by your
consciousness  if individual response to the world in his own particular
""
""
""
""
What is the basis of objectivity  ?
""
""
""
""
""
definition 
""
""
objectivity 
""
""
like subjectivity and objectivity  or subjectivity refers to the subject
objectivity 
""
And the  of your
""
""
How does the object get 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
So the act of perception itself is a selective art  and when
""
""
objectivity is lost
""
You don't see the whole world 
""
You see piecemeal 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
You know  and uh western
""
""
""
""
""
your think in your perception 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
refuse to see 
""
Deliberately you  do not like to see things because you don't
""
""
But  it
""
 because
""
""
""
So you select something that confirms to  your line of thinking
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Sir  experience at
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
criticism or even black literature and 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
example literary criticism or  so all this
""
only 
""
""
You can do that you can say that 
""
If there is some  and
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
you look at the individual  that
""
""
can take note of that 
""
""
commonality  imposed upon those
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Commonwealth  now they say
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
the Australian response is similar to Indian response or the Canadian
""
world
""
""
""
""
""
See this is as I say it is a desperate ideas  yoked in
""
very debatable idea 
""
Is there any communality of  this kind of political term which
unites  a
""
""
""
""
""
""
So there is a lot of variations  but uh phenomenology doesn't
""
""
""
""
""
reader response criticism 
""
But the collective response idea also  is self contradictory
""
""
Response cannot be collective  because two people two persons
""
""
And you group them together and say you think alike  and you
""
""
""
manipulate the whole  even to suit your convenience
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
to be  there
""
""
Blacks certainly think in their own way there is communality of
""
""
""
white domination  about
the notion of domination ideology power and so on and so forth  and that
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
reflection 
""
""
""
her idea  then you
""
""
First  and
that perceptuality of every 
""
""
There is no object until  in your mental eyes
""
""
you know is a very is a mental perception 
""
""
""
""
""
only after  has taken
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
miniature copy of the idea  it has
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
manifestation 
""
This is the idea of the ideatic reduction 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Objectivity  objectivity is the
""
objectiveness the object  objectness
""
""
""
quality of the object  is manifested through your subjective perception
""
""
""
uh without you know some subjectivity 
""
Subjectivity makes the objectness possible  objectivity is
possible 
""
So the object and subject come together  in a very mystical
way  is the consciousness of an object
""
""
You cannot have subjectivity without objectivity 
""
You cannot have objectivity without subjectivity 
""
""
world  is possible
 because of this relationship between the subject
""
""
""
""
""
""
 that you see around you
""
""
""
""
your own perception
