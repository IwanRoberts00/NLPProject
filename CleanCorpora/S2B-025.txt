Graham Greene 
""
He can now look back on a career in writing  which has covered
over sixty years 
""
This programme  whom many critics
regard as the finest author  never to have won the nobel prize for
literature 
""
In order to  understand what a writer or a poet is about
 about his background and his
life 
""
Graham Greene was born  on the second of October nineteen hundred
and four 
""
Uh his father was the headmaster of Birkamstate school
""
And that is where Graham Greene did his earlier education 
""
He won a scholarship to go to Belliol College Oxford 
""
And it was at Oxford that he first started writing 
""
Uh his first 
Babling April 
""
Soon after he left 
married a catholic lady 
""
The marriage wasn't very successful and  it ended in a divorce
""
""
Uh Greene went through a very long period of extreme depression
""
""
He continued writing 
""
He wrote three novels
""
None of them  and although they
were published he later  disclaimed having done them and refused to allow
them to be 
""
He worked for a time  Times of London
 and did a lot of journalism
""
""
And then he began his travels 
""
He travelled extensively 
""
He is one of the most widely travelled  uh in the
world today 
""
Uh he went specifically to look for material 
he stayed a long time got to know the people  and got whatever he wanted
for his novels 
""
Uh his first successful book only in terms of uh  sales was
""
""
It wasn't very uh outstanding but it gave him a break
""
He got recognised and was taken a little more seriously  then he
had been with his first three novels 
""
Then followed a veritable  and of all kinds
 books of travel adventure detective stories essays
 you name them and Graham Greene was writing
them 
""
Uh it  find
anyone who did such a vast range of writing 
""
Therefore it is really very difficult to put any kind of lable on
him  because he wrote on just every single topic that even you can think
of 
""
However uh three or four of his books were really taken very
seriously  uh
particularly the ones I will mention later  were some kind of his
philosophy of life comes through 
""
Now  ?
""
As I said before he is a Catholic  but in politics he was
pretty close to being a communist 
""
He is an extremely extreme leftist  uh knew and admired people
like Fidel Castro of Cuba 
""
Uh he was denied a passport  to the United States
because of his leftists leanings 
""
It was again very wrong to try and lable him even in politics 
""
He  convinced in his writings that you cannot really make
black and white decisions  there is a
vast grey area 
""
In his first volume of his autobiography called  A sort of
life 
""
He  to his earlier novels
and quotes  and goes something like
this  our
interest are on the dangerous edge of things  the
tender murderer 
""
Now you can see the contradiction in terms here 
""
And in the second volume he makes it even clear
""
The second volume being known as  The ways of escape
""
""
He talks of the appalling strangeness of the mercy of God 
""
So you can see that there was no  between
right and wrong 
""
While I was looking through 
preparing on Graham Greene to talk about him  I was struck by a strange
coincidence  which also
happens to be Mahatma 
""
Uh I don't believe in astrology  but I was very curious to know
 as is
maintained by astrologers that people born under the same  combination of
stars 
""
Now obviously there wasn't really a  to the outword eye very
much in common 
""
Uh Gandhi was a devout Hindu  who only wrote
because he wanted to convey his message 
""
Greeen on the other hand was an Englishman a Catholic  and his
primary interest was writing  a mission that he like Gandhi had
""
""
But there was one thing very 
""
Both were deeply concerned 
""
""
landless peasantry  in
""
""
He didn't bother about rest of the world very much 
""
He travelled very little  studies in England
and this  and
then once as the member of the round table conference this uh 
representing the  all his travel
was 
""
Graham Greene hardly ever lived in England his native country and
he was travelling all the time 
""
But while Gandhiji looked to the poor in his country Graham Greene
was most concerned with drop outs  of society in all parts of the
world 
""
His main characters are  uh
drug-pedlars 
""
Now the other thing  have some kind of
contrast 
""
He believed that there is something fundamentally good in every
person  uh the man could be changed completely
""
""
Now Greene was not so naive 
""
He does not believe in the innate goodness of man  he believed
that something good in the worst of us and something bad in the  best of
us 
""
And he was closer to the reality 
""
Third thing which uh  both
were concerned with the struggle  uh the
eternal battle between right and wrong 
""
Gandhiji 
believed 
""
""
Now again  the
good always triumphs over  truthfulness always scored
 good
people suffered 
""
Uh I think these were the things that I think one should bear in
mind when comparing 
""
Now I come to 
""
I think the three best known  uh and most seriously taken by
critics 
Power and the Glory  Heart of the
Matter  is the third
""
I think they are the three most outstanding works of Graham Greene
""
""
Now  with the
career of a young delinquent  his one ambition
in life is to get the better of Olioni  a bigger racketier who has made a
lot of money 
""
Uh Pinky has a catholic girl friend called Rose 
""
He is a drunkard
""
He is a violent man 
""
And in the process of trying to become  the leader of the gang
""
""
Then he picks up the young protestant girl  and they
have an affair for a long time  really brings him
to justice and he is 
""
Here you see  although Greene was a catholic and his main
character Pinky is a catholic  uh the person who betrays him but for the
goodness  is a girl of
loose morals 
""
You see this even in  what I
think is probably is very best novel  The Power and the Glory
""
""
This is set in Mexico  severe persecution
by the state 
for uh  putting them
in jails 
""
And here we have two characters  one is a
drunkard 
""
The other has taken a vow of chastity and yet gone and got married
""
So  with the basic tenets of
catholicism 
""
And they are on the run 
""
This priest who  sired a bastard child and is
drunkard  successfully getting out of the country in just as he is
coming close to the border and to freedom  he gets a message that a poor
peasant  catholic person is dying and he would like his last sacraments to
be performed 
""
He takes the risk of turning back  to go and perform the last
sacraments  uh by a police man who is also a
good man but he wants to do justice 
""
Here you see the mixture of characters uh  catholic priest
drunkard  to the
final test 
""
And the third novel 
""
""
Here we have a character  uh deputy commissioner of police uh
Scobie 
""
Uh he has a rather eccentric wife Louise  who dabbles in writing
""
""
Uh he has a lady friend a young 
""
And it is going on alright till  get
caught in a whole plot  and
Scobie  making
wrong decisions and ends his life ultimately in suicide 
""
Uh Scobie also is a catholic and  suicide is a sin by the
catholic church 
""
And here once again clearly  the
conflict between good and evil  and uh
reason  is
absolutely masterly 
""
Graham Greene undoubtedly is the most famous and highly respected
English writer 
""
In nineteen eighty-six he was appointed to the order of merit 
""
In nineteen eighty-eight  he received the British film
institute award for his services to the cinema  that he has not yet been
awarded the nobel prize for literature  is a puzzle to most people outside
the British Academy 
""
People have asked why hasn't he  been given the nobel prize for
literature the greatest award  ?
""
Well the answer I think is pretty simple 
""
Uh Greene is essentially  Mau
""
""
Uh not one of his description really  rises above straight
writing 
""
He hasn't got the 
""
He is really a  that his
writing is very constricted and there are no spare words that he uses 
nothing embellished 
""
And perhaps the  people who decide on these things are more
impressive with smart  memorable description
""
""
As far as philosophy is concerned  Graham Greene is far too
subtle  of the
nobel prize committee
