Graham Greene recently celebrated his eighty-fifth birthday 
He can now look back on a career in writing which has covered
over sixty years 
This programme pays homage to Graham Greene whom many critics
regard as the finest author never to have won the nobel prize for
literature 
In order to understand what a writer or a poet is about
 it is most important to know something about his background and his
life 
Graham Greene was born on the second of October nineteen hundred
and four at Birkamstate 
Uh his father was the headmaster of Birkamstate school
And that is where Graham Greene did his earlier education 
He won a scholarship to go to Belliol College Oxford 
And it was at Oxford that he first started writing 
Uh his first work was a collection of poems called 
Babling April 
Soon after he left Belliol he converted to Catholicism 
married a catholic lady 
The marriage wasn't very successful and it ended in a divorce
Uh Greene went through a very long period of extreme depression
He continued writing 
He wrote three novels
None of them which he rated very high and although they
were published he later disclaimed having done them and refused to allow
them to be reprinted 
He worked for a time in the Times of London
 and The Spectator and did a lot of journalism
And then he began his travels 
He travelled extensively 
He is one of the most widely travelled authors uh in the
world today 
Uh he went specifically to look for material for his books 
he stayed a long time got to know the people and got whatever he wanted
for his novels 
Uh his first successful book only in terms of uh sales was
 Istanbul Train uh based on the Orient Express 
It wasn't very uh outstanding but it gave him a break
He got recognised and was taken a little more seriously then he
had been with his first three novels 
Then followed a veritable flood of books and of all kinds
 books of poetry books of travel adventure detective stories essays
 childern's books you name them and Graham Greene was writing
them 
Uh it really in the sheer output it is hard to find
anyone who did such a vast range of writing 
Therefore it is really very difficult to put any kind of lable on
him because he wrote on just every single topic that even you can think
of 
However uh three or four of his books were really taken very
seriously and uh one can see in those uh novels uh
particularly the ones I will mention later were some kind of his
philosophy of life comes through 
Now what kind of uh belief did Graham Greene have ?
As I said before he is a Catholic but in politics he was
pretty close to being a communist 
He is an extremely extreme leftist uh knew and admired people
like Fidel Castro of Cuba 
Uh he was denied a passport uh a visa to the United States
because of his leftists leanings 
It was again very wrong to try and lable him even in politics 
He is convinced in his writings that you cannot really make
black and white decisions or black and white distinctions there is a
vast grey area uh which really has more truth in it 
In his first volume of his autobiography called A sort of
life which he uh wrote in nineteen seventy-one 
He talks of what he calls an epigraph to his earlier novels
and quotes Bishop Bagrum's apology and goes something like
this Our interests are on the dangerous edge of things our
interest are on the dangerous edge of things the honest thief the
tender murderer the superstitious atheist 
Now you can see the contradiction in terms here 
And in the second volume he makes it even clear
The second volume being known as The ways of escape
 
He talks of the appalling strangeness of the mercy of God 
So you can see that there was no distinct line between
right and wrong goodness and badness 
While I was looking through uh uh notes making 
preparing on Graham Greene to talk about him I was struck by a strange
coincidence that he was born on the second of October which also
happens to be Mahatma Gandhi's birthday 
Uh I don't believe in astrology but I was very curious to know
 if there was anything in common between these two men as is
maintained by astrologers that people born under the same combination of
stars have similar careers 
Now obviously there wasn't really a to the outword eye very
much in common 
Uh Gandhi was a devout Hindu a pacifist who only wrote
because he wanted to convey his message 
Greeen on the other hand was an Englishman a Catholic and his
primary interest was writing not a mission that he like Gandhi had
But there was one thing very common between the two 
Both were deeply concerned with the lowest of the lowly 
 Gandhiji's interest was with harijans 
landless peasantry and those who had been indiscriminated against in
 his own country 
He didn't bother about rest of the world very much 
He travelled very little apart from his studies in England
and this couple of years he spent in South Africa as a lawyer and
then once as the member of the round table conference this uh 
representing the Congress party all his travel
was rest of his travel was in India 
Graham Greene hardly ever lived in England his native country and
he was travelling all the time 
But while Gandhiji looked to the poor in his country Graham Greene
was most concerned with drop outs in of society in all parts of the
world 
His main characters are uh thieves robbers uh
drug-pedlars the scum of society 
Now the other thing uh where the two have some kind of
contrast Gandhiji believed in the innate goodness of man 
He believed that there is something fundamentally good in every
person and if it appealed to uh the man could be changed completely
Now Greene was not so naive 
He does not believe in the innate goodness of man he believed
that something good in the worst of us and something bad in the best of
us 
And he was closer to the reality 
Third thing which uh is of interest is that uh both
were concerned with the struggle between good and evil uh the
eternal battle between right and wrong 
Gandhiji uh being devoutly religious uh belief 
believed that ultimately goodness always triumphs over evil 
 Satyamev Jayate 
Now again Greene was not so naive to believe that uh the
good always triumphs over bad that uh truthfulness always scored
 over evil because he saw that many times people good
people suffered and evil people prospered 
Uh I think these were the things that I think one should bear in
mind when comparing the careers of these two people 
Now I come to some of his books to illustrate 
I think the three best known uh and most seriously taken by
critics are Brighten Rock is one and 
Power and the Glory is another one and Heart of the
Matter is the third
I think they are the three most outstanding works of Graham Greene
Now Brighten Rock concerns itself with the
career of a young delinquent a catholic Pinky his one ambition
in life is to get the better of Olioni a bigger racketier who has made a
lot of money 
Uh Pinky has a catholic girl friend called Rose 
He is a drunkard
He is a violent man 
And in the process of trying to become the leader of the gang
 he kills an innocent journalist 
Then he picks up the young protestant girl Ida and they
have an affair for a long time and Ida ultimately really brings him
to justice and he is taken arrested 
Here you see although Greene was a catholic and his main
character Pinky is a catholic uh the person who betrays him but for the
goodness for the right cause so that justice is done is a girl of
loose morals a protestant girl called Ida 
You see this even in more uh clarity in the what I
think is probably is very best novel The Power and the Glory
This is set in Mexico at the time of uh severe persecution
by the state of the catholic church uh the police were hunting 
for uh catholic priests murdering them bringing them putting them
in jails 
And here we have two characters uh catholic priest one is a
drunkard uh he has a mistress he sired a bastard child through her 
The other has taken a vow of chastity and yet gone and got married
So both in that sense have defied with the basic tenets of
catholicism 
And they are on the run from the police 
This priest who has uh sired a bastard child and is
drunkard is successfully getting out of the country in just as he is
coming close to the border and to freedom he gets a message that a poor
peasant catholic person is dying and he would like his last sacraments to
be performed 
He takes the risk of turning back to go and perform the last
sacraments is caught and executed uh by a police man who is also a
good man but he wants to do justice 
Here you see the mixture of characters uh catholic priest
drunkard uh siring illegitimate children and yet when it comes to the
final test atleast giving up his life and becoming a martyr 
And the third novel uh Heart of the Matter 
 it is set in West Africa 
Here we have a character uh deputy commissioner of police uh
Scobie who is a good upright man 
Uh he has a rather eccentric wife Louise who dabbles in writing
Uh he has a lady friend a young widow called Helen 
And it is going on alright till slowly he begins to uh get
caught in a whole plot where a innocent journalist is murdered and
Scobie in trying to investigate is uh laid up wrong making
wrong decisions and ends his life ultimately in suicide 
Uh Scobie also is a catholic and suicide is a sin by the
catholic church 
And here once again clearly you see the dichotomy the
conflict between good and evil between belief faith and uh
reason and the way Greene mixes these characters is
absolutely masterly 
Graham Greene undoubtedly is the most famous and highly respected
English writer 
In nineteen eighty-six he was appointed to the order of merit 
In nineteen eighty-eight he received the British film
institute award for his services to the cinema that he has not yet been
awarded the nobel prize for literature is a puzzle to most people outside
the British Academy 
People have asked why hasn't he been given the nobel prize for
literature the greatest award ?
Well the answer I think is pretty simple 
Uh Greene is essentially a story teller in the Mau
 Somerset Maugham's tradition 
Uh not one of his description really rises above straight
writing 
He hasn't got the turn up phrase 
He is really a master craftsman only in as much that his
writing is very constricted and there are no spare words that he uses 
nothing embellished 
And perhaps the people who decide on these things are more
impressive with smart writing turn up phrase memorable description
 or sometime the philosophy 
As far as philosophy is concerned Graham Greene is far too
subtle uh for people of who form the decision making body of the
nobel prize committee
