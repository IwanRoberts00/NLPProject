He can now look back on a career in writing  which has covered
""
""
""
""
literature 
""
In order to  understand what a writer or a poet is about
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
And it was at Oxford that he first started writing 
""
""
Babling April 
""
""
married a catholic lady 
""
The marriage wasn't very successful and  it ended in a divorce
""
""
Uh Greene went through a very long period of extreme depression
""
""
He continued writing 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
And then he began his travels 
""
He travelled extensively 
""
He is one of the most widely travelled  uh in the
world today 
""
""
he stayed a long time got to know the people  and got whatever he wanted
for his novels 
""
Uh his first successful book only in terms of uh  sales was
""
""
""
""
He got recognised and was taken a little more seriously  then he
had been with his first three novels 
""
Then followed a veritable  and of all kinds
 books of travel adventure detective stories essays
""
them 
""
Uh it  find
anyone who did such a vast range of writing 
""
""
""
""
""
However uh three or four of his books were really taken very
""
""
philosophy of life comes through 
""
""
""
As I said before he is a Catholic  but in politics he was
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
this  our
interest are on the dangerous edge of things  the
tender murderer 
""
Now you can see the contradiction in terms here 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
preparing on Graham Greene to talk about him  I was struck by a strange
""
""
""
""
""
maintained by astrologers that people born under the same  combination of
""
""
""
""
""
Uh Gandhi was a devout Hindu  who only wrote
""
""
""
primary interest was writing  a mission that he like Gandhi had
""
""
But there was one thing very 
""
Both were deeply concerned 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
he was travelling all the time 
""
""
""
""
""
His main characters are  uh
""
""
Now the other thing  have some kind of
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
He does not believe in the innate goodness of man  he believed
""
us 
""
""
""
""
were concerned with the struggle  uh the
""
""
Gandhiji 
""
""
""
""
""
 good
""
""
Uh I think these were the things that I think one should bear in
""
""
Now I come to 
""
""
""
""
""
""
I think they are the three most outstanding works of Graham Greene
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
He is a violent man 
""
And in the process of trying to become  the leader of the gang
""
""
Then he picks up the young protestant girl  and they
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
This is set in Mexico  severe persecution
by the state 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
This priest who  sired a bastard child and is
""
coming close to the border and to freedom  he gets a message that a poor
""
be performed 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
final test 
""
""
""
""
""
Scobie 
""
Uh he has a rather eccentric wife Louise  who dabbles in writing
""
""
Uh he has a lady friend a young 
""
And it is going on alright till  get
caught in a whole plot  and
""
wrong decisions and ends his life ultimately in suicide 
""
Uh Scobie also is a catholic and  suicide is a sin by the
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Graham Greene undoubtedly is the most famous and highly respected
""
""
In nineteen eighty-six he was appointed to the order of merit 
""
In nineteen eighty-eight  he received the British film
""
awarded the nobel prize for literature  is a puzzle to most people outside
the British Academy 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
writing 
""
He hasn't got the 
""
""
writing is very constricted and there are no spare words that he uses 
nothing embellished 
""
""
impressive with smart  memorable description
""
""
As far as philosophy is concerned  Graham Greene is far too
subtle  of the
