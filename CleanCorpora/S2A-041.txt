As uh my guru is here I can breath
more freely uhm 
And he is going to record my talk also 
Well I selected this topic E L L English
Language Learning uhm we have read and heard so much about
E L T now 
Perhaps you may find it interesting and this is the last period
uhm so I don't want you to be bored 
So this is a new topic uhm E L L uhn
not quite new 
You know that second language learning and first language
learning first language learning is at takes place uhm
early in childhood and it is acquired you know 
And second language learning takes place when we are adult
So it is learned uhm
So acquisition and learning while this cough uh 
differentiation you know acquisition and learning 
But here I'm putting before you a new outlook
Even second language learning is acquisition like first
language acquisition because to acquire second language is 
to take an additional language after having acquired one language 
after having fully acquired one language 
So that's why we call it second language 
Now what the difference between the two learner L one
learner and L two learner ?
Now if we observe L one learner we can very easily see
 that even their proficiency is at very low level 
Well they never hesitate using their first
language for you can observe children uh you can observe uh
around you so many you see persons even those persons who never go to
school uhm especially children 
Now if we observe L two learner second language learner they
are mostly adult because if they are not adults and if first
language and second language uhm if a child acquires then even that
second language is like first language uhm if the child acquire
simultaneously 
And as we are adult we are more cognitively mature 
Second language learners are more cognitively mature 
They are have more metalinguistic awareness
Well this is word this is sentence this is phrase know
metalinguistic awareness second language learner 
And they have more word knowledge say this is the difference
between uh L one learners and L two learners 
Now in learning L two we observe two psychological processes
Now one is simplification and another is over
generalisation 
Now L two learner shall have this tendency of simplification
Well he while learning target language or second language
 well he tries to simplify 
Well at all linguistic level like lexical level morphological level
 even at syntactic level 
And there are many jokes also 
Now here is one example uhm from morphological level 
 Two chicken many bird
 well plural form plural form well is missing here
 Many bird many birds you know 
But many bird two chicken now this occurs
at the morphological level simplification 
Well there is no need of birds because
there is many birds is not
needed because there is many 
Then uh you may take even the language of telegram 
language of telegram
Now this is simplification at the syntactic level 
Well refresher course ends tomorrow I I don't know when
ends you know laughter 
But you may telegram send a telegram 
 Refresher course ends tomorrow uhm home Sunday or Monday or 
uhm whatever day it is 
Now here uh say articles are missing prepositions are missing
Well this is the example of simplification at the syntactic level
Then well there are many examples of over generalisation 
Uhn L two learners uhm uh over generalise it at all
linguistic levels again 
Say instead of using specific verbs like fly 
run well he uses the nuclear verb like go
 
Now go is a nuclear verb you know it is cover term you see
Instead of using specific verbs like run fly travel
 etcetera he uses go 
Well this is one example of over generalisation you see at
the lexical level 
Now where the morphological level I think you know 
wh when you assess you see uh the writing of
your students you may come across many of them instead of went
gone instead of you now went gone 
instead of children child instead of
 children you know child 
So this occurs at the morphological level uhm over
generalisation 
So first thing we observe in this L two learning is
L two learning is not linear or cumulative 
We do not go on adding the structures one by one or we do not
learn them all at a time 
You see this L two learning is uh neither linear nor
cumulative 
But this is somewhat U shaped you know U shape learning
Now I will explain this uh unfortunately I don't have a piece of
chalk and duster you know
But uh I will try to explain 
Well in the beginning when learning is almost 
mechanic mechanical say the right use of the 
right use of plural suffix s or es 
 L two learner you see catches it 
And in terms of accuracy in terms of accuracy well he
 must be given hundred percent mark that is the beginning 
But this learning is mechanic this learning is 
mechanic mechanical he is accurate he learns
mechanically as we say know parrot learning 
So and then his level of accuracy falls down well he
he begins to commit error 
He begins to commit error 
His level of accuracy falls down 
And then again it rises this level rises so that's 
why you know I said U shaped 
U shape learning L two learning is U shape and even first
language learning is also U shape 
So first there is high level of accuracy and then low
level then again high level of accuracy 
There are three stages first stage high level second stage
low level third stage again high level 
Here this U shaped learning strategy U shape
learning strategy that L two learner uses while learning second
language is worth considering seriously 
Unless we know how our students learn second language 
no methods will be useful 
We will never be successful 
We will never be successful
Uhm let me tell you once again 
Well we should know them how they learn ?
What strategies they use ?
Uh what are the processes that take place while learning L two ?
And this is very important process uhm U shaped learning 
Now there are three stages let me repeat again first
stage mechanical learning when we go on adding the structure 
Second stage second stage when accuracy falls down 
Now this takes place because once a structure is
mechanically learn once a structure is mechanically learnt the whole
system is again restructured 
The whole system is again refined 
Uhm whatever language proficiency the second language learner
has it is again disturbed when new information is added when new
structure is learned 
Now the whole structure is you see renewed again 
Now this is the second stage that's why the learner
 you see makes many mistakes 
He commits many error 
Now third stage after restructuring the system again his
accuracy level rises 
He makes no mistakes 
Well he well his proficiency level also rises 
So this U shape development is very important process in
second language learning because it deals with the error that the
learner makes 
Yes if we consider these errors then we can know
our students or second language learner 
But we teacher pay very little attention to our to our
student to the error that they commit to the mistakes you know that
they make while learning 
Now it is part of their on going process of learning second
language 
Well making you see mistakes or committing error well it
is part of the process of learning second language 
And that's why we should take it very serious we
as teacher and try to analyse the the error that they make and
then judge or decide the level of proficiency uhm they they have
achieved 
Now there are two kinds of error they make or two sets of
errors they make 
Now first is interlingua error B B writing 
interlingual error well they are interfrance error B B
writing 
And second intralingual intralingual error B
B writing they are developmental error B B writing 
Now these errors interlingual error are mostly
interfrance error our see first language interfrance interferes with
the second language learning and uh we we find our student 
transfering you see the the features of their first language to their
second language 
This we can identify very easily 
Now intralingual error these are the developmental error 
They are part of the development of you see the student or the
learner in second language 
So here you know I say it is one word B B
writing 
It is part of the process of learning second language 
Now interlingual error are error because of our
attitude you know behaviourist or what you call see even 
structural I call bahaviourist B B writing or product 
oriented B B writing 
And this is process oriented 
Well here I have in my mind the teacher versus the
researcher 
Now for me teacher is more important 
Now researcher may level it anything but we must be able to
identify it among our student among the learner that they come to us 
So we must be able to identify you see these interlingual
error uhm which are the product of our view to language learning 
Our view uhm towards language learning if our view is product
oriented we find these errors but if our view is process oriented
 if we think that learning second language is a process you see then
 the errors are intralingual error 
So this I leave to the teacher 
Now here one important thing must be noted at
every stage of learning the second language learner at every stage
of learning the second language learner has his own language which is
called interlanguage B B writing interlanguage 
And this interlanguage lies somewhere between first language
and second language 
But it is the learners language 
It is the learners language at every stage the learner you
see arrives at his own language and that is his interlanguage 
It is always under fluctuation changing because it is 
part of the process it is part of the process 
Now this interlanguage theory you see developed in about
nineteen sixty-nine well is very important 
Now it is nothing but an interium grammar it is
nothing but an interium grammar that the second language learner
develops or L two learner develops on his way to target language
On his way to when going towards on his way to target language
It is an interium grammar 
Now it is in itself a system distinct from L one and L two
first language and second language 
And this is the language that we as teachers first understand 
If we succeed in understanding this interlanguage of the learner
 yes we will be a success well in what you say teaching the
language and they will be success in learning the language 
 Ou our own strategy of
presenting our material asking them to do some task you see our way
of guiding them will depend upon our knowledge of this interlanguage of
the second language learner 
Now here I don't say we fail we I don't say we fail
 but well we we ignore to to some extent well we we take liberty
to to some extent and here you see what I say we go away from our
student 
If we are language teacher we must make our best to
identify this interlanguage 
At what stage the process of learning the second language
learning is now you see if a teacher knows this he knows his student 
he knows the process 
He will be able to guide and he is the best teacher 
Uhm well in in my opinion a teacher knowing all the
methods of teaching is not a good teacher laughter uh uh
the teacher one who knows his student well one who knows his learners
well is the good teacher 
Then only you will be able to guide 
If now there are uh many level given to this 
interlanguage uhm I don't you see waste your time on it 
But interlanguage is very curious you see how a a
learner reaches that stage of interlanguage uhm is very interesting to
know 
Well this process takes place in a certain sequence in a
certain order and this sequence this order well you may call
acquisition order language acquisition order or you may say
developmental sequence B B writing developmental sequence 
Well this is psychological process and only researcher
can know this uhm how how it takes place 
Well we we teacher can judge it only by the results that
we get from the student uhm but a good researcher uhm knows very well
 how this process takes place process of forming ones own
interlanguage 
But this is not uhm formed by mechanical learning 
Now this is formed by following this acquisition order 
or developmental sequence 
You see developmental sequence now uh I will mention two 
well uh project you see undertaken and also completed 
One was on interrogative and another was on negative
