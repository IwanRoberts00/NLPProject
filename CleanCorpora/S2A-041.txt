As uh  I can breath
more freely 
""
And he is going to 
""
Well I  English
Language Learning  read and heard so much about
E L T now 
""
Perhaps  you may find it interesting and this is the last period
uhm 
""
So this is a new topic  uhn
not quite new 
""
You know that  second language learning and first language
learning  uhm
early in childhood 
""
And second language learning  adult
""
""
So it is learned  uhm
""
So acquisition and learning while this 
differentiation you know acquisition and learning 
""
But here  a new outlook
""
""
Even  is acquisition like first
language acquisition 
to take an additional language 
after having fully acquired one language 
""
So 
""
Now what the difference between  L one
learner and L two learner  ?
""
Now  we can very easily see
""
""
Well  their first
language  uh
around you  those persons who never go to
school 
""
Now if we observe L two learner second language learner  they
are mostly adult  and if first
language and second language  then even that
second language is like first language  uhm if the child acquire
simultaneously 
""
And as we are adult 
""
Second language learners are more cognitively mature 
""
They  more metalinguistic awareness
""
Well this is word this is sentence this is phrase  know
metalinguistic awareness 
""
And they have more word knowledge  say this is the difference
between 
""
Now in learning L two  we observe two psychological processes
""
""
Now one is  and another is over
generalisation 
""
Now L two learner  shall have this tendency of simplification
""
""
Well he  target language or second language
""
""
Well at all linguistic level like lexical level morphological level
""
""
And there are many jokes also 
""
Now here is one example 
""
 many bird
 well is missing here
""
""
""
""
But  now this occurs
at the morphological level 
""
Well there is no need of  because
there is  is not
needed because there is 
""
Then 
language of telegram
""
Now this is simplification at the syntactic level 
""
Well  I I don't know when
ends you know 
""
But you may 
""
uhm 
""
Now here  uh say articles are missing prepositions are missing
""
""
Well this is the example of simplification at the syntactic level
""
""
Then 
""
Uhn L two learners  at all
linguistic levels again 
""
Say 
run  go
""
""
Now go  cover term you see
""
""
Instead of using  run fly travel
""
""
Well this is one example of  you see at
the lexical level 
""
Now where the morphological level I think you know 
wh  uh the writing of
your students you may come across many of them  went
gone 
instead of  instead of
""
""
So this occurs at the morphological level  uhm over
generalisation 
""
So  is
L two learning is not linear or cumulative 
""
We do not go on adding the structures one by one  or we do not
learn them all at a time 
""
You see this L two learning is  uh neither linear nor
cumulative 
""
But this is  you know U shape learning
""
""
Now I will explain this uh unfortunately I don't have a piece of
chalk and duster you know
""
But 
""
Well in the beginning 
mechanic 
right use of plural suffix 
""
""
And  well he
""
""
But this learning is mechanic 
mechanic  he learns
mechanically 
""
So  well he
he begins to commit error 
""
He begins to commit error 
""
His level of accuracy falls down 
""
And then again it rises this level rises 
why you know I said U shaped 
""
U shape learning L two learning is U shape  and even first
language learning is also U shape 
""
So first  and then low
level then again high level of accuracy 
""
There are three stages  high level second stage
low level third stage again 
""
Here  U shape
learning strategy that L two learner uses  second
language 
""
Unless 
no methods will be useful 
""
We will never be successful 
""
We will never be successful
""
Uhm let me tell you once again 
""
Well we should know them how they learn  ?
""
What strategies they use  ?
""
Uh what are the processes that take place while learning L two  ?
""
And this is very important process 
""
Now there are  first
stage 
""
Second stage 
""
Now this  once a structure is
mechanically learn  the whole
system is again restructured 
""
The whole system is again refined 
""
Uhm whatever language  proficiency the second language learner
has  when new information is added when new
structure is learned 
""
Now 
""
Now this is the second stage  why the learner
""
""
He commits many error 
""
Now third stage  again his
accuracy level rises 
""
He makes no mistakes 
""
Well he 
""
So this U shape development  is very important process in
second language learning  it deals with the error that the
learner makes 
""
Yes  we can know
our students or 
""
But we teacher  to our
student  to the mistakes you know that
they make while learning 
""
Now it is part of their on going process of learning second
language 
""
Well making you see mistakes  well it
is part of the process of learning second language 
""
And  very serious we
as teacher  and
then judge or decide  they they have
achieved 
""
Now  or two sets of
errors they make 
""
Now first is 
interlingual error  B B
writing 
""
And second  B
B writing 
""
Now these errors  are mostly
interfrance error  see first language interfrance interferes with
the 
transfering  you see the the features of their first language to their
second language 
""
This we can identify very easily 
""
Now intralingual error 
""
They are part of the development of  you see the student or the
learner 
""
So here you know I say  B B
writing 
""
It is part of the process of learning 
""
Now  because of our
attitude you know behaviourist 
structural I call bahaviourist 
oriented 
""
And this is process oriented 
""
Well here I have in my mind  the
researcher 
""
Now for me teacher is more important 
""
Now researcher may level it anything  but we must be able to
identify it among our student 
""
So we must be able to identify  these interlingual
error 
""
Our view  uhm towards language learning if our view is product
oriented  but if our view is process oriented
 you see then
""
""
So this I leave to the teacher 
""
Now  at
every stage of learning  at every stage
of learning the second language learner  has his own language which is
called interlanguage 
""
And this interlanguage lies somewhere between  first language
and second language 
""
But it is the learners language 
""
It is the learners language  you
see 
""
It is always under fluctuation 
part of the process 
""
Now this interlanguage theory  you see developed in about
nineteen sixty-nine 
""
Now it is nothing but an  it is
nothing but an  grammar that the second language learner
develops  on his way to target language
""
""
On his way to  when going towards on his way to target language
""
""
It is an 
""
Now it is in itself a system  distinct from L one and L two
first language and 
""
And this is the language that we as teachers first understand 
""
If we succeed in understanding this interlanguage of the learner
 teaching the
language and they will be success in learning the language 
""
 own strategy of
presenting our material  you see our way
of guiding them will depend upon  our knowledge of this interlanguage of
the second language learner 
""
Now here  I don't say we fail
 well we we take liberty
to to some extent  you see what I say we go away from our
student 
""
If we are language teacher  make our best to
identify this interlanguage 
""
At what stage  the process of learning the second language
learning is now 
he knows the process 
""
He will be able to guide and he is the best teacher 
""
Uhm well in in my opinion  all the
methods of teaching  uh uh
the teacher one who knows his student well  one who knows his learners
well is the good teacher 
""
Then only you will be able to guide 
""
If 
interlanguage 
""
But  you see how a a
learner reaches that stage of interlanguage  uhm is very interesting to
know 
""
Well this  in a certain sequence in a
certain order  well you may call
acquisition order  you may say
developmental sequence 
""
Well this is psychological process  researcher
can know this uhm how how it takes place 
""
Well we we teacher  only by the results that
we get from the student  uhm but a good researcher uhm knows very well
 forming ones own
interlanguage 
""
But this is not 
""
Now this is formed 
or developmental sequence 
""
You see developmental sequence now 
well uh 
""
One was on interrogative
