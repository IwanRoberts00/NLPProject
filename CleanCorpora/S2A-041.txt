As uh  I can breath
""
""
And he is going to 
""
Well I  English
""
""
""
""
uhm 
""
""
not quite new 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
language acquisition 
""
""
""
""
""
Now what the difference between  L one
""
""
Now  we can very easily see
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
are mostly adult  and if first
""
second language is like first language  uhm if the child acquire
""
""
And as we are adult 
""
""
""
They  more metalinguistic awareness
""
Well this is word this is sentence this is phrase  know
""
""
""
""
""
Now in learning L two  we observe two psychological processes
""
""
Now one is  and another is over
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Now here is one example 
""
""
 well is missing here
""
""
""
""
""
at the morphological level 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
ends you know 
""
""
""
uhm 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
your students you may come across many of them  went
""
instead of  instead of
""
""
""
generalisation 
""
""
L two learning is not linear or cumulative 
""
We do not go on adding the structures one by one  or we do not
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
And  well he
""
""
But this learning is mechanic 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
His level of accuracy falls down 
""
And then again it rises this level rises 
""
""
U shape learning L two learning is U shape  and even first
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
language 
""
""
no methods will be useful 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
What strategies they use  ?
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Second stage 
""
""
mechanically learn  the whole
""
""
""
""
Uhm whatever language  proficiency the second language learner
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Now third stage  again his
accuracy level rises 
""
He makes no mistakes 
""
""
""
""
""
learner makes 
""
Yes  we can know
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
language 
""
Well making you see mistakes  well it
is part of the process of learning second language 
""
""
""
""
""
""
Now  or two sets of
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
B writing 
""
""
interfrance error  see first language interfrance interferes with
""
transfering  you see the the features of their first language to their
second language 
""
This we can identify very easily 
""
Now intralingual error 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
It is part of the process of learning 
""
Now  because of our
attitude you know behaviourist 
""
oriented 
""
And this is process oriented 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
So we must be able to identify  these interlingual
""
""
""
oriented  but if our view is process oriented
""
""
""
So this I leave to the teacher 
""
""
every stage of learning  at every stage
""
""
""
And this interlanguage lies somewhere between  first language
""
""
But it is the learners language 
""
It is the learners language  you
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Now it is nothing but an  it is
""
develops  on his way to target language
""
""
On his way to  when going towards on his way to target language
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
 teaching the
""
""
""
""
of guiding them will depend upon  our knowledge of this interlanguage of
""
""
Now here  I don't say we fail
""
""
""
""
""
identify this interlanguage 
""
At what stage  the process of learning the second language
""
he knows the process 
""
He will be able to guide and he is the best teacher 
""
Uhm well in in my opinion  all the
""
the teacher one who knows his student well  one who knows his learners
well is the good teacher 
""
Then only you will be able to guide 
""
If 
""
""
""
learner reaches that stage of interlanguage  uhm is very interesting to
""
""
Well this  in a certain sequence in a
certain order  well you may call
""
developmental sequence 
""
Well this is psychological process  researcher
""
""
Well we we teacher  only by the results that
""
""
""
""
But this is not 
""
Now this is formed 
""
""
""
well uh 
""
One was on interrogative
