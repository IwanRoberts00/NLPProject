Kerala is the southern most part of India 
We are having many theatrical art forms and
performances as a part of our culture 
Among our classical theatrical arts 
Kathakali is the foremost one 
Perhaps we may be able to point out Chakyarkuta
 and Kudiyatam are the more
ancient forms of classical art forms Kathakali is
more popular 
We have got Krishnanatam which might have
 originated before Kathakali 
Actually the first term used for Kathakali 
 was Aatam 
And the first performance was based on the Ramayana theme 
 Ramanatam composed in seventeenth century
or later sixteenth century by Kottarakartampuran 
At that time this Ramanatam was not so
sophisticated and it was not perfect in any sense 
 Ramanatam is a story on drama 
based on Valmiki Ramayana divided into eight parts just as 
 Krishanatam is framed in eight days play
form 
 Krishanatam was popular in the south 
northern part of Kerala while Ramanatam was popular
 in the southern areas of the play uh land 
 Ramanatam though was spreading
slowly in throughout Kerala gradually another composer
 Kotesampuran who lived in seventeenth century composed
 four stories based on Mahabharata 
Nivathakavachakalakeyavatham Bhagavadham Karmiri Karmirivatham
 and Kalyanasaugandhikam 
Among these four plays Kalakeyavadham became very popular
 on the Kathakali stage 
 Kot Kotechidambaran 
composed these Aatakathas and uh they are very
popular of course but the major contribution to Kathakali stage 
by Kotechidambaran is that he has stabilized the wa 
method of presentation of this atam making much
improvements on Ramanatam technique 
So the system evolved by Kotechidambaran was popularly
known as Vettadda Sampradayam 
And from Kotechidambran Kathakali 
 became a sophisticated classical theatrical art of Kerala and
uh as far as the visual aspect of Kathakali no major attempt was
made to make a stabilisation in this art form 
But in the later years there were many other styles
just like Kannadikot Sampradayam Kapling art Sampradayam 
etcetera 
This Kapling art Sampradayam is the eighteenth century 
modification made by one Kapliknot Nambudri which the then
Maharaja of Travancore Shri Kartigeternol Dyamavarma 
Kartigeternol Dyamavarma composed not only 
atakathas but he made a uh technical book a
theatrical book a theoritical book Balaramabharatam that is also
 a very concrete evidence for the stabilisation of this art form 
As far as the technique of Kathakali is concerned it is a
combination of the three forms of abhinaya nrita 
nritya and natya 
And in Kathakali we find 
padarthabhinaya in dense quality 
As padarthabhinaya is there we find
 bhavatmaka character also 
Every word is being depicted on the stage by the actor 
according to the word and according to the bhava 
for the relevant context 
And we find natya aspects we find 
nritya aspect we find nrita aspect also 
There are four types of abhinayam aangika aahariya
 wachica and satvica 
This aahariya abhinaya abhinaya or action
based on the costumes is very relevent to Kathakali
 
The costumes are uh planned on the basis of 
satvaguna rajoguna and tamoguna 
There are different terms used for costumes pachha
 minikka katti tadi kari etcetera 
These are for various characters according to the story
And uh in the uh aangika abhinaya context
 we have to point out one very important aspect that is the
gestural language 
The hastamudras are employed in in a very
 profused manner based on either natyashastra 
 or hastalakshnadeepika or balarambharatam
 
Perhaps all these steps might have used by the uhm foremost
compositors and actors 
 Hastalakshnadeepika contain of course it is a
Kerala text on gestural language uh this hastilakshnadeepika
 gives a very good evidence for the aangika
abhinaya technique employed in Kathakali 
And all the actors see that they are basing on uh 
hastalakshanadeepika where the twenty-four 
hastamudras the samyuta mudra the 
asammita mudra etcetera are uh used and utilised for each
purpose 
For example pataka tripatakam mudra kadagamugham uh
shukatundam all these mudras are uh
employed in this gestural language 
Likewise the rasabhinaya the 
satyakabhinaya for that the navarasabhinaya is
very important for each and every character 
We take valour singara karuna uh shoka
 or uhm hasya all these rasas
 are being depicted in Kathakali 
but the presentation is on basis of bhavas 
 Padarthabhinayatpada and bhavatmaga
 is Kathakali 
So bhava is being conveyed through each and
every word of the composition 
The actor is presenting his action on the basis of this 
 pada 
 Pada is sung by or the wak
 wachikyabhinaya is performed by the
musicians 
The compositions are written in various ragas and
 talas restricted to the Kathakali style 
The that style of singing is often called as 
 often called or referred as sopan sangeeta 
 Sopana is a word used for a particular method
of singing songs especially the geetagovinda songs on the steps of
the shrine in every temple in Kerala 
So that is called sopana style 
This sopana style is being adopted in Kathakali
singing uh eventhough there are ragas common to Carnatic
music and sopana style of singing the method of singing
the rendering of singing is very different in sopana 
style 
Uh Kathakali composers uh adopting the
 sopana style and there is an evidence in the 
Kathakali that uhn they incorporated item 
manjutala 
It is also called as melappada 
This manjutala is a first portion of a 
pada in uh Geetagovinda manjutala kunjatala
kelisadane that portion is being sung at the beginning of
every performance of Kathakali 
And that denotes the adoption of Kathakali style from the
singing method of a ashtapadi or Geetagovinda in the
Kerala tradition 
So in the actor is performing his action on the basis
of the wachikabhinaya performed by the composer the
musician
The main musician is called Ponani the second musician is called
Sengadi 
Ponani and Sengadi with uh instrumental music cymbals
 chengala or eluttalam are being
used by the singers 
And on the basis of the wachikabhinaya the
actor acts on the principle of padarthabhinaya and
 bhavatmaga 
He has the freedom to uh present his uh quality and
efficiency in manodharmatam or ilagiyatam 
While in chuliyatam he actually imitates the
words through expression and uh conveying the meaning through the
gestural language just like pataka mudra kadagamughum 
shukatundam sarpashirsham uh mrigashirsham etcetera 
So the gestural language is very important in 
Kathakali as it is important in Kudiattam also 
But in Krishnanatam we don't find so much employment of
gestural language
There the dance technique is more important the nritya
 and nrita are important while in 
Kathakali natya nrita nritya are also uhm
equally important 
The another aspect of Kathakali we have to
point out that we are seeing imitative action we are seeing 
descriptive action we are finding symbolic action in 
Kathakali 
All these techniques are employed together in Kathakali
 
Kathakali actor will have to undergo a training
 a rigorous training for six or more years under an able guru
 to become a good actor 
Uh and for that in Kerala the gurukula
 system of coaching was pre prevalent 
 
Now it is almost faded and we are having certain institutions
like Kerala Kalamandalam instituted by poet laureate Wallatol 
Narayan Menon 
He is the chief personality who worked behind the
popularisation the modern popularisation of Kathakali
 in modern times 
The Kalamandalam Margi in Trivandrum and some other
institutions are also giving training in this particular art form as well
as it provides training in kodiattam mohiniyattam 
 uhn and other similar art forms of Kerala 
With regard to the literature of Kathakali we are having about
five hundred stories based on the Puranas 
 Ka Ramanatam of course is
based on Valmiki Ramayana and uh Kotechidambaran stories 
Unnai's Nalacharitam Iraimentam stories are based on Mahabharata
And similarly we are having many stories based on Ramayana
 Mahabharata and other Puranas 
Yet Dakshayagam is a very popular story connected with
 Shiva 
Lord Shiva is punishing his father-in-law Daksha 
And a quarrel between father-in-law and son-in-law takes
place in a very dramatic manner 
This theme is adopted by a poet composer of eighteenth
century Iraimantambi 
Iraimantambi was a musician a musicologist a 
Kathakali composer and uh a very good art connoisseur who lived
in the period of Shri Sadatinha Maharaja who was the 
doyen of Karnataka music as far as Kerala is concerned 
And uh Iraimantambi was a court musician court poet and
uh very popular figure in the cultural arena of Kerala of the ninteenth
century 
Before that we have got Unnai Wadiyar who composed
Naliyadadamaatakatha which is a four uhn days play uh based on
Mahabharata 
The Nala Damayanti katha is beautifully presented in the
Nalacharitam uh with musical skill with literary skill as well as
sufficient scope to action also 
After that we can point out only this personality Iraimantambi 
uh for his three plays Keechakavadham Uttaraswayavaram and Dakshayagam
 uh very popular stories on the Kathakali stage 
Beyond that we are having Ravana Vijayam by Tilimanur
Vidwangoitambran and uh Duryodhanavadham by Waikkarmusud uh
Tadagavadham by Weekasindambi who is the originator of the Kathakali club
system in Kerala uh who has uh written some Kathakali plays also uh
modified some techniques evolved some uh evolutions in the 
methods on the Kathakali stage 
Uh similarly we are having some later period composers also
For example one man who lives till now Mali Madhavanna has
composed a story on Karnashapatham that is also based on Mahabharata
Modern writers uh try to adopt foreign stories in Kathakali
stage 
For example Kerala Kalamandalam presented this year a story
on the basis of Shakespeare's King Lear 
Uhn it was appreciated by foreign audience but I don't know 
whether this will suit Kathakali stage fully well as the mythological
 themes of our traditional style and we can not think of
a a Shakespearean character with this pachha or 
other costumes on the Kathakali stage 
Another aspect we have to account with regard to
 Kathakali is the musical aspect of uh this
theatrical art 
We have got in Kerala three major instruments of music 
 idakya chanda and muyav 
 Idakya is used for sopan 
music or ashtapadi singing and uh muyav
 is for chakyarkut and kudiattam
 alone 
While chanda and maddalam 
are used in Kathalali 
 Idakya has got some relevance in 
Kathakali very rarely also 
And this chan chanda 
 and uh maddalam iluttalam and 
kaimani this combination of Kathakali in
 musical aspect is very important and just like aharyabhinava
 this musical instrument also gives a very good impression on the
whole art 
 Kathakali is a total theatre 
It is dramatic 
It is musical 
It is rhythmic 
There is dance technique there are there is natya technique
 there is nrita technique everthing is combined in there 
And the total story is being present 
Another aspect of the story is in kudiattam
 and kuttu we find vidushaka 
character 
But there is no vidushaka or comic character
in Kathakali 
We are having dhirodatta dhirodhadata dhiralalita
 and dhirashanta characters 
These characters are ba coming from our Puranas and
 uh Epics 
So uh this type of nayaka characters uh
 heroines like Damayanti or Uttara or Draupadi uh
women characters they also uh participate in the action
But the women characters uh are represented by men only 
Major actors are men 
They take the role of uh female characters 
That is a peculiar uh aspect of Kathakali
There are very few ladies who participate in
 Kathakali 
And there is a troupe also ladies troupe also 
But that is not so popular 
Mainly the main men take female role also 
because uh Kathakali requires very rigorous
training in uh aangikabhinaya aspect 
Uh female dancers or actors do not undergo such severe
training 
Men only can face that uh annual training physical
training 
So kathakali is a performance
 mainly acted by men and this is very popular 
This is almost a temple art but it has come out of the
temple walls and it is presented for social functions cultural
functions and other uhn celebrations also 
Every temple festival will have a Kathakali performance 
one or two or three or any number 
Similarly uh this costume makers the 
productions everything of Katha every aspect of 
Kathakali has become a predominant uh factor of our 
 K Kerala culture 
Just like we had Krishnatam troupes in ancient times we
are having Kathakali troupes in modern times also 
Uh it is almost a non-secular performance now 
And we are having Kathakali pada kacharis 
now 
We are having individual presentations like putanamorcha
 or some other story 
Individual characters are being presented
Now we have got a youth festival stage in Kerala school
youth festival and college youth festival 
There also uh there is much competition is going on
between youngsters to present Kathakali in a
beautiful way 
So Kathakali is getting its
popularity day by day and Wallatol has contributed much for our 
uh present popularity of Kathakali 
This classical theatre is uh progressing even though
we have lost so many uh distinguished actors 
The style of acting and the presentation of the art the
standard of art is maintained almost in a very uh attractive 
method 
Thank you
