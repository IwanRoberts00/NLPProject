""
""
Kerala 
""
We are having  and
performances 
""
Among 
Kathakali 
""
Perhaps  Chakyarkuta
 more
ancient forms of classical art forms  is
more popular 
""
We have got  which might have
""
""
Actually 
""
""
And the first performance was based on 
 seventeenth century
or later sixteenth century 
""
At that time  was not so
sophisticated 
""
""
based on Valmiki Ramayana 
 days play
form 
""
""
northern part of Kerala  was popular
""
""
 spreading
slowly  another composer
 composed
""
Nivathakavachakalakeyavatham  Karmirivatham
""
""
Among these four plays  became very popular
""
""
""
composed these  very
popular 
by Kotechidambaran 
method of presentation of this  making much
improvements 
""
So  was popularly
known as 
""
And 
 and
uh  no major attempt was
made 
""
But  many other styles
just like 
etcetera 
""
This Kapling art Sampradayam 
modification  which the then
Maharaja of Travancore 
""
Kartigeternol Dyamavarma 
atakathas  a
theatrical book  that is also
""
""
As far as the technique of Kathakali is concerned  it is a
combination 
nritya 
""
And in 
padarthabhinaya 
""
As  we find
""
""
Every word is being depicted on the stage by the actor 
according to the word 
for the relevant 
""
And 
nritya 
""
There are four types of  aahariya
""
""
This  or action
based on the costumes  Kathakali
""
""
The 
satvaguna 
""
There are  pachha
""
""
These are  according to the story
""
""
And uh  context
 that is the
gestural language 
""
The  in a very
""
 balarambharatam
""
""
Perhaps all these steps might have used by  uhm foremost
compositors and 
""
 of course it is a
Kerala text on  hastilakshnadeepika
 aangika
abhinaya 
""
""
And all the actors see that they are basing on 
hastalakshanadeepika 
hastamudras 
asammita mudra  and utilised for each
purpose 
""
For example  uh
shukatundam  uh
employed 
""
Likewise 
satyakabhinaya  is
very important 
""
We  uh shoka
 rasas
""
but the presentation is 
""
 bhavatmaga
""
""
So  is being conveyed through each and
every word of the composition 
""
The actor is presenting 
""
""
 wak
 is performed by the
musicians 
""
The compositions are written in various  and
""
""
The 
""
""
""
 a particular method
of singing  on the steps of
the shrine 
""
So that is called 
""
This  style is being adopted in Kathakali
singing  common to Carnatic
music and  the method of singing
the rendering of singing 
style 
""
Uh  uh adopting the
""
Kathakali 
manjutala 
""
It is also called as 
""
This 
pada  manjutala kunjatala
kelisadane  sung at the beginning of
every performance of 
""
And that denotes the adoption  from the
singing method of a  or Geetagovinda in the
Kerala tradition 
""
So  the actor is performing his action on the basis
of  performed by the composer the
musician
""
The main musician is called Ponani the second musician is called
Sengadi 
""
Ponani and Sengadi with uh  cymbals
 are being
used by the singers 
""
And on the basis of the  the
actor  and
""
""
He has the freedom to  quality and
efficiency in 
""
While  he actually imitates the
words through expression and uh  conveying the meaning through the
gestural language 
shukatundam 
""
So 
Kathakali 
""
But in Krishnanatam we don't find  so much employment of
gestural language
""
There the dance technique is more important  nritya
""
Kathakali  uhm
equally important 
""
The another aspect of  we have to
point out that we are seeing imitative action 
descriptive action 
Kathakali 
""
All these techniques are employed together in  Kathakali
""
""
Kathakali  a training
 guru
""
""
Uh  gurukula
""
""
""
Now it is almost faded  and we are having certain institutions
like Kerala Kalamandalam 
Narayan Menon 
""
He is the  the
popularisation  Kathakali
""
""
The Kalamandalam  and some other
institutions are also giving  training in this particular art form as well
as it provides 
""
""
With regard to the literature of Kathakali  we are having about
five hundred stories based on 
""
 is
based on 
Unnai's  are based on Mahabharata
""
""
And similarly we are having  based on Ramayana
""
""
Yet Dakshayagam is a very  connected with
""
""
Lord Shiva 
""
And a quarrel between  takes
place 
""
This  a poet composer of eighteenth
century 
""
Iraimantambi was 
Kathakali composer  who lived
in the period of 
doyen of Karnataka music as far as Kerala is concerned 
""
And uh  and
uh  very popular figure in the cultural arena of Kerala of the ninteenth
century 
""
Before that we have got  Unnai Wadiyar who composed
Naliyadadamaatakatha which is a four  uh based on
Mahabharata 
""
The Nala Damayanti katha  is beautifully presented in the
Nalacharitam  as well as
sufficient scope to 
""
After that we can point out only this personality Iraimantambi 
uh for his three plays Keechakavadham  Uttaraswayavaram and Dakshayagam
""
""
Beyond that  we are having Ravana Vijayam by Tilimanur
Vidwangoitambran  uh
Tadagavadham by Weekasindambi who is the originator of the Kathakali club
system in Kerala  uh
modified some techniques 
methods on the Kathakali stage 
""
Uh similarly  we are having some later period composers also
""
""
For example one  Mali Madhavanna has
composed a story on Karnashapatham  Mahabharata
""
""
Modern writers  in Kathakali
stage 
""
For example Kerala Kalamandalam  a story
on the basis of 
""
Uhn it was appreciated by 
whether  stage fully well as the mythological
 think of
a 
other costumes 
""
Another  with regard to
 this
theatrical art 
""
We have got 
""
""
""
music  muyav
 kudiattam
""
""
While 
are used in Kathalali 
""
""
Kathakali 
""
And this 
""
kaimani  in
 aharyabhinava
 a very good impression on the
whole art 
""
""
""
It is dramatic 
""
It is musical 
""
It is rhythmic 
""
There is dance  there is natya technique
""
""
And the total story is being present 
""
Another  kudiattam
""
character 
""
But there is no  or comic character
in 
""
We are having  dhiralalita
""
""
These characters are  our Puranas and
""
""
So  uh
 uh
women characters they also  uh participate in the action
""
But the women characters 
""
Major actors are men 
""
They take the role of uh 
""
That is a peculiar  Kathakali
""
""
There are very few  participate in
""
""
And there is a troupe also 
""
But that is not so popular 
""
Mainly 
because uh  very rigorous
training in 
""
Uh female  undergo such severe
training 
""
Men only can face that uh  physical
training 
""
So  a performance
""
""
This is  but it has come out of the
temple walls  cultural
functions 
""
Every temple festival 
one or two or three or 
""
Similarly 
productions 
Kathakali 
""
""
Just like  we
are having 
""
Uh it is 
""
And we are having 
now 
""
We are having individual presentations like  putanamorcha
""
""
Individual characters are being presented
""
Now we have got a  school
youth festival and college youth festival 
""
There also  much competition is going on
between youngsters to present  in a
beautiful way 
""
So  its
popularity 
uh present popularity of 
""
This classical theatre  even though
we have lost so many 
""
The style of acting and the presentation of the art  the
standard of art is maintained almost 
method 
""
Thank you
