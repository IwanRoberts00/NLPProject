My dear ladies and gentleman 
""

andbeyond 
""
In fact uh  the
""
""
I am going to speakonly on 
""
""
""
""
There was a time  from
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
But  an
""
""
What is more  intelligentia of the world language
""
""
Now  as its
""
""
""
""
""
""

In the rest of the world  in various other

""
""

""
""
to do with two

One  among otherminor
European powers  and stabilized
""
""
""
And secondly  The independence from the British colonies from
the 
""
""
nineteen ninety-seven 
""
""
with theproblem of national language 
""
""
""
The transition  as many factors were
""
speech communities  or
""
""
The case of India is a very special one 
""
""
""
""

Secondly  de
""
""
""
""

time of independence

""
Constitution 
""
""
Associate Official Language for 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

""
""
""

Perhaps  that is the
 the position of Hindi seems to have
""
official language 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
It might be useful to remember at the backof our mind  the
""

""
""
""
speakers  or even if they
""
""

It is in this context that  The Three Language formula
""

It was subsequently modified in the  Kothari Commission Report
""

with regard to the study of language between Hindi and non-Hindi 
""

It recommended that  Hindi
