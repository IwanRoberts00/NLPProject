<I>
My dear ladies and gentleman 
I would like to speak on the relevance of English education 
andbeyond 
In fact uh I am not going to deal with the
beyond 
I am going to speakonly on The relevance of 
English education 
Uh let me start with the background
There was a time when The sun did not set from
the British Empire 
That is the Empire spread almost all over the world 
Along with the Empire the English language also spread all over the
world 
Now the sun almost does not arise on the British Empire 
But the English language has now become an
international language known all over the world 
What is more it is the intelligentia of the world language
Now less than half of the globe speaks English as its
native speaker native language 
They are the inhabitants of Great Britain U.S.A. Canada
 Australia New Zealand the Caribbean and South Africa 
And this accounts for three hundred million speakers 
In the rest of the world Englishis used in various other
parts either as foreign language or a second language including
in the U.S.S. R.
However restricted in its way 
Roughly there are three major speech communities 
spoken all over the world 
First The native speakers second 
 Second language speakers and third 
Foreign languagespeakers 
The predominant position of English in the world had something
to do with two factors 
One is the colonisation of British Empire among otherminor
European powers towards the end of nineteenth century and stabilized
in the year twentieth century until the outbreak of 
south wo Second World War
And secondly The independence from the British colonies from
the end of Second World War which has been on 
The latest as you know is Hong Kong which will be free in
nineteen ninety-seven 
After independence the new countries were confronted
with theproblem of national language and or official language 
A few African and Asian countries opted for English
The transition was not very easy as many factors were
involved particularly the size of the country and the size of the
speech communities whether they are mon mono-lingual or
multi-lingual communities 
The case of India is a very special one 
One thing that happened to India after independence was that 
the number of Princely States thanks to Sardar Patel were 
integrated into the erstwhile British Provinces 
Secondly we have already by this time a de
facto lingua franca in fact two
 lingua francas if you like English and Hindi
Now the position of English in India is that at the
time of independence English was the de facto
official language but soon after that we decided to accept Hindi as
our national language as en enshrined in the Indian
Constitution 
Along with Hindi we decided to continue with English as an
Associate Official Language for fifteen years from the 
commencement of the Indian Constitution in nineteen fifty up to
nineteen sixty-five 
In the meantime wedecided to cultivate and develop Hindi to
take over from English in the hope that it would be relegated to
the position of foreign language that is for restrictive
functions 
And Hindi would take over fully not only as a national language
 but also as the official language and as the lingua
franca of the pan-Indian language 
However during the period of fifteenyears something seems
to have gone wrong 
Perhaps because of one of the uh factors that is the
 creation of Linguistic States the position of Hindi seems to have
suffered a setback and we had to continue English as an associate
official language indefinitely 
So at the moment our national language is Hindi our+
official language is English and our lingua franca
 link language seems to be divided
 broadly speaking English and Hindi 
These link languages cut across the two regions north and south
 on the one hand and the two sections of society all over the country
English as second language in India 
It might be useful to remember at the backof our mind the
concept of Second Language before we go on 
 Second language by definition fulfills 
four important functions namely instrumental regulative
 interpersonal and imaginative 
In India the main instrumental and regulative functions are
 fulfilled by education and administration respectively 
The interpersonal function is fulfilled by one of the link
languages that is English 
It is in fact a linklanguage between the regional language 
speakers especiallythose who do not understand Hindi or even if they
 knowHindi will prefer it to English 
Finally the imaginative function is fulfilled by a large body of
 well established literature namely Indian writing in
English next only to native English literatures such as
British American Australian Canadian and other literatures
 The ups and downs in the position of English 
We can discern two phase phases in post independent
era of English inIndia 
The first up to nineteen sixty-five and the second after that
Even before independence the medium of instruction at regional
language at the secondary schools and English as second languages
 was taught in all such schools 
There were of course certain English medium schools also
And the medium of instruction was uh English throughout
post-school level
As early as nineteen forty nine The University
Education Commission recommended a gradual change over of 
mediu medium of instruction+ from English to Indian languages
 at the higher stage at the also 
The three languages regional federal presumably Hindi
 and English are to be studied at seco at higher
secondary and university stages 
In the year nineteen fifty-one fifty-two The
Secondary Education Commission recommended that the study of
English should be given importance in secondary schools and
facilities shouldbe made available at the middle school stage for
its study on an optional basis 
Thus English was taught as a main second language at
the school system in all the stages and in all the States
It was taughtfor anything between four to seven years 
partly or wholly as a compulsory subject 
The report of the Official Language Commission nineteen
fifty-six made a clear cut distinction between lan
 English language and English literature 
Hitherto English literature was taught even with
 at the school stage but now the regional
languages had already become the medium of instruction throughout the
secondary schools and gradually it was being used as a medium of
 certain faculties even at the university stage 
Under the circumstances the position of English has undergone a
great change 
Inthe words of the report uh I quote 
English has to be taught hereafter as a language of comprehension
rather than as a literary language unquote 
After the creation of the Linguistic States we witnessed one of
the most controversial issue issues in Indian
Education that is the place of English in our educational set up 
From angrezi hatao 
Downwith English at one extreme to English as the
sole medium of education at the other 
were widespread unrest and riots all over the country
It is in this context that The Three Language formula
 was proposed 
It was subsequently modified in the Kothari Commission Report
 nineteen sixty-four sixty-six 
 The three language formula sought I quote
 to establish equally equality 
with regard to the study of language between Hindi and non-Hindi 
speaker speaking areas 
It recommended that as against the third language Hindi
 along uh another lan another Indian
language besides Hindi and English should be studied by
 pupils in Hindi speaking area unquote 
This almost amounts to punishment 
There was no motivation whatsoever for the Hindi speaking pupil
 to learn another modern Indian language modern 
English Indian language 
Thus The three language formula seems to
have failed 
In the meantime the role of English has undergone change
As we have mentioned earlier instead of English literature 
we have sought to cultivate English language 
Pioneering work has been undertaken by the Central Institute of
English C.I.E. Hyderabad created in nineteen fifty-eight 
English began to be considered as second language and the
appropriate methods of teaching English were proposed
In course of time several other institutions like the Regional
Institute of English R.I.E. State Institute of English S.I.E and
so on spread 
And on the whole the overall educational facilities had tremendously
increased
Not only in school level but also at the college and university
levels 
The latest All India Education Commission Kothari
Commission Report has advocated the study of English 
on an optional basis at the primary level that is from fifth
to seventh and on secondary basis at the secondary level that is
 eight to ten and again optional basis higher secondary
level that is uhm eleven to twelve in its scheme of seven
 uh twelve year school and three year degree course for the
entire country that is ten plus two plus three 
And the position of English has been prescribed sorry 
described as a library language 
Today English is English in India is an
important if not compulsory secondary language at all stages of
education 
Now let me uhm look at The National
Policy of Education and Plan Action 
Two decades of intense planning and implementation of mass
education that is quantitative improve improve 
improvement the government of India hasnow turned to the qualitative
improvement of uhimprovement of educational facilities 
In the year nineteen eighty-six the national policy of education
and plan of action popularly known as NPE 
and POA modified in nineteen ninety-two were
launched 
It then reviewed the National Policy from nineteen sixty-eight to
nineteen eighty-six and noted that there have been slow progress
in the implementation of these recommendations and emphasised the need
for a dynamic approach 
As far as the development of language is concerned the medium of
instruction at the university stage has been unsatisfactory on
account of two factors ( a) the preparation and production of these text
books has not synchronised with the universities decision to switch
over to modern English modern Indian 
languages 
And ( b) secondly second uhm uhm university teacher 
having received education through English find it difficult to teach
through their English language in Indian languages 
More importantly the universities are reluctant to change their
medium ofinstruction in regard to Indian languages because the lack
of employment opportunities to those who have studied in those languages 
There is no special mention of medium of instruction in the chapter
on higher education in this document 
However the development of English language trained 
 uh training institution is encouraged 
+ centres have been set up for imparting training to
English language teacher at school stage and have trained
one point five lakh of English teachers 
Now among other things the NPE suggests the
delinking of degree requirement for employment wherever feasible
One of themost important measures taken in respect of 
qualitative improvement of the Engl education was the creation of
 institutes institutions of excellence uh 
Navodaya Vidyalaya 
Since nineteen eighty-six Navodaya 
Vidya Vidyanagar Vid Vidyalayas were set up in two
hundred and eighty districts spread over twenty-nine States and
Union Territories of Territories for children who are
potentially high achiever 
 Acharya Rammurthi CommissionReport notes 
that in the name of qualitative improvement of education the
National Policy of Educationand Programme of Action have been
criticised for the reclu uh exclusion of the poor 
from the educational process and he decries elitism 
The relevance of English education 
We have now to ask a question how relevant English
education is in our country ? 
 I've been asked to make a statement not only about the
relevance of English education butalso beyond it 
But first let me make certain statements of the
first part How relevant English education is ?
You will find from the fifth uh fifth All India
Education Survey of the NCERT nineteen ninety-two compiled
in nineteen eighty-six that is ten years ago there were two major
language medium uh medium schools all over the country 
One Hindi medium Hindi medium schools
 and two English medium schools 
Apart from these there were several Indian language medium
schools particularly mother tongue languages language
schools which were minor ones 
All put together there were six point four lakh
 of schools in the country at all levels primary upper
primary and secondary 
Out of these the majority of English medium schools account for
two point four four lakhs of schools followed by
 uhm zero point nine nine lakh that is less than one
 lakh of Hindi medium schools 
That is to say that all the media of instructions in the whole
of India there were six point four lakh of schools 
outof which English medium schools account for four two point
four four lakhs 
That is more than one third of all the schools in the entire
country 
What is more interesting is that the English medium
schoolswere much more both in the urban and the ural uh the
rural sections 
In the rural areas there were seventy-five thousand Hindi
medium schools as against two lakh of English medium
schools that is two and a half time 
Similarly in the urban sector there were only twenty-four
thousand Hindi medium schools as against uh forty-nine thousand English
medium schools that is as much as double the number 
In that there were more number of English medium schools in
rural areas than in urban ones 
These statistics perve pertaining 
 to the prevailing year nineteen eighty-six 
Today in the year nineteen ninety-six what that is 
ten year after that what is the real situation ? 
We do not know the statistics now but we can project
it on an impressional uh impressionistic basis for example
 a small town my own place Kolhapur
