My dear ladies and gentleman 
""
I would like to speak on the relevance of 
andbeyond 
""
In fact uh  the
beyond 
""
I am going to speakonly on 
English education 
""
Uh let me start with the 
""
There was a time  from
the British Empire 
""
That is 
""
Along with the Empire the English language also spread all over the
world 
""
Now the sun almost 
""
But  an
international language 
""
What is more  intelligentia of the world language
""
""
Now  as its
native speaker 
""
They are the inhabitants of  Canada
""
""
And this accounts for 
""
In the rest of the world  in various other
parts  including
in the U.S.S. 
""
However restricted in its 
""
Roughly 
spoken 
""
First 
""
Foreign languagespeakers 
""
The predominant position of English in the world  had something
to do with two 
""
One  among otherminor
European powers  and stabilized
in the 
south 
""
And secondly  The independence from the British colonies from
the 
""
The latest as you know is Hong Kong  which will be free in
nineteen ninety-seven 
""
After independence  confronted
with theproblem of national language 
""
A few African 
""
The transition  as many factors were
involved  size of the
speech communities  or
multi-lingual 
""
The case of India is a very special one 
""
One thing that happened to India after independence was that 
the number of 
integrated into the erstwhile British Provinces 
""
Secondly  de
facto  two
 and Hindi
""
""
Now the position of English in India  at the
time of independence 
official language  after that we decided to accept Hindi as
our national language  Indian
Constitution 
""
Along with Hindi  we decided to continue with English as an
Associate Official Language for 
commencement of the Indian Constitution  up to
nineteen sixty-five 
""
In the meantime  to
take over from English relegated to
the position of foreign language  for restrictive
functions 
""
And Hindi would take over fully  not only as a national language
 lingua
franca 
""
However  something seems
to have gone wrong 
""
Perhaps  that is the
 the position of Hindi seems to have
suffered a setback  as an associate
official language 
""
So  our+
official  lingua franca
 seems to be divided
""
""
These link languages cut across the two regions  north and south
 and the two sections of society all over the country
""
""
English as second language in India 
""
It might be useful to remember at the backof our mind  the
concept of 
""
""
four important functions  regulative
""
""
In India  the main instrumental and regulative functions are
""
""
The interpersonal function is fulfilled by  one of the link
languages that is English 
""
It is in fact a linklanguage between the regional language 
speakers  or even if they
""
""
Finally the imaginative function is fulfilled by a large body of
 Indian writing in
English  such as
British  and other literatures
""
""
""
""
""
We can discern  in post independent
era of English inIndia 
""
The first up to nineteen sixty-five  and the second after that
""
""
Even before independence the medium of instruction at  regional
language at the secondary schools and  languages
""
""
There were of course  English medium schools also
""
""
And the medium of instruction was uh  English throughout
post-school level
""
As early as nineteen forty  The University
Education Commission 
mediu  Indian languages
""
""
The three languages  presumably Hindi
 at higher
secondary and 
""
In the year nineteen fifty-one fifty-two  The
Secondary Education Commission recommended that the study of
English  and
facilities  for
its study on an optional basis

Thus  at
the  States

""
It was taughtfor 
partly or wholly as a compulsory subject

The report of the  Official Language Commission nineteen
fifty-six  lan

Hitherto with
 the regional
languages had  already become the medium of instruction throughout the
secondary schools  used as a medium of

""
Under the circumstances  the position of English has undergone a
great change 
""
Inthe words of the report 
English has to be taught 
rather than 
""
After the creation of the Linguistic States  we witnessed one of
the most controversial  in Indian
Education 
""
From
Downwith English  English as the
sole medium of education 
""
were widespread  and riots all over the country
""
""
It is in this context that  The Three Language formula
""
""
It was subsequently modified in the  Kothari Commission Report
""
""
 I quote
""
with regard to the study of language between Hindi and non-Hindi 
speaker 
""
It recommended that  Hindi
 another Indian
language  should be studied by
""
""
This almost amounts to 
""
There was no motivation whatsoever for the Hindi speaking  pupil
""
English 
""
Thus  seems to
have failed 
""
In the meantime  has undergone change
""
""
As we have mentioned earlier 
we have sought to cultivate 
""
Pioneering work has been undertaken by the Central Institute of
English C.I.E. Hyderabad 
""
English began to be  and the
appropriate methods of teaching English were 
""
In course of time  several other institutions like the Regional
Institute of English  and
so on 
""
And on the whole the overall educational facilities had tremendously
increased
""
Not only in school level  but also at the college and university
levels

The latest  All India Education Commission Kothari
Commission Report

to seventh  that is

entire country

And the position of English has been 
described

Today  is an
important  at all stages of
education

Now let me  The National
Policy of Education

Two decades of intense planning and  implementation of mass
education 
improvement  qualitative

In the year nineteen eighty-six  the national policy of education
and plan of action

launched

It then reviewed the National Policy from nineteen sixty-eight to
nineteen eighty-six  slow progress
in the implementation of these recommendations  and emphasised the need
for a

As far as the development of language is concerned  the medium of
instruction at the  unsatisfactory on
account of two factors  ( a) the preparation and production of these text
books synchronised with the universities decision to switch
over

And ( b) 
having received education through English  find it difficult to teach
through their

More importantly  the universities are reluctant to change their
medium ofinstruction in regard to  the lack
of employment opportunities to those who have studied in those languages

There is no special mention of medium of instruction in the chapter
on higher education in this document

However

One of themost important measures taken in respect of

National Policy of Educationand Programme of  have been
criticised for the

""
The relevance of English education 
""
We have now to ask a question  English
education is 
""
 been asked to make a statement not only about the
relevance of 
""
But  make certain statements of the
first part  ?
""
""
You will find from the  All India
Education Survey  compiled
in there were two major
language 
""
One  Hindi medium schools
""
""
Apart from these there were several Indian language medium
schools  language
schools 
""
All put together  lakh
 upper
primary
""
Out of these  the majority of English medium schools account for
two point four four  followed by
 less than one
""
""
That is to say  that all the media of instructions in the whole
of India 
outof which  two point
four four 
""
That is more than one third of all the schools in the entire
country 
""
What is more interesting is that  the English medium
schoolswere much more  uh the
rural 
""
In the rural areas  there were seventy-five thousand Hindi
medium schools  of English medium
schools that is 
""
Similarly in the urban sector  twenty-four
thousand Hindi medium schools as against uh  forty-nine thousand English
medium schools 
""
In that  there were more number of English medium schools in
rural areas 
""
These statistics 
""
""
Today in the year nineteen ninety-six 
ten year after that

We do not know the  we can project
it  uh impressionistic basis for example
