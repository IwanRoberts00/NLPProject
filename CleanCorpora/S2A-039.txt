 uh another very
important  Margaret Atwood and
Robinson they each together 
""
Nationalist in the sense  raised their voice
""
""
The situation is something like this  on the one
hand there is the imperial  from which they have not been
able to see the 
""
So the Britain  the conventional
 America on
the other side  which is as
well 
""
If they don't  if they don't release
them 
then this is a very difficult situation 
""
Resisting a neighbour is more difficult than resisting somebody 
at a distance  into
contact daily  with whom you have to
workout a relatioship in which  and wanted
or unwanted help 
""
You can't escape the influence of neighbour 
""
And the neighbour is another evil  as
we have seen at the very outset that there was a clash of interest and ideas
at the beginning which  brought out uh two nation of Canada and America
""
""
So America 
""
And there is another type of relationship with Britain 
parental relationship 
what has Canada to do 
""
Where is the choice  ?
""
Either you say  or
you say good bye to your neighbour  to be
doubly 
""
Both of them are exploitative 
""
This is the worry 
""
And Margaret Atwood 
against  Women's
 some decades
back 
""
We saw to liberate  Margaret Atwood says
 it is not possible
""
""
The books  which
are which have made her prominent 
Women  both the books
 and
of them 
""
The west  is
 the women doesn't know what
exactly she should do 
""
So she is advised to  Good bye to all the
conventions  the institution
of marriage 
""
Again 
characters in the 
""
Clara is a married person 
""
Joe  is always impregnating her
""
""
And who nurses  ?
""
The mother only  care
is taken by father 
""
His  Atwood is
problem of 
""
What will the child  ?
""
Who is the father  ?
""
The child will more likely answer 
who cooks 
""
Who is the mother  ?
""
A person who sits  writes is the
mother 
""
There is a clash 
""
There is the projection of the clash 
""
The value system 
""
And our 
""
She says  that a
""
""
""
That is the question of  but that does not
necessarily mean 
marriage is a social institution 
""
It does not necessarily mean  for someone to produce children
""
""
You can have the children even outside the wedlock 
""
So you chose your man 
""
You know  good bye to
the man 
""
The child will also mean  my
fulfillness in my lap  that
can be one solution 
""
The problem will be 
how do you know  there is a real problem
""
""
If you are  and if you are a woman
 then
you should actually prefer 
""
This is what the logic is 
""
But no mother  a child
inside the womb as  the child
as he 
""
What is this he  ?
""
Why always he  even though you are claiming or shouting from the
rooftop that you are liberated woman that you are no longer a slave of man
""
""
The same problem  you
have become over traditional in mental theory of the covention  which
accords greater status higher status to man 
""
So  you are still
thinking of your child about whom you don't know  as a he
""
It means you are still pining for a male child 
""
This is a thought this is a very embarassing  for all
""
""
So our uh uh puts up this question  to which there is no answer
except that 
is a co-institution 
""
It solves many problems  of the
feminist 
""
And thereby she seems to reject 
liberation  that has come from Europe
""
The 
""
In such a theme  a terrible mistake
""
""
There seems to be an American  she
finds that Americans are  Americans are there looking for
""
""
So if they are  the American is
always interested  in finding out whether there is a good amount of fish
""
""
In the forest 
Margaret Atwood finds  over which
the Americans C I A agents have an eye and they want to have 
""
Such properties  in order to
espionage 
""
So 
who has very much identified herself  with the problems and establishments
of her country 
""
She has identified  but she has not been able to find an answer
 to the complex
problems of  uh compulsion
 which has created a very ordinary event situation
""
 incidentally is the hallmark of
women creative writing 
""
And  seem
to know what exactly they should do 
""
So this type of situation  or marked the
writing of 
""
Uh however there is an exception 
""
That too is a little  because we have so
far discussed 
""
Let us go to the French 
""
And I have selected and talk 
""
 a very prominent
French 
""
Premjeet Roy 
the  will nest
""
""
This is 
uninhabited 
""
And there is only one family 
crossing various streams and waters you reach a place  where there is only
one family 
""
And that family is a French speaking catholic 
""
And this 
""
She has eight children 
""
She is an educated woman 
""
She occasionaly visits 
""
Uh let me introduce you to which we can call  centres of
civilization 
""
She keeps in touch with the  modern world in order to know that
 that are
happening 
""
Must be known to these people and they must not be deprived of the
 ?
""
Is it because of me  ?
""
Uh uh I hope 
laughter 
""
Can we do something about it 
""
So she occasionally  uh it doesn't work uh
""
""
So she goes 
""
She has a problem  of her children
""
She is living  forest area
""
""
And she is very much worried about the education of her children
because  in order to
""
""
She has five 
""
At present she has five  to be
admitted or enrolled 
""
But she nevertheless  and they
mercifully appoint 
""
The first teacher 
""
The moment she comes  mixes with the
family  teaches very
meticulously 
""
She is very punctual 
""
She wants  without wasting a moment
""
""
So one year passes 
""
The education of these children for one year has taken place 
""
There is a transfer 
""
The next 
""
And the moment she comes  fault with everything
that exist there 
""
She starts complaining oh  what a stretch I have had to travel
 in
a 
""
I feel very much 
""
And what are these people 
""
They have not provided 
""
The food also is not 
""
The children are also very dirty
""
They don't have good habits 
""
She starts complaining 
""
She complains and complains 
""
But she stays on 
""
And  as she did in the
case of the earlier teacher 
""
She was a French 
""
She does not give any chance 
""
But this woman by nature is fussy 
""
She is also transfered 
""
And when she is transfered she realises oh 
not so bad after all 
""
I could have  stayed on
""
Why have they transfered 
""
The two types of attitude at the beginning and at the end 
""
And Lousina does not feel  that she should complain
against the teacher because she finds  of an
English speaking  teacher being made available to her children because
otherwise 
particularly in the context  of the modern world in which English has
become a lingua franca 
""
If 
education or instruction only in French  lose the
advantages of  spread of
kmowledge 
""
So she  that
""
she feels thankful to the  arrival of these two teachers
""
However 
""
He is a French 
""
When he comes  he doesn't take any interest in teaching
children
""
He says  don't
worry
""
Let me go to the nature  let me enjoy I feel very happy
""
""
""
And he would retire to the jungle 
and sleep there 
""
And he says 
see 
""
He enjoys 
""
He starts calling her mama 
mother 
""
And  always demands
this and that does not feel shy 
""
And then he also receives 
""
He does not disclose it 
""
But all of a sudden there is a change in his attitude 
""
He becomes very serious 
""
And they realise that this man has a wonderful store of knowledge
""
""
He teaches them wonderful things very advanced things 
""
And before he goes  what he calls his course
""
""
So there is no complaint 
""
Lousina loves to have this man 
""
She says  ?
""
""
that your 
""
The man says  thank you for all the hospitality and
the care you took of me 
""
But 
""
And  going to a place where I would like to make my
career 
""
This is not the place 
""
So even though I love the place 
I will not tie my career 
""
We will leave the narrative here and discuss the merits 
because 
""
Now what happens is this 
""
As I already said at the  that there are
""
""
There is a talk of separation 
""
But here is a message  who
seems to be advocating  and not
encouraging the separation or division in society in the polity 
""
 that English
""
hate 
""
They hate everything that is English 
""
They would not  if you talk
to them in English 
""
That is not acknowledged 
""
So this type of hatred should cease 
learning 
""
And she seems to feel it 
in the society only if we didn't talk of the differences 
""
At a party she invites  all the types of
people available there
