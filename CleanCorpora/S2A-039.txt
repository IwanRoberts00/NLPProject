You can't escape the influence of neighbour

what has Canada to do

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
And Margaret Atwood

 some decades
""
""
We saw to liberate  Margaret Atwood says
""
""
""
The books  which

Women  both the books

exactly she should do

So she is advised to  Good bye to all the

The problem will be

This is what the logic is

But no mother  a child

It solves many problems  of the
""

And thereby she seems to reject 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
finds that Americans are  Americans are there looking for

""
""
""
""
""
In the forest 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
of her country 
""
""
 to the complex
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
So this type of situation  or marked the
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
 a very prominent
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
uninhabited 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
And this 
""
She has eight children 
""
""
""
""
""
""
civilization 
""
She keeps in touch with the  modern world in order to know that
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
laughter 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
And she is very much worried about the education of her children
""
""
""
""
""
""
admitted or enrolled 
""
""
mercifully appoint 
""
The first teacher 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
She wants  without wasting a moment
""
""
So one year passes 
""
The education of these children for one year has taken place 
""
There is a transfer 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
The food also is not 
""
""
""
They don't have good habits 
""
""
""
She complains and complains 
""
""
""
""
case of the earlier teacher 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
not so bad after all 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
particularly in the context  of the modern world in which English has
""
""
""
education or instruction only in French  lose the
""
""
""
""
""
she feels thankful to the  arrival of these two teachers
""
""
""
He is a French 
""
When he comes  he doesn't take any interest in teaching
""
""
""
worry
""
Let me go to the nature  let me enjoy I feel very happy
""
""
""
And he would retire to the jungle 
and sleep there 
""
And he says 
see 
""
""
""
""
mother 
""
""
this and that does not feel shy 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
He becomes very serious 
""
""
""
""
He teaches them wonderful things very advanced things 
""
And before he goes  what he calls his course
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
As I already said at the  that there are
""
""
There is a talk of separation 
""
""
""
encouraging the separation or division in society in the polity 
""
""
""
""
""
They hate everything that is English 
""
They would not  if you talk
to them in English 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
in the society only if we didn't talk of the differences 
""
""
people available there
