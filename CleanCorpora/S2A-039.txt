<I>
 I've also wanted to enlist you uh another very
important writer Margaret Atwood Margaret Atwood and
Robinson they each together are very much nationalists 
Nationalist in the sense that they have raised their voice
 against the imperialistic dominition of their country 
The situation is something like this cough on the one
hand there is the imperial Britain from which they have not been
able to see the a few words 
So the Britain is the exploiting power the conventional
 relationship with Britain on the one hand and America on
the other side because across the border is America which is as
well capitalistic exploitative society 
If they don't uh bow or if they don't release
them or if they resist the influence of the neighbour 
then this is a very difficult situation 
Resisting a neighbour is more difficult than resisting somebody 
at a distance because you can't you have to come into
contact daily contact with the neighbour with whom you have to
workout a relatioship in which there will be co-operation and wanted
or unwanted help 
You can't escape the influence of neighbour 
And the neighbour is another evil which wants to dominate as
we have seen at the very outset that there was a clash of interest and ideas
at the beginning which brought out uh two nation of Canada and America
 cough 
So America wants to exploit Canada capitalistically 
And there is another type of relationship with Britain 
parental relationship that too is very painful to receive at 
what has Canada to do 
Where is the choice ?
Either you say good bye to your parentage or
you say good bye to your neighbour or you allow yourself to be
doubly exploited 
Both of them are exploitative 
This is the worry 
And Margaret Atwood has raised her voice particularly 
against the what is called the fashion of Women's
 Liberation Movement that swept the whole of Europe some decades
back 
We saw to liberate the western women Margaret Atwood says
 through her fiction that it is not feasible it is not possible
 it is another way of uh self detention 
The books which she has prominently written which
are which have made her prominent are The Adable 
Women and Surfacing both the books
 deal with this problem of influence of the neighbour and
of them of you know 
The west uh the the women's liberation movement is
 Europe's gift in which the women doesn't know what
exactly she should do in order to be called a liberated women 
So she is advised to say Good bye to all the
conventions all the conventional morality like the institution
of marriage 
Again about Amphly and Clara the two women 
characters in the Adam and Who have been discussing this 
Clara is a married person 
Joe the husband of Clara is always impregnating her
 and then every time there is a child 
And who nurses the child ?
The mother only gives the birth the rest of the care
is taken by father feeding washing clothing everything 
His poses according to our writer Atwood is
problem of father image and the mother image 
What will the child think ?
Who is the father ?
The child will more likely answer a person who feeds 
who cooks who washes is the father 
Who is the mother ?
A person who sits enjoys sleeps reads writes is the
mother 
There is a clash 
There is the projection of the clash of values 
The value system will stand changed 
And our one word goes a step further 
She says Why worry at all admitted that a
 women's life is made unfulfilled until she has a child 
That is the question of women but that does not
necessarily mean that she should marry where is the logic 
marriage is a social institution 
It does not necessarily mean for someone to produce children
 that he or she should marry someone 
You can have the children even outside the wedlock 
So you chose your man 
You know one word him a child is born good bye to
the man 
The child will also mean I'm the mother my
fulfillness in my lap to hell with you man get away from you that
can be one solution 
The problem will be the problem will be laughter 
how do you know who is the boy you see there is a real problem
If you are a woman liberationist and if you are a woman
 you want to break away from all of the convention may be then
you should actually prefer to be the mother of a girl child 
This is what the logic is 
But no mother no mother has ever thought of a child
inside the womb as there for a girl every mother thinks of the child
as he 
What is this he ?
Why always he even though you are claiming or shouting from the
rooftop that you are liberated woman that you are no longer a slave of man
The same problem of slavery man's slavery you
have become over traditional in mental theory of the covention which
accords greater status higher status to man 
So even though you are a liberationist you are still
thinking of your child about whom you don't know as a he
It means you are still pining for a male child 
This is a thought this is a very embarassing for for all
 women 
So our uh uh puts up this question to which there is no answer
except that ultimately we arrive at a conclusion that marriage 
is a co-institution 
It solves many problems not only of the personality of the
feminist but even of cohesion of harmony in the society 
And thereby she seems to reject this wave of women's 
liberation that has come from Europe
The parental left 
In such a theme she finds that a terrible mistake
There seems to be an American in the pristine forest she
finds that Americans are poaching Americans are there looking for
 the wealth which they can exploit the natural wealth 
So if they are boating in the lake the American is
always interested in finding out whether there is a good amount of fish
 which he can perhaps later how to exploit it 
In the forest pristine dense green forest our 
Margaret Atwood finds uh beautifully located huts over which
the Americans C I A agents have an eye and they want to have 
Such properties where they can plant themselves in order to
espionage 
So we can say that here is a writer a woman writer 
who has very much identified herself with the problems and establishments
of her country 
She has identified but she has not been able to find an answer
 and this inability of the writer to find an answer to the complex
problems of two words full and neighbourly uh compulsion
 which has created a very ordinary event situation
 It's at the present incidentally is the hallmark of
women creative writing 
And they are uneducated they can't meet seem
to know what exactly they should do 
So this type of situation has attracted or marked the
writing of the character 
Uh however there is an exception 
That too is a little along the line because we have so
far discussed English speaking novelist writers 
Let us go to the French Canada 
And I have selected and talk for a few minutes 
 I've selected to introduce you a very prominent
French Canadian writer Premjeet Roy 
Premjeet Roy has written a novel uh Where 
the hen's will nest Where the hen's will nest
 
This is a novel about a very very remote area 
uninhabited by the people 
And there is only one family after traversing the land 
crossing various streams and waters you reach a place where there is only
one family 
And that family is a French speaking catholic 
And this Lousina the woman has a problem 
She has eight children 
She is an educated woman 
She occasionaly visits uh centres 
Uh let me introduce you to which we can call centres of
civilization 
She keeps in touch with the modern world in order to know that
 the progress or the new I mean uh or the new things that are
happening 
Must be known to these people and they must not be deprived of the
 of the latest only because there is some problem ?
Is it because of me ?
Uh uh I hope these external things are not against me 
laughter 
Can we do something about it ? interruption 
So she occasionally I don't mind if uh it doesn't work uh
 interruption but this will continue yes 
So she goes 
She has a problem of education of her children
She is living as a family unit in a remote forest area
And she is very much worried about the education of her children
because the Canada government stipulates that's in order to
 sanction a school there should be atleast six pupils 
She has five 
At present she has five and one is too small to be
admitted or enrolled as a pupil 
But she nevertheless writes to the government and they
mercifully appoint a teacher 
The first teacher is a Catholic woman 
The moment she comes she endears herself mixes with the
family becomes a member or part of the family teaches very
meticulously 
She is very punctual 
She wants to take full interest without wasting a moment
So one year passes 
The education of these children for one year has taken place 
There is a transfer 
The next woman teacher is an English woman 
And the moment she comes she finds fault with everything
that exist there 
She starts complaining oh what a stretch I have had to travel
 I'm tired and I'm bored I'm as if in
a in an undesirable situation 
I feel very much unhappy here 
And what are these people Lousina's 
They have not provided a good accomodation to me 
The food also is not palatable to me 
The children are also very dirty
They don't have good habits 
She starts complaining 
She complains and complains 
But she stays on 
And she's looked after by Lousina as she did in the
case of the earlier teacher 
She was a French here is an English 
She does not give any chance of complain to this woman 
But this woman by nature is fussy as we call such people 
She is also transfered 
And when she is transfered she realises oh the place was 
not so bad after all 
I could have stayed on
Why have they transfered 
The two types of attitude at the beginning and at the end 
And Lousina does not feel uh that she should complain
against the teacher because she finds the great advantage of an
English speaking teacher being made available to her children because
otherwise her children would never have a chance to learn English 
particularly in the context of the modern world in which English has
become a lingua franca 
If her childre her children were given 
education or instruction only in French they would lose the
advantages of the world wide uh contact spread of
kmowledge etcetera etcetera 
So she feels that it's a very good event that
 this coach as the British teacher have come and 
she feels thankful to the arrival of these two teachers
However the third teacher is a male 
He is a French male a bachelor unmarried 
When he comes he doesn't take any interest in teaching
children
He says teaching will take place afterwards don't
worry
Let me go to the nature let me enjoy I feel very happy
 I'll shoot I'll fish 
And he would retire to the jungle put a cap on his eyes 
and sleep there 
And he says education will take place we'll 
see to that part of duty later let me enjoy 
He enjoys he always 
He starts calling her mama oh mama 
mother 
And he is interested in eating good things always demands
this and that does not feel shy or constraint 
And then he also receives the transfer orders 
He does not disclose it 
But all of a sudden there is a change in his attitude 
He becomes very serious in teaching these children 
And they realise that this man has a wonderful store of knowledge
He teaches them wonderful things very advanced things 
And before he goes he completes what he calls his course
So there is no complaint 
Lousina loves to have this man as a teacher 
She says Why don't you stay on ?
 Write to the government we'll also write 
that your stay here should be extended 
The man says No thank you for all the hospitality and
the care you took of me 
But I'm going on promotion 
And I'm going to a place where I would like to make my
career 
This is not the place where I can make my career 
So even though I love the place I have enjoyed it but mum 
I will not tie my career 
We will leave the narrative here and discuss the merits 
because we find the time constraint 
Now what happens is this Canada is a bilingual country 
As I already said at the said at the outset that there are
 language problems and there are nationality problem 
There is a talk of separation 
But here is a message from a French woman writer who
seems to be advocating the coexistence of the two and not
encouraging the separation or division in society in the polity 
 He she seems to be possessing that English
 is alright for the French because the French as you know 
hate English 
They hate everything that is English 
They would not speak a word in French Canada if you talk
to them in English 
That is not acknowledged 
So this type of hatred should cease because English 
learning has its own advantages 
And she seems to feel it that there could be harmony 
in the society only if we didn't talk of the differences 
At a party she invites she invites all the types of
people available there
