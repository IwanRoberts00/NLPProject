<I>
""
""
To most of us the term  is quite
familiar 
""
But still 
""
Perhaps we are not sure what a map conveys  or what a map is
likely to present to us 
""
That shows there is a need  map
""
""
""
the whole surface of the earth  part of the surface of the earth
according to scale 
""
When I use the word whole surface of the earth I mean the world 
""
When I say a portion of the earth that means it can be a town  it
can be a village 
""
Now when I use the word scale  the scale means that all the
things that we find in the reality 
""
You have to represent 
""
In other words that  perhaps
it represent sixteen kilometres on the ground 
""
That shows the scale is one inch to sixteen kilometres 
""
Now  let us take
a very very simple example 
""
You are calling your friend home for a dinner  and you have
given the address too 
""
But he finds it extremely difficult to locate your house 
""
After a few queries  perhaps you feel that your friend is not
confident 
""
May be you would like to take a small piece of paper and draw a few
lines  clearly indicating what is a road on which your house is located
 and
how to reach your place 
""
Well  the man more confident and he
is able to get himself acquainted with your area  and he will be able to
reach home confidently 
""
Now what does it mean  ?
""
It means that  you have drawn a part of the city in a small
sketch to convey the message to your friend 
""
I call this as the concept of map 
""
Well  any message can be transmitted in
the form of a map 
""
Now we would like to know how often we use 
""
Well  ?
""
You would like to know whether we came to know about maps  only
recently 
""
I would like to say that the concept of map  dates
back to six hundred B C 
""
Greeks and Romans were the pioneers  to introduce the concept of
map 
""
Perhaps you would like to know that 
it is Ptolemy  for the whole
world 
""
However  is not that encouraging
""
""
Very rough 
""
But  dates back to sixteen seventy-eight
""
""
I would like to show now 
accurate  during the historical period
""
""
Here  which was drawn in the year
sixteen seventy-eight 
""
And it is the  accurately drawn map
""
""
It represents facts  and
the colour  hand painted
colour 
""
After  which is hand painted
 in terms of painting and
production 
""
""
pleasant 
""
But 
direction 
""
These three concepts  in
the modern maps 
""
I would like to show 
the concept of location 
easily seen 
""
We have a map here 
Tamil Nadu 
""
If you look into this map  the first thing
that comes to your mind 
""
Here I have  in
the form of a black dot  location of a
particular place 
""
Our next concept 
""
I have here  towards the
top 
""
In other words  towards
northern direction 
""
Well 
""
The scales are given  sometimes both in the
form of figures as well as in the form of  roughly six
point eight miles on the ground  represented on one centimetre in the map
""
""
A map contains 
""
Number one 
""
Number two  it is the technical skill which is needed to draft a
map 
""
Skill in art means 
positioning of letters  and drawing the
 aesthetic
""
""
Similarly  the second part of it which I call it as a technical
drafting  have to be
 have to be
transferred  the
minds 
""
It is very difficult to understand what is the step by step 
movements 
""
Because  it is in a
position to create a visual image in your mind 
""
You will keep things in your mind for a long time to come 
""
Its quite easier  map is a very powerful
tool of communication 
""
I would like to now explain  and a
map  to you
""
""
Let us look at  which I have
taken 
""
We will look into that 
""
Here is a small cutting  the
text which is written  and simultaneously on the other side
a map is drawn 
""
Perhaps  is
complementary 
""
I do agree 
""
But  you will know
that  and you
will be able to understand the news 
""
Perhaps if you read only the first sentence  and jump into the
last sentence 
""
You will not be able to receive 
""
Therefore  you are required to move sentence by sentence to
understand 
""
So is the case with the map 
""
If I have to say  Today I am going to deal with Kuwait
""
""
That means first I should know where Kuwait is located in the
Middle East 
""
And here is the small insert map  which gives an idea that where
is Kuwait located 
""
From that you move on to the  and its surrounding
countries 
""
So your eye and mind goes step by step  from one message to
another message 
""
All these messages are  steadily kept in your mind
""
""
In addition to this  possibly you not only store this message in
your mind you will be able to interpret the  news in a much more
scientific way 
""
Therefore  map is a very powerful tool of
communication 
""
Let us look at 
""
You are able to see  the land
""
""
This is more or less 
""
But 
especially  which is quite small in
size 
etcetera 
""
But 
and then represent in a plain sheet of paper  how difficult it will be
""
""
It will be definitely difficult  on a
plain sheet of paper 
""
Once it is distorted 
the shape 
""
Therefore there is a need 
latitudes and longitudes  so that
entire thing can be transferred on a plain sheet of paper 
""
For this process we use a technical term  known as projection
""
""
The projection is nothing but arrangement of  latitude and
longitude in such a manner  surface of the
earth 
and size 
""
Here is a world map  wherein the entire land and ocean is
represented 
""
You are able to see the Greenland 
Canada 
""
Whereas in the previous scene we have seen  in the globe that
Greenland was much smaller than Canada  this indicates that the
representation of the sphere  necessarily
brings 
""
Now 
""
I would like you to look at the symbols  in
a map 
""
If we 
of India 
""
The first and the foremost symbol  is the administrative symbols
""
""
In other words  the administrative symbols are nothing but lines
""
""
Now  is a line which separates India
from Nepal 
""
And this administrative line is known as international boundary
""
""
When we come down you will be able to see  the boundary line
which separates 
""
Again this is another symbol which represents the 
administrative set up of the country 
""
After that the most important symbol that we would like to look
into 
""
Physical means  the physical
details of a map 
""
Here we are able to see the river  which is given in the form
of a blue line 
""
Now  usually the rivers are given blue lines mainly because one
is able to perceive the reality in 
""
After the river symbols probably the next one which attracts most
us 
""
The cultural symbols 
""
Now the Hyderabad 
which is given in the form of a red line 
""
Like this almost all the symbols are carried out in a map in a
sophisticated manner so that each symbol merges with the map in a systematic
manner
""
The next important component 
""
The size  do indicate
""
""
The size of the letters  do indicate the hierarchy of place
names 
""
The direction of letters also indicate the  style as well as
the slope of a river 
""
Similarly  if a group of islands have to be shown they are
written in such a manner so that it covers all the distribution of islands
""
Now  the title is
written  below which you will find the scale is written
""
""
Below the scale 
indicating that  are
given 
""
In other words  one should be in a
position to read first this  with the
details 
""
The second most important thing that you have to keep in mind is
""
the inner line  the
outer line will give you the finishing for the entire map 
""
All the details  lines which are
known as neat lines 
""
In the black and white map 
between one region 
""
Whereas in a colour map  at
much faster rate 
""
In other words  it
appears that 
""
If we look into these maps 
this is the map of the city of Madras 
""
It is a large scale map 
""
But  here we have the tourist map of Tamil Nadu which is a
small scale map 
""
So maps can be classified on the basis of the scale  so that it
is easy to identify the specific purpose for which the map is prepared 
""
We could see today in the world  school
children 
business people  in some form or other
""
""
The man who draws this map usually called as a cartographer 
""
The subject  drafting and
printing of maps usually known as cartography 
""
Well  today we could see that the developments in the field of
cartography  have reached such a high
standard that  and satellite imageries have come
into 
""
Maps are part and parcel of life 
""
One is able to convey the message more effectively  accurately
""
""
And it reminds us a graphical age  the years
to come 
""
I am sure you will also agree with me that  there is a need to
create this awareness 
life
