To most of us the term  is quite
""
""
But still 
""
Perhaps we are not sure what a map conveys  or what a map is
""
""
That shows there is a need  map
""
""
""
""
according to scale 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
You have to represent 
""
""
it represent sixteen kilometres on the ground 
""
""
""
""
a very very simple example 
""
""
given the address too 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
sketch to convey the message to your friend 
""
""
""
Well  any message can be transmitted in
the form of a map 
""
Now we would like to know how often we use 
""
Well  ?
""
""
recently 
""
""
back to six hundred B C 
""
""
map 
""
Perhaps you would like to know that 
it is Ptolemy  for the whole
""
""
""
""
""
Very rough 
""
""
""
""
""
accurate  during the historical period
""
""
Here  which was drawn in the year
""
""
And it is the  accurately drawn map
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
pleasant 
""
""
direction 
""
These three concepts  in
""
""
I would like to show 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
particular place 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
The scales are given  sometimes both in the
""
point eight miles on the ground  represented on one centimetre in the map
""
""
""
""
Number one 
""
Number two  it is the technical skill which is needed to draft a
""
""
""
positioning of letters  and drawing the
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
movements 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
text which is written  and simultaneously on the other side
""
""
Perhaps  is
""
""
""
""
But  you will know
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Therefore  you are required to move sentence by sentence to
""
""
So is the case with the map 
""
""
""
""
""
Middle East 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
your mind you will be able to interpret the  news in a much more
""
""
Therefore  map is a very powerful tool of
""
""
Let us look at 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
especially  which is quite small in
size 
etcetera 
""
""
""
""
""
""
plain sheet of paper 
""
Once it is distorted 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
The projection is nothing but arrangement of  latitude and
longitude in such a manner  surface of the
""
""
""
""
""
""
You are able to see the Greenland 
""
""
""
""
""
brings 
""
Now 
""
""
a map 
""
If we 
of India 
""
The first and the foremost symbol  is the administrative symbols
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
When we come down you will be able to see  the boundary line
which separates 
""
Again this is another symbol which represents the 
""
""
After that the most important symbol that we would like to look
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Now  usually the rivers are given blue lines mainly because one
""
""
""
us 
""
""
""
Now the Hyderabad 
""
""
Like this almost all the symbols are carried out in a map in a
""
""
""
The next important component 
""
""
""
""
The size of the letters  do indicate the hierarchy of place
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
Now  the title is
""
""
""
""
indicating that  are
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
the inner line  the
""
""
""
known as neat lines 
""
""
between one region 
""
""
much faster rate 
""
""
""
""
""
this is the map of the city of Madras 
""
It is a large scale map 
""
But  here we have the tourist map of Tamil Nadu which is a
""
""
""
is easy to identify the specific purpose for which the map is prepared 
""
We could see today in the world  school
children 
""
""
""
The man who draws this map usually called as a cartographer 
""
The subject  drafting and
""
""
""
""
standard that  and satellite imageries have come
into 
""
Maps are part and parcel of life 
""
One is able to convey the message more effectively  accurately
""
""
And it reminds us a graphical age  the years
