<I>
To most of us the term map is quite
familiar 
But still we do not understand the exact meaning of a map 
Perhaps we are not sure what a map conveys or what a map is
likely to present to us 
That shows there is a need to define the term map
 
 Map is nothing but representation of 
the whole surface of the earth or part of the surface of the earth
according to scale 
When I use the word whole surface of the earth I mean the world 
When I say a portion of the earth that means it can be a town it
can be a village 
Now when I use the word scale the scale means that all the
things that we find in the reality cannot be transferred on a map 
You have to represent that's found in the reality 
In other words that one inch if you draw on a map perhaps
it represent sixteen kilometres on the ground 
That shows the scale is one inch to sixteen kilometres 
Now if one has to explain the concept of a map let us take
a very very simple example 
You are calling your friend home for a dinner and you have
given the address too to him 
But he finds it extremely difficult to locate your house 
After a few queries perhaps you feel that your friend is not
confident to reach your home 
May be you would like to take a small piece of paper and draw a few
lines clearly indicating what is a road on which your house is located
 what's a land mark which is quite simple to identify and
how to reach your place 
Well this sketch makes the man more confident and he
is able to get himself acquainted with your area and he will be able to
reach home confidently 
Now what does it mean ?
It means that you have drawn a part of the city in a small
sketch to convey the message to your friend 
I call this as the concept of map 
Well if you agree that any message can be transmitted in
the form of a map 
Now we would like to know how often we use map 
Well how old is this concept ?
You would like to know whether we came to know about maps only
recently or it has a history behind 
I would like to say that the concept of map was dates
back to six hundred B C 
Greeks and Romans were the pioneers to introduce the concept of
map 
Perhaps you would like to know that in second century A D 
it is Ptolemy who brought the concept of the map for the whole
world 
However the accuracy of the map is not that encouraging
Very rough idea of the world was given 
But very accurate map dates back to sixteen seventy-eight
I would like to show now a map which is quite 
accurate accurately drawn during the historical period
Here you have a map which was drawn in the year
sixteen seventy-eight 
And it is the history's first accurately drawn map
It represents facts which is drawn with true to scale and
the colour which you could see here is nothing but hand painted
colour 
After watching the historical map which is hand painted
 the maps have gone a revolution in terms of painting and
production 
 Today's maps are multicoloured and looks 
pleasant and more informative 
But the maps have also incorporated concepts like 
direction distance and location 
These three concepts have been given more importance in
the modern maps 
I would like to show a map of Tamil Nadu wherein 
the concept of location direction and distance could be 
easily seen 
We have a map here which is a representation of 
Tamil Nadu state 
If you look into this map very carefully the first thing
that comes to your mind is the location of places 
Here I have the location of Bangalore which is given in
the form of a black dot and this is exactly known as location of a
particular place 
Our next concept is the direction 
I have here marked a red arrow line facing towards the
top which is nothing but the northern direction 
In other words most of the maps are prepared towards
northern direction on the top of the map 
Well from the direction we move to the scale 
The scales are given at the bottom sometimes both in the
form of figures as well as in the form of equivalance roughly six
point eight miles on the ground represented on one centimetre in the map
A map contains two important components 
Number one it is a skill in art 
Number two it is the technical skill which is needed to draft a
map 
Skill in art means the designing of a map 
positioning of letters symbols title writing and drawing the
 components inside a map which should be more pleasing aesthetic
 to the viewer or to a map user 
Similarly the second part of it which I call it as a technical
drafting is a very difficult job because the maps have to be
 drawn according to scale and the information have to be
transferred into a map in a systematic manner so that the
minds idea follow the things in a very very systematic manner 
It is very difficult to understand what is the step by step 
movements 
Because a map is a highest form of graphic it is in a
position to create a visual image in your mind 
You will keep things in your mind for a long time to come 
Its quite easier to understand that map is a very powerful
tool of communication 
I would like to now explain how a written text and a
map if they are together how do they convey the message to you
Let us look at a small piece of information which I have
taken from a newspaper 
We will look into that in a more systematic manner 
Here is a small cutting wherein you will be able to see the
text which is written over here and simultaneously on the other side
a map is drawn 
Perhaps you will understand that this map is
complementary to the text 
I do agree 
But if you look into the text very carefully you will know
that as you read the sentences it will go into your mind and you
will be able to understand the news in a systematic manner 
Perhaps if you read only the first sentence and jump into the
last sentence you will miss the message 
You will not be able to receive anything 
Therefore you are required to move sentence by sentence to
understand the message 
So is the case with the map 
If I have to say Today I am going to deal with Kuwait
 
That means first I should know where Kuwait is located in the
Middle East 
And here is the small insert map which gives an idea that where
is Kuwait located 
From that you move on to the Kuwait and its surrounding
countries with physical as well as cultural features 
So your eye and mind goes step by step from one message to
another message 
All these messages are slowly steadily kept in your mind
 and you can retrieve this message in a more systematic manner 
In addition to this possibly you not only store this message in
your mind you will be able to interpret the news in a much more
scientific way in order to understand the situation better 
Therefore I would say that map is a very powerful tool of
communication 
Let us look at the map in the form of a globe 
You are able to see this globe now wherein the land
 sea are distributed in aesthetical manner 
This is more or less true to the reality 
But you will be able to see that the size of the land 
especially if you could watch the Greenland which is quite small in
size as compared with the Canada United States 
etcetera 
But if this globe has to be broken into several parts 
and then represent in a plain sheet of paper how difficult it will be
It will be definitely difficult to represent this on a
plain sheet of paper because this will be distorted 
Once it is distorted the figures will not appear clearly 
the shape size scale will all vary 
Therefore there is a need of mathematical calculation of 
latitudes and longitudes to be corrected in such a manner so that
entire thing can be transferred on a plain sheet of paper 
For this process we use a technical term known as projection
The projection is nothing but arrangement of latitude and
longitude in such a manner so that you represent the surface of the
earth any part of the surface of the earth according to correct shape 
and size 
Here is a world map wherein the entire land and ocean is
represented in a plain sheet of paper 
You are able to see the Greenland which is bigger than 
Canada 
Whereas in the previous scene we have seen in the globe that
Greenland was much smaller than Canada this indicates that the
representation of the sphere on a plain sheet of paper necessarily
brings distortion of shape and size 
Now symbols are the most important components of a map 
I would like you to look at the symbols which are given in
a map drawn for India 
If we look into this map it is a tourist road map 
of India wherein the symbols are given in different forms 
The first and the foremost symbol is the administrative symbols
In other words the administrative symbols are nothing but lines
 drawn to show the administrative boundaries 
Now this particular line is a line which separates India
from Nepal 
And this administrative line is known as international boundary
When we come down you will be able to see the boundary line
which separates Uttar Pradesh from Madhya Pradesh 
Again this is another symbol which represents the 
administrative set up of the country 
After that the most important symbol that we would like to look
into is the physical symbol 
Physical means that the representation of the physical
details of a map 
Here we are able to see the river which is given in the form
of a blue line 
Now usually the rivers are given blue lines mainly because one
is able to perceive the reality in without much difficulty 
After the river symbols probably the next one which attracts most
us is the cultural symbols 
The cultural symbols the good example will be a road 
Now the Hyderabad is connected to Nagpur via highway 
which is given in the form of a red line 
Like this almost all the symbols are carried out in a map in a
sophisticated manner so that each symbol merges with the map in a systematic
manner
The next important component is lettering 
The size style direction of letters do indicate
 different type of messages 
The size of the letters do indicate the hierarchy of place
names 
The direction of letters also indicate the style as well as
the slope of a river 
Similarly if a group of islands have to be shown they are
written in such a manner so that it covers all the distribution of islands
Now in this map the first thing is that the title is
written in a corner below which you will find the scale is written
Below the scale you will find the term legend 
indicating that all the details which have gone into the map are
given 
In other words that in the format one should be in a
position to read first this and then familarise himself with the
details then go to the map to read the map what it is all about 
The second most important thing that you have to keep in mind is
 the design of the total format wherein you will be able to see 
the inner line will give you the latitude and longitude boundary the
outer line will give you the finishing for the entire map 
All the details should come between these lines which are
known as neat lines 
In the black and white map you are unable to distinguish 
between one region to another region and different symbols 
Whereas in a colour map the eye catches the difference at
much faster rate 
In other words from the point of your communication it
appears that colour seems to play a most important role 
If we look into these maps you will be able to see that 
this is the map of the city of Madras 
It is a large scale map 
But here we have the tourist map of Tamil Nadu which is a
small scale map 
So maps can be classified on the basis of the scale so that it
is easy to identify the specific purpose for which the map is prepared 
We could see today in the world the educationists school
children scientists planners administrators politicians 
business people all of them are using the maps in some form or other
The man who draws this map usually called as a cartographer 
The subject which deals with designing drafting and
printing of maps usually known as cartography 
Well today we could see that the developments in the field of
cartography or in the preparation of maps have reached such a high
standard that computer technology and satellite imageries have come
into a great way in expanding the scope of mapping the earths surface 
Maps are part and parcel of life 
One is able to convey the message more effectively accurately
 scientifically through maps 
And it reminds us a graphical age in your mind the years
to come 
I am sure you will also agree with me that there is a need to
create this awareness in the utility of maps in the man's 
life
