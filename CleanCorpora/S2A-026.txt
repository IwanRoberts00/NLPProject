The Vice-chancellor of  today's
 Pro-Vice-Chancellor of Shivaji
University  my
colleagues from the Shivaji University  and the participants in this
orientation programme 
""
It is a pleasure to be associated  with the inauguration of the
twenty-second  by the
academic staff college of Goa University 
""
This also happens to be the  second programme we are organizing
in Kolhapur 
""
And I am grateful  to the Vice-Chancellor of Goa University and
to his colleagues 
coming  such a
programme
""
Without  this attitude of yours I think it may have been
difficult for 
the facility which the University Grants Commission is offering 
""
At the outset  to this
campus 
""
He has visited us 
 and today we have had the pleasure
of having him here  to give the key note address of this orientation
programme 
""
Dr Dubhashi  enjoys a unique position amongst the
vice-Chancellors of India 
""
Most vice-Chancellors like myself  from
inwards 
""
We have been a part of the university system 
only 
""
But Dr Dubhashi being an administrator  and an administrator
 has the advantage of looking at the
education system from outside  what is
present therein 
""
And I am sure  being
able to see  and to able to understand
your own problems  the Goa
University 
""
I have had the  previlege of hearing him at two or three
conferences 
""
And I must say  with the fresh
view points 
""
Dr Dubashi has jokingly said that we should not  underestimate
Goa 
""
We understand Goa  is a place where there is an integration of
two cultures  stands next to
the old Cathedral of Goa  the
very necessary background for the development of the cultures  and where
you have got  National
Institute of Oceanography 
""
We know  Goa
is a place which can really  something new in terms of
knowledge something new in terms of developng 
""
And  to share
from your staff member as well as from ours  a different
view point  culture a different view point on history and a
different view point 
education should develop 
""
Dr Dubhashi had mentioned  conference of vice-
Chancellors  Commonwealth universities at Dehli which was held
earlier this year 
""
One of the main problems  at this
conference was that of  and quantity Vs
quality
""
I am putting it the  westerners
would put it  in the education system at least
we find that mediocrity  over quality and
excellence 
""
And what is absolutely essential from the point of view of the
development of education in India is  excellence should be there
""
""
If there is excellence 
proud of it 
""
But at least excellence in smaller amounts would be absolutely
essential before  to the next generation what they
deserve 
""
And from this point of view  the concept of academic staff
colleges which the University Grants Commission has developed in recent years
""
""
It is unless we train our minds  our own
knowledge I do not think we can deliver to the students 
""
What  has
an idea that what they are getting is really something which is old and
outdated 
""
Many years ago I read in the  Digest
 a small anecdote which they usually publish but which has
stuck to my mind 
""
In the scenario  of about five
or six 
""
An 
""
One child said  number of
the aircraft 
""
The other said  uh nine look at the
angle of the wings 
""
And then the 
""
And then one child says to the another  let's
""
""
So it is a fact from knowledge the  younger
generation know so much more  probably we
 younger days would not be able
to transmit it
""
And therefore this question of upgrading of knowledge has to be
taken 
""
As  Dr Fernandes has pointed out the Academic Staff College has
""
""
These are  for meeting the new
challenges 
making you  making you aware
""
to what you are going to do 
""
And I think all of these are very important 
of view of a 
""
You will find  new challenges which are being put
 us will require absolutely new
skills
""
What  would probably be next to
useless
""
I just cannot handle a computer 
""
But 
today knows the basics of computers
""
He can handle it
""
And five years later unless  we all can handle the skill I don't
think we will be able to  of knowledge to our
students 
""
What is most important is having an awareness of the linkage
between education and society 
""
Many years ago we had the traditional system of education where 
the teacher  dealt with different
aspects of his subject  he distributed the
knowledge 
""
But it was all very abstract 
""
And what Sidney Smith said was very important  the teacher
""
""
In a university system you had the right to be wrong 
""
That was the  that even if a teacher
taught something which was very abstract which was wrong it was his right and
the right to be the wrong was one of the  biggest previleges of a
university 
""
Today the times have changed 
""
The whole social system is financing your education  and
therefore you have something to pay back to uh society 
""
And this is the  university society linkage which has got to be
very important 
""
The third aspect is also of developing our knowledge 
""
Today  we are in an age where you have to draw from every other
subject before you can really put forward what your own subject says 
""
And this 
uh we have learned 
master's  programme
""
We have got to go  and we have got to
draw 
""
Uh later in this afternoon I will be  I'll
 be talking to you regarding the science and technology policy how our
science and technology has developed uh since  the days of freedom and
what are the problems 
""
Now one of the basic problems which I will try to tell you is that
our background has not been broad enough 
""
And it is from this point of view  like it is essential
for the scientist to know his ancient heritage and his culture  it is very
necessary for the  uh uh student of social sciences to know what the
scientific development is
""
And it is from this point of view  have
to enlarge 
""
Again  when we transmit our knowledge there are certain
techniques and then there are certain skills  and there are certain
limitations 
""
Very uh  uh when I
 media
research centre at Poona University they were developing cassettes 
""
And at that time one thing was said that when  only an
audio cassette  and there is
nothing else to be seen  the cassette should not be more than fifteen
minutes or eighteen minutes because you do not hold the interest of a student
for more than that period 
""
In brief 
should not dwelt too much on a 
""
Dr  attention to the fact that there
is something wrong with our national spirit 
""
We have come to a stage  where we have become very much
dependent 
""
I mean the present economic crisis  uh is a very good example
""
""
And he has also pointed out that the idealism which Gandhiji and
Nehruji had  the spirit with which they had fought for freedom and the
spirit with which  at the future is quite different
""
""
Twenty-five years ago or a little more than that  I was in the
United States  I was doing my post doctor
research at that time 
""
And I came to know some of the American professors very intimately
""
""
One of them  in the context of the foreign policies of India and
Pakistan said  like Pakistan why do you not co-operate with us
""
""
If India co-operates  lay down the red
carpet for your country 
""
At that time I told him very  proudly
 under slavery for a long time we do
not want red carpets we want to be independent we would like to stand on our
feet 
we have  and
we are now willing to walk on that red carpet 
""
I do not think this is the proper attitude the proper spirit at
which we are 
""
But I do hope  not only change ourselves
but we will act in our manner when the young generation changes 
""
And for that if you want the younger generation to change  then
""
""
And if they are to look  then I think the basic
requirement is that when we go into our classrooms we are fully equipped for
the next 
""
We know our subject thoroughly well  to enthuse
the student  certain amount of
information  the
search for knowledge 
""
This is the spirit 
""
All of you have been enthusiastic enough to register for uh 
this course 
""
I am sure that during the next  three weeks you will be provided
with a lot of information 
""
My only hope is that you will take this information  you will
imbibe whatever is given to you 
""
You will see that mentally  it is
co-ordinated and a new flow of knowledge emerges 
""
And this flow of our knowledge these new thoughts  are not
confined to  but they go down to our
students 
""
It is our duty 
and all of us are willing to do our job 
""
 thank Dr
Dubhashi for coming here I must thank  for allowing the
Academic Staff College of Goa University to hold its orientation programme
here
""
And  I am sure that with the fare Dr Devasthali has put out for
you the 
not only 
vacation or so called vacation period for you 
""
Thank you all
