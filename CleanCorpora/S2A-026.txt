The Vice-chancellor of  today's
""
""
colleagues from the Shivaji University  and the participants in this
""
""
""
""
academic staff college of Goa University 
""
This also happens to be the  second programme we are organizing
""
""
And I am grateful  to the Vice-Chancellor of Goa University and
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
campus 
""
""
 and today we have had the pleasure
""
""
""
""
vice-Chancellors of India 
""
""
inwards 
""
""
only 
""
""
 has the advantage of looking at the
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
I have had the  previlege of hearing him at two or three
""
""
""
view points 
""
""
""
""
We understand Goa  is a place where there is an integration of
two cultures  stands next to
the old Cathedral of Goa  the
""
you have got  National
""
""
We know  Goa
is a place which can really  something new in terms of
""
""
And  to share
""
view point  culture a different view point on history and a
""
education should develop 
""
""
""
""
""
""
conference was that of  and quantity Vs
""
""
I am putting it the  westerners
""
""
excellence 
""
""
development of education in India is  excellence should be there
""
""
If there is excellence 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
knowledge I do not think we can deliver to the students 
""
""
an idea that what they are getting is really something which is old and
outdated 
""
""
 a small anecdote which they usually publish but which has
stuck to my mind 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
So it is a fact from knowledge the  younger
""
""
""
""
""
taken 
""
As  Dr Fernandes has pointed out the Academic Staff College has
""
""
""
challenges 
making you  making you aware
""
to what you are going to do 
""
And I think all of these are very important 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
today knows the basics of computers
""
""
""
""
""
students 
""
""
between education and society 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
And what Sidney Smith said was very important  the teacher
""
""
""
""
That was the  that even if a teacher
""
the right to be the wrong was one of the  biggest previleges of a
""
""
Today the times have changed 
""
""
""
""
""
very important 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
draw 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
And it is from this point of view  like it is essential
""
""
scientific development is
""
And it is from this point of view  have
""
""
Again  when we transmit our knowledge there are certain
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
minutes or eighteen minutes because you do not hold the interest of a student
for more than that period 
""
In brief 
""
""
""
""
""
We have come to a stage  where we have become very much
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
spirit with which  at the future is quite different
""
""
""
United States  I was doing my post doctor
research at that time 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
 under slavery for a long time we do
""
feet 
we have  and
""
""
""
which we are 
""
""
but we will act in our manner when the young generation changes 
""
And for that if you want the younger generation to change  then
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
the student  certain amount of
""
search for knowledge 
""
""
""
""
this course 
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
confined to  but they go down to our
""
""
""
""
""
 thank Dr
""
""
here
""
""
you the 
not only 
""
""
Thank you all
