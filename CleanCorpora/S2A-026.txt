<I>
The Vice-chancellor of Goa University and today's
 chief guest Dr Dubhashi Pro-Vice-Chancellor of Shivaji
University Dr Yadav Dr Fernandes Dr Devasthali my
colleagues from the Shivaji University and the participants in this
orientation programme 
It is a pleasure to be associated with the inauguration of the
twenty-second orientation programme being organized by the
academic staff college of Goa University 
This also happens to be the second programme we are organizing
in Kolhapur 
And I am grateful to the Vice-Chancellor of Goa University and
to his colleagues for taking all trouble of co 
coming over to Kolhapur every year and organizing such a
programme
Without this attitude of yours I think it may have been
difficult for many of our lady participants to take advantage of 
the facility which the University Grants Commission is offering 
At the outset I would like to welcome Dr Dubhashi to this
campus on a formal basis 
He has visited us on a couple of occasions but was 
 that was more of a personal visit and today we have had the pleasure
of having him here to give the key note address of this orientation
programme 
Dr Dubhashi enjoys a unique position amongst the
vice-Chancellors of India 
Most vice-Chancellors like myself look upon the job from
inwards 
We have been a part of the university system and we see 
only what we have been seeing for say twenty-five thirty years 
But Dr Dubhashi being an administrator and an administrator
 par excellence has the advantage of looking at the
education system from outside after taking into account what is
present therein 
And I am sure this these two factors being
able to see from the view point of others and to able to understand
your own problems will go a long way in seeing that the Goa
University develops at a very rapid rate 
I have had the previlege of hearing him at two or three
conferences 
And I must say that all have been impressed with the fresh
view points which he has been presenting 
Dr Dubashi has jokingly said that we should not underestimate
Goa no sir we certainly do not do so 
We understand Goa is a place where there is an integration of
two cultures where the temple of Mangeshi stands next to
the old Cathedral of Goa where the scenic beauty provides the
very necessary background for the development of the cultures and where
you have got research institutes of the stature of the National
Institute of Oceanography 
We know therefore that Goa is an education centre Goa
is a place which can really provide something new in terms of
knowledge something new in terms of developng the human mind 
And it is therefore our beloved previlege sir to share
from your staff member as well as from ours the a different
view point on culture a different view point on history and a
different view point on scientific achievements and the ways 
education should develop 
Dr Dubhashi had mentioned the conference of vice-
Chancellors of Commonwealth universities at Dehli which was held
earlier this year 
One of the main problems which was discussed at this
conference was that of mediocrity Vs excellence and quantity Vs
quality
I am putting it the other way to what the westerners
would put it because today in India in the education system at least
we find that mediocrity and quantity has held a sway over quality and
excellence 
And what is absolutely essential from the point of view of the
development of education in India is that excellence should be there
If there is excellence with quantity I'll be very 
proud of it 
But at least excellence in smaller amounts would be absolutely
essential before we can really give to the next generation what they
deserve 
And from this point of view the concept of academic staff
colleges which the University Grants Commission has developed in recent years
 was is of great importance 
It is unless we train our minds unless we enlarge our own
knowledge I do not think we can deliver to the students 
What Dr Dubhashi has again mentioned that the students has
an idea that what they are getting is really something which is old and
outdated 
Many years ago I read in the Readers' Digest
 a small anecdote which they usually publish but which has
stuck to my mind 
In the scenario was two young children of about five
or six were playing in the school courtyard 
An aeroplane went over 
One child said It is a V H naming some uh number of
the aircraft 
The other said no no it is a V uh nine look at the
angle of the wings 
And then the bell rang 
And then one child says to the another Now let's
 go back and count those silly bits laughter 
So it is a fact from knowledge the young younger
generation know so much more that probably we probably we
 who never had that training in our uh younger days would not be able
to transmit it
And therefore this question of upgrading of knowledge has to be
taken very very seriously 
As Dr Fernandes has pointed out the Academic Staff College has
 three or four major objectives 
These are giving you the skill for meeting the new
challenges making you aware of the linkages of education with society 
making you aware of the current trends in knowledge making you aware
 of the educational technology and giving you a practical aspect 
to what you are going to do 
And I think all of these are very important from the point 
of view of a teacher 
You will find that the new challenges which are being put
 before before us will require absolutely new
skills
What I as a student learned would probably be next to
useless
I just cannot handle a computer 
But a school ch ch child 
today knows the basics of computers
He can handle it
And five years later unless we all can handle the skill I don't
think we will be able to give anything in terms of knowledge to our
students 
What is most important is having an awareness of the linkage
between education and society 
Many years ago we had the traditional system of education where 
the teacher lived in his ivory tower he dealt with different
aspects of his subject he gained knowledge he distributed the
knowledge 
But it was all very abstract 
And what Sidney Smith said was very important the teacher
 had the right to do everything 
In a university system you had the right to be wrong 
That was the uh expression there that even if a teacher
taught something which was very abstract which was wrong it was his right and
the right to be the wrong was one of the biggest previleges of a
university 
Today the times have changed 
The whole social system is financing your education and
therefore you have something to pay back to uh society 
And this is the university society linkage which has got to be
very important 
The third aspect is also of developing our knowledge 
Today we are in an age where you have to draw from every other
subject before you can really put forward what your own subject says 
And this I don't think can be done on the basis of what 
uh we have learned during our bachelor's programme or in our 
master's programme
We have got to go to the right and left and we have got to
draw from every source which we had 
Uh later in this afternoon I will be telling you or I'll
 be talking to you regarding the science and technology policy how our
science and technology has developed uh since the days of freedom and
what are the problems 
Now one of the basic problems which I will try to tell you is that
our background has not been broad enough 
And it is from this point of view just like it is essential
for the scientist to know his ancient heritage and his culture it is very
necessary for the uh uh student of social sciences to know what the
scientific development is
And it is from this point of view that uh we will have
to enlarge 
Again when we transmit our knowledge there are certain
techniques and then there are certain skills and there are certain
limitations 
Very uh jokingly I will tell you one thing that uh when I
 had something to do with the educational mis uh me media
research centre at Poona University they were developing cassettes 
And at that time one thing was said that when it's only an
audio cassette one only if there is a speaker and there is
nothing else to be seen the cassette should not be more than fifteen
minutes or eighteen minutes because you do not hold the interest of a student
for more than that period laughter 
In brief a teacher uh uh a speaker should be not 
should not dwelt too much on a uh special topic 
Dr Dubhashi has drawn our attention to the fact that there
is something wrong with our national spirit 
We have come to a stage where we have become very much
dependent upon other countries 
I mean the present economic crisis uh is a very good example
And he has also pointed out that the idealism which Gandhiji and
Nehruji had the spirit with which they had fought for freedom and the
spirit with which they looked at the future is quite different
Twenty-five years ago or a little more than that I was in the
United States I was studying uh I was doing my post doctor
research at that time 
And I came to know some of the American professors very intimately
One of them in the context of the foreign policies of India and
Pakistan said like Pakistan why do you not co-operate with us
If India co-operates the America will lay down the red
carpet for your country 
At that time I told him very prou proudly
 We have been under slavery for a long time we do
not want red carpets we want to be independent we would like to stand on our
feet clapping twenty-five years later I think 
we have failed we have asked them to lay down the red carpet and
we are now willing to walk on that red carpet 
I do not think this is the proper attitude the proper spirit at
which we are looking at our problems 
But I do hope that we will not only change ourselves
but we will act in our manner when the young generation changes 
And for that if you want the younger generation to change then
 they should not look down at us they should look up at us 
And if they are to look up at us then I think the basic
requirement is that when we go into our classrooms we are fully equipped for
the next fifty minutes' or sixty minutes' lecture 
We know our subject thoroughly well wer are able to enthuse
the student we are able to draw from them certain amount of
information and we are able to make them to interact with us in the
search for knowledge 
This is the spirit behind the Academic Staff College 
All of you have been enthusiastic enough to register for uh 
this course 
I am sure that during the next three weeks you will be provided
with a lot of information 
My only hope is that you will take this information you will
imbibe whatever is given to you 
You will see that mentally what has come together it is
co-ordinated and a new flow of knowledge emerges 
And this flow of our knowledge these new thoughts are not
confined to us to our colleagues but they go down to our
students 
It is our duty and I think all of us here realize this 
and all of us are willing to do our job 
 I must before I conclude I must again thank Dr
Dubhashi for coming here I must thank uh him for allowing the
Academic Staff College of Goa University to hold its orientation programme
here
And I am sure that with the fare Dr Devasthali has put out for
you the next three years would be next three weeks would be 
not only very invigorating but will be a very happy 
vacation or so called vacation period for you 
Thank you all clapping
