 You'd be happy to know that you and Professor Shastri they are preparing a cassette of the spoken Indian English
 
English was very old in this country from the time of
the East India Company 
East India Company which came to India in seventeenth century
 they started English in the coastal areas of Andhra Pradesh to begin
it 
And then with the establishment of East India Company at Madras
Calcutta and Bombay things have improved 
And during seventeenth century as well as in eighteenth
that is finally English was systematized and standardized by
the Macaulay's minute 
It was introduced in the schools which was started by the East
India Company and English became one of the subjects of study 
People have been studying English for last so many years
 and uh it became a big a matter after the establishment
of the three universities at the provincial cities of Madras Bombay and
Calcutta 
English is studied both for its language as well as for
literature 
English has influenced the Indians and very much it has given
strength and source to them to fight against the British later on
Through English only Indians have came to know what is a
democratic system how the government works in England and the speeches of
Burke
And many other uh leaders in the British Parliament 
influenced the Indian leaders 
And English is one of the motive factor for many people 
who started writing in Indian languages even Bankim Chandra Chatterji
 who wrote such a beautiful novel like uh Anandmath
 was influenced by English and he gave a slogan called
 Vande Mataram 
So English has become one of the important languages in India
English is studied today in schools colleges 
universities 
English is the lingua franca 
And I think through English only for the first time 
India is uh made one uh otherwise it will be difficult for most
of the Indians to know each other 
Because there are so many languages in India there are nearly
seven hundred languages in India
There was a cultural unity but a linguistic unity was not there
And uh therefore English has provided this and in this 
unity of language people began to be united they used to exchange their
 opinions they used to read newspapers which were coming in English
and therefore the people like uh uh Srinivasa Iyengar who has written
about the development of Indian English through his book Indian Writing
in English
It is a good thing the English have done to this country 
During the last two hundred years the language was 
developing in different ways 
English is not spoken uniformly by all the Indians 
As a matter of fact English is not spoken uniformly even
in England 
Only R P is spoken only South of London 
There are other dialects like uh uh Scottish dialect or Welsh
dialect or other dialects which are not standard dialects of English 
Like that in India also uh the English is influenced by 
Indian languages 
Every Indian who speaks English is influenced is by by
his mother tongue 
And there is a Telugu English there is a Tamilian English 
there is a Punjabi English there is a Hindi English like that various
dialects are there 
For these things we had to bring out a standard a standard to
understand each other and a standard which can be useful to have a
 to systemize the this International language 
English is essential today in the modern world because
English is spoken by the largest number of people in the world 
English is spoken in America English is spoken in Australia
 New Zealand Canada and many other countries 
I think nearly one third of the uh people of the world they
are speaking in English
English is adopted by even other countries who are 
 do not speak English because of its uh business 
purposes and transport purposes and many other purposes 
Therefore English is essential today to the country
Probably the old classic classical and uh English is
spoken in the colonies as pointed by Rushdie in a better way than
his own mother country 
So English is International nobody can say that English is not
wanted today 
English is required for anybody to become international in
communication 
They therefore English is going to live in India even 
uh against the wishes of many other people 
And there are people in this country who're talking
that English is to be replaced by Hindi and regional languages 
Regional languages are to be studied as well as the national
language is studied and at the same time we require an international
language which will uh make us a part of the world 
Because the world is only a global village today 
India cannot survive without English or a International
language like English 
And uh it is important for every country 
Therefore English will remain with us 
And English is studied even in the Central Institute of
English and Foreign Languages which has come into existence in nineteen
fifty-eight 
This Institute was established when the Government of India 
in the education department and by the British council as well as the
Ford Foundation 
And it was established with a specific purpose to improve
 the language content of the En English 
 
And English literature is taught by all universities in
their department of English literature 
But language was not studied 
There is a controversy whether English language is to be
learnt through literature or literature is to be learnt through 
English language 
Both are important they are the two co uh sides of the
same coin 
And one can learn good English and by that he can learn
good literature 
Or if one is a constant reader of literature one may acquire
 unconsciously good English 
But English has many other aspects 
It has its spoken aspect 
One should be conscious of the pronunciation 
And if a Indian goes and talks in United States of
India United States of America one may not understand
what he is speaking because his English contains wrong stresses 
and wrong tone probably people will not understand him 
Therefore it is essential to standardize what we speak 
And the Institute of Central Institute of English and
Foreign Languages makes a good effort it at it
It has a language lab it has various other facilities 
through which it wants to improve the standard of of English 
spoken by every segment of the people of India 
Therefore number of people after their M A or
postgraduation in English language or education or some other subject 
they come to the Central Institute of English for studying English
language 
We have different courses here and uh we have E L T 
methodology 
We have a language laboratory and the department of spoken
English and uh phonetics
We have other departments also 
These departments during a course of one year they give a
systematic training in studying English language 
And uh this is helpful for most of the teachers who come here
 to learn English because when they go back they can teach better
English to their students 
It will have a percolative effect because these teachers who
are trained they can teach better when they go back to the schools or
colleges 
And the students are to be taught young because their
pronunciation if it is influenced by a trained teacher in English at the
Central Institute of English he will be a better speaker and an effective
speaker 
Communication with proper pronunciation is important to
understand each other 
Therefore English spoken English particularly is important
 at the regional level at the national level as well as international
level 
And English is given the importance in our education system 
As a matter of fact most of the publications in India are
in English uh every year we're publishing nearly eighteen
thousand books in India 
Out of eighteen thousand nearly eight thousand to nine thousand
books are in English and whereas the remaining are published in the
regional languages or uh vernacular languages of India 
So the publication not only in the case of books even in
the case of newspaper most of the important newspapers are in English 
Newpapers like Times of India The Hindu
 and uh they are very effective communication media most of
 the circulation of these two papers are very large 
People throughout India they read these newspapers and uh 
the English is the lingua franca today in India effective connector
between various states who speaks various languages 
Therefore English is uh unlikely to go from this country
 and English will remain for a long time to come 
Uhm so the the English has uh uh in English is 
part of the national life and uh throughout education the
students in the schools and colleges they read it
But mostly the English is an effective medium only from the
college level after school leaving 
Therefore the English if it is introduced even at uh
 at class three year class four that will be more effective and
uh a bilingual child or a multilingual child is more intelligent 
and the language can be learnt only at the in 
childhood 
And instead of forcing English at a later stage of life 
which will be difficult and as a child will pick up a 
languages easier and quicker 
Therefore English would be introduced at a uh the school
level rather than at uh college level 
And uh English is also important to get jobs and people
with more education they want to go outside their country 
If India like I India which has
 large population if it wants to export its educated people 
 to other countr to other countries like
Singapore or Saudi Arabia or U S A English is essential 
Even in the case of the professional uh educated people like
engineers or doctors if they want to go abroad they require English
language 
And uh without English one at one cannot go outside
India
And even if he goes outside he will find number of
difficulties 
And uh professionally also if one wants to be up-to- date 
he should know and he should read English books books which are
coming in English 
And most of the uh knowledge which is created throughout
 the world somehow or other by translation or by uh
recreation it is coming into English language books which are published on
large scale in England America Australia Hongkong and other
places
Therefore through the English language books only you
come to know what is happening outside our own country
And uh they through them the research is developed 
Research is one of the important activity for any country 
because without research it is you cannot uh develop
And uh the development for the development of a country you
require information latest technology latest knowledge 
Knowledge is a resource today 
Now without knowledge you cannot have anything 
It can be other resources 
You can have a resource of one word you can have a 
coal resources you can have petroleum resources 
But knowledge resource is very important knowledge is power
Uh even you take a small country like Japan which is only
as big as an Andhra Pradesh but it is today on the top of the
world
It is because of the technology which they learn through English
language 
And even England which is not bigger than one state of our
country and England ruled the world for a long time and there was
a saying that sun sun never set on the British Empire 
How did uh the small countries small isles like British
Isles could rule such a vast world ?
It is because of the latest innovations that have taken place 
in their country and these are essential if you have come to know about
 the developments in science it has it was only possible by reading
 English language books 
We have come to know about Newton's theory of gravity and
even Einstein's theory of relativity
All these things helped us helped our science 
And particularly in science and technology most of the books are
in English and they are not in vernacular languages 
The defect is the international terminology is in English 
and it is a standardised terminology it is not possible to have the
translations of the same terminology in our vernacular languages 
the our languages have haven't developed that much
