 spoken Indian English
""
""
English was  from the time of
the East India Company 
""
East India Company which came to India  in seventeenth century
 coastal areas of Andhra Pradesh to begin
it 
""
And then  with the establishment of East India Company at Madras
Calcutta and Bombay 
""
And during seventeenth  in eighteenth
that is  by
the 
""
It was introduced in the schools which was started  by the East
India Company 
""
People have been studying  years
 after the establishment
of the three universities  at the provincial cities of Madras Bombay and
Calcutta 
""
English is  as well as for
literature 
""
English has influenced the Indians and very much  it has given
strength and source  to fight against the British later on
""
""
Through English only  what is a
democratic system  how the government works in England and the speeches of
Burke
""
And 
influenced the Indian 
""
And English is one of the 
who started writing in Indian languages  Bankim Chandra Chatterji
 Anandmath
 English and he gave a slogan called
""
""
So English has become one of the important languages  in India
""
""
English is studied today 
universities 
""
English is the lingua franca 
""
And 
India is  difficult for most
of the Indians 
""
Because there are so many languages in India  there are nearly
seven hundred languages in India
""
There was a cultural unity  but a linguistic unity was not there
""
""
And uh 
unity of language  people began to be united they used to exchange their
 read newspapers which were coming in English
and therefore  uh Srinivasa Iyengar who has written
about the development of Indian English  through his book Indian Writing
in English
""
It is a 
""
During the last two hundred years 
developing in different ways 
""
English is not spoken uniformly 
""
As a matter of fact English is  even
in England 
""
Only R P is spoken only South of London 
""
There are other dialects like uh  uh Scottish dialect or Welsh
dialect or other dialects which are 
""
Like that in India also 
Indian languages 
""
Every Indian who speaks English is influenced  by
his mother tongue 
""
And there is a Telugu English 
there is a Punjabi English  like that various
dialects are there 
""
For these things we had to bring out a standard  a standard to
understand each other  to have a
""
""
English is  because
English is spoken by the largest 
""
English is  English is spoken in Australia
""
""
I think nearly one third of the  they
are speaking in English
""
English is adopted by even other countries 
""
purposes and 
""
Therefore  English is essential today to the country
""
Probably  English is
spoken  in a better way than
his own 
""
So English is International nobody can  say that English is not
wanted today 
""
English is  required for anybody to become international in
communication 
""
They 
uh against the wishes of many other people 
""
And there are people in this country  talking
that English is to be replaced by 
""
Regional languages are to be studied  as well as the national
language is studied  and at the same time we require an international
language 
""
Because the world is only a global village today 
""
India cannot survive without English  or a International
language like English 
""
And uh 
""
Therefore 
""
And English is  studied even in the Central Institute of
English and Foreign Languages  which has come into existence in nineteen
fifty-eight 
""
This Institute was established 
in the education department  and by the British council as well as the
Ford Foundation 
""
And it was  to improve
""
""
""
And  by all universities in
their department of English literature 
""
But language was not studied 
""
There is a controversy whether  to be
learnt through literature 
English language 
""
Both are important  uh sides of the
same coin 
""
And one can  good English and by that he can learn
good literature 
""
Or if one is a constant reader of  literature one may acquire
""
""
But English has many other aspects 
""
It has its spoken aspect 
""
One should be conscious of the 
""
And if a Indian goes and talks in  United States of
India  one may not understand
what he is speaking because 
and wrong tone 
""
Therefore it is essential to standardize 
""
And the  Central Institute of English and
Foreign Languages  at it
""
It has a language lab 
through which it wants to improve 
spoken by every segment of the people of India 
""
Therefore number of people  or
postgraduation in English language or education or some other subject 
they come to the Central Institute of English  English
language 
""
We have different courses here and uh 
methodology 
""
We have a language laboratory  and the department of spoken
English  phonetics
""
We have other departments also 
""
These departments  they give a
systematic training 
""
And uh  this is helpful for most of the teachers who come here
 they can teach better
English to their students 
""
It will have a percolative effect  because these teachers who
are trained  when they go back to the schools or
colleges 
""
And the students are to be taught young  because their
pronunciation  if it is influenced by a trained teacher in English at the
Central Institute of English  he will be a better speaker and an effective
speaker 
""
Communication  to
understand each other 
""
Therefore English  important
 at the national level as well as international
level 
""
And 
""
As a matter of fact  are
in  publishing nearly eighteen
thousand books in India 
""
Out of eighteen thousand nearly  eight thousand to nine thousand
books are in English  are published in the
regional languages or uh 
""
So the publication  even in
the case of newspaper 
""
Newpapers like  The Hindu
 most of
""
""
People throughout India they read these newspapers 
the English is the lingua franca today in India effective  connector
between various states 
""
Therefore English  unlikely to go from this country
""
""
Uhm 
part of the  the
students in the schools and colleges they read it
""
But  only from the
college level 
""
Therefore  at uh
 and
uh 
and the language can be learnt only 
childhood 
""
And instead of forcing English 
which will be difficult 
languages easier 
""
Therefore English would be introduced  the school
level 
""
And uh  and people
with more 
""
If India like  which has
""
 like
Singapore 
""
Even in the case of the professional  uh educated people like
engineers  they require English
language 
""
And uh  outside
India
""
And even  he goes outside he will find number of
difficulties 
""
And uh 
he should know  books which are
coming in English 
""
And  knowledge which is created throughout
 uh
recreation it is coming into English language books which are published on
large scale in England  Hongkong and other
places
""
Therefore  you
come to know what is happening  our own country
""
And uh 
""
Research is one of the important activity for any country 
because  develop
""
And uh  the development for the development of a country you
require information 
""
Knowledge is a resource today 
""
Now without knowledge you cannot have anything 
""
It can be other resources 
""
You can have a resource of 
coal resources 
""
But knowledge resource is very important  knowledge is power
""
Uh  which is only
as big as an Andhra Pradesh  top of the
world
""
It is because of the technology which they learn through English
language 
""
And even England  one state of our
country  and there was
a saying that sun 
""
How did uh  British
Isles could rule such a vast world  ?
""
It is because of the latest innovations that have taken place 
in their country and these are essential  if you have come to know about
 it was only possible by reading
""
""
We have come to know about  theory of gravity and
even  theory of relativity
""
All these things helped us 
""
And particularly in science and technology most of the books are
in English 
""
The defect is 
and it is a standardised terminology  it is not possible to have the
translations of the same terminology 
the
